      "Despite the vast sums spent improving Manchester United's attack in the summer, the club are being touted for another major signing who can help the goal drought. That's after former England playmaker Chris Waddle backed the Red Devils to recruit Bournemouth winger Antoine Semenyo.",
      "The Ghana international will cost a pretty penny, however, having carried on his form with a superb start to the new season. And the same could be said for Crystal Palace sensation Adam Wharton after enjoying his own fruitful campaign to date.",
      "Only Erling Haaland (10) has racked up more direct goal involvements than Semenyo (nine) so far this season. So it's little wonder the winger is attracting interest from some Premier League powerhouses.",
      "Bournemouth feel their player, who signed a new five-year contract in July, is worth upwards of £75million. However, Chris Waddle believes the Red Devils would be making a smart investment by targeting the 25-year-old.",
      "\"Antoine Semenyo, the winger at Bournemouth, is definitely the best [in the Premier League] right now,\" Waddle told BestBettingSites. \"Semenyo is good at scoring goals, he’s positive, and he gets good goals. When he gets the ball he drives at players.",
      "\"I think Bournemouth will struggle to hold onto him. He’s really talented, and the best winger in the country right now.\"",
      "Much has been made of United not boasting the same appeal to players as they once did. The club aren't featuring in European competitions this season, which will inevitably be an obstacle to certain players wanting to head to Old Trafford.",
      "However, Waddle is assured the Red Devils will be back to their best at some point in the future. And he believes the allure is still sufficient to land a player of Semenyo's quality.",
      "\"People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still,\" he added. \"If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them. He could play alongside Matheus Cunha, and then he and Benjamin Sesko could spark into life.\"",
      "Those comments don't account for another signing, Bryan Mbeumo, who didn't come cheap given United paid an initial £65m. And adding more new talent to the attack becomes complicated given the sums already spent upgrading this past summer.",
      "It seems only a matter of time before Wharton becomes the latest star at Crystal Palace to complete a big-money move elsewhere. And Eagles chairman Steve Parish has suggested United will be at a disadvantage as long as they're without Champions League football.",
      "Wharton, 21, is reportedly poised to become the subject of a £60m offer from the Red Devils. However, Parish clarified the player's intentions to feature among Europe's finest and there's no guarantee of Champions League participation in United's future.",
      "\"I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club,\" he told talkSPORT. \"He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace.",
      "\"He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had that a lot of young players get. I think this season he's completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us, and making sure that he can show that Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday.",
      "\"It's a difficult programme for us right now. I think he's very committed to the club. I don't know where all this stuff comes from.\"",
      "The Red Devils failed to qualify for any form of continental competition this term after a record-low 15th-place league finish last season.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side moved up to 10th after winning their last three home games but they're still waiting on a first away victory of the campaign.",
      "Wharton, who has watched the likes of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze leave Palace for huge teams in the last 18 months, now stands clear as arguably Palace's most valuable asset. The Eagles are involved in Europe themselves this season as they compete for the Europa Conference League but United could one day fulfil even loftier aspirations.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is keeping himself in tip-top shape during the October international break, despite struggling to secure a spot in Ruben Amorim's plans at Old Trafford. The Stockport-born youngster has found it tough to compete with Bruno Fernandes for a starting XI position, which has limited his playing time.",
      "Mainoo has been used in the advanced No.10 role, but the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have further complicated his chances of starting there. The 20-year-old's lack of game time this season prompted him to request a loan move away from United.",
      "With the World Cup looming at the end of the season, Mainoo needs regular playing time to be considered for Thomas Tuchel's England squad. However, Amorim turned down Mainoo's request, insisting he is needed as part of his team.",
      "Having not yet started a Premier League match for United this season, the issue of a transfer is likely to resurface when the January window opens. But if Mainoo is feeling frustrated at Old Trafford, he's not letting it affect his professionalism.",
      "During the October international break, Mainoo flew to Marbella to gear up for the return of the Premier League. While soaking up the Spanish sun, Mainoo has kept up his training both on the pitch and in the gym.",
      "The midfielder also shared snaps of himself working out in the gym, captioning them 'blessed'. It's a sight that will surely please Amorim as he sees Mainoo maintaining his professional attitude.",
      "Meanwhile, the midfielder is undoubtedly eager for his moment to shine sooner rather than later. United face off against Liverpool in their next Premier League match this Sunday afternoon.",
      "Speaking last month, Amorim said: \"I didn't have a conversation with him before the window closed because I didn't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having a conversation with him just to hold on to him. I did it this week.",
      "\"I believe in him a lot. He is a top player. But some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done [a complete player]. I think he can do so much better.",
      "\"For some guys [talent] is enough, but for him it is not. Maybe it's not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie and that's it.\"",

      "Manchester United winger Antony has disclosed that his fellow Brazilian Matheus Cunha pleaded with him to remain at Old Trafford before his permanent transfer to Real Betis. Antony was Erik ten Hag's headline acquisition at United but his displays failed to justify his £85m price tag.",
      "When Ten Hag was ultimately dismissed in October 2024, the Brazilian's stint in Manchester seemed to be drawing to a close. Ruben Amorim's arrival virtually confirmed his departure with the new setup at United not suitable for wingers.",
      "By January, Amorim had secured a loan deal for Antony to Real Betis and this succeeded in rejuvenating his career. The winger netted nine goals and provided five assists in Spain as he assisted his side in reaching the Conference League final.",
      "At the end of the campaign, Antony returned to Manchester and told the club that he wanted to depart. Nevertheless, Antony has disclosed that Cunha, who arrived from Wolverhampton Wanderers at the start of the summer transfer window, encouraged the Brazilian to remain.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha wanted me to play there with him, but the situation was already very difficult,\" he told AS. \"I have a lot of affection for him.\"",
      "At one point, it appeared uncertain that Antony would depart United but eventually an agreement was reached with Betis. Whilst talks progressed with the La Liga side, Antony was compelled to train separately from his colleagues at Carrington.",
      "Looking back on that situation, Antony added: \"I didn't speak much with Ruben Amorim; there wasn't much contact. His decision to allow me to train separately was a given, but I had to respect it.",
      "\"Today I'm fine. I took care of myself by training well even though I was apart.",
      "\"After three months, I played 90 minutes, and that's the result of what I was working on.\" Since his return to Spain, Antony has scored a goal and provided an assist in the same match as Real Betis drew 2-2 with Nottingham Forest in the Europa League.",

      "Barcelona are ready to let Robert Lewandowski's contract expire next summer - allowing him to leave for nothing - which has increased their desire to keep Marcus Rashford at the club.",
      "The Spanish giants are in the early phase of trying to retain their La Liga crown and have begun the season impressively, but plans are already being made for next term. It appears that has involved them making the shock decision to let their premier marksman leave.",
      "Lewandowski is now 37 and joined Barcelona from Bayern Munich in a £42.5million deal back in the summer 2022. He's been crucial to their recent success, scoring 105 times in 156 appearances, but the club's bosses will not offer him a new deal.",
      "Catalan paper Sport claim that they don't believe Lewandowski is still able to press with the required intensity and that his decline has begun. That is despite the Pole scoring four La Liga goals in just three starts so far this term.",
      "Lewandowski's wages are also thought to be an issue for the club, who have battled financial issues and penalties recently. The Pole remains a top earner and club boss Deco claimed that they would not be entertaining contract talk this early into the year.",
      "The sporting director said: \"We’re not going to talk about renewals in October. We’re taking it step by step. He’s (Lewandowski) one of the best strikers of recent years, a top-level player. He’s helped us a lot. He’s scored more than 40 goals, but we will analyse it. It’s time to talk about getting injured players back.\"",
      "The situation means that Rashford could see his dream move become permanent with the Manchester United outcast currently on loan in Spain. He's shown in moments what he can do, scoring a stunning brace as they downed Newcastle in the Champions League.",
      "Whilst Ruben Amorim remains in Manchester, which in itself is a subject for debate, Rashford appears to be frozen out. Leading lights in Barcelona have been impressed by the 27-year-old's work ethic and talent. They can make the deal permanent at the end of the season by paying an initial £25m plus £5m in add-ons.",
      "Rashford has come into Hansi Flick's attack which already included Raphinha and Lamine Yamal, who narrowly missed out on the Ballon d'Or recently. Dani Olmo is among their other talents with Barcelona only denied a treble last term by their Champions League semi-final defeat to Inter Milan.",

      "Zinedine Zidane has made it clear he would \"like to be the head coach of the France team one day\" as he eyes a return to the dugout with the Real Madrid job still the only management role he's had.",
      "The Frenchman is the only manager in history to win the Champions League three times in succession, doing so with Los Blancos between 2016 and 2018, and later returned for a second stint, but has been out of work since 2021.",
      "The France job will become vacant after next summer's World Cup and the Les Blues icon has made it clear that taking charge of the national team is on his radar. Didier Deschamps has already confirmed he will step down as manager after 14 years in charge.",
      "He and Zidane were part of the France side that won the 1998 World Cup. Deschamps has become one of only three men to win the World Cup as a player and a manager, having led France to success in 2018. Zidane would have the chance to become the fourth if he did take charge.",
      "He has been a guest at the Festival dello Sport in Trento over the weekend and claimed: \"I will definitely return.” Zidane went on to say: “In terms of the future, I don’t know. My feeling is that I want to be able to coach the national team in the future, even though I don’t mean right now. I would like to one day, but we’ll see.”",
      "Zizou has previously been linked with the Manchester United job, but there has never been any approach from those at Old Trafford. Instead they've gone after the likes of Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim, who now holds the post.",
      "It is understood that the two main candidates to take charge of France are Zidane and Thierry Henry - another 1998 World Cup winner. France have been regulars in the latter stages of tournaments - making the semi-finals of the last Euros and losing in the most recent World Cup final.",
      "Zidane has been linked with another former club in Juventus in the past. The Italian giants are the club where Zidane made his name on the European stage before his then world-record move to Real. They have lost their grip as Serie A's elite outfit and previously appointed the likes of Igor Tudor and Thiago Motta.",
      "The French icon remains unsure whether he will ever head to Turin as manager. \"I don't know. It hasn't happened before, I've made other choices,\" he said. \"Juve will always remain in my heart, it gave me a lot from the beginning when I went there. As for the future, I don't know.\"",

      "Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has revealed that preliminary discussions have begun with Oliver Glasner regarding a fresh contract, though he acknowledged the Austrian boss harbours ambitions to secure additional silverware following recent speculation linking him with the Manchester United position. United have been strongly connected with finding a replacement for Ruben Amorim following another difficult start to the season.",
      "The win against Sunderland before the international break eased some pressure on his position. This was accompanied midweek by Sir Jim Ratcliffe publicly declaring his desire to afford Amorim three years to demonstrate his capabilities.",
      "Nevertheless, there remains uncertainty over whether this position is permanent, particularly should United fail to qualify for European competition next term. Should Amorim face the axe, Glasner has surfaced as amongst the leading contenders for the role.",
      "The Austrian has made his mark at Selhurst Park after claiming the FA Cup last campaign and guiding Palace to a club-record 19-match undefeated streak that was only halted by Everton last weekend. Glasner's agreement with the Eagles runs until this season's conclusion and, thus far, no fresh deal has materialised.",
      "When questioned by talkSPORT regarding his manager's future, Parish disclosed that negotiations are ongoing. \"We've had some early conversations,\" Parish explained.",
      "\"We would love to keep Oliver, we're building something.\" However, Parish did concede that Glasner is a manager with high aspirations, aiming for more trophies in his career after leading Palace to their first major silverware.",
      "\"I think for Oliver it's about the conditions being right,\" Parish added. \"It's about everything being in a way that he enjoys his work and he finds the conditions favourable to achieve.",
      "\"Oliver wants to win things. He makes no secret of that, that's what he is in football for.",
      "\"So if we can align those interests then hopefully we can make something happen.\" When asked directly this week if he would be interested in taking the United job if it was offered to him, Glasner chose to dodge the question about his future.",
      "\"As I said, I try to keep it at bay, whether I'm successful or unsuccessful, partly for self-protection,\" he responded after receiving the Coach of the Year award at Austria's Sporthilfe Gala. \"A few years ago, I got into the habit of living in the here and now and enjoying it.",
      "\"It's simply better when you don't lose 19 games than when you don't win 19. Then the atmosphere at the training ground in the morning is simply better; everything is easier.",
      "\"I'm no less ambitious, no less demanding, and just as annoyed when we lose, like now. Even if it was the first defeat in six months: I'm one of the worst losers in the world, and I'm still annoyed about it today.\"",

      "With big money comes big expectations but all too often in the Premier League the most expensive players haven't delivered the ultimate prize. None of the top clubs spend record sums to get them to second or third spot.",
      "But over recent years some of the most lucrative moves have failed to take their club's to the summit of English football. Liverpool made Florian Wirtz the British-record transfer when they landed him from Bayer Leverkusen in the summer.",
      "Only weeks later and they smashed their own record with Alexander Isak joining from Newcastle for £125million. The pressure is now on for the Swede, who has been regarded as among the best strikers in the world, to ensure that Liverpool remain top of the pile.",
      "History suggests, at least in recent years, that the most expensive signings don't often deliver the title. In fact, cast your eye down the 10 most expensive transfers to an English side and you'll find just TWO men with a Premier League winner's medal - but even they struggled to hit the heights expected.",
      "They are Jack Grealish and Darwin Nunez. The ex-Aston Villa star boasts three titles to his name few would argue that he has justified his £100million fee since moving to Manchester City. Nunez left Liverpool in the summer, three years after his £85m switch from Benfica, which was more frustrating than successful.",
      "Isak is hoping to be more success than frustration. He joined a team that had looked a well oiled machine last term, but less so in the early weeks of this campaign. Already Arne Slot is having to figure out how the get the best from the Swede with much debate over how to best use him and the host of quality names in Liverpool's heavily stocked attack.",
      "Isak, but first Wirtz, exceeded the British-record transfer fee that had belonged to Enzo Fernandez. The Argentine moved from Benfica to Chelsea just months after becoming a World Cup winner. In Qatar he was named the best young player at the tournament - immediately attracting huge attention.",
      "Fernandez moved to Stamford Bridge in the January of 2023 for a then record £105m. He, so far, only has a Europa Conference League and a Club World Cup to his name. Team-mate Moises Caicedo joined only months later for £100m.",
      "At the time he penned a deal that had the potential to rise to £115m, which was a record fee. He has formed an impressive partnership with Fernandez in midfield but the two men have yet to make Chelsea title contenders.",
      "One man who has proved a huge hit is Declan Rice. He headed to Arsenal after impressing for years at West Ham with the Gunners investing £100m, rising to £105m with add-ons. The England midfielder is now regarded among the best in the league in his position.",
      "He's enjoyed some stunning moments for the north Londoners but is yet to land the title he and his team-mates crave. In his two years with Arsenal they've finished twice on both occasions, but do currently sit top of the pile at this early stage of the season.",
      "Back in 2021 Chelsea, when Roman Abramovich was the man still signing off on major deals, spent a club-record fee of £97.5m to bring Romelu Lukaku back to the club from Inter Milan. He was seen as the striker who could take Thomas Tuchel's side to the title.",
      "He scored on his debut and the early signs were ominous, but he soon tailed off, facing public criticism from his manager. The Belgian later departed for Napoli, where he's won another Serie A title, but the title in England certainly evaded him.",
      "1. Alexander Isak to Liverpool - £125m",

      "Antoine Semenyo would be an 'ideal' signing for Manchester United, according to former England international Chris Waddle. And the ex-Marseille star believes Semenyo is the best winger in the Premier League.",
      "The Bournemouth ace has enjoyed a phenomenal start to the season. The Cherries winger has bagged six goals and made three assists in his opening seven matches of the Premier League season.",
      "United, in addition to Tottenham and Liverpool, were linked with a summer move for the Ghana international. Ruben Amorim is even said to have met the star for dinner at the end of last season.",
      "The Red Devils invested heavily in their frontline over the summer. United spent £200million on adding Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Semenyo ultimately extended his Bournemouth contract early in the summer transfer window. The former Bristol City star committed himself to the Vitality Stadium until 2030.",
      "Waddle believes that the south coast club will still struggle to retain his services ,however. And the former winger believes he could form a potent combination entwined with Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "\"Antoine Semenyo, the winger at Bournemouth, is definitely the best [in the Premier League] right now,\" Waddle told BestBettingSites.",
      "\"Semenyo is good at scoring goals, he’s positive, and he gets good goals. When he gets the ball he drives at players.",
      "\"I think Bournemouth will struggle to hold onto him. He’s really talented, and the best winger in the country right now.",
      "\"People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still.",
      "\"If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them. He could play alongside Matheus Cunha, and then he and Benjamin Sesko could spark into life.",
      "\"You could see a real team developing, especially with Bruno Fernandes in behind. There’s a lot more to do, but I can see them building a team there.",
      "\"He’s the type of player that United fans would love, and it would be a great acquisition, but he won’t come cheap.\"",
      "\"This (Bournemouth) is my safe place. I felt wanted. It feels great. I want to be playing, that’s the most important thing for me. We’ve got a good group here and we’re wanting to achieve top things this year. So this is the best place to be right now.\"",

      "Crystal Palace's young midfield maestro, Adam Wharton, is rapidly becoming one of the most sought-after talents in European football. The rumour mill is buzzing with reports that Manchester United are keen on snapping up the 21-year-old starlet.",
      "While additions like Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo have bolstered the squad, Ruben Amorim's side are still struggling to gel and the heat is beginning to mount on the Portuguese gaffer.",
      "United had their eyes on Brighton and Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba during the summer transfer window but were deterred by the hefty £100m price tag slapped on him by The Seagulls.",
      "Clearly, Amorim and his team felt the need for reinforcements in the midfield. Skipper Bruno Fernandes was also rumoured to be considering a move to Saudi Arabia during the same period and at 31, it wouldn't be outlandish to think he might fancy a change in the next couple of transfer windows.",
      "Therefore, United need to start planning for the future and Wharton fits the bill perfectly. Reports suggest that United are prepared to shell out £60m for the English wonderkid, but it's highly likely that this sum will fall short of Palace's valuation.",
      "The London-based club has set a hefty £150m price tag on Wharton and with his contract not expiring until 2029, they hold the upper hand in any negotiation talks. Despite being content at Palace, the allure of joining one of England's top clubs could prove irresistible for Wharton.",
      "Having earned his first England cap and been a surprise addition to the squad that made it to the Euro 2024 final, Wharton has been absent from recent line-ups. However, he revealed that Thomas Tuchel assured him his performance was up to par and he was close to selection, but the coach wanted to maintain team consistency.",
      "\"Nothing is expected,\" Wharton stated. \"England have some top players and he's got a lot of players to choose from. No matter who he picks someone is not going to get in and there will be a fuss about it.",
      "\"I can't sit here and cry about it, this is football and I'm happy playing for Palace and getting minutes. I'll keep knocking on the door and if I'm in, I'm in and if not I'll carry on.\"",
      "As per The Daily Star, Amorim is reportedly a 'huge fan' of the young player.",
      "United may need to streamline their squad in upcoming transfer windows, which could play into their hands if they're keen on signing Wharton. Casemiro's departure from United seems imminent, but a move to Palace appears highly unlikely given his age and salary demands.",
      "The Mirror examines potential swap deals that could benefit both clubs....",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, once hailed as the next big thing, is no longer a regular on the pitch and had sought a loan move last summer for this very reason. His request was denied, so it's probable that the 20-year-old will be looking for a permanent transfer in the January window.",
      "With the World Cup looming next year, the England midfielder is keen to get more game time to secure his place in the squad. Palace would likely demand cash plus Mainoo in exchange for Wharton, whose value is currently at its peak.",
      "Another potential bargaining chip for United could be Dutch international Joshua Zirkzee. He arrived at Old Trafford amid high expectations but things haven't quite panned out for the 24-year-old.",
      "Despite being fielded as a striker on several occasions, he hasn't managed to cement his position, proving more effective in the number 10 role.",
      "AC Milan and Juventus have shown interest in Zirkzee, who joined United after an impressive stint with Bologna in Serie A. While Zirkzee doesn't fit into Wharton's deeper midfield position, his inclusion in a swap deal could give Palace additional firepower to support Mateta.",
      "As per TBR Football, Zirkzee has informed United officials of his desire to leave in the January window to secure a spot in the Netherlands' World Cup squad. A switch to The Eagles - offering regular Premier League football - might just be the smart move for Zirkzee.",
      "A swap deal involving Zirkzee and Mainoo could be a fair trade for Wharton. However, as previously noted, if only one of these players is on the table, Palace will likely demand additional cash.",

      "Roy Keane's daughter Caragh has opened up about her battle with lupus which left her bed bound for months. In 2021, Caragh, 29, was diagnosed with the chronic auto-immune disease which causes the body's immune system to attack healthy parts of the body.",
      "She visited the doctor when she was suffering from blistered skin, joint pains and hair loss. Caragh, who was a teacher by trade at the time, was so affected by the condition, she had to resign from her role a school in Manchester.",
      "However, she is firmly on the road to recovery and her business 'Superkeen,' a gut-friendly cereal brand, is also thriving. Her resilience has made her former Manchester United captain father very proud, particularly when it comes to the health struggles she has experienced.",
      "In an interview with talkSPORT, she opened up about the work she has put into the business. Caragh, while also explaining her health battles, said: \"It was around five years ago.",
      "\"I started getting these symptoms, which ranged from really painful joints to hair loss and blistered skin. I thought it was because I was stressed at the time.",
      "\"I was teaching and I was thinking, 'Oh, I'm just really tired'. I was falling asleep while I was driving and things like that.",
      "\"I was thinking, 'God, this is a bit bizarre,' but I was just thinking, 'Yeah, we'll see how we go on. It must be stress.'",
      "\"Until I just physically couldn't move and was essentially bed bound for around three months. I wasn't able to teach. I was always quite sporty and love being active, so it was a real shock when I just wasn't able to do those things anymore.",
      "\"That led me to start researching gut health and just overall wellness. I hadn't heard of lupus before being diagnosed. So it's one of those things where it was a real shock to hear that.\"",
      "Caragh is one of five children Keane had with his wife Theresa. She has three sisters - Alanna, Shannon and Leah - and one brother named Aidan.",
      "When the United skipper was in the headlines, he and Theresa did their best to keep their children out of the limelight. Now they have all grown up, the pair are doing anything they can to publicly support their children's ventures.",
      "Asking what role her famous father and mother have been playing, Caragh added: \"Me and mum go, we do all the food events. I love that part of it and chatting to people. They've been involved with every aspect of it from emotional support and checking on me.",
      "\"They're saying, 'How are you getting on?' And I love spending time with my family. So I drag them along to these food events.\"",
      "Keane also gave her some publicity by bringing some of her cereal in to the Stick to Football podcast, which he takes part in with Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher, Ian Wright, Jill Scott and other guests. After handing out the boxes, he said: \"My daughter Caragh has got a company with health stuff. I am proud, very proud.\"",

      "Adam Wharton will want to play Champions League football in the near future as he continues to excel for Crystal Palace - as their chairman Steve Parish sounds a warning to interested parties.",
      "Wharton has enjoyed a meteoric rise since he joined the Eagles for £22m in January 2024 from Blackburn Rovers. The 21-year-old has proved himself as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and is now tipped as an England regular for the next decade.",
      "He already boasts an FA Cup and the Community Shield on his CV with Palace enjoying one of the most successful periods in their history - which has seen reports claim Manchester United are considering making a £60million bid next summer for Wharton.",
      "Those at Old Trafford were looking to add a midfielder in the summer, leading to their interest in Brighton's Carlos Baleba, but failed to get a player through the door. They're now linked with Wharton as they look to revive their fortunes.",
      "But Parish has laid down the law to anyone who wants Wharton, insisting he wants to play at the top table of European football, something the Eagles may struggle to provide, but United are equally miles off being able to offer that.",
      "He told talkSPORT: “I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club. He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace.",
      "“He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had that a lot of young players get. I think this season he's completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us, and making sure that he can show that Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday. It's a difficult programme for us right now. I think he's very committed to the club. I don't know where all this stuff comes from.\"",
      "Palace have had to deal with the loss of a key player in each of the last two summers. Michael Olise left for Bayern Munich in 2024 and Eberechi Eze joined Arsenal in the summer. There is now talk of Marc Guehi leaving once his contract expires next summer.",
      "Parish though is confident that Wharton, who has more than two years left on his deal, has no desire to leave with the club in a strong position. He said: \"There's no pressure on us to do it, and I don't think there's any real pressure from the player either.”",

      "The international break has done little to quell the speculation surrounding Ruben Amorim's future at Manchester United. That's in the wake of reports suggesting club bosses have been in discussions with key players to gauge the current mood within the squad.",
      "Amorim, 40, is fast approaching his first year anniversary at Old Trafford, having taken over from Erik ten Hag in November 2024. However, after guiding the team to a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League last season, progress has been slower than many had hoped.",
      "United hit another low this season when they were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two side Grimsby Town. With Amorim's men still yet to secure their first away win of the campaign, club chiefs have turned to certain players for their take on how things are progressing.",
      "This situation echoes the circumstances that led to a marathon seven-hour meeting between Ten Hag and his former superiors this time last year. And it wasn't long after the tactician was sacked from his role.",
      "Co-owner Joel Glazer, chief executive Omar Berrada, sporting director Dan Ashworth and technical director Jason Wilcox all convened at Ratcliffe's Knightsbridge offices in London to discuss the state of the club. Board member Jean-Claude Blanc, chief operating officer Collette Roche and chief financial officer Roger Bell were also understood to have been part of the summit.",
      "Ten Hag survived just three weeks following that lengthy meeting. And it may not be long before United's top brass are forced to convene once again as issues on the pitch continue to pile up.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox are understood to be leading recent discussions between the club's hierarchy and the playing squad. Captain Bruno Fernandes is among those who have been consulted, while other opinions have also been sought.",
      "It has been suggested the conversations were casual in nature and not necessarily designed to evaluate Amorim's standing at the club as such. Nevertheless, it is not the sort of activity one would normally witness at a club where everything is functioning seamlessly.",
      "United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has repeatedly been compelled to field questions regarding the manager's future. The Ineos billionaire has defended his head coach, indicating he expects the Portuguese boss to remain at the club for the foreseeable future.",
      "\"He has not had the best of seasons,\" Ratcliffe said on the debut episode of The Business Podcast after describing Amorim as a decent bloke. \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be [on the topic of sacking Amorim].\"",
      "The remarks arrived amid growing anger from supporters about how the club is being operated. The Glazer family's stewardship of United has remained a significant source of frustration for fans, and Ratcliffe has found it difficult to shift sentiment since acquiring nearly 30% of the club and assuming control of daily operations last year.",
      "Oliver Glasner, Eddie Howe, Gareth Southgate and Diego Simeone are among the managers who have been mentioned in connection with the United position recently. Yet it seems the current boss is staying put for now.",
      "Despite overseeing 50 Premier League matches, United's boss Amorim is yet to secure back-to-back victories in the competition. The Red Devils have enjoyed a winning streak at home and beat Sunderland 2-0 just prior to the international break but their away performance continues to be a major worry.",
      "Currently positioned 10th in the league and two points shy of the top six, United face a daunting run of fixtures. Over the next month, they'll be squaring off against threats like Liverpool, Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",

      "Barca chiefs initially feared there could be something wrong with the star forward, but Rashford's representative, his brother Dwaine, convinced them that the United academy product would not mess them around, according to reports. The Spanish side now believes they have a bargain available to them.",

      "Senne Lammens has boosted the confidence of the Manchester United dressing room after just one match, according to former defender Wes Brown. At the beginning of the summer transfer window, previous first-choice goalkeeper Andre Onana was reassured that he remained part of the plans at Old Trafford.",
      "However, an injury kept him out of the pre-season tour of the USA with deputy Altay Bayindir taking on the reins. Even after recovering, Onana was still overlooked until his nightmare appearance against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "The Cameroon international was arguably at fault for both of the League Two club's goals while the penalty shootout failed to redeem him. After that appearance in North Lincolnshire, the writing was on the wall for Onana.",
      "On deadline day, Ruben Amorim chose to take a punt on Royal Antwerp 'keeper Lammens and shortly after the window closed, Onana moved to Trabzonspor for the season. While his time at United will not officially end at the culmination of this campaign, those with inside knowledge of the situation believe that Onana is as good as done at Old Trafford.",
      "Therefore, the weight of expectation now rests with Lammens. Immediately following Onana's exit, Bayindir was kept between the sticks.",
      "But, a poor display against Brentford was enough for Amorim to call upon Lammens. Despite being just 23, the Belgian managed to rise to the pressure against Sunderland.",
      "He was competent and made a couple of decent saves to ensure it was a relatively relaxed afternoon for the United fans and defence. Speaking to 10bet Casino, Brown believes that Lammens, after just one match, has already impacted the Reds' dressing room for the better.",
      "\"I think there were a couple of positive things. First of all, and maybe the most important, was Senne Lammens, the goalkeeper,\" he explained.",
      "\"He gave a very confident display, and I think that gives encouragement to the rest of the team. We had more consistency and what I mean by that is the defence was solid, and the keeper was solid.",
      "\"We were creating chances, and obviously we got two goals out of that. And you just want to see smiles on faces.",
      "\"When you're playing football, when you're scoring goals, defending well, it gives you a big smile. I think going into the next game, the confidence obviously against Liverpool will be at a good state and you have to try and take it into the game.",
      "\"But, consistency is the big thing for us at the moment. You know, one game we play well, one game we play bad and somehow we've got to change that.",
      "\"We know how well we can play in certain games, but we've not been able to take that into the next game. So the mentality, hopefully having the confidence from the Sunderland result gets the lads fired up for the Liverpool game after the international break.\"",
      "As Brown alluded to, Lammens' next test is arguably one of the biggest a United player can have - a trip to Anfield. In recent years, clashes with Liverpool have been difficult for United fans to stomach.",
      "They have only won two of their last ten against their bitter rivals. United's last victory was the 4-3 thriller in the FA Cup at Old Trafford where Amad wrote himself into the history books.",
      "Incredibly, United's last victory at Anfield came all the way back in 2016. Back then, Louis van Gaal was still in charge and Wayne Rooney scored the winner.",
      "Fortunately for Amorim, he will take confidence from their last visit to Anfield where they so nearly took all three points against the runaway leaders. But if they are to manage that next weekend, they will need Lammens to be on top form.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Thomas Zilliacus has outlined his transfer plans as he prepares to approach investors regarding a bid for Manchester United. The Finnish businessman made an offer for the club two years ago and is now drafting a revised proposal.",
      "Zilliacus and his XXI Century Capital launched a bid for United in 2023 when the Glazer family made it clear they would consider offers. He rivalled the likes of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sheikh Jassim.",
      "But this bid came too late and it was Ratcliffe's Ineos that secured a nearly 30 per cent stake in the club. New rumours suggest that United could be taken over with whispers of a bid from the UAE and \"advanced negotiations\" being reached.",
      "He said: \"I mean under Sir Jim Ratcliffe it hasn't been a roaring success. I don't think anybody could claim that. So no criticism of him. I'm sure he has done the best he can. But unfortunately, in my opinion, there have been some poor choices regarding players. The new manager, it is maybe a bit early yet to say whether he can turn the ship around.",
      "\"It's not, of course, just the manager but the squad that he has… A lot of money has been put into the club and we still haven't seen the results. I think that also reminds us of another very important thing, that this is a team.\"",
      "The Finnish former Nokia chief then elaborated on which areas of the side he would improve were he to be handed any control. He specifically played down the signing of superstars.",
      "\"I mean, football is at the end of the day a pretty simple game,\" Zilliacus continued. \"It's about scoring more goals than you let in. You need to have a good attack, you need to have a good defence and in between that you need to have a good midfield.",
      "\"I think that I would honestly look at all parts of the team, I think that while there are some very good players, there is always room for improvement. But it is not about going out and buying the biggest star that is around.",
      "\"A good example, although he's already over the hill, is Neymar. Even at his peak, I would never have brought a player like Neymar to Manchester United because that's a player who expects everybody else to play for him.",
      "\"I would build a club very much on the basis of young, strong players who already have proven that they are really good top-class, but who still have a hunger to prove themselves in order to go even further.",
      "\"That should be the backbone of the team. Then you can have a few experienced guys in the gel as well. I think it's always good to have a mix because the more mature guys, the more experienced guys, they also know how to act when things don't go well.\"",
      "While he would have passed on Neymar in his prime, Zilliacus did name one player who he thinks fits the sort of character he admires. That star is Ousmane Dembele, who once cost Barcelona £125m.",
      "\"Look at PSG. Ousmane Dembele is such a perfect example,\" he added. \"Barcelona were pretty happy to see him go. Now he's got the Ballon d'Or and he's the star player in a team where he is allowed to play the way he should. But I also think the manager has managed to get him to understand that if he wants to be a star, he has to work. And now he's doing it.\"",

      "We may be in the midst of an international break but life is never dull at Manchester United. Since under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim secured a crucial win over Sunderland to take United within six points of the Premier League summit, takeover talk has surprisingly resurfaced thanks to Saudi Arabia sports mogul Turki Al-Sheikh.",
      "The chairman of the country’s General Entertainment Authority sparked speculation with a social media post regarding a possible investment. While it is believed the Glazers could consider a full sale for £5bn, club insiders were said to be taken aback by Al-Sheikh’s declaration.",
      "The Middle East money magnet subsequently tried to clear things up with another post, which read: “My post about Manchester United’s potential sale meant one thing: the club is in an advanced negotiation phase with a new investor.",
      "“Just to clarify, I am not the investor, nor are they from my nation. I’m posting this as a fan who wishes the deal to happen, though it might not necessarily happen.”",
      "Thoughts will soon return to matters on the pitch and the not-so-small matter of a trip to Liverpool next Sunday, when Amorim will aim to secure back-to-back wins for the first time as United boss. But there is also one eye on the future, with defenders at the opposite ends of their careers in the spotlight...",
      "Harry Maguire could reject a mega-money offer from Saudi Arabia to extend his United career. The defender, whose Old Trafford contract is up at the end of the season, has been linked with Al-Ettifaq and Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr, who are prepared to offer him in the region of £500,000 a week.",
      "It’s an opportunity the 33-year-old has been seriously considering as he approaches the end of his career, given United have been cool on offering him a new deal. But the Red Devils are considering offering Maguire a final contract after all, with talks to take place over the next few weeks.",
      "Maguire is said to be mindful that a move to Saudi would damage his chances of extending his England career after the World Cup, whether under Thomas Tuchel or another manager.",
      "International breaks are always nervous times for clubs. It’s rare that the club’s contingent of internationals return unscathed.",
      "Promising defender Ayden Heaven suffered a worrying knock in the early stages of England Under-20s’ game versus Switzerland on Friday. The 19-year-old needed lengthy treatment and although he continued, he was taken off at half as a precaution.",
      "To United’s relief, England U20s boss Ben Futcher does not believe the injury is too serious. He said: “He picked something up. I don't think it is too serious but we will have to see how it settles down.”",
      "Heaven has been a regular on the bench for United this season and is expected to be involved in the Liverpool game.",

      "Manchester United are planning to launch a £60million move for Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton, with club bosses believing a bid in that region would be good enough to tempt the Eagles to sell their sought-after playmaker.",
      "The Red Devils were unable to strengthen their midfield last summer despite it being one of their priorities, but they have plans to do so ahead of next season with Ruben Amorim's preferred pairing of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes coming under scrutiny this season.",
      "Amorim has kept close tabs on Wharton's progress at Selhurst Park and has become a huge fan of the midfielder, per The Daily Star. And the Portuguese coach is said to believe the talented 21-year-old has the technical abilities to be a huge success at United.",
      "The report adds that both Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro are expected to leave Old Trafford. The former has not made a Premier League start this term and could move to Napoli on loan in January, while Casemiro is out of contract next year.",
      "Wharton is one of the most sought-after talents in the Premier League following a remarkable rise in the last two years. United's target became one of Blackburn's top stars before joining Crystal Palace from the Lancashire club for £18m in February 2024. Wharton quickly settled into the Premier League and earned a spot in Gareth Southgate's squad for the Euros that summer.",
      "And the midfield ace has earned an integral role under Oliver Glasner at Palace as they earned FA Cup success and qualified for European football. Wharton's reputation only continues to grow.",
      "United opted to spend £200m on their forward line this summer, adding Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to their squad in an attempt to solve their goalscoring woes. And now early work is being planned to tempt Palace into letting go their most promising star, after he was already linked to a move in August.",
      "The Eagles have proven willing to part ways with their top talent for the correct price. Over the summer, they sold Eberechi Eze to Arsenal in a £67.5m deal , while Michael Olise departed for Bayern Munich 12 months before.",

They took up the option in Maguire's current contract last summer, something he, ultimately, didn't have a choice in.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo will return to Manchester United training today with renewed hunger to show boss Ruben Amorim he is worthy of a first Premier League start of the season.",
      "United's players not involved on international duty were given Friday, Saturday and Sunday off, and told to report back for training to begin the build-up to the weekend trip to arch rivals Liverpool.",
      "Mainoo is among those United players not required by his country during the international break, an unthinkable scenario 16 months ago when he started England's Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain.",
      "But Mainoo's continued England exile is a measure of just how far he has fallen since scoring and starring in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City last year and starting that 2-1 defeat for the Three Lions in Berlin's Olympic Stadium seven weeks later.",
      "While some of United's players not representing their countries have taken the time off for some rest and recuperation, escaping to the sun before reporting back for duty tomorrow, Mainoo has made no secret of the fact he has been working hard on his strength and conditioning during his down time.",
      "Mainoo has been put through his paces by a fitness team at Complejo Deportivo Arroyo, Enmedio, a fitness centre and sports complex in the Spanish town of Estepona, posting to his 3.3million followers on Instagram pictures and videos of himself working out and pushing himself to the limit.",
      "The motivation for posting such content is clear – Mainoo and his camp want the world to see just how hard he is training and that he is doing everything he can to force his way into boss Ruben Amorim's plans and earn his way back into United's starting line-up.",
      "But the brutal reality for Mainoo seems to be that however many posts he uploads of himself working on his fitness, he is simply not trusted by Amorim to start a game, and with fixtures in short supply given United's failure to qualify for Europe and EFL Cup exit at League Two Grimsby, his exile is likely to continue.",
      "Against that backdrop, it will come as little surprise if Mainoo makes a fresh request to go out on loan in the January transfer window, by which time the World Cup will be just six months away, with time running out for the 20-year-old to force his way into Thomas Tuchel's squad.",
      "Tuchel's reluctance to pick Mainoo, despite the midfielder's undeniable talent, is understandable, for he cannot select players who are not playing regularly for their clubs, despite past exploits for England. Therein lies the problem for Mainoo – he has become an outcast for club and country, his career in limbo while Amorim remains in charge and refuses to trust him to start a game.",
      "The only solution to Mainoo's plight is Amorim leaving or United allowing him to leave on loan in the new year. Neither scenario seems likely, given Sir Jim Ratcliffe's recent insistence that Amorim needs time and United's previous decision to turn down Mainoo's loan request.",
      "In that sense, there seems to be no escape for Mainoo from his current predicament, a bleak situation for such a bright talent.",

      "Since Ruben Amorim arrived at Old Trafford, it has been difficult for Mainoo to insert himself into his plans. Amorim has already made it clear that the Stockport-born midfielder is in direct competition with Bruno Fernandes for a place in his starting XI which has hindered his minutes.",
      "Mainoo has played in the more advanced No.10 role but since the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, the 20-year-old has struggled to find a place their too. A lack of minutes this season led to the midfielder requesting a loan move away from Old Trafford.",
      "With the World Cup on the horizon at the end of the season, Mainoo needs to be playing to stand a chance of making Thomas Tuchel's squad. However, Amorim rejected the request from Mainoo, insisting that he needs him to stay as part of his squad.",
      "Despite this, Mainoo has still yet to start a match for United in the Premier League and the topic of a transfer move is bound to return when the January window opens. But if the midfielder is frustrated at Old Trafford, he has ensured his professional standards remain.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "During the October international break, Mainoo jetted off to Marbella to prepare for the Premier League's return. Whilst in the heat of Spain, Mainoo has continued to train on the pitch and in the gym.",
      "The midfielder also posted pictures of himself in the gym with the caption 'blessed'. From Amorim's perspective, it will be pleasing to see Mainoo sticking to his professionalism.",
      "As for the midfielder, he will be hoping that his time does come sooner, rather than later. United return to Premier League action on Sunday afternoon when they visit Liverpool.",

      "We're here to bring you all the latest Manchester United news, reaction, and opinion following Turki Al-Sheikh's claims that a businessman is in an 'advanced stage' of purchasing the club. The Saudi Arabian billionaire clarified his comments on Thursday evening, but the rumour mill continues to churn.",
      "There's also talk of interest from the UAE, according to reports, while Sheikh Jassim, who narrowly missed out on buying United not too long ago, could be back in the game. The Qatari banker had his sights set on a full takeover of the club, but the Glazers sold a minority share to Sir Jim Ratcliffe instead.",
      "In other news, Kobbie Mainoo continues to be heavily linked with a move away from United. The 20 year old midfielder pushed for a transfer from Old Trafford in the summer, seeking more game time ahead of next year's World Cup, but his request was blocked.",
      "Manchester United have been told that Rasmus Hojlund is seen as one of Serie A's finest strikers.",
      "The 22-year-old forward made the move to Italian champions Italy on a season-long loan this summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by Reds boss Ruben Amorim. Despite his initial desire to stay at Old Trafford and fight for his place, even with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, it appears his decision to leave has paid off.",
      "Hojlund only found the back of the net four times in the Premier League for United last season, contributing to the club's disappointing 15th-place finish in the English top flight. However, in just six appearances across Serie A and the Champions League, Hojlund has already matched that goal tally under Napoli manager Antonio Conte.",
      "Read more here",
      "Senne Lammens had a bit of a shaky start on his first day at the Carrington Training Complex. The 23-year-old goalkeeper has already made a significant impact at Manchester United following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp, despite an initial hiccup.",
      "As reported by GiveMeSport, some members of the dressing room were 'strongly advocating' for the Old Trafford higher-ups to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa. The 33-year-old goalkeeper was heavily rumoured to be moving throughout the summer after what appeared to be an emotional goodbye on the last day of the previous season.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United news.",
      "It may be the international break but there's been plenty to talk about at Old Trafford over the past week or so. The takeover rumour mill has been in overdrive although claims from Turki Al-Sheikh have since been clarified.",
      "And the Reds are less than a week away from returning to action where they travel to rivals Liverpool on Sunday.",
      "Stick with us throughtout the day for all the latest.",
      "Thank you for joining us on the United blog today.",
      "We will be back here tomorrow bringing you more of the latest news from Old Trafford.",
      "Until then, good night!",
      "Speaking to United In Focus, journalist Graeme Bailey has claimed that United have U-turned on Fernandes.",
      "Last summer, the club did not want to sell the midfielder.",
      "However, it is believed that the Reds' stance has now altered and talks have been held with Saudi Pro League clubs over a price.",
      "Bailey added that Fernandes is determined to decide his own future and not be forced out by those higher up.",
      "According to our colleagues at the Daily Mirror, Harry Maguire is ready to reject a whopping £500,000 per week contract offer from the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The centre-back is out of contract at the end of this season but negotiations are underway to extend his stay in Manchester.",
      "Should United offer him a new deal, Maguire is believed to be keen to stay and would reject the Saudi millions.",
      "Speaking in a recent interview with AS, Antony has insisted that a new signing at Old Trafford urged him to stay at the club.",
      "Explaining the situation, the winger said:",
      "Matheus Cunha wanted me to play there with him, but the situation was already very difficult. I have a lot of affection for him.",
      "Well, it is hard to argue with the fact that Zidane is one of the best head coaches in world football.",
      "His stock has only risen since being out of work and his next job will be chosen carefully.",
      "Whether he would choose United if offered the opportunity remains to be seen, but if Amorim was to ever leave United and Zidane was offered the job, I doubt there would be many, if any, Reds complaining.",
      "One name that seemingly always comes up when the United job is mentioned is Zinedine Zidane.",
      "As quoted by One Football, Zidane does not mention United as one of the priority jobs that he would like to take.",
      "For sure I’m returning to work as head coach, it’s my plan. My desire is to become France head coach one day. Let’s see. Me at Juventus? I don’t know why it didn’t happen. I always keep that team in my heart because it gave me a lot.",
      "According to The Independent, United will be needing to splash £70m if they are to convince Bournemouth to sell their talisman in the January transfer window or beyond.",
      "Unfortunately for the Reds, they are not the team in pole position to sign the forward.",
      "It is believed that Spurs are leading the way as they look to splash the cash to cement their place at the top end of the table.",
      "Speaking to BestBettingSites, via The Mirror, Chris Waddle has insisted that Bournemouth's talisman Antoine Semenyo would be perfect for United.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is definitely the best [in the Premier League] right now. Semenyo is good at scoring goals, he’s positive, and he gets good goals. When he gets the ball he drives at players. I think Bournemouth will struggle to hold onto him. He’s really talented, and the best winger in the country right now. People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still. If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them. He could play alongside Matheus Cunha, and then he and Benjamin Sesko could spark into life.",
      "While the Reds are keen on Wharton, there is a scenario where his current manager, Oliver Glasner, could join him at Old Trafford.",
      "Glasner has been linked with replacing Amorim should United choose to sack the Portuguese head coach.",
      "Currently, Ratcliffe is keen to stick with Amorim but could be tempted to U-turn if performances and results don't improve.",
      "Glasner is due to be a free agent at the end of this season but Parish has confirmed that talks have been held with the Austrian regarding a new contract.",
      "When asked directly about United's interest in Wharton, Parish was not shocked by that development.",
      "He continued on talkSPORT:",
      "If Manchester United want Adam Wharton, there's nothing surprising really about that. The fact of the matter is he's got a long contract to run. There's no pressure on us to do it, and I don't think there's any real pressure from the player either.",
      "That's according to Palace chairman Steve Parish who sat down with talkSPORT earlier.",
      "Speaking to journalists Henry Winter and Sean Custis, Parish was asked about the future of his talented midfielder.",
      "I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club. He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace.",
      "According to our colleagues at the Sunday Mirror, United are planning a £60m move for Wharton in the summer transfer window.",
      "It is believed by United that an offer in that region will be enough to tempt Wharton to the Reds.",
      "The 21-year-old's current deal at Selhurst Park is due to expire in 2029.",
      "Hello and welcome back to the United blog this Sunday afternoon.",
      "We are just a week away from United returning to action in the Premier League when they visit Liverpool.",
      "The clash will see two teams face each other who are both interested in the man below...",
      "Dylan James believes United could offer Crystal Palace a couple of player in exchange for Adam Wharton.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, a man once tipped to be the next best thing, does not get much game time anymore and requested a loan move during the summer for that exact reason. His loan request was blocked, so it's likely the 20-year-old will want to leave on a permanent transfer during the January window.",
      "Another player that United could offer up is Netherlands international Joshua Zirkzee. Although he doesn't match Wharton's more deep-lying position in midfield, the swap offer could provide Palace with extra firepower behind Mateta.",
      "United will have to qualify for the Champions League just to stand a chance of signing Adam Wharton. Speaking on talkSPORT, Steve Parish revealed the midfielder's desire to play on the European stage.",
      "\"I think Adam at some point will want to play either in the Champions League with us, if we can make that happen, or probably with another club,\" said the Crystal Palace chairman.",
      "\"He's an extraordinary talent. I think right now, and I can't speak for Adam, but I think he's focused on his time at Crystal Palace. He had a broken season last season with the groin issues that he had that a lot of young players get.",
      "\"I think this season he's completely focused on putting the games in, getting in the England squad, being a regular for us, and making sure that he can show that Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Sunday.",
      "\"It's a difficult programme for us right now. I think he's very committed to the club. I don't know where all this stuff comes from...\"",
      "According to The Sun, United will not consider Thomas Tuchel as an option if they sack Ruben Amorim. The report claims that the former Chelsea boss met with Sir Jim Ratcliffe shortly before the Reds axed Erik ten Hag.",
      "Tuchel was heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford, but he took the England job and United opted for Amorim.",
      "According to Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport, Roma have identified Joshua Zirkzee as a 'top target'. The report claims the Serie A outfit are also keen on Folarin Balogun at Monaco and Lucas Stassin at Saint-Etienne.",
      "According to the Mirror, Al-Nassr are prepared to offer Harry Maguire a contract in the region of £500,000-a-week. The Manchester United defender has recently entered the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, making him available on a free in the summer.",
      "The report claims Maguire could reject the proposal in favour of an extension at United. It's said that the 33-year-old has been 'seriously considering' the opportunity to play in the Middle East, given he's approaching the end of his career.",
      "The Mirror reckons that United are weighing up an offer of their own, with talks set to take place over the coming weeks. Maguire is reportedly aware that a move to Saudi could hamper his chance of extending his England career beyond the World Cup.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has explained just how close United were to signing Viktor Gyokeres ahead of Arsenal in the summer.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, the journalist said: \"At some point Sporting were insisting and pushing to offer Gyokeres to Man United and to get the deal done for less money from Man United than Arsenal in terms of fixed fee, but with better bonuses.",
      "\"United were ready to make the deal. For United it was okay, but the problem was always the player. Gyokeres, with all respect for Man United, wanted to go to Arsenal and made this desire very clear.",
      "“So Gyokeres didn’t want to move to Man Utd and Gyokeres’ dream was Arsenal. But Sporting were pushing like crazy. But Gyokeres decided to wait, to resist, to be patient and then to join Arsenal as he wanted to do...\"",
      "According to the Daily Star, Ruben Amorim is a 'huge fan' of Adam Wharton, and he's told United officials to secure his signature. The 21-year-old midfielder has been heavily linked with a few teams following his impressive performances for Crystal Palace.",
      "The report claims United believe a bid in the region of £60m would be enough to strike a deal with the Eagles, despite having previously priced Wharton at £100m.",
      "According to TBR Football, Joshua Zirkzee has told United officials that he wants to leave in January to secure a place in the Netherlands squad at the World Cup. The report claims that the club are aware of the Dutchman's situation, and a move will be arranged ahead of the upcoming transfer window.",
      "Zirkzee, who United signed from Bologna for £36.5m in the summer of 2024, has struggled to force himself into the side since Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag in the dugout. The striker sees his contract at Old Trafford expire in June 2029.",
      "\"I don't think anybody could claim that. So no criticism of him. I'm sure he has done the best he can. But unfortunately, in my opinion, there have been some poor choices regarding players.",
      "\"The new manager, it is maybe a bit early yet to say whether he can turn the ship around. It's not, of course, just the manager but the squad that he has…",
      "\"A lot of money has been put into the club and we still haven't seen the results. I think that also reminds us of another very important thing, that this is a team...\"",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of Portugal’s 1-0 won over the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night, Bruno Fernandes provided an update on his future. The United captain said: \"I didn't close the door on moving to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup.",
      "\"That was never in my mind. I wanted to stay at Manchester United, and the club wanted me to stay. That's all there is to it.\"",
      "Fernandes added: \"I like to enjoy the moment, and the most important thing for me now is representing the national team, because it's a source of enormous pride to be able to play tomorrow [Saturday], and I still don't know if I'll play, let alone if I'll leave Manchester United in a year.",
      "\"I'm happy where I am. Otherwise, I wouldn't have stayed, but it's something that doesn't affect me...\"",
      "According to the Mirror, Marcus Rashford has set his heart on joining Barcelona despite interest from other clubs. The report claims that the Spanish champions have the option to sign the United loanee permanently for £26m in the summer.",
      "It's said that Rashford is focused on playing well enough to secure a transfer to the Camp Nou, as it was his dream to play for the Catalan outfit when he left Old Trafford.",
      "Thomas Zilliacus has outlined his transfer plans as he prepares to approach investors ahead of a potential bid for Manchester United.",
      "\"That should be the backbone of the team. Then you can have a few experienced guys in the gel as well. I think it's always good to have a mix because the more mature guys, the more experienced guys, they also know how to act when things don't go well.\"",
      "Zilliacus added: \"Look at PSG. Ousmane Dembele is such a perfect example. Barcelona were pretty happy to see him go. Now he's got the Ballon d'Or and he's the star player in a team where he is allowed to play the way he should.",
      "\"But I also think the manager has managed to get him to understand that if he wants to be a star, he has to work. And now he's doing it...\"",
      "After the international break, the Reds will lock horns with Liverpool at Anfield. While the reigning Premier League may fancy their chances, United have recently shown signs of promise...",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has taken to social media to send a message amid transfer speculation over his future.",
      "His lack of game time at United has seen him left out of the England squad for the international break. But the midfielder continues to work hard.",
      "He has shared pictures of him in the gym and on the training pitch, along with a caption reading: \"Blessed\""

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "On the face of it, Bruno Fernandes could hardly have been more positive when asked about playing in midfield for Manchester United.",
      "\"I love playing football, whatever the position,” said Fernandes, ahead of Portugal's 1-0 World Cup qualifier win over Republic of Ireland. “They can put me at full-back, winger, goalkeeper. I’ll always give my best.”",
      "But it was the follow-up remark from Fernandes that was most telling, suggesting the 31-year-old playmaker was far from happy at playing in a deeper-lying role on the insistence of boss Ruben Amorim.“Everyone has their preferences,” said United captain Fernandes. “But we have to adapt to the coach’s ideas.”",
      "The clear inference from that comment is that Fernandes would rather play in a more advanced role, where he has been most effective for United and can provide a greater attacking threat and influence.",
      "Fernandes and his camp are known to have taken umbrage at recent reports stating he is not happy with the role in which Amorim continues to deploy him and is desperate to play further up the pitch, with more freedom.",
      "What is undeniable is that being selected in midfield does not play to the attacking strengths of Fernandes. He is arguably United's most creative player and the one with the biggest goal threat, but those weapons are being nullified by where he is currently being played.",
      "In midfield, Fernandes is forced to think defensively as well as offensively, something that does not come naturally to him. It is a different mindset, focusing on thwarting opponents when you don't have the ball, rather than what you can do with it at your feet, which is where Fernandes excels.",
      "In his new role, Fernandes' objective is frequently not to unlock the opposition but to keep them under lock and key. That is likely to be the case when United return to Premier League action at arch rivals Liverpool on Sunday, where Fernandes will be tasked with being more of a spoiler than a match-winner, given how the game is likely to unfold, with the hosts enjoying greater possession, forcing Amorim's side into a policy of containment.",
      "That is not to say Fernandes is completely ill-suited to playing more centrally. His intrinsic work ethic and willingness to cover so much ground, as evidenced by some key challenges in the dying embers of United's hard-fought 2-1 win over Chelsea, is a key skill set for a midfielder.",
      "But Amorim's insistence on sticking with his contentious 3-4-2-1 system, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Amad or Mason Mount playing as the two behind Benjamin Sesko, means Fernandes has had to accept he is now a midfielder and will play there as long as his compatriot remains in charge.",
      "Publicly, players will rarely complain about the position they are asked to occupy and the role they are required to fulfil. Privately, though, Fernandes surely yearns for the days under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag, when he was able to maraud around the pitch, showcasing his prodigious attacking talent, without having to do any of the dirty work.",

      "United have been heavily linked with replacing Ruben Amorim after another tough start to the season. The victory over Sunderland prior to the international break relieved some of the pressure from his shoulders.",

      "\"We've had some early conversations,\" Parish explained. \"We would love to keep Oliver, we're building something.\"",
      "However, Parish did also admit that Glasner is an ambitious manager, and is targeting further silverware in his career having taken Palace to the first major trophy in their history.",
      "\"I think for Oliver it's about the conditions being right,\" Parish added. \"It's about everything being in a way that he enjoys his work and he finds the conditions favourable to achieve.",
      "\"Oliver wants to win things. He makes no secret of that, that's what he is in football for.",
      "\"So if we can align those interests then hopefully we can make something happen.\" Glasner himself was asked directly this week if he would be interested in taking the United job if it was offered to him.",
      "Glasner chose to sidestep the questions about his future last week. \"As I said, I try to keep it at bay, whether I'm successful or unsuccessful, partly for self-protection,\" he replied after picking up the Coach of the Year award at Austria's Sporthilfe Gala.",
      "\"A few years ago, I got into the habit of living in the here and now and enjoying it. It's simply better when you don't lose 19 games than when you don't win 19.",
      "\"Then the atmosphere at the training ground in the morning is simply better; everything is easier. I'm no less ambitious, no less demanding, and just as annoyed when we lose, like now.",
      "\"Even if it was the first defeat in six months: I'm one of the worst losers in the world, and I'm still annoyed about it today.\"",

      "Manchester United resume their Premier League campaign at Anfield next week buoyed by the 2-0 victory over Sunderland last time out.",
      "It was a convincing performance from the Reds and relieved some of the pressure on under-fire boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "United are 10th in the table and will hope to find consistency to sustain a challenge for a top six spot and European football next season.",
      "To do that, they need key players to perform and two United stars have hit their straps in recent weeks, offering Amorim an added dimension, competition and attacking threat.",
      "Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko were the scorers against Sunderland and both look set to keep their places for the trip to Liverpool.",
      "Mount has suffered two injury-hit years since his arrival at Old Trafford but Amorim has remained convinced that the England international has plenty to offer if fully-fit.",
      "The 26-year-old played in one of the two number 10 roles against Sunderland and opened the scoring with a smart finish. Mount has been used in a plethora of positions already this term but that attacking midfield role is the best fit for his capabilities as he seeks to recapture his best form.",
      "Mount kept summer signing Matheus Cunha out of the side against Sunderland and having players of quality coming off the bench as game-changing options is something United have lacked in recent seasons.",
      "For Mount himself, there is a steely determination to showcase his talent this season as he seeks to help United erase the memories of a disappointing 2024-25 campaign which ended with a 15th place finish in the Premier League and a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "\"A lot of people have said a lot of stuff about us as a group, and we ball that up and we use that energy in the best way we can, and that's on the football pitch against other teams, and really competing and fighting for those three points,\" admitted Mount earlier this season.",
      "Mount was joined on the scoresheet against Sunderland by Sesko, who netted his second goal since his summer arrival.",
      "The Slovenia international is beginning to make his mark up front and if he can offer the consistent goalscoring threat that Rasmus Hojlund struggled to achieve last season, then United can reap the rewards.",
      "Hojlund has hit the ground running since departing United for Napoli but he managed just four goals for the Reds in the Premier League last season. If Amorim's men are to compete at the top end of the table, they will need a regular supply of goals from their centre forward.",
      "Sesko's early signs of fulfilling that brief are promising, and Amorim has been pleased with what he has seen from the 22-year-old.",
      "\"The thing I like most in Ben is, even when things are hard for him with the ball, he is working hard in every minute of the game,\" he said. \"That is the most important thing in the moment.\"",
      "The hard work will continue at Anfield on Sunday, Amorim will hope it yields a result.",

      "Senne Lammens has admitted Manchester United's players have “everything to succeed” and can have no excuses for failure following the overhaul of the club's training complex.",
      "United spent £50million modernising the Carrington complex, situated half-an-hour's drive from Old Trafford, turning the tired training ground into a state-of-the-art facility.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo famously called out the club's deteriorating training facilities during his ill-fated second spell at United, which led to his acrimonious exit just before the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.",
      "But Ronaldo's remarks resonated with the United hierarchy in the wake of his departure and led to the long-overdue and radical revamp of the training complex, to bring it up to standard.",
      "Against that backdrop, £18.2milion deadline day signing Lammens, who has established himself as United's first-choice goalkeeper after just one game, said the players do not want for anything.",
      "“We have everything here to succeed, to help us in our way of training and to get ready for the games,” said Lammens. “So that's not an excuse.",
      "“It's been very nice. It's also a step up from being in Antwerp. When I came here for the first time, it was really eye-opening so, yeah, it's very nice.",
      "“It's been a big change. The level in everything, in every aspect, is bigger. So it's been good and the team have welcomed me with open arms.",
      "“The first couple of weeks was a little bit getting used to everything, getting settled, but now the last week or two weeks have been about training really well and building up my life in Manchester, so it's been good.”",
      "United's new facilities at Carrington include a high altitude room with multiple exercise bikes and rowing machines, with the option to change the levels of humidity and temperature to suit the individual players.",
      "In the swimming pool area, sauna and steam rooms have been updated and increased in size, with the addition of a smaller pool with an underwater treadmill, to be used by players as part of their rehabilitation from injury.",
      "The first-team dressing-room is bigger and brighter than before, with touch-screens fitted to each player's individual space, outlining their training regime and routine for the day, while 'smart urinals' help measure if a player is dehydrated and what they need to take on to be rehydrated.",
      "United's medical facilities have also undergone a huge transformation as part of the training ground overhaul, with a newly-installed MRI, CT and full body scanner on site.",
      "As Lammens admitted, United's players now have everything off the pitch to give themselves the best chance of success on it, meaning there can be no excuses for coming up short when it comes to preparing for games.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "Ruben Amorim will have taken Sir Jim Ratcliffe's public vote of confidence in him one of two ways.",
      "The Manchester United head coach may have welcomed his boss's public endorsement of him, along with Ratcliffe's belief that Amorim needs to be judged over the length of his three-year contract.",
      "Or Amorim will have viewed the backing from Ratcliffe, like so many did, as the dreaded vote of confidence, the precursor to the inevitable sacking, having been so publicly supported by the man in charge.",
      "Either way, Amorim knows the only way for him to remain in charge of United long-term and to continue to have the backing of the club's hierarchy, is with an upturn in results.",
      "A haul of 37 points from a possible 112 is the kind of return that sees teams relegated and one Amorim knows cannot continue, even with Ratcliffe's three-year security blanket for comfort.",
      "Ratcliffe, chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox will not hesitate to pull the trigger on Amorim if results do not improve significantly with immediate effect.",
      "In the interview in which he endorsed Amorim, Ratcliffe may have referenced the clamour for Sir Alex Ferguson to be sacked after a poor start to his United reign, before the era of unprecedented success he oversaw at Old Trafford.",
      "Ferguson took four years to win his first trophy at United, the FA Cup in 1990, but time is not a luxury managers are afforded in today's game, despite Ratcliffe's insistence that Amorim needs time to prove his is, in his words, a “great coach”.",
      "There is no doubting Amorim's coaching prowess – two Primeira Liga titles with Sporting Lisbon is testimony to that – but his intransigence in terms of his system and playing philosophy may ultimately be what costs him the United job.",
      "In defending his contentious 3-4-2-1 system, Amorim is right to say United played with four at the back under his immediate predecessors and the players still struggled, so a change of system can hardly be solely responsible for their current woes and last season's 15th-placed finish, their lowest for 51 years.",
      "But while his other rival managers have shown a willingness and ability to adapt their approach and formation when things are not going well and when the opposition demands it, Amorim has chosen to dig his heels in and double down on the way he sets up United.",
      "Amorim has said on several occasions recently that if he were to change to playing four at the back, he would lose credibility and respect among his players, only to then muddy the waters by saying that he will, at some stage, change his formation, but not now.",
      "Certainly, changing to a 4-2-3-1 system would solve the problem of Kobbie Mainoo's ongoing exile, enabling him to play in a midfield two with Casemiro and liberating skipper Bruno Fernandes from the current deeper-lying role that simply does not play to his attacking strengths.",
      "But with Amorim seemingly unwilling to entertain the prospect of changing his system, he must find a way of getting the best out of the personnel within, in particular improving the delivery and threat from his wing-backs.",
      "Amad has had a slow start to the season and missed the Brentford defeat following a family bereavement, but looked better in the 2-0 win over Sunderland, while Patrick Dorgu needs to improve his final ball if he is to start regularly ahead of Diogo Dalot.",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have all made encouraging starts, while fellow new arrival, goalkeeper Senne Lammens, made an assured debut against Sunderland and has the No.1 position for now.",
      "The task facing Amorim in the next few weeks is to put together a sustained winning run. He has yet to win back-to-back league games after nearly a year in charge, and while achieving that feat at arch rivals Liverpool next Sunday – even accounting for their current wobble – is unlikely, Amorim needs a statement win and performance.",
      "Anfield would be the perfect place to do just that.",

      "JJ Gabriel enjoys video games and comes out of his shell once he gets to know someone.",
      "In many ways he is a normal 14-year-old, but his extraordinary talent is revealed when he steps onto a football pitch. There is certainly nothing normal about what Gabriel can do with a ball at his feet.",
      "That is quite the prediction considering the graduates who have come before Gabriel, who already has more than 200,000 followers on Instagram and a sponsorship deal with Nike.",
      "Academy coaches who have worked with Gabriel have marvelled at the youngster's skillset and have struggled to find weaknesses, despite playing him years above his age group.",
      "Gabriel idolises Neymar and some of his goals are reminiscent of the Brazilian at the peak of his powers. Last weekend in an Under-18 game, Gabriel glided into the penalty area, deceived a Manchester City defender with a shimmy and found the corner. The clip has amassed thousands of views on social media.",
      "Word of Gabriel's talent has already swept around the world. Europe's top clubs have closely followed his development, and the teenager was close to leaving United in the summer.",
      "Talks were advanced with a European giant and an eleventh-hour meeting was held at Carrington in an attempt to keep Gabriel. It's understood Jason Wilcox (director of football) and Omar Berrada (CEO) were present, which shows the high regard in which Gabriel is held.",
      "United reiterated that Gabriel could become the face of the club and it was eventually agreed the teenage sensation would remain in Manchester - the player's final decision was decisive.",
      "There are windows for rivals to poach academy players at 14 and 16. Gabriel has committed his future at United for another two years at least, but interest from Europe's biggest sides will only intensify as he gets older, especially as he holds a European passport through his parents.",
      "United know they have a special talent on their hands and recently introduced Gabriel to Ruben Amorim. During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Amorim played alongside Ronaldo for Portugal's national team. The United boss recounted stories about Ronaldo's work ethic - he was the first to report for training and the last to leave.",
      "Gabriel does not lack a work ethic. He is already living like a dedicated professional athlete with his diet and recovery sessions, and wakes up at 6am most days to make his dream a reality.",
      "In the summer, he trained at a Nike camp in Marbella with Newcastle midfielder Sandro Tonali and former Liverpool striker Danny Ings. When Marcus Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January, Gabriel thanked him for taking penalties with him at Carrington before he left.",
      "He also received a \"get well soon\" video from Andre Onana when he was recovering from his shoulder injury last year. Experienced players are shocked when they learn his age.",
      "Gabriel has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and was invited to watch the Premier League opener against Arsenal in the directors' box.",
      "It speaks volumes that brands are already desperate to work with Gabriel, who was subject to interest from Adidas before Nike beat off competition from the German company.",
      "Adidas were in pole position to sign Gabriel before a late effort from Nike to better their offer - how many 14-year-olds could spark a bidding war between sportswear's commercial giants?",
      "United want to temper expectations to help Gabriel focus on football. Former academy director Nick Cox was asked a question about Gabriel during an interview earlier this year and politely steered the conversation in another direction. Those questions will become common for his successor.",
      "Those who know Gabriel are not concerned about keeping him grounded. He has strong family support and a circle of friends, and those closest to him don't let him get ahead of himself. He is just JJ to them.",
      "Gabriel possesses the right mentality to enjoy a successful career. It takes him just minutes to forget about the football after leaving the pitch following an academy game at Carrington.",
      "That is a trait that many top professionals share - the ability to separate what happens on the pitch from their home lives - but Gabriel loves playing football and entertaining with the ball.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "Gabriel has been played down the middle and from the left this term, although it doesn't matter which position he plays because the end result is the same: he tears through the opposition and scores.",
      "MUTV subscriptions might begin to sell like hot cakes, just so fans can watch Gabriel play.",
      "The teenager's ball control is exceptional, and his finishing power is remarkable for a player of his age. Gabriel has seven goals in six Under-18 appearances and scored for the Under-17s on Wednesday.",
      "He was even given the nickname 'Kid Messi' after clips of him training and completing skills went viral on social media when he was younger, and Lionel Messi would probably approve of his footwork.",
      "Fans have already started to speculate when Gabriel could make his senior debut, and it already feels likely that he will become United's youngest-ever Premier League player.",
      "Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are the youngest to make a debut for United in the Premier League.",
      "Gabriel has the potential to break that record, and he could even topple the Premier League record of Ethan Nwaneri (15 years, 181 days). Max Dowman (15 years, 235 days) is the second youngest.",
      "Mikel Arteta has shown faith in Nwaneri and Dowman at Arsenal, while talented Liverpool youngster Rio Ngumoha recently scored on his senior debut aged 16 years and 361 days.",
      "Dowman and Ngumoha have blown away spectators this season, offering an exciting glimpse into the future of English football, but many believe Gabriel could be the pick of the bunch.",
      "There is a reason why Wilcox and Berrada were involved in the meeting to keep Gabriel in the summer, and why the youngster has been offered a box at the new Old Trafford.",
      "He is a generational prospect - and the best is yet to come from the supremely talented teenager.",

      "PGMO chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that Brentford defender Nathan Collins should have been sent off in their defeat on September 27.",
      "With United trailing 2-1 after an Igor Thiago brace which was pegged back by Benjamin Sesko, the Reds won a penalty after Collins tugged back Bryan Mbeumo inside the penalty area. The spot kick was rightly awarded but the punishment for Collins by referee Craig Pawson was merely a booking.",
      "Had Collins made a genuine attempt to play the ball, a booking would have sufficed in this scenario thanks to the recently introduced 'double jeopardy' rule. However, it seemed clear at the time that Collins did not make a genuine attempt and he was the last man, thus preventing Mbeumo having a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "The decision not to send off Collins would feel even more bitter when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty and Mathias Jensen scored late to win the game 3-1. According to the Daily Mail, United chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox sought clarification on the decision with Webb who admitted the mistake.",
      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",
      "What's more, the defeat caused significant pressure to mount on Ruben Amorim which may not have been the case had the match finished differently. MEN Sport understands that United are not currently considering sacking their Portuguese head coach.",
      "Despite reports stating that Gareth Southgate is among the names that Ineos are considering replacing Amorim with, there are believed to have been no contacts made with other managers regarding the currently filled position at Old Trafford. Fortunately for United, they put the defeat to Brentford behind them on Saturday with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland.",

      "The new keeper's opportunity arrived at last on Saturday, with Amorim handing him a start against Sunderland. All went according to plan for the 23-year-old, with goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko ensuring United got three points and eased the pressure on their head coach.",
      "United's win was a timely one for Amorim, with some suggestions his job could be at risk if his team lost. After the victory, he spoke highly of Lammens while also praising the team as a whole.",
      "\"We didn’t play well all the game, but we had our moments and we defended well,\" Amorim said. \"I think Senne did a great job and gave us confidence. It was a good day, not a perfect day, but to win like this with a clean sheet is important for our team.",
      "\"We need to understand that we need everyone to be ready to play. It's a long season, we have a lot of problems, anything can happen. The important thing is that the teammates helped Lammens a lot to have a very good performance.\"",
      "While Lammens will surely face trickier tests than Sunderland this season, perhaps starting with his next game, he still earned plaudits from the Belgian press.",
      "\"Against Sunderland, the scenario was perfect for Lammens,\" Sporza's verdict began. \"He was barely challenged in the first half and took no risks in possession. It was striking how he constantly connected with his backline and made adjustments.",
      "\"Sober, precise, and controlling. Old Trafford appreciated this and gave Lammens plenty of opportunities at times.\"",
      "The same publication pointed to his sharp save from a long-range Granit Xhaka effort, as well as the let-off he received when Bertrand Traore was booked for diving after it looked for a moment as though Lammens had conceded a penalty.",
      "\"If Ruben Amorim still had any doubts about who would be the first choice goalkeeper, Lammens has more than left his mark today,\" Sporza added.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Elsewhere in Belgium, HLN highlighted Amorim's praise for Lammens while pointing out the goalkeeper watched much of the first half 'from a distance'. They wrote: \"Just over a month after his arrival and after three matches on the bench, Lammens finally made his debut for Manchester United.",
      "\"The goalkeeper thus became the seventh Belgian to feature for the Red Devils. Marouane Fellaini, Romelu Lukaku, Adnan Januzaj, Ritchie De Laet, Marnick Vermijl, and Largie Ramazani preceded him.",
      "\"Lammens had to prove himself once in the first half. The former Antwerp goalkeeper made a good save on a powerful shot from Xhaka. His play on the ball at his feet and on high balls was also flawless. From a distance, our compatriot saw Manchester United dominate.\"",
      "The report added that his next assignment could be considerably trickier. \"All in all, Lammens can look back with satisfaction on his debut in the Manchester United shirt,\" it read. \"His first clean sheet is a fact. This debut will leave him wanting more. His next assignment? The top-flight match at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday, October 19th. Lammens will likely be tested more then.\"",
      "Nieuwsblad's Brian Dewulf referenced United fans' response to the impressive debut. \"Just before half-time, Senne Lammens finally got the chance to show his true colours,\" he wrote. \"Granit Xhaka had the first attempt for Sunderland, but Lammens saw the long-range shot come from far out and made a good save. There was applause in Old Trafford.",
      "\"The Belgian goalkeeper remained virtually unemployed in the second half, though it was a bit of a shock after an hour of play. Bruno Fernandes gave his keeper the runaround with a long ball, causing the pair to collide. Sunderland winger Traoré lurked and nearly capitalised, but also went down in the action.",
      "\"Ultimately, Man United were given the foul, allowing Lammens and his teammates to breathe a sigh of relief. He was applauded again in the final seconds for his second save of the evening, but Lammens was never given another opportunity.",
      "\"It was certainly a successful debut for the Belgian goalkeeper. Manchester United secured only their third Premier League victory, and the young Belgian also secured their first clean sheet of the season for the Mancunians.",
      "\"Has the train departed? During the match, the home fans were already singing loudly for the goalkeeper: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" fans wondered aloud if Lammens wasn't just the former Danish legend of Man U.\"",

      "Amorim needed this victory to ease the growing pressure on him, amid suggestions of players losing faith in his methods and United's hierarchy starting to harbour doubts about him.",

      "Memphis Depay, Alexis Sanchez, Rasmus Hojlund were all signed to be the new main man at Old Trafford and have failed to live up to the hype. Benjamin Sesko received the same adulation when he signed for United and there was fears that the Slovenian was going to struggle with the weight of expectation.",
      "In his opening five Premier League matches he drew blanks. And while some questioned whether he was receiving adequate support from his teammates, there was a fear that Sesko was going to follow the same path as those who came before him.",
      "However, his first goal for the club at Brentford has swiftly been followed by his second against Sunderland. Now, there is a feeling of momentum behind the centre-forward and genuine hope that he can deliver where so few have.",
      "And yet, Sesko's admission following the victory over the Black Cats should leave the supporters excited to see what he can do moving forward. \"No, not yet,\" he responded to MUTV when asked if we were starting to see the best of him at United.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Transfer insider Graeme Bailey has revealed that Manchester United have “held talks” over the sale of Bruno Fernandes, as “things have changed” after a summer move fell through.",
      "Fernandes has long been one of the very best players at United. In recent seasons, he’s been one of the main reasons they have stayed competitive, with others struggling around him.",
      "In the summer, after last season’s 15th-placed Premier League finish, Fernandes was offered huge money to ditch the Red Devils in order to move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "He said at the time that he did not want to leave, but if United were willing to sell, he’d part ways with them.",
      "United decided against letting him go, but it seems the chances of a move to the Saudi Pro League are more likely, per insider Bailey.",
      "He told United In Focus: “Bruno Fernandes has made it clear to Manchester United that he will not be pushed out of the club, hence his quotes about the Saudi Pro League.",
      "“Fernandes considered the Saudi Pro League last summer, but both the player and United were not keen. Since then, things have changed. Sources confirm that United have indeed held talks with the Pro League about Fernandes.",
      "“However, Fernandes – as we know – has not put the brakes on this by publicly stating his stance.",
      "“It is clear Fernandes will decide his own future.”",
      "That there have been talks between United and the Saudis for Fernandes is something of a shock. However, they know they’d make good money from the midfielder’s sale, the current regime is not using him in a way which best suits his game, and that’s seen him struggle for form – with just two goals and no assists this term.",
      "Fernandes has recently cleared the air on his reasons for staying at United, saying: “I didn’t close the door to move to Saudi Arabia because of the World Cup — that was never on my mind. I just wanted to stay at the club, and the club wanted me to stay. That’s all.”",
      "Given the suggestion that United have held talks over Fernandes’ sale, it seems they might no longer want him to stay, and as that was one of the main drivers of him remaining at the club last summer, his view might soon change.",

      "Chris Waddle has told Manchester United to sign the “best winger in the country” in an attack which would not include one of the club’s most expensive summer signings.",
      "United spent around £170million in the summer, largely on attacking talents. Of their five signings, three – Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo – play in the attack.",
      "Sesko has scored twice in the Premier League, Mbeumo once, while Cunha is yet to get off the mark.",
      "The nine goals scored by United in the league this season is fairly middling, and they are ninth in the table as a result.",
      "Waddle feels that to take the next step, though they have just signed three attackers, one more needs to come in, and he has named that man.",
      "Waddle said: “Antoine Semenyo, the winger at Bournemouth, is definitely the best [in the Premier League] right now.",
      "“Semenyo is good at scoring goals, he’s positive, and he gets good goals. When he gets the ball he drives at players.",
      "“I think Bournemouth will struggle to hold onto him. He’s really talented, and the best winger in the country right now.",
      "“People might question why someone would want to join Manchester United right now, but they will come good again, and they’re a huge club still.",
      "“If Semenyo went to United, he could play just as he is for Bournemouth and be ideal for them.",
      "“He could play alongside Matheus Cunha, and then he and Benjamin Sesko could spark into life.",
      "“You could see a real team developing, especially with Bruno Fernandes in behind. There’s a lot more to do, but I can see them building a team there.",
      "“He’s the type of player that United fans would love, and it would be a great acquisition, but he won’t come cheap.”",
      "Waddle’s suggestion that Semenyo could play in attack with Cunha and Sesko would mean there was no space for Mbeumo, and that would be a surprise given he’s had more impact than Cunha so far this term.",
      "It is conceivable that Semenyo would leave Bournemouth for United, as Cunha and Mbeumo were both at similar stature teams – Brentford finished above United last season – but still joined them.",
      "But he’ll have seen that neither is having the same impact there, and for a player with six goals and three assists in seven Premier League games this season, he won’t want to risk becoming less impactful by making a move to the wrong side.",
      "Man Utd are taking ‘formal steps’ to complete their next signing after bringing in Colombian midfielder Juan Orozco, according to Fabrizio Romano.",

      "We can only assume that Potter will therefore replace Postecoglou, Nuno’s replacement at Nottingham Forest, at the City Ground as the Aussie is the favourite to be binned next, replacing Amorim, who is probably only still in a job so United can save a few quid on his pay-off.",
      "The managerial merry-go-round has never felt more real.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "Although what does need saying here is that there is a wild divergence in opinion on Slot’s job security. He is – entirely absurdly – joint third-favourite in some places. But we’re interested in the best available prices, and on that basis he’s as safe as Mikel Arteta.",
      "But however ridiculous it may sound, there are bookmakers out there who consider Slot’s position to be less secure than anyone in the league who isn’t Ange Postecoglou or Ruben Amorim.",
      "Life comes at you fast when a mini-crisis takes hold.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",

      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that.",

      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",

      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford plus another win at Nottingham Forest have everything looking peachy. And most sides are going to be pretty happy any time they take a point from Palace this season, we reckon.",
      "Losing at Old Trafford is quite embarrassing, though.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "Victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",

      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October or November if and when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Currently benefiting twice from the Ruben Amorim situation, gleefully helping himself to a much-needed win over a man also helping to keep him and others away from the head of this market.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction, but they are firmly in the bottom three as we reach the October international break where club decision-makers do start to get antsy.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the next manager to go.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United and now Leeds.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Wolves for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Buy some alcohol for some youths?",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself.",
      "",
      "Really isn’t that long ago that Emery was listed among your Slots and your Iraolas in this market, but it’s been an alarmingly bleak start to the season for a striving club with lofty ambitions but a worrisome balance sheet.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season.",
      "What makes this particularly impressive, in a way, is that Nuno hasn’t really done that much wrong when you think about it. Not at the sort of catastrophic level that would normally be required for such an ‘achievement’",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "Definitely worth noting the oddsmakers currently consider this very much a two-horse race at current prices.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",

      "He is currently trying – and failing – to deploy it with a Forest squad far less suited than Tottenham, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability. Throw in the fact that when it did work at Spurs, it worked early on due to its shock-and-awe newness before everyone figured it all out. There has been no early benefit reaped at Forest. Actually the opposite is true.",

      "Over the summer, it was reported that United were looking to ship out Hojlund, though Zirkzee would be safe. That was despite the former wanting to stay at United.",

      "A short but wide-rangingly sweet Sunday Mailbox manages to solve all Ruben Amorim’s problems at Manchester United through the – on the face of it unlikely – prism of 1990s Liverpool, before a pondering of just why some quite big teams have produced such a low number of prolific England goalscorers.",

      "Thanks George for asking in the last mailbox. It’s been stressing me out a lot hearing how 3-5-2 doesn’t work for various reasons and Amorim and the players have no chance.",
      "I remember in the 90s when Roy Evans took over the Liverpool side and adopted a 3-5-2. Liverpool bought Mark Wright for £2.2m who was England’s centre back (Harry Maguire with pace and class). John Scales (De Ligt with fewer mistakes) and Phil Babb (Lenny Yoro) were the other centre backs.",
      "Left back was Stig Inge Bjornabye and Steve Harkness. Nothing world class but could tirelessly get up and down the whole game. Right back was Rob Jones who was superb and again could run and run. Dorgu seems like he knows what he is doing but neither Dalot or Amad are a good fit for that position which messes up the formation and attacking lines.",
      "Midfield we had John Barnes (Bruno Fernandes) but he was fat and old so he just sat at the back reading the game, intercepting, spraying lovely passes and getting a few goals. He was definitely not all over the pitch trying to do everything but falling on all counts and ruining the formation. Barnes also took a decent penalty without getting into a strop. His partner was a young Jamie Redknapp whose best achievement was marrying Louise (If you know you know). He was a decent player and put a shift in. The 2 of them screened the back 3 so we were pretty solid.",
      "Biggest difference in Utd and Liverpool was the front 3. Liverpool had Steve McManaman who was all over the pitch (where Bruno should play) and had the license to roam and create. Up front was Stanley Victor Collymore and Robbie Fowler. They got 55 goals between them one season and played as orthodox strikers. The team was built to get chances to the front 2.",
      "In my opinion (Geoff) with Cunha roaming and Mbeumo wide it only leaves Sesko in there who can be easily marshalled by the opposition defence. So the answer is simple. Bruno needs to be further forward with Cunha and Mbeumo as 2 orthodox strikers. Put De Ligt as defensive midfield with Mason Mount sitting in front of the back 3. Buy a right wing back.

      "Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes feels a meeting with Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher is a good opportunity to “settle scores” after he missed a penalty against him earlier this season.",
      "Fernandes has been one of United‘s very best players since he joined them in 2020. The attacking midfielder has been directly involved in 186 goals in 298 games for the Red Devils.",
      "He has been their designated penalty taker for most of his time there, and in the Premier League, he’s scored 23 of those spot kicks, and missed six.",

      "Fernandes will come up against Kelleher for Portugal against Ireland on Saturday, and thus his penalty record has been brought up.",
      "Fernandes said: “This season, out of three, I ended up missing two. I don’t want to miss any of them. It’s something I need to study better. I’ll always do it with full conviction because there’s a coach who trusts me.",
      "“Every day is a good day to settle scores.",
      "“He was stronger. He did very well, and I didn’t. But it’s not something that affects my head. In a football team, there’s something bigger than individuality. Winning is much more important than settling scores with the Irish goalkeeper.”",
      "Portugal have full points from their two World Cup qualification games so far, but Fernandes is yet to have a direct hand in a goal.",
      "He played 90 minutes in the 5-0 victory over Armenia and neither scored nor assisted, before he again blanked in a 66-minute outing against Hungary.",
      "In three games against Ireland in his career, he’s assisted once and not scored.",

What it represents can change at the drop of a (Bowler) hat. 30 years ago, if I’d started tying flags to lampposts showing the colours of the rainbow, most people would have assumed I was in favour of leprechauns, or Teletubbies, or Zippy and Bungle, etc. What’s that idiot doing up a ladder with that flag?

Life may be easier psychologically if you tell yourself that the flag doesn’t mean anything deep; there’s no subtext to anything; flying the UJ is just a plain statement of fact – it’s just reminding people what country they’re in.

But if you’re telling everyone that this is their flag too, their country, and their values, the answer is No. Nobody asked us to sign up to how this is being used; nobody tying flags to railings and then pissing in the street straight afterwards asked for my opinion beforehand; nobody setting hotels on fire stopped to enquire if the people – be they white, middle-aged, angry or whatever else – are alright with this.",

      "Reports of ‘revenge’ on Manchester United from Arsenal have been described as ‘inevitable’ by a journalist in the chase for ‘Kid Messi’ JJ Gabriel after a viral video of him displaying ‘silly talent.’",
      "United have produced some fantastic talents in recent years. Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho have both become quality attackers following their time at Carrington.",
      "More recently, Chido Obi seems to be turning himself into a threat up top, though he was poached from the Arsenal academy.",
      "Next in line to find his way into United’s first team could be JJ Gabriel, described as ‘Kid Messi’ due to hie exceptional dribbling and skill.",
      "So far this season, the 15-year-old forward has seven goals and one assist to his name in six under-18 Premier League games.",
      "There have been rumours that he could make the switch to Arsenal amid his top form, and Isaan Khan has written for the Daily Mail that suggestions of ‘revenge’ from the Gunners are ‘inevitable.’",
      "That’s given United signed both Obi and Ayden Heaven from the Emirates, prising away two talented youngsters in the process.",
      "Arsenal are certainly reported to be ‘aware of’ Gabriel, but reports of concrete interest are ‘premature’.",
      "Gabriel’s short-term future is committed to United until at least his 16th birthday, and the earliest he could sign his first professional contract is in the summer of 2027, before it would come into effect when he turns 17.",
      "United are said to be ‘desperate’ to keep Gabriel on their books, as they see him as a ‘future superstar’ and have reportedly offered him a box at the new Old Trafford – set to open in 2030.",
      "This right here is an elite talent, JJ Gabriel 🔥. Hopefully we’ll have a competent manager by the term he’s ready for the first team transition pic.twitter.com/QJX3EXhU20",
      "— Ryan (@Utd_BarryRyan) October 11, 2025",
      "Gabriel has displayed his exceptional talent online of late. A video has gone viral on social media of him passing a tennis ball back to himself off a wall, one touch at a time, using his left and right feet equally, before simply keeping it up by doing kick-ups.",
      "He then walked to a wall behind him, keeping the ball up still, knocked the ball against it a couple of times, before walking back to the first wall, ball still in the air, and started kicking it harder back to himself from about six feet away.",
      "Many social media accounts were in awe of the video, with football content creator Tom Garratt labelling it ‘silly talent’ as a mark of respect for the tough feat."

      "“Next it was the people buying the players, so everyone wanted rid of them. Then it was the board, so the board was shuffled around when Sir Jim Ratcliffe got involved.",
      "“Then it’s the fault of the facilities so they wanted to revamp the training ground and put plans in for a new stadium.",
      "“Then it’s the staff, so half the backroom staff, physios, doctors, canteen lady, the whole thing, wiped clean and a new start there.",
      "“The latest one is it’s because they’re playing a back-three. If I’m not wrong, I watched Erik Ten Hag about a year ago playing a back-four, and it was some of the most awful football I’ve ever seen from a Manchester United team.",
      "“Some great teams over the years have played with a back-three. I’m not saying that’s my favourite formation at all, and I’m not saying that Amorim is right to be steadfast in his beliefs in that formation. But I certainly don’t think all of United’s problems now are because they play with the back-three.",
      "“It’s embarrassing if you’re going to say the main reason for the downturn is because they play a back-three. I mean, it really isn’t. They could go back to a back-four and play as bad as they did under Ten Hag, then the screams would be equally as loud.”",
      "Amorim has voiced his concerns that negative comments from pundits about his system might be influencing his players, and Owen thinks that is possible.",
      "“I could totally buy that,” he said. “Players aren’t sheltered away from everything.",
      "“They’re driving cars to training, putting the radio on. They sit at home in the lounge with the TV on. They read social media. They can do all these things. If you’re interested in football, you can’t get away from what people are thinking and saying about it.",
      "“Whether footballers should be swayed by those comments or impacted by them, that’s a different argument. But I’ve got no doubt that people will watch and will listen to people they probably respected and thought were great players growing up. They’ll listen to those opinions.",
      "“If they’re saying certain things, then it might enter their head, and they could perhaps wonder if the manager is doing the right thing. They might have their own ideas, but that’s not a new phenomenon.",

      "“At Liverpool [where Atletico lost 3-2 in the Champions League] a few weeks ago… the team aren’t as great as few years ago, but they still had fighting spirit. He’s on the sideline, he got sent off that night, I’d like a big personality.”",

      "Beloved boss David Moyes is doing a wonderful job at Everton as their move from Goodison Park to their stupidly named new stadium has been as seamless as it could have been, thanks partly to great management and the positive impact made by their summer signings.",
      "Moyes being brought back to oversee the major transition at Everton over the past year just felt right, but he does have a limited shelf life and at some point, he’ll face the same problem he had at West Ham.",
      "Everton’s ambitious new owners really backed Moyes in the summer as it finally appears that the club is on track to return to the European picture, but there will come a time when club chiefs and potentially supporters grow tired of the manager’s pragmatic style and demand a change of approach.",

      "Postecoglou to Forest was bound to fail from the start for a multitude of reasons, particularly because his playing philosophy is completely different from Nuno Espirito Santo’s.",
      "Forest’s squad is also built for Nuno’s style, with Postecoglou, trying and unsurprisingly failing to overhaul their approach in the middle of the season.",
      "But at Man Utd, the arrival of Postecoglou would surely spark an immediate upturn in performances and results, largely from a switch to the more-suited 4-2-3-1 formation that would allow Man Utd’s top stars to be played in their preferred positions.

      "Amorim is dying on his sword with a formation that isn’t suited to this group of players and never will be fit for Man Utd, and this will eventually be his undoing at Old Trafford.",

      "Manchester United and Newcastle United are among the clubs chasing Elliot Anderson and they could sign him for a bargain fee in January…",
      "Anderson is certainly one to watch heading into next year’s transfer windows as Nottm Forest’s dramatic decline this season reduces their hopes of keeping him beyond the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Newcastle will no doubt regret their decision to sell Anderson and not another valuable asset to avoid a PSR breach in 2024, as he’s been a revelation since joining Forest for £35m.",
      "The 22-year-old was one of the breakout stars in the Premier League last season, as his sudden emergence as one of the division’s best defensive midfielders helped them secure European qualification.",
      "And Anderson has arguably stepped up a level at the start of this campaign, looking at home in the Europa League and in Thomas Tuchel’s first England XI, with a start at next year’s World Cup currently looking a sure-fire certainty.",
      "READ: England player ratings v Wales: Saka stars; Rogers, Gordon and Spence among big winners",
      "The Three Lions have been crying out for an Anderson-type player for years and he’s quickly struck up a great partnership with Arsenal standout Declan Rice, who has been afforded the freedom to move further forward in a more suited No.8 position in recent internationals.",
      "Things are coming together for England at the right time, with the discipline, work rate, and quality passing of Anderson providing the platform for Tuchel’s talented attackers to shine.",
      "Speculation surrounding a transfer is already building as Man Utd are reportedly threatening Newcastle’s hopes of re-signing Anderson next year.",
      "This is according to Football Insider, who claim that the two Premier League clubs ‘hold serious interest’ in Anderson, though it ‘will be difficult’ for them to sign him in January.",
      "Naturally, this comes down to the price as the big spending is usually reserved for the summer transfer window, though Football Insider‘s explanation on Anderson’s price is somewhat puzzling.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Nottingham Forest are likely to demand an extortionate figure for their star midfielder in order to stave off any interest.",
      "‘Anderson could cost around £70million when the window reopens in the new year, as a result of his recent performances and undoubted potential.’",
      "£70m ‘extortionate’ for Anderson? Really?",
      "Given the current landscape of the midfield market, Forest can actually be justified in demanding more like £100m for their prized asset, especially considering Brighton asked for over £100m for Carlos Baleba in the summer.",
      "They are right in saying that Anderson is ‘unlikely’ to leave Forest in January as he and the club will inevitably wait for the post-World Cup tax to cash in, but Man Utd, Newcastle and potentially others should be licking their lips at the prospect of a £70m bargain next year.",
      "Newcastle have chosen their new sporting director – and it might give them an advantage in their upcoming transfer battle with Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, Bruno Fernandes and Manchester United have already ‘agreed’ his £100m ‘sale’ and this deal will fund two ‘incoming’ signings.",
      "Crystal Palace and Nottingham are definitely at risk as we rank the top ten non-Big Six stars most likely to secure an upwards transfer to a giant in 2026.",
      "Manchester United’s potential ‘first’ signing of 2026 would leave Newcastle United sick to the stomach and could be their worst embarrassment yet…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United already have a ‘plan’ for a ‘huge’ double deal as they ‘want to bring in two new midfielders’.",
      "Declan Rice has heaped praise on his new England team-mate, who “made it look so easy” in the World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia."

      "They look like they have a potential emerging No 1 in Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko had by far his best game for United so far, his pressing and ability to bring others into play were particularly impressive.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe mentioned Arsenal's faith in Mikel Arteta when saying he would like to give Ruben Amorim three years at Man Utd, but how does his record in his first 50 games in charge compare? Have your say in our poll",
      "Thursday 9 October 2025 13:10, UK",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has cited Mikel Arteta's \"miserable\" start as Arsenal boss as a reason to have patience with Manchester United's under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim. But how do their first 50 games in charge really compare?",
      "\"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,\" the Manchester United minority owner told The Business podcast. \"Football is not overnight. It's three years. You also look at Arteta. He had a miserable time over the first couple of years.\"",
      "Arteta has gone on to justify the club's faith by turning Arsenal into consistent Premier League title challengers. But does Amorim have Manchester United on the same path to long-term success? And what do their records after 50 games in charge tell us?",
      "While Arsenal were a long way below their current level in Arteta's first 50 games between December 2019 and April 2021, their record was much better than that of Amorim's Manchester United.",
      "Arteta won 27 of his first 50 games compared to Amorim's 19, giving him a win rate of 54 per cent to Amorim's 38 per cent. Arteta lost 13 games to Amorim's 19, drawing 12 to Amorim's 10.",
      "The goals scored columns are nearly identical, with Arsenal scoring 79 times to Manchester United's 78 under Amorim. But there is a big difference in goals conceded, with Amorim's side having let in nearly 60 per cent more than Arsenal, on 76.",
      "Arsenal kept 18 clean sheets in Arteta's first 50 games, hinting at his capacity to make the side more difficult to beat. Manchester United, by contrast, have only managed eight shut-outs under Amorim. They have conceded three or more goals on nine occasions, something that only happened three times in Arteta's first 50 games at Arsenal.",
      "Arteta inherited a team sitting 10th in the Premier League when he took the Arsenal job in December 2019. Manchester United were lower, in 14th, when Amorim took over at Manchester United.",
      "Arteta oversaw slight improvement relative to his starting position, although Arsenal's eighth-placed finish at the end of his first campaign, which included the interruption of the Covid pandemic, was the club's lowest since coming 10th in 1992/93.",
      "Manchester United finished even lower than the position in which Amorim found them at the end of his first season, coming 15th in a record-low for the club, with a points total of 42 to Arsenal's 56 in Arsenal's first season under Arteta.",
      "Both managers reached cup finals at the end of their first seasons. But while Arteta guided Arsenal to FA Cup success, beating Chelsea in the final having overcome Manchester City in the last four, Amorim suffered Europa League disappointment against Spurs.",
      "Arteta was unable to improve on Arsenal's eighth-placed finish in his first full season in charge, with Arsenal ending up in the same spot in the table. They were ninth at the time of his 50th game, a 3-0 loss to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in April 2021, only a place higher than Manchester United's position at Amorim's half-century.",
      "Arteta showed pragmatism in winning the FA Cup, moving away from his favoured 4-2-3-1, which has subsequently evolved into a 4-3-3, and instead using a back three, a change he said was intended to make the most of the players at his disposal at that time.",
      "Amorim has taken a more rigid approach, sticking to his favoured 3-4-2-1, despite external pressure to adapt his system. While Arteta showed variation in his starting formations in his first 50 games, Amorim has used a back three consistently, the only variation from 3-4-2-1 being 3-4-3, which he has used five times.",
      "Bukayo Saka is the only player from Arteta's first Arsenal line-up still at the club this season. The England international was used as a left-back in their 1-1 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day in 2019.",
      "There has been turnover at Manchester United under Amorim too, albeit in a shorter time frame, with five players who started the 1-1 draw with Ipswich in his first game in November of last year having gone, either on loan or permanently, in Andre Onana, Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford.",
      "The pace of change was relatively slow initially for Arteta at Arsenal, although he was able to include Gabriel Magalhaes, Martin Odegaard and Thomas Partey in his team for the defeat to Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium in his 50th game.",
      "Amorim enjoyed a win to mark his half-century as Manchester United beat Sunderland 2-0 last weekend with a starting line-up which included three new signings.",
      "Arsenal's transfer spending has ramped up in recent years, culminating in this summer's record £257m spend. But the club's outlay was more modest over the course of Arteta's first 50 games.",
      "Arteta mostly had to rely on loan signings and free transfers, with spending totalling only £81.5m across two transfer windows. Partey and Gabriel were the only players signed for significant fees.",
      "Manchester United have brought in fewer players under Amorim but spent considerably more in transfer fees, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lemmens, Diego Leon and Ayden Heaven arriving for a combined £232.4m, dwarfing Arsenal's figure in Arteta's first two transfer windows.",
      "As for sales, Arsenal only received a fee for one player during Arteta's first 50 games, with Emiliano Martinez sold to Aston Villa for £17m.",
      "Manchester United have been more successful on that front, recouping £61.7m from the sales of Garnacho and Antony.",
      "Have your say on which manager has done a better job in his first 50 games in charge in the poll below.",
      "Let us know whether you think Amorim will come good long-term.",

      "Thursday 9 October 2025 07:24, UK",
      "Manchester United minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has said he wants to give under-pressure head coach Ruben Amorim three years in the job to prove himself.",
      "Amorim is approaching the first anniversary of his appointment at Old Trafford, but his position has been under constant scrutiny since he took over on November 1 last year.",
      "He has failed to record back-to-back Premier League wins during that time, coming 15th last season - their worst top-flight finish since 1974 - and things have not improved much since the summer as United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby in August.",
      "That has led to suggestions Amorim's job is under threat, but Ratcliffe said the 40-year-old is a \"good guy\" and has time to turn things around.",

      "\"We have to be patient. We have a long-term plan. It isn't a light switch.",
      "\"You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has owned just under 30 per cent of United through his chemicals company INEOS since February 2024, taking over control of football operations at the club.",
      "That still left the Glazer family, who have been the subject of numerous fan protests over their handling of the club since taking over in 2005, in overall charge.",
      "Asked what would happen if the Glazers told him to sack Amorim, Ratcliffe said: \"It's not going to happen.\"",
      "The INEOS boss added the Glazers were happy for him to take charge, adding: \"That probably sums it up. We're local and they're the other side of the pond.",
      "\"That's a long way away to try and manage a football club as big and complex as Manchester United. We're here with feet on the ground.",
      "\"They [the Glazers] get a bad rap... but they are really nice people and they are really passionate about the club.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has come in for criticism of his own after controversial cuts designed to drive down costs saw around 450 jobs axed and the removal of perks like subsidised staff lunches.",
      "\"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated,\" he said.",
      "\"I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"The biggest correlation, like it or not, between results and any external factor - is profitability. The more cash you have got, the better squad you can build.",

      "\"Those numbers will get better. Manchester United will become the most profitable football club in the world, in my view, and from that will stem, I hope, a long-term, sustainable, high-level of football.\"",

He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me.

      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."
