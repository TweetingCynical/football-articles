      "Manchester United are stepping up their bid to sign a striker before the start of the new season – with Ollie Watkins now their first-choice target.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants a proven goalscorer to lead his side's attack, with Aston Villa and England striker Watkins seen as the ideal choice to fill the role. This summer United have adopted a policy of signing players with Premier League experience, as evidenced by the recruitment of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United are continuing that strategy with a move for Watkins, but are understood to be unwilling to meet Villa's £60million valuation of the 29-year-old.",
      "There is hope among the United hierarchy that a compromise figure of £40m-£45m for Watkins can be reached with Villa and enable a deal to be struck between the two clubs.",
      "Watkins scored 17 goals last season, 16 in the Premier League, with Amorim wanting a striker who can go straight into United's team and start scoring regularly, without needing time to adapt.",
      "As well as Watkins, United are keeping tabs on RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, but the Bundesliga club want around £70m for him and Newcastle are in pole position to sign the 22-year-old Slovenian.",
      "United are exploring the possibility of deals for Watkins and Sesko, but a move for Nicolas Jackson has been ruled out due to Chelsea's £80million asking price for him.",
      "While Amorim is keen to get a new striker signed as quickly as possible to give him time to settle in and build up an understanding with his new team-mates, he accepts that negotiations could drag on.",
      "In order to fund a move for a striker, United must raise revenue from player sales, with the double sale of Alejandro Garnacho and Antony – both left out of the US tour squad - enough to cover the cost of a new front man.",
      "United are also trying to offload Jadon Sancho and Tyrrell Malacia, who joined Garnacho and Antony in being left behind by Amorim, while Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona has saved around £12m, with the Spanish giants covering his wages for the whole of next season.",
      "United's determination to sign a new striker casts doubt over the future of Rasmus Hojlund, who struggled last season, scoring just 10 goals from 52 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Villa sources insist Watkins is not for sale, but they wanted £60m from Arsenal in January, before changing their stance when Jhon Duran left to join Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a fresh move for PSG star Randal Kolo Muani, having previously targeted the forward in 2023. The club ultimately opted to sign Rasmus Hojlund ahead of Kolo Muani that summer, but the France international looks to be available once again.",
      "United were enticed by Hojlund’s long-term potential, having impressed during his time at Atalanta, resulting in an eye-catching £72million move to Old Trafford. After a slow start, the young Dane ended his debut season with 16 goals in all competitions, but he found the net on just 10 occasions last term.",
      "As United work on improving their frontline through the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Ruben Amorim’s side have also been linked with a new number nine. Kolo Muani may have been snubbed in favour of Hojlund two years ago, but reports in Italy have claimed that United are targeting the PSG forward, who spent time on loan at Juventus last season.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport has reported that United have entered the race to sign Kolo Muani. The France international completed an initial £65m (€75m) move to PSG in 2023 following a prolific spell at Eintracht Frankfurt, which had also caught United's attention.",
      "The 26-year-old has since struggled to cement his place at the French club but showed signs of his best form during his Juventus loan spell, scoring 10 goals in 22 games. Gazzetta dello Sport claims that Kolo Muani remains a top target for Juventus and discussions with PSG are ongoing, but United are also pursuing the forward.",
      "It is reported that United’s interest in Kolo Munai, who is claimed to favour a return to Turin, has become more concrete since missing out on Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal. Meanwhile, PSG are keen to complete a permanent sale for the forward, though Juventus are said to have proposed a £8.6m (€10m) loan fee ahead of a future £39m (€45m) deal.",
      "However, if United succeed in snapping up Juventus target Kolo Muani, it could have a knock-on effect for Hojlund. Gazzetta dello Sport claims that Kolo Muani heading to Old Trafford would lead Juventus to have an interest in signing Hojlund on loan.",
      "Hojlund does have Serie A experience from his sole season with Atalanta. The 22-year-old scored nine league goals for the Bergamo club before sealing his big-money move to United.",
      "The potential arrival of Kolo Muani would threaten Hojlund’s place in the pecking order. He is already competing with Joshua Zirkzee and youngster Chido Obi for a starting spot, while new signings Cunha and Mbeumo could also be viewed as alternative centre-forwards.",
      "Kolo Muani is in need of a fresh start, as it recently emerged that he has been made to train with the youth team as PSG looks to offload the forward. If a move fails to materialise this summer, he faces the unenviable task of competing with PSG’s Champions League-winning attack for game time.",
      "United have also been linked with moves for Aston Villa ’s Ollie Watkins and Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic. However, United boss Amorim recently played down the team’s need for new signings.",
      "\"In the moment we need to be careful when we sign a player,” Amorim explained. “If I start the season with this squad I will be happy.\"",
      "He added: \"You feel the bond between the players in the best teams. We remind ourself how special it is to be at the best club in the world. I really like to be in a group that is healthy. We are going to suffer but that feeling of bonding is really important. The spirit is positive.\"",

      "Manchester United have been sent a come and get me plea by one of their transfer targets. Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is one of the players being considered to strengthen the position and he is very keen on a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Lammens is one of the players United are considering after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Onana was dropped by Ruben Amorim during the 2024/25 campaign, only for his back-up Bayindir to fail to take his chance in goal.",
      "The situation has led to much speculation over potential targets this summer, with ambitious interest in Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma emerging. United even approached Villa over a loan deal for Martinez, only for their offer to be rejected out of hand, while Donnarumma is unlikely to swap Champions League winners for a side that finished 15th last season.",
      "Lammens, a 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper, is clearly a much more attainable target for United at this stage. He is reportedly available for a fee of around £13m-17m after Antwerp sporting director Marc Overmars signed Taishi Brandon Nozawa to replace him.",
      "He played the full 90 minutes in his side’s 1-1 draw against Royale Union Saint-Gilloise in the league at the weekend. But speaking afterwards, it is clear that Lammens is courting a move away from Belgium.",
      "“Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he told reporters. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here, in any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.”",
      "He added: “I certainly have enough confidence in myself. I think the most important thing is that my future team, whenever they arrive, has a plan in place. Ideally, that means playing immediately, but it’s also possible I’ll have to take a step in between.",
      "“As long as there’s a plan, it doesn’t matter whether I’m ready for the next step or not. Everyone has their own career, their own path. Even if I don’t take the right step right away, I’ll get there.",
      "“It could be within a few days, but also a few months or a year. I have people around me who help me with that, and that way I can focus on what I need to do.”",
      "Royal Antwerp manager Stef Wils won’t stand in his way if United do come calling. “He’s proven why,” he said, referring to the transfer interest. “He has everything a modern goalkeeper needs, and as a young lad, he still has room to grow in a major league. He exudes calm and inspires confidence in his defenders, a plus on high balls.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United still have a lot of work to do in the summer transfer window after signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United endured a miserable 2024/25 season and know they need major reinforcements if they are to turn things around. Cunha, a £62.5million addition from Wolves, and Mbeumo, who cost a potential £71m from Brentford, are big signings, but it has been slow going on other fronts.",
      "The most important is at centre-forward, where United missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool and Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal. They cannot afford another miss and have identified some new targets, including Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United know how difficult it can be to sign a striker, having missed out on at least three occasions already this summer to rivals. Well, another similar situation could be brewing with RB Leipzig striker Sesko and Newcastle.",
      "The Magpies lost out on Ekitike to Liverpool and need to replace Callum Wilson, even if Alexander Isak stays put. They are moving for Sesko and it appears to be a straight shoot-out with United, who are also interested.",
      "Local newspaper Leipziger Volkszeitung says Sesko’s agent is in talks with both Newcastle and United and it could come down to the choice of the Slovenian. In that case, Sesko would ‘undoubtedly’ pick Ruben Amorim’s side, despite the fact they can’t offer any European football and Newcastle are in the Champions League.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is keen on a move to Manchester United. Lammens is one of the players United are considering after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Ambitious moves for Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma have gone nowhere, but Lammens is available for €15-20million (£13-17m).",
      "“Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he told reporters after sporting director Marc Overmars signed Taishi Brandon Nozawa to replace him. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here, in any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.”",

Everyone has their own career, their own path. Even if I don’t take the right step right away, I’ll get there.”",
      "Al-Nassr appear to be coming to Manchester United’s rescue with a move for Antony. The Brazilian is one of the outcasts Amorim is desperate to sell, but a move back to Real Betis, following a successful loan spell, never materialised due to financial problems.",
      "Now the Saudi Arabian side have made their interest known. Fresh off the back of agreeing a deal for one Premier League flop, in the form of Chelsea’s Joao Felix, Al-Nassr also want to do the charity of signing Antony to join Sadio Mane and Cristiano Ronaldo up front.",
      "Antony would consider such a move, according to his agent, so it looks like a goer. Having already got rid of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona, this would leave Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho as the final unwanted players to offload.",

      "A number of forwards have already been linked including Viktor Gyokeres - albeit he has now completed a move to Premier League rivals Arsenal. Sesko has now emerged as a back-up option, with the Slovenian having caught the eye for RB Leipzig over recent seasons.",
      "Newcastle are also interested, with Sesko seen as a potential replacement for Alexander Isak, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool. But the Red Devils have moved to the front of the queue with the striker’s own stance on a move.",
      "According to Sky in Germany, United chiefs have already been in touch with Sesko to lay out their project. They have also proposed figures to his representatives ahead of potentially launching talks with Leipzig.",
      "Luckily for United, Sesko has responded well, having been left impressed by what the Red Devils had to say. There is still some work to do on a deal though, with Leipzig wanting around £64m for their star forward.",
      "Meanwhile, boss Amorim has already spoken about what he wants from his new signings. He said: “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already.",
      "“Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.”",
      "Sesko, who has scored 39 goals for Leipzig over the past two seasons, has already revealed what could help him make a decision - a potential new club’s style of play. Speaking after he signed for Leipzig, he said: \"The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations, but I think it was better to come here.",
      "\"It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.\"",
      "He doubled down on that stance after penning a new contract with the German side last summer. He said: “Leipzig has given me a lot and continues to give me a lot every day. It’s a great club to develop at. In the future, I want to play for a club that suits me, that brings out the best in me. That’s the most important thing for me.”",

      "But instead of joining the side on their pre-season tour, Vitek has penned a new deal until the summer of 2028 and straight away moved to Championship side Bristol City on a season-long loan. The Czech Republic youth international has previously had spells on loan with Accrington Stanley and Austrian side Blau-Weiß Linz.",
      "On completing his move to Ashton Gate, Vítek said: “I’m really excited, for me the Championship is a new level. More games is a big positive for me and I can’t wait to get to know all the players and staff better.”",
      "Vitek will now hope to earn more experience having been tipped for big things by Academy lead goalkeeping coach Tommy Lee. He said: \"Radek has done great out there in Austria.",
      "“He got an injury early on but recovered extremely well and played really well. He has got really good experience there. I think we often use Radek as an example to some of the younger goalkeepers in the Academy.",

The Uruguay star failed to deliver on his huge transfer fee and was an unused sub for United's last two games of the season – including the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "But Ugarte impressed in United's 2-1 win over West Ham in the opening game of their US tour at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. The 24-year-old pressed high, regularly won back possession and went on a fine run to set Amad up for a goal that was ultimately ruled out for offside.",
      "It was a positive start to pre-season for Ugarte, one which suggests he could start in midfield for United in their season opener at home to Arsenal on August 17.",

      "“I already know the league, the rivals, which is important. So I’m very happy, but we have to keep going.",

      "Marcus Rashford's humiliating debut for Barcelona comes almost 10 years after his first start for Manchester United, after which he was hailed by former team-mate Michael Carrick. Rashford joined the La Liga champions last week on a season-long loan move after becoming surplus to requirements under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "After kicking off life in Catalonia by training with his new team-mates, Rashford then flew out on the club's pre-season tour of Japan. A 3-1 victory over J-League side Vissel Kobe followed in what was his first match for the club.",
      "However, it was an embarrassing baptism for Rashford, who came on at half-time before being replaced in just the 78th minute. His low-key bow for Barca is worlds apart from when former United star Carrick gushed over Rashford's senior debut for his boyhood club in February 2016.",
      "Rashford was only 18 when he was brought into the United starting line-up against FC Midtjylland in the Europa League as a last-minute replacement for the injured Anthony Martial. He quickly announced himself to the world as he scored twice in a 5-1 United win.",
      "Afterwards, in what is a far cry from the reaction to his Barca debut, Carrick lauded Rashford. \"It's great. You can't put a price on that for the younger lads, especially Marcus. It's incredible and brings back memories for me, when I made my debut,\" Carrick told MUTV.",
      "\"It's what football's all about, and what this club has been about for so long. For a local lad to do that and come through the system like that, I'm delighted for him.\"",
      "After his first minutes for Barcelona, manager Hansi Flick explained why the 27-year-old came off just over half an hour after coming on. \"He's [a] week behind the others,\" Flick said.",
      "\"He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him. It was a very good match, a good test for us. The first 30 minutes were fantastic.",
      "\"After that we lost a bit of control, but the second half was also very good. I'm pleased. What they do with the ball, how they pressed us, it’s really interesting. You can tell they have a clear idea, and it’s similar to ours.\"",
      "Rashford hadn't played for United since December 2024 after being dropped by Amorin. He spent the second half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Barca have the option to make Rashford's deal permanent for £26million next summer after he was handed the No. 14 shirt, previously worn by Thierry Henry at the club. Since arriving, he has claimed that his new residence feels like home.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford told Barcelona's YouTube channel upon his unveiling. \"It's a club where people's dreams come true, they win big prizes. What the club stands for means a lot for me.",
      "\"I feel like I'm at home and a big factor in my choice to come here is because it is a family place and a good place for good players to showcase their skills. Another factor is because the conversations I had with [Hansi Flick] were positive.",
      "\"What he did last season was terrific. To lead such a young team to a very successful season and come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club and it's everything I wished. I'm eager to learn the Barcelona way.\"",
      "Next up for Barcelona is a friendly against Seoul in the South Korean capital on Thursday. Rashford will have a reunion with ex-United team-mate Jesse Lingard, who captains the K-League side.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford suffered one of the biggest humiliations a top-level footballer can endure on Sunday. The Manchester United forward completed what he hoped to be a dream loan move to Barcelona last week as he looks to get his career back on track.",
      "The deal, which was finalised in time for Rashford to fly to Japan with the rest of the Barca squad, gives the La Liga champions an option to buy the forward for £26million at the end of the season. Rashford’s first pre-season outing came against Japanese side Vissel Kobe, where he started the game on the bench.",
      "Flick brought the 27-year-old on for his much-anticipated debut at half-time, with Rashford showing glimpses of promise and working hard to track back in his new Blaugrana colours. However, he was quickly cut down to size as manager Hansi Flick took him off after just 33 minutes, moments after playing a key role in Barcelona’s second goal.",
      "Rashford and left-back Jofre Torrents made way for Gerard Martin and Pedro Fernandez, who scored Barca’s third goal. While the substitution would have stung Rashford, Flick explained that his decision was not performance related, saying: \"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury.\"",
      "Just seven days ago, Rashford had been part of United’s ‘bomb squad’ – the group training alone and made to use the club’s Carrington training ground only once the first-team squad had gone home for the day.",
      "One player who knows exactly how Rashford would have felt this weekend is former Tottenham midfielder Hossam Ghaly. He was signed by Spurs in 2006 and was used sporadically by then-head coach Martin Jol during the 2006/07 season.",
      "After being in and out of the squad, the Egyptian was brought on against Blackburn Rovers in the first half of the penultimate game of the Premier League season after an injury to Steed Malbranque. But, like Rashford, he found himself substituted 31 minutes after his introduction – only his substitution WAS due to a poor performance.",
      "Unlike Rashford, Ghaly responded in the worst possible way, furiously throwing his shirt on the ground while walking off the pitch. The act infuriated the Spurs faithful as jeers and chants of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” rang around the stadium.",
      "Ghaly was disciplined by the club and left out of the matchday squad on the final day of the season, before making a public apology. He said: \"I am just so angry with myself. I have always considered it an honour to wear the Tottenham shirt and I never intended to show any disrespect.",
      "\"I knew things weren't happening for me out there, my play was terrible and I could hear the crowd jeering me.",
      "\"I was so upset at the fans' reaction. I have enjoyed playing in front of the club's supporters all season and I felt I had given my best all the time and played some decent football.",
      "\"It is always hard to accept being substituted after such a short period of time and I was upset and taken aback by the cheering. I am a player who plays with my heart.",
      "\"I know my reaction was totally wrong,\" he added. \"I have apologised to the manager and I also want to apologise to the fans. I hope they don't judge me on this incident alone. I have tried hard for the club this season.\"",
      "Despite his best efforts at reconciliation, it marked Ghaly’s last game for Spurs as he was sent out on loan to Derby County in January 2008. He returned to north London for the 2008/09 season but didn’t play a single game before his permanent departure.",
      "Harry Redknapp considered bringing him on during a January 2009 clash with Wigan, but the Englishman decided against it after hearing the fans boo Ghaly while he was warming up and preparing to come on off the bench.",
      "Rashford will want to avoid such a fate at Barcelona, though he will also hope that Flick does not make a habit of subjecting him to external ridicule. The England international has had his fair share of spats with United managers Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim in recent years.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "In September of last year, Nick died three days short of his 60th birthday. \"For the past few months, I've been trying to figure it all out, trying to get unstuck,\" Ella wrote for the Players' Tribune in January.",

      "She was replaced by Beth Mead in the 87th minute, as the Lionesses dug in and took the game to extra-time and penalties before getting their hands on the trophy for the second time in three years. Post-match, Toone shared two emotional Instagram stories and revealed that her mum had been sat next to a spare seat at the final in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "\"Spare seat next to my mum tonight,\" she wrote alongside an image of the empty seat. \"If that's not a sign I don't know what is. I know you were there Dad. Love you cock.\"",

      "Who was your Player of the Tournament for England? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",

      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants a proven goalscorer to lead his side's attack, with Aston Villa and England striker Watkins seen as the ideal choice to fill the role. This summer United have adopted a policy of signing players with Premier League experience, as evidenced by the recruitment of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United are continuing that strategy with a move for Watkins, but are understood to be unwilling to meet Villa's £60million valuation of the 29-year-old.",

      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.”",

      "Chelsea have also been linked with a move while Galatasaray are said to have gone a step further by making a formal approach. It'd be a surprise if City put their hat in the ring after they struck a £27m deal with Burnley to re-sign James Trafford.",
      "The topic of Donnarumma's future was bubbling under the surface as the ex-AC Milan wonderkid helped PSG finally get their hands on the Champions League in May. As recently as last month, Donnarumma confirmed that it was his priority to stay in Paris.",
      "\"My priority is to stay at PSG, I don't think there will be any problems in the negotiations,\" Donnarumma told Sky Italia on June 9. \"We're a great team.\"",
      "Napoli have also been linked with Donnarumma but his agent, Enzo Raiola - cousin of the late super agent, Mino - dismissed the speculation by labelling it 'pure fantasy'. \"I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio,\" Raiola told Radio CRC via Calciomercato.",
      "\"He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal. I have never ruled out interest from the top Italian clubs, but there has never been a negotiation, let's see.",
      "\"He is still young, I have to squeeze him for at least another 10 years. At the moment, however, it is very difficult to see Donnarumma in the Italian championship, I'm not just talking about numbers but also about the sporting project.",
      "\"In Italy, beyond Inter who reached the Champions League final, there are Milan and Juventus who are struggling, they are in the process of reorganising: these factors are fundamental.\"",

      "They say it is the biggest humiliation a footballer can experience: being a substitute that, after getting on the pitch, is then subbed off. So why did Hansi Flick bring on Marcus Rashford for 30 minutes on his Barcelona debut - and then take him off again?",
      "Rashford, 27, appeared for the first since completing his season-long loan move from Manchester United in midweek, ending his exile at Old Trafford. The forward's transfer - which includes a £26million option to buy - was finalised in time for him to fly to Japan with the rest of Barca's squad, as they embark on a pre-season tour of Asia. First up was a clash with Japanese side Vissel Kobe in a friendly match which was initially suspended before organisers scrambled to make it happen.",
      "Rashford was named on the bench by Flick before the German changed his entire line-up at half-time. The United loanee showed promise during his 30-minute cameo, notably playing a crucial role when fellow new signing Roony Bardghji got on the scoresheet in Barcelona's 3-1 win.",
      "After defender Jofre Torrents won back possession on the left, Rashford collected the ball and played a perfectly-weighted pass through to Robert Lewandowski. Barca's No.9 then picked out Bardghji on the right, as the former Copenhagen hotshot produced an impressive first-time finish.",
      "Seconds later, Rashford was brought off. The England international and Torrents were replaced by Gerard Martin and Pedro Fernandez, scorer of Barcelona's third goal, in the 77th minute.",
      "Post-match, Flick was asked about his decision to haul both Rashford and Torrents off after half an hour each.",
      "\"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury,\" the Barcelona manager explained. Which, obviously, makes perfect sense for a player who, just seven days ago, was a member of Manchester United's 'bomb squad' training alone and made to use the club's Carrington training ground when the first-team squad had gone home.",
      "For Flick, these early days are about getting Rashford up to speed, slowly but surely, helping him adjust to what he wants. Do it correctly, and it's another match winner among Barca's collection of stars. Subbing him on and then off in a pre-season friendly? Not a problem for the manager nor his new player.",
      "Will Marcus Rashford be a success at Barcelona? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Flick was a 'key' reason why Rashford joined the La Liga champions, having led Barcelona to three trophies in his first season. \"He was another key factor for me to join Barca,\" the 27-year-old revealed during his unveiling.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive. He has proven to be one of the top coaches... He led a young team to such a successful season and has returned to the preseason wanting more.\"",
      "Rashford's team-mates are already looking forward to playing alongside him. \"Rashford is a very talented player,\" Lewandowski told reporters in Japan.",
      "\"We played Manchester United two years ago and he was in great form. He can help us and is able to play in different positions.\"",

It is suggested that the London side would be willing to offer the youngster instant Premier League football, while United see him as one for the future.",

      "Signing a player compared to Erling Haaland is one thing - but signing one many believe is better? Now that's a mouthwatering prospect. For Manchester United, that prospect may become reality if they land Benjamin Sesko this summer.",
      "The RB Leipzig striker, who is being linked with a blockbuster £60million move to Old Trafford, had the unenviable task of filling Haaland's shoes at Red Bull Salzburg. In just half a season in Austria, a teenage Haaland smashed 28 goals in 22 games before sealing a career-launching switch to Borussia Dortmund - turning down United in the process.",
      "A year later, Sesko arrived at Salzburg with the same towering frame, explosive playing style, and sky-high expectations. The comparisons to Haaland were inevitable. And while he wasn't quite as ruthless in front of goal, Sesko made just as big an impression - and, in the eyes of some, an even bigger one.",
      "\"Such comparisons motivate me and give me energy,\" the Slovenian said in 2021. \"They do not represent pressure. I will listen and learn so I can be even better than he is.",
      "\"My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\"",
      "Sesko's rise hasn't been as meteoric as Haaland's, but if he secures a Premier League move this summer, he'll have done so at the same age his Norwegian counterpart made the leap. Arsenal looked set to sign the 22-year-old earlier in the window, but ultimately pivoted to Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea have also shown interest in Sesko, but after signing Hugo Ekitike and Liam Delap respectively, both clubs now look out of the running. This has given United something of a free run at the striker, but a deal is far from guaranteed.",
      "The Red Devils have already splashed £133m on attacking reinforcements, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - and with concerns about the club's financial situation lingering, any further moves must be approached with caution.",
      "Then there's the matter of convincing Sesko himself. Without Champions League football on offer, United are at a disadvantage against several domestic and European rivals. And with the striker tied to RB Leipzig until 2029, neither he nor the club are under pressure to make a decision quickly.",
      "United will also be hoping Sesko, who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season, has had a change of heart since turning down a move to Old Trafford in 2023, opting instead for RB Leipzig - a decision he later attributed to concerns over United's style of play.",
      "\"The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations [about which club I would sign for]. But I think it was better to come [to RB Leipzig],\" Sesko admitted in 2024.",
      "\"It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.\"",
      "Now, with a new manager, a fresh attacking core, and a point to prove, United are hoping the timing - and the project - feel different this time around.",
      "If they can convince Sesko that Old Trafford is where he can become not just the next Haaland, but the first Sesko, it could mark the beginning of a new era - one built not just on reputation or comparisons, but on potential fully realised in red.",

      "But United stuck to their stance that Fernandes was not for sale, despite the huge offer from Al Hilal for a player who turns 31 in less than two months.",
      "And after Fernandes produced a man-of-the-match display to get United's Stateside tour off to a winning start, boss Amorim underlined why he remains such a key player.",
      "“It was so clear last season,” said Amorim. “You can see it in the assists, the goals, but not just that. I think now he has more players [around him]. I've felt that on the tour. I feel that now there are more players to help him to lead the group. That is a good thing.",
      "“But he's our leader, so he's really important. Not just on the field, but also off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and sometimes he plays with pain.",
      "“The problem is that sometimes he gets frustrated and sometimes he loses a little bit of the focus of his job. Sometimes he wants to help his team-mates so much that sometimes it's not the best thing to do.",
      "“They all have to learn. They have to do their job. Bruno also has to wait for the ball in different situations. This kind of thing is what a leader does, but he needs help and he's going to have help.",
      "“Bruno has a function or a position for every game. It's impossible to play in all of the positions. Last year I felt that sometimes I pushed him back, to have more possession in the build-up, and then we missed Bruno near the box.",
      "“I think with different characteristics, with Matheus Cunha, with Bryan Mbeumo, I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, I think he will have more help this season.",
      "“Bruno runs a lot. Maybe in the sprint he's a different player, but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance. He's smart. The physicality of Bruno is not the concern. He's ready for the physicality, playing deep or as a midfielder.”",
      "Amorim picked a strong team against West Ham and revealed he did so because he needs the team that is likely to start the season to get up to speed as quickly as possible.",
      "“It was a strong team because we need to prepare all the players,” said Amorim. “We needed to take this game seriously. We don't have a lot of weeks, a lot of games to prepare all of the team, but that can change. It's rare that the team plays more than an hour on their first tour game.",
      "“But I was expecting this from the team at this moment. We have all the data, all the information. We know that at this stage they can cope with 70 minutes with a high tempo. So it wasn't a surprise.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United are weighing up a move for Ollie Watkins or Benjamin Sesko as their striker signing.",
      "United have identified Aston Villa figurehead Watkins, 29, as their preferred target but the 22-year-old RB Leipzig frontman Sesko is also under consideration as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Well-placed sources have suggested Watkins would be open to joining United, who want a new starting striker following the £133.5million investments to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Sesko rejected United three years ago in favour of joining Leipzig but is keen to secure a major move this summer. Sesko is under contract at Leipzig until 2029.",
      "The Slovenia international's agent, Elvis Basanovic, has remained in dialogue with United and visited their Carrington training complex and Old Trafford since holding talks about a possible move in 2022.",
      "Watkins turns 30 on December 30 but has entered the final two years of his Villa contract and has played in the Premier League for five years. The England international has scored 75 goals in 184 Premier League games.",
      "Former Brentford striker Watkins has started at least 30 Premier League matches in each of his five seasons with Villa and has only missed seven games through injury for the club.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim admitted the club had specifically targeted Cunha and Mbeumo due to their Premier League nous. Only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have scored more league goals than Watkins in the past three campaigns.",
      "Villa were receptive to letting Watkins leave in the winter transfer window but ended up selling Jhon Duran to Al Nassr for £71million instead. Arsenal had a bid of around £60m rejected for Watkins.",
      "United sources concede Watkins would command a sizeable fee but are prepared to move for a more experienced top flight striker after first-choice target Liam Delap chose to join Chelsea.",
      "The club are still aiming to obtain fees for forwards Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho. A United source acknowledged they have extra \"headroom\" following Marcus Rashford's season-long loan to Barcelona, who are covering his salary in full.",
      "Villa and Watkins are also in the United States on their pre-season tour but are not involved in the Premier League Summer Series that United are participating in. Villa play their next games in St Louis and Nashville whereas United are in Chicago and next travel to Atlanta.",
      "Sesko tallied a modest 13 goals in 33 Bundesliga games last term.",

      "Whisper it quietly, but this might finally be the season Manchester United finally see the best of Mason Mount in a red shirt.",
      "When United signed the England international midfielder from Chelsea in a deal worth up to £60million two years ago it was seen as a major coup to get one of their rivals' biggest talents.",
      "One of Mount's greatest abilities was his availability and managers ranging from Thomas Tuchel to Gareth Southgate to Frank Lampard all hailed him as a coach's dream.",
      "Erik ten Hag thought he was going to get the same feeling but, ironically, since joining United, his lack of availability has been a major problem. A number of unfortunate injuries have restricted Mount to just 30 Premier League appearances across his first two seasons in Manchester.",
      "However, he ended last season strongly and scored twice in United's 4-1 Europa League semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao and played a prominent role in the side.",
      "Speaking back in March, United boss Ruben Amorim described why he 'really loved' Mount and why his version of United needed a player like him in the team.",
      "\"I really love Mason Mount,\" he said. \"I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club. We will try to manage the load.",
      "\"You saw players who had a lot of problems in time but they can then stay fit and I believe a lot in Mason Mount. We need players like Mason Mount.\"",
      "Mount was signed as a deeper midfield option by Ten Hag but always thrived in a more advanced role at Chelsea. That is where Amorim sees him playing for United, too, but he will have fierce competition this season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes can play in that role while new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, have been brought in to play in that position.",
      "Mount has a fight on his hands but it is one he seems up for and insists he has ensured he's returned to pre-season feeling as strong as possible.",
      "\"I look at the end of last season and that was positive for me, to get back in the shape that I was in and be able to play and finish the end of the season off, to get a few goals, and to be back in and amongst the lads. That's the most important thing,\" he said.",
      "\"We're all in this together, and I think this period now is so important for us to spend together to train. But yeah, personally, I'm feeling really good. I feel like I'm in a really good place at the moment. I'm so excited for the start of the season.\"",
      "So far, Mount's body has held up in pre-season, having come off the bench in the draw with Leeds and the win over West Ham.",
      "With games against Bournemouth and Everton to come in the USA this week, the 26-year-old will be keen to make his mark ahead of what is a make-or-break season for him in the eyes of United fans.",
      "Amorim's system and support should get the best out of Mount. It is now time for him to deliver what United fans have waited two years to see.",

      "After missing out on Liam Delap, Manchester United have been chasing shadows in their pursuit of a striker this summer.",
      "Delap was identified as United's top striker target ahead of the summer transfer window. Following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship, Delap was available via a £30million release clause. Unfortunately for United, Chelsea won the race for his signature, signing him in time for the start of the Club World Cup.",
      "Although Delap did well for Ipswich last season, scoring 12 goals, signing him to spearhead United's attack after just one season as a Premier League regular would have been a huge risk, meaning it is somewhat bold to suggest missing out on him was a 'blow'.",
      "Nevertheless, missing out on him has delayed their striker search. The additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have bolstered their attack, but they are still missing the main piece of the jigsaw.",
      "Links connecting United with Viktor Gyokeres, who has now joined Arsenal, have been and gone, while reports linking them with Victor Osimhen have persisted for as long as one can remember. Exactly where United's striker search will end remains to be seen.",
      "However, according to widespread reports, RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has made his way back onto United's radar. Former football director John Murtough met Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, to gauge the possibility of a transfer in 2022.",
      "According to Sky Germany, United, alongside Premier League counterparts Newcastle United, have entered discussions with Sesko's representatives.",
      "With Delap, Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike, who was also on United's radar earlier this summer, having all been snapped up already this summer, United's options are dwindling.",
      "United acknowledge they need to recruit a high-end striker to beef up Ruben Amorim's attack, and Sesko is arguably one of the very few left on the market that could be attainable.",
      "It goes without saying Leipzig will want a hefty-sized fee for the 22-year-old, who has four years left on his deal at the Red Bull Arena. He joined Leipzig from sister club Red Bull Salzburg in 2023 and signed a contract extension in June last year.",
      "Two seasons into his career in Germany, the Slovenian has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances in Leipzig colours. He scored 21 times last term.",
      "Sesko is by no means the finished article; he is still fairly young and finding his feet. In all honesty, United should be targeting someone more established and with a proven record in the Premier League.",
      "Nevertheless, Sesko is an option United are reportedly running the rule over once again. And when you remember who is leading their recruitment this summer, it should come as no surprise.",
      "Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who joined United last year, has been empowered to oversee the club's recruitment network and is a key part of the football structure at Old Trafford. Prior to joining the Reds, Vivell had stints at Chelsea and Leipzig.",
      "After joining the Bundesliga club in August 2020, he became their technical director, meaning he was responsible for recruitment and scouting across all age groups. He had previously spent five years at Salzburg, so is well-versed in the Red Bull model.",
      "Having swapped Salzburg for Leipzig, Sesko followed in his footsteps in 2023, swapping Austria for Germany. Leipzig agreed a deal to sign him in 2022, but the deal did not come into effect until the following year.",
      "Vivell was responsible for Leipzig's recruitment at the point of signing Sesko, meaning he knows all about the striker. He will be advising United and giving them insight on what he could potentially bring to Old Trafford.",
      "Sales, of course, remain key to United's chances of being able to land a big-name striker, and Sesko will command a big fee, but Vivell could make all the difference if a transfer tug-of-war unfolds.",

      "Too many of Manchester United's recent superstar signings have failed to live up to the mark.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in typically Zlatan Ibrahimovic style, was different. He arrived at Old Trafford in 2016, announcing his move on social media 24 hours before an official statement. He was in the twilight of his career but plundered 29 goals in 43 starts, helping United win the Europa League, albeit he missed the final through injury, and the League Cup, in which he scored twice as the Reds beat Southampton.",
      "Benjamin Sesko would have taken note. The Slovenia superstar is being linked with a move to United and the prospect of him following in Ibrahimovic's footsteps is one that would excite both Sesko and Reds supporters.",
      "The 22-year-old has forged a reputation as one of Europe's leading goalscorers in recent seasons, transferring the form he showed breaking through at Red Bull Salzburg to the Bundesliga with RB Leipzig. United were first linked with a move for Sesko two years ago and speculation he could join this summer has ramped up in recent days.",
      "He was nothing more than a promising junior when Ibrahimovic was strutting his stuff at Old Trafford but a young Sesko, who is a keen basketball fan and was initially pressed into football as a goalkeeper by his dad, himself a former stopper, before becoming a forward, was enthralled by the Swedish superstar.",
      "“Zlatan Ibrahimovic was my idol,” he said in an interview in 2023. “I’m not saying I play like him but he was having fun, enjoying himself on the pitch, doing what he wanted to do. It makes me really happy when I see that kind of player. Every single video I could find, I was looking at him.”",
      "One of those videos will likely have been the League Cup win in 2017 when Ibrahimovic netted a late winner to hand United the trophy. Sesko has spoken of an interest in playing in the Premier League: \"Of course it would be nice to play there,\" he mused shortly after signing for Leipzig.",
      "His stock has risen considerably since and it's easy to see why. Sesko is a towering forward with an eye for goal, aerial ability, and a thunderous strike, but he offers much more than 'the big man up top'.",
      "He is a willing channel runner, often retreats into midfield to pick up the ball and progress play while his dribbling ability makes him a danger from deep.",
      "He has 27 goals in 47 league starts for Leipzig, numbers that provide a belief he could cut it in the Premier League. And at United, as a focal point of an attack and with a new-look creative force behind him, he could thrive.",
      "If United were able to complete a deal for Sesko, it would significantly enhance a squad that has struggled for goals in the past two seasons and potentially provide a long-term solution.",
      "In his first interview as a Red, Ibrahmiovic said: \"I don't like to compare the past with the present.\"",
      "In Sesko, United would get a reminder of the past with a bright future ahead.",

      "According to a report from Calcio Mercato, Man United have made an offer of around £34m to sign Sporting CP midfielder Morten Hjulmand.",
      "The Danish international is said to have a release clause of around £69m in his contract, but Sporting are believed to be willing to do business at around £43m.",
      "United have yet to strengthen the defensive midfield this summer having signed Matheus Cunha, Diego Leon and Bryan Mbeumo for the first team. Ruben Amorim had a strong relationship with Hjulmand prior to his exit from the club in November.",

      "Ultimately, Arsenal managed to sign the Swede after reaching a compromise with their president Frederico Varandas which was a rather painstaking process.",

      "The 21-year-old is one of five central midfielders available to head coach Ruben Amorim, and it is thought his temporary exit could open the door for a new addition.",
      "Although he didn't manage to get himself on the scoresheet against West Ham United at the MetLife Stadium on Saturday night, Rasmus Hojlund played well.",
      "He spearheaded United's attack and was very unfortunate not to give the Reds the lead inside the opening 50 seconds, smashing an excellent effort against the woodwork.",
      "Hojlund made several intelligent runs against the Hammers and was a general nuisance. Of course, the caveat is that pre-season games are very different to competitive fixtures.",
      "Nevertheless, Hojlund should be encouraged by his display. Of course, he is fighting to keep his place in the starting XI ahead of this coming season amid United's desperate need to sign a new striker.",
      "Even if Hojlund, for example, scores four goals in United's final three friendlies, the club will still need to sign a striker. On the flip side, a successful pre-season campaign for the Dane could elevate his stock and trigger more interest from elsewhere.",
      "Furthermore, a good pre-season could convince United to retain him and keep him as their second striker. That is the role he should have been signed to fill back in 2023.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly being watched closely by those at AC Milan.",
      "Corriere dello Sport claim that Milan are searching for a striker who will provide competition with Santiago Gimenez.",
      "Hojlund is said to fit the bill, with Darwin Nunez and Juve star Dusan Vlahovic also of interest.",
      "“Rasmus Højlund also remains of interest. His agent recently offered him to Milan, although it’s Manchester United who would need to agree to a loan with an option to buy.”",
      "Manchester United have begun background talks with RB Leipzig over a proposed move for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Fabrizio Romano expressed that on Monday, United's hierarchy opened up conversations about trying to beat Newcastle United to his signature. In a video uploaded to YouTube, he said:",
      "Man United also in the recent hours on Sunday night, on Monday morning made new contacts with Sesko's camp. Not directly with the player, but with agents of the player to start conversations about eventual numbers, the contract, the project, the vision. So Man United are starting to move, Newcastle have already presented their project and are prepared to match the financial request.",
      "Any deal is seen as slightly complicated due to the finances involved, given the Red Devils still need to seek exits for the likes of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "His price remains set at £60-70m this summer, with add-ons perhaps taking a deal closer to the £80m mark.",
      "Following the signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha already this summer, United's next task is to try and find a striker.",
      "They are desperate to secure a new No.9 this summer and they have been linked with countless names in recent weeks and months.",
      "But after signing two Premier League proven attackers to strengthen their No.10 options, it would be no surprise if United followed suit in their search for a natural No.9.",
      "Liam Delap was attainable via a £30million release clause but ended up at Chelsea, meaning that has forced United to look elsewhere for a goal-getter.",
      "In truth, there are a limited number of Premier League strikers United could realistically try and sign before the end of the window, and even then sales remain vitally important. Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa and Crystal Palace ace Jean-Philippe Mateta are probably the two most attractive options right now.",
      "Nevertheless, the signings of Mbeumo and Cunha show that United want players with Premier League pedigree.",
      "United are being linked with a move for Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "Evening Standard says the 26-year-old PSG man would be available for permanent transfer this summer.",
      "The France international scored eight goals in 16 appearances for Juventus, with his loan deal proving fruitful.",
      "Ruben Amorim has a whole host of options on his current shortlist, which includes Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Jean-Philippe Mateta.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is a name that simply will not go away this summer.",
      "The RB Leipzig forward has been linked with United, Newcastle and Arsenal, and his future is still not set in stone.",
      "Ruben Amorim wants a new number nine and appears to be waiting for further outgoings before sanctioning his next addition.",
      "TBR Football have today stated that Sesko would 'prefer' a move to Old Trafford over one to Newcastle.",
      "It remains to be seen, for now, whether the talented Slovenian ends up.",
      "Another one you may have missed over the weekend is the story linking United with Aleksandar Mitrovic.",
      "Caught Offside have claimed that the Reds are planning a surprise move for the striker. He has scored 68 goals in the last two seasons in Saudi Arabia and it's been said he would accept a pay cut to move to Old Trafford.",
      "A fee of £20m has been touted.",
      "Al Nassr have submitted an offer for Antony and it's understood that the Brazilian is open to a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "TeamTALK have claimed that United want £43.7m for Antony with negotiations ongoing to reach an agreement. Antony, however, has given a green light to complete the move.",
      "Man United have reportedly made their first move to sign Sporting CP midfielder Morten Hjulmand.",
      "Calciomercato.com has reported that an offer worth €40m (£34.8m) has been submitted in hope of securing his services ahead of Juventus. Hjulmand has a release clause worth €80m (£69.6m).",
      "Sporting are said to be open to offers of €50m (£43.5m) but Hjulmand's entourage are keen to finalise an exit for €30m/€40m (£26.1m-£34.8m).",
      "Randal Kolo Muani is set to be the subject of a bid from Man United in the coming days, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.",
      "Juventus are also said to be monitoring the situation after having the striker on loan last season. Kolo Muani scored eight goals in 16 Serie A appearances.",
      "You may have missed it over the weekend but Luke Shaw has been tipped with a shock move out of Man United.",
      "The Sun have claimed that the defender is willing to listen to offers from Saudi Arabia amid uncertainty over his playing time under Ruben Amorim."

      "Toby Collyer is set to leave Manchester United on loan this summer.",
      "Collyer made his United debut in the Community Shield against Manchester City last year but he has only started three times for the club.",
      "The 21-year-old is one of five central midfielders available to head coach Ruben Amorim and United's intention to facilitate a loan move for Collyer is expected to clear the pathway for a midfield signing.",
      "Collyer joined the United academy from Brighton in 2022 and he signed a new contract last summer. However, he missed 28 games through three separate injuries last season and managed only 13 appearances.",
      "Sources say Collyer \"has to go on loan\" for the benefit of his development and United are planning to okay a move, despite Collyer's determination to challenge for a place.",
      "\"I think first and foremost I want to be here and play as many games for Man United as possible,\" Collyer said. \"I'll sit down with the manager and higher-ups and see what's the best solution for that. The best way for me to develop, whether it's stay here or go on loan.",
      "\"The end goal for me is to play as many minutes as possible here, hopefully starting every week. So yeah, I'll sit down with them.",
      "\"Obviously, my feeling at this moment is I want to stay. I want to play as many games as possible. I've not really thought that far ahead to be honest. I'll just see how the next few weeks go and then we'll go over those conversations.",
      "\"I'll be able to sit down with them and see what's the best solution for that. But yeah, like you said there as well, obviously there's not a lot of time in football. You need to get the results and get the team progressing. So that's what we're working towards at the minute.\"",
      "Collyer had interest from Brentford and Chelsea before he opted to sign for United in early 2022 and he is under contract at the club until 2027, with the option of an additional year.",
      "Erik ten Hag made a beeline for Collyer after United won the 2024 FA Cup and the Dutchman insisted on attending the midfielder's contract signing ceremony last summer.",
      "Collyer came on for United against City, Liverpool and Arsenal in his first full season at the club, having been an unused substitute on eight occasions in 2023-24.",
      "The academy graduate started the 0-0 draw with Leeds United last week as one of the two playmakers behind striker Chido Obi, a first for Collyer in coach Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "\"I think he's trying out new things,\" Collyer added. \"Obviously he had an idea. I've got quite good legs on the pitch and then I think halfway through me and Amad swapped. It's the manager (who decided that). I'll do whatever he wants me to do.",
      "\"Obviously the manager knows what he's doing. He's got his reason for doing things. Obviously last season, like I said previously, I had quite a few injuries so he could be looking at it that he doesn't want to overcook me in a way like that. So the manager knows what he's doing.\"",

      "Manuel Ugarte is \"optimistic\" about a successful season at Manchester United amid the buoyant mood in the squad.",
      "Ugarte excelled in United's opening tour win against West Ham United in New Jersey on Saturday night in what is his first pre-season with the club.",
      "The 24-year-old joined United from Paris Saint-Germain on transfer deadline day last August for a fee rising to £50.75million and Ugarte is set to have a pivotal role in head coach Ruben Amorim's side this season.",
      "Ugarte played under Amorim at Sporting and the Uruguay international has backed himself to improve on an underwhelming first campaign which ended with him being benched for the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim omitted the five members of United's 'bomb squad' from the tour. Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan but Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia are all still at the club. Ugarte stressed togetherness is fundamental if United are to recover from their worst season in 51 years.",
      "\"Last year we made some changes, we changed our coach, we changed our formation,\" Ugarte said. \"We got to know the Premier League. This year I am good, I am very excited.",
      "\"It is important to perform well in this club, with United. You have to have responsibilities when you play for United. I am very happy and we have to keep going.",
      "\"Without a doubt, I know the rivals, I know the teammates, it is important. Sometimes the connections take time to get to know each other. I already know the league, the rivals, which is important. I am very happy, but we have to keep going.",
      "\"All three players (Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon) who came are very good, good people, good players. It is important that everyone is together in the dressing room and we have to keep going.",
      "\"We are very optimistic because we all work together. We try to be humble day by day, game by game. We will see this season.\"",
      "Ugarte admitted in May that he is copying Casemiro, nine years his senior, as the baton is passed on in the United midfield. Casemiro, 33, has entered the last year of his contract at the club.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo partnered Ugarte for the 2-1 victory over West Ham after the pair lined up together in central midfield only ten times last season. Ugarte is likely to play alongside Mainoo more often amid a lack of options in midfield.",
      "\"Obviously, I talk to Case every day,\" Ugarte added. \"I have a good relationship. About everything, football less, but we talk about everything, life, day to day things. I am very happy because I have a good relationship with him.",
      "\"Kobbie? Also English, he is a young player with a lot of talent. We also talk about younger things, compared to Casemiro, because Casemiro is older. But we all have a good relationship, there is a lot of optimism in the team.",
      "\"I have been talking to Bruno (Fernandes) since before, because he played for Sporting. I have a very good relationship with him. He is a good person and it is important for everyone, for the squad, because he is a great player.",
      "\"Without a doubt, we have to improve things, we have matches to prepare for. We are all very motivated, because we believe in the coach, we believe in what he wants and that is very important.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been on Kobbie Mainoo’s case to increase his “rhythm and pace”. Mainoo was quick to intercept Alphonse Areola’s pass to assist Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes caressed the ball as nonchalantly as David Beckham to put United 2-0 up against West Ham. He could have purely milked the acclaim yet made a beeline for Mainoo.",
      "This was the second time Mainoo walked off the MetLife Stadium pitch to murmurs of approval. As an 18-year-old two years ago, he outshone an Arsenal midfield of Declan Rice and Martin Odegaard. Erik ten Hag did not attend a post-match press conference but paused in the mixed zone to wax lyrical about Mainoo to us journalists.",
      "It was apparent that Ten Hag was preparing Mainoo not for the first team squad but the first team. Cruelly, 80 seconds into the friendly with Real Madrid in Houston the following week, Casemiro fouled Rodrygo, who collided into Mainoo’s ankle and he was sidelined for four months.",
      "Back in the United States for his second pre-season tour, Mainoo’s challenge is to regain his place rather than gain it. It augurs well that Amorim not only picked him from the start against West Ham but played Mainoo in midfield, his natural habitat.",
      "Mainoo has occupied three different roles in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system but it is in his and the team’s interests that he returns to midfield. United have a surfeit of possible No.10s - Matheus Cunha, Bruno Fernandes, Bryan Mbeumo, Amad, Mason Mount, Joshua Zirkzee. They have a shortage of out-and-out central midfielders and Mainoo is one of four.",
      "“I liked Kobbie Mainoo’s game,” Amorim enthused at the MetLife. That was unprompted. He was especially pleased with how Mainoo and the domineering Manuel Ugarte upped the intensity after the drab draw with Leeds United seven days earlier. Both started on the bench in Sweden.",
      "Amorim lamented “the lack of pace” in midfield against Leeds. He picked Fernandes and Casemiro, players with a combined age of 63. That rotational team in Stockholm seemed to be solely about fitness. In New Jersey, United’s starting XI could feasibly line up against Arsenal at Old Trafford on August 17.",
      "\"I spoke about that against Leeds because I felt like everybody in the midfield, the pace was not there,\" Amorim explained. \"Today it was there. Manuel and Kobbie did that job.\"",
      "\"I like the mentality of us today,\" Matthijs de Ligt added. \"High pressing, a lot of intensity.\" Mainoo and Ugarte underpinned that.",
      "Of the outfield players, Mainoo was maybe the least assured of keeping his place. Bryan Mbeumo could muscle his way in, though he will not play until the third tour match against Everton in Atlanta on Sunday. United only have one more friendly - at home to Fiorentina on August 9 - before Arsenal board their train to Manchester Piccadilly.",
      "2024-25 was not a season teeming with highlights for Mainoo but he excelled at Arsenal in the spirited FA Cup third round triumph. Arsenal will likely have Rice and Rodri’s heir, Martin Zubimendi, to pit against United’s midfield axis.",
      "Amorim leaned on Casemiro in the final months of last season, predominantly in the Europa League. Mainoo and Ugarte are better equipped to compete with Rice, Zubimendi and Fernandes’ opposite number, Martin Odegaard.",
      "It has gone quiet on the new contract front for Mainoo. He last scrawled his signature on United papers in February 2023 when he was still a teenager and had made two appearances. The deal was highly incentivised but his profile has expanded vastly since, so much so that Nike made a song-and-dance about his renewal last year, arranging for Mainoo to play in a five-a-side game at Venice Beach. United have to remunerate him.",
      "As much of a wrench as it would be for members of the academy to see Alejandro Garnacho depart after five years, Garnacho hails from Madrid, not Manchester. His arrogance was so apparent in the academy that it was inevitable he would not be a one-club man and one day angle for a return to the land of his birth.",
      "It is different with Mainoo. He is a Mancunian and a boyhood United fan. The era of the one-club is in danger of ending and United is the club that has to rail against that.",
      "It is not pure sentiment to safeguard Mainoo’s future. He was integral to United’s FA Youth Cup and FA Cup successes, two of their highlights this decade. His winner at Wembley is one of the great Cup final goals. Mainoo left Wembley that day looking like a schoolboy on a field trip, with his shirt tucked out and a bucket hat resting on his noggin.",
      "He didn’t stand still. Weeks later, Mainoo transformed England’s midfield in their run to the European Championship final. He would enhance most midfields.",
      "Some supporters will be nervous about Mainoo’s sellable asset status. Midfield is also an area where United want to strengthen, once they have made room. Selling Mainoo is a prospect they cannot entertain and, as insignificant as pre-season matches are, Mainoo’s selection against West Ham was somewhat significant.",
      "Whenever Mainoo started in the second half of last season, it was in domestic matches between European ties. Amorim is evidently willing to compromise now, bringing Mainoo back into the midfield fold, and there is not as much noise around him as there was with Scott McTominay last year. Fulham had submitted two offers for McTominay by late July 2024.",
      "Two years ago, Mainoo’s sudden prominence made United receptive to selling McTominay. The plans changed when Rodrygo ploughed into Mainoo’s ankle. Hopefully, he avoids such misfortune in Chicago.",
      "Then he can continue to perfect his rhythm.",

      "According to Sky Germany, United, alongside Premier League counterparts Newcastle United, are 'currently in talks' about the possibility of luring him to the Premier League before the end of this summer's transfer window.",
      "United are desperate to recruit a centre-forward this summer after finishing each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "They have already bolstered their attack with the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "Signing a reliable striker is essential for United this summer and reports linking them with Sesko have resurfaced once again. The RB Leipzig forward is one of the most exciting strikers in Europe and scored a respectable 21 goals across all competitions last season.",
      "As documented, Newcastle are also said to be interested in signing the Slovenian international, 22, amid the increasing likelihood they will be lose Alexander Isak this summer. The Magpies marksman is currently being heavily linked with Premier League champions Liverpool.",
      "With Newcastle set to be left with no choice to try and find a replacement, it has been claimed Sesko has made his way onto their radar, meaning United have stiff competition to try and secure his signature. Furthermore, Leipzig are yet to have received a formal bid from either club.",
      "Sesko, who was on United's radar in 2022, has been no stranger to transfer speculation in recent months, prompting his agent, Elvis Basanovic, to outline what he and his client will be looking for in a new club.",
      "He said: \"It's not correct to speak about the names of clubs that are interested in Sesko but maybe it is right to clarify a few things. Let me tell you: Sesko is not competing with anyone. It's him vs him every day.",
      "\"We have a clear plan for the future and media speculation doesn't affect us. His numbers at his age are comparable to some strikers with already great careers.",
      "\"That confirms my words. He will move from RB Leipzig only when we recognise a special club. A special project with a special coach.\"",
      "United, this summer, are embarking on what they hope will be a long and successful marriage with head coach Ruben Amorim, meaning they have high hopes the Portuguese chief will oversee a sharp improvement in the coming years.",
      "After attempting to find his feet at Old Trafford last season, following his mid-season appointment, Amorim has essentially been able to start with a clean slate this summer ahead of his first full season at the helm.",

      "Fabrizio Romano shared an update on RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko on Monday. He suggested there is a gentleman's agreement in place between the player and the club.",
      "After signing a new contract with Leipzig last summer, Sesko was reportedly told he would be allowed to leave if a suitable offer came in. That offer is believed to be in the region of £60million or more - a figure that could be within reach for United, provided they are able to offload some of their current players.",
      "Meanwhile, Florian Plettenberg in Germany reported that United remain determined to sign the Slovenian striker. The club has already presented Sesko with their financial proposal and outlined their long-term project.",
      "Sesko is said to be impressed by what United have put forward, but Newcastle United are still in the race and are preparing to make a formal offer of their own.",
      "MEN Sport says: Determination and patience will be essential for United as they work to secure a deal with Leipzig. Although a gentleman's agreement may exist allowing Benjamin Sesko to leave if a suitable offer is made, Leipzig are under no pressure to sell quickly.",
      "The reported £60m price tag underscores the need for United to approach negotiations with composure and strategy, avoiding rash decisions or being dragged into a bidding war.",
      "However, time is still a factor. United will need to act decisively to avoid losing out, especially with Newcastle closely monitoring the situation.",
      "With uncertainty surrounding the future of their leading striker, Alexander Isak, Newcastle are preparing alternative options, and Sesko is high on their list. A swift and calculated move from United could prove vital in winning the race.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Chelsea could still pursue Alejandro Garnacho even if they secure the signing of Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig.",
      "Garnacho is reportedly viewed as potential competition for Jamie Gittens on the left wing should he make the move to Stamford Bridge. However, for any deal to materialise, the Blues would first need to offload Christopher Nkunku to create space.",
      "MEN Sport says: This development could be encouraging news for United, who are looking to streamline their squad under new manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "Garnacho's potential departure, if sanctioned, would help address the club’s need to offload players who may not feature prominently in Amorim’s plans moving forward.",
      "Selling players like Garnacho would not only free up valuable squad space but also generate funds that could be reinvested into strengthening key areas.",

      "Eddie Howe's men are on the hunt for a striker after Alexander Isak told them of his desire to leave last week. Newcastle stress Isak is not for sale and that a move for any striker would be in addition to the Swede but the reality could be a lot different before the window ends.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano provided further details on Newcastle's efforts to sign Sesko on his YouTube channel. He claims that the Magpies are crucially further ahead in the process to sign the forward having already presented their project to him and having prepared a bid which would match RB Leipzig's asking price of between £60.7m and £69.4m.",
      "The Bundesliga club would also like to receive between £4.3m and £8.7m in add-ons from the move. Romano added that United have been asked to be updated with any progress made on Sesko's exit.",
      "It is understood the striker wishes to leave RB Leipzig after they missed out on the Champions League spots last season. While United are unable to offer him that competition and Newcastle are, this may not be a deciding factor in the race for the striker.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window is more than halfway through and still key investments need to be made.",
      "Last week, Ruben Amorim was relatively nonchalant when asked if he would like to add a centre-forward to his team before the big kick off against Arsenal on August 17. \"They [Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha] can play as a striker,\" he told his press conference.",
      "\"We have Josh [Zirkzee], we have Rasmus [Hojlund], so our focus is to improve the connection between them. I don't know if the positions are there for them. They have to work.",
      "\"I think our club in the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player. So if we have to start the season with this squad, I'm happy.\"",
      "Despite Amorim's gracious attempt to bat away speculation surrounding the signing of a centre-forward, there is surely a part of him who dreams for a new striker to join. While Mbeumo and Cunha can both play as the lone striker, the duo would perhaps be better suited to playing deeper in the No.10 roles.",
      "Beyond Zirkzee and Hojlund there is Chido Obi who could start up front but at such a young age, it is doubtful that Amorim would wish to chuck him into the fold with the pressure of being the talisman. As the United boss mentioned, the Reds have to be careful with their spending and ultimately it will be a case of player sales funding a move for a striker.",
      "On that front, Marcus Rashford has already left on loan while Antony and Jadon Sancho currently seem stuck without suitors that United were hoping for. This leaves just one asset left who could change the complexion of United's summer transfer window.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho wants to leave United and that must have been music to the ears of Amorim. The Argentine does not fit into the system and his immature outbursts at the end of last season ruined all hope of reconciliation.",
      "He is also one of the few players who could demand a significant fee as there is undoubtedly a player in there who is itching to come out. The problem is that Garnacho wants to stay in the Premier League which significantly narrows the market for him.",
      "Fortunately, Chelsea could come to the rescue. Despite concerns their pursuit of Xavi Simons could scupper a move for Garnacho, The Telegraph reports that is not necessarily the case with the Blues looking at potentially bringing in the United man to battle on the left with Jamie Gittens.",
      "If this is the case, United could bag themselves a hefty pure profit deal having bought Garnacho for a nominal fee. With that money, Amorim could be allowed to go into the market and spend for a striker with the likes of Randal Kolo Muani, Ollie Watkins, Benjamin Sesko and Dusan Vlahovic all plausible targets once the Garnacho cash clears.",
      "Sadly for United, they are having to play reactively now as they await what others do before making their move. This isn't ideal but Chelsea could save the Reds' summer.",

      "It was on Sunday when Rashford made his first appearance for Barcelona in a friendly match against Vissel Kobe in Japan. Rashford was introduced at half time before being substituted in the 78th minute.",
      "After the game, which Barcelona won 3-1, Rashford took to social media to post a message about his debut. The on-loan United star posted to his 19.4million followers on Instagram several photos from his cameo in Japan, accompanied with the caption: \"First minutes in a Barca shirt! Vamos.\"",
      "The post has since received more than 1.7million likes, including several from United stars past and present. Joshua Zirkzee, Bruno Fernandes, Antony, Diogo Dalot, Tyrell Malacia, Harry Maguire and Rasmus Hojlund all liked the post from Rashford.",
      "Rashford's post also received some likes from former United players, including Juan Mata, David De Gea, Anthony Martial, Donny van de Beek, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Christian Eriksen.",
      "There were some questions after Barca's win over Vissel Kobe as to why Rashford was only on the pitch for 33 minutes. Manager Hansi Flick explained that the on-loan United star's fitness was the reason for Rashford's minutes being managed.",
      "\"He's a week behind the others,\" he said. \"He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him. It was a very good match, a good test for us.\"",

      "Yes, Ruben Amorim's first season in charge won't be judged on a pre-season win over West Ham United during a tour of the USA, but there were plenty of positives to emerge from their outing at the New York Giants' Met Life Stadium.",
      "Their performance would have pleased Amorim and so too would the two-goal contribution from captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Too often United had to rely on the brilliance of their skipper to pull them out of trouble and that was signified by the fact he scored 19 goals and registered 18 assists in one of United's most forgettable seasons for decades.",
      "If United are going to get back to the top, they need their captain to maintain that brilliant form this season. The key is for others to step up with meaningful contributions of their own.",
      "However, it had been though that Fernandes would be used in a deeper central midfield role this season, having largely impressed as one of Amorim's two attacking midfielders in his 3-4-2-1 formation last term.",
      "New signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo had been tipped to take those two roles this season but in the absence of Mbuemo, Fernandes lined up alongside Cunha in a more advanced role.",
      "And he showed his qualities, linking up with the Brazil international well, and offering Amorim some food for thought - particularly given Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo played well together at the base of midfield.",
      "Mbeumo will be introduced to the side in the coming days and weeks and it will be interesting to see what that means for Fernandes.",
      "The Portugal international has always offered versatility in where he is used in midfield and it is hard to imagine United won't team up Mbeumo and Cunha, who scored 37 goals between them last term, in the more advanced midfield roles.",
      "But Fernandes sent a timely reminder of what he can do there and with Mason Mount and Amad also options that can be used in those roles, Amorim suddenly has a number of options at his disposal.",
      "If the deeper Fernandes experiment doesn't work, Amorim won't hesitate to change his plan.",

      "Ruben Amorim made no changes at the break and United started the second half as they did the first. Fernandes should have doubled his tally but was denied by Alphonse Areola, but there was nothing the West Ham goalkeeper could do to stop the United captain doubling his side’s lead with a superb curling effort just minutes later.",

      "\"They also understand that this is not the moment to want to be a star. They are team players at the same time. But it's not just what they give to the team, it's the way they make the feel with their teammates, so they are improving this team in every aspect.\"",
      "Amorim produced that answer during an interview with MUTV ahead of Manchester United's game against West Ham in New Jersey. The clip has gained some traction, but a lot of supporters won't have seen it.",
      "United's head coach is a good communicator. His comments could be taken at face value, but it felt like he was sending a message to the players who have crossed him at Old Trafford.",

      "Building a healthy culture is crucial to building a successful team and Amorim wants the right personalities in his dressing room, which is why Rashford and Garnacho have been kicked out.",
      "Erik ten Hag improved standards during his two-and-a-half-year reign and took on Cristiano Ronaldo. Amorim isn't stupid and has quickly decided Rashford and Garnacho cannot be part of his squad.",

      "Having excelled under United head coach Ruben Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, many believed it was inevitable he would end up reuniting with him in M16.",

      "Having spent more than £120million on Cunha and Mbeumo, United need to raise funds via player sales to continue their recruitment drive. The aforementioned duo are statement signings and United will want a No.9 of the same mould.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap last month, United have been chasing shadows in their striker search. They have been linked with countless names but they are still waiting to make a breakthrough.",
      "If United are to follow the same blueprint in their search for a striker that led them to Mbeumo and Cunha, they are likely to target a goalscorer with Premier League pedigree. However, Premier League proven strikers are not cheap.",

      "If that proves to be the case, they should be setting their sights on Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta. He enjoyed a stellar 2024/25 campaign, scoring 17 goals across all competitions, helping Palace win the FA Cup.",
      "The 28-year-old was one of the best strikers in the Premier League last term, scoring 14 league goals, two of which were scored against United at Old Trafford.",
      "The Frenchman has made solid progress since joining Palace from German club Mainz, initially on loan, four-and-a-half years ago, scoring 46 goals in 152 games. However, he required time to adapt, so much so it was not until the 2023/24 campaign that he started to consistently show his class.",
      "Scoring 19 times in 2023/24, Mateta has scored 36 goals in the last two seasons for Palace. Of those 36 goals, 30 were plundered in the Premier League, meaning he has an established record in England's top flight.",
      "Mateta ticks plenty of boxes. He is a defender's worst nightmare, both with the ball at his feet and in the air.",
      "After Palace triggered the 12-month option in his contract last December to extend his stay at Selhurst Park until June 2027, they have ensured they have protected his value. His deal was originally due to expire next June.",
      "Despite that, Palace may be mindful that this summer could represent their last chance to get the best possible price for their chief goal-getter.",
      "If they fail to tie him down to a new deal within the next 12 months, clubs will try and land him for a cut-price fee next summer amid the fact he will have just one year left on his contract.",
      "Palace will be accounting for plenty of factors this summer, and keeping Mateta will be a priority for them. He is their main striker and losing him would be a massive blow.",
      "But as United have demonstrated with the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo, they still have plenty of pulling power. Palace's demotion to the Europa Conference League from the Europa League could also play into United's hands.",
      "There is no denying Mateta will cost a hefty fee this summer, but Palace might be prepared to negotiate amid the possibility their grip on his future this time next year could be weaker.",

      "20) Farid El Melali (Angers)\nAlgerian international winger who has previously been arrested (twice) for masturbating in public. A real catch.",
      "",
      "19) Christian Eriksen (Manchester United)\nThree years at Manchester United are over.",

      "18) Hakim Ziyech (Al-Duhail)\nAfter six miserable months at Galatasaray and six months in Qatar, the former Chelsea winger is available again.",
      "",
      "17) Luka Jovic (AC Milan)\nSix years after becoming a £50m-plus Real Madrid striker, the Serb is available for nothing after another poor season.",
      "",
      "16) Davide Calabria (AC Milan)\nFormer Milan captain – last seen on loan at Bologna – who is attracting interest from Crystal Palace among others.",
      "",
      "15) Vladimir Coufal (West Ham)\nEverton, Leeds and Wolves are among the clubs linked to the Czech right-back.",
      "",
      "14) Josh Dasilva (Brentford)\nStill recovering from a significant knee injury; he will continue his rehab at the club.",
      "",
      "13) Sergio Reguilon (Tottenham)\nSpanish left-back leaves Spurs after playing barely 300 minutes of football last season.",
      "",
      "12) Danny Ings (West Ham)\nThere have been strong links with Wrexham but he looks good in claret and blue, and Burnley need a striker.",
      "",
      "11) Nicolas Tagliafico (Lyon)\nThere is a lot of interest in the Argentine left-back, both in the Premier League and abroad.",
      "",
      "10) Abdoulaye Doucoure (Everton)\nAfter five years at Goodison Park, Doucoure has left and will not represent Everton at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.",
      "",
      "9) Abdel Abqar (Alaves)\nMoroccan centre-half ends his spell with the Spanish club.",

      "",
      "1) Takehiro Tomiyasu (Arsenal)\n“Unfortunately, injuries have limited Tomi’s time on the pitch in the past two seasons, with the defender making just one substitute appearance last season. It was therefore mutually agreed to end Tomi’s contract in order for him to start a new chapter in his career,” said Arsenal. His ongoing knee injury means he could be on this list for a while.",

      "Isak is said to be ‘furious’ with Newcastle and has even been accused of ‘starting to check out’ towards the end of last season.",
      "It is thought that Liverpool will ramp up their attempts to procure the Swede from St James’ Park once the clever sale of Luis Diaz to Bayern Munich has been sanctioned.",
      "Newcastle remain steadfast in their desire to keep Isak but his omission from the squad for their pre-season tour of the Far East was a significant moment in the summer-long saga, the first meaningful weakening of the Magpies’ position.",
      "But Liverpool will still have to make it worth the hassle with a momentous and likely record-breaking financial package – certainly the biggest ever between two Premier League clubs at the very least.",
      "That would grant Newcastle a far bigger budget to reinvest across a Champions League squad which has only had Anthony Elanga added this summer due to an increasingly humorous list of rejections from top targets.",
      "Such money can be as much a blessing as it is a curse, as these eclectic examples show. The biggest Premier League sales ever, and what those fees were subsequently spent on, are below.",

      "An awkwardly-timed transfer ban prevented Chelsea from properly investing their Hazard money back into the squad immediately, although by the time Frank Lampard was given access to those funds a year later, the hit-rate was sub-optimal at best.",
      "That Hazard deal really was ridiculous; Chelsea were still receiving add-on payments when he was retired and well over a year after his last professional game.",

      "Liverpool put on an absolute transfer masterclass in 2018, extracting daft money from Barcelona for an excellent but expendable Coutinho and still managing to arguably underpay for four of their next five signings despite the selling clubs knowing they had a boosted budget.",
      "A world-record fee for Van Dijk was immediately offset and the Dutchman helped take them to the Champions League final within a matter of months; Fabinho, Alisson and even Shaqiri joined in the summer and played crucial roles in their European coronation and Premier League success.",

      "Once the dust settled following Liverpool and Chelsea’s embarrassing transfer stand-off of summer 2023, the winner was ultimately Brighton. It usually is.",
      "Caicedo had reached his peak value with the Seagulls and there were buyers whose funds were matched only by their desperation to sign a Premier League midfield panacea.",
      "Long before the money landed in their bank account, Brighton had popped Paul Barber’s laptop open to sign Caicedo’s replacement in Baleba, their future first-choice keeper in Verbruggen and a player they would sell for almost twice as much a couple of years later in Pedro.",
      "Igor was one of those few speculative moves which do not pay off but in general Brighton absorbed another substantial sale on their terms like only they can.",

      "And while the signings of Alvarez, Ward-Prowse and Kudus felt exciting and filled a great many of the voids left behind by their captain and talisman, West Ham have sold one and would be open to offloading the other two a couple of years later.",

      "Total: £88m",
      "“It was never our intention to replace Jack with one footballer; our strategy was to analyse and break down Jack’s key attributes – his creativity, his assists and goals – and find those qualities and others in three forward players,” said chief executive Christian Purslow.",
      "But even the combined efforts of Buendia, Bailey and Ings – the latter being one of the great transfers that came out of absolutely nowhere – summarily failed to replicate the impact and importance of the departed Villa captain.",
      "",

      "After scoring 280 goals in 435 appearances across nine full trophyless seasons, the last of which saw him net 30 times for a Spurs side which finished 8th and sacked two managers, Kane was finally granted his release by Daniel Levy.",
      "The emergence of a rich European suitor who could take Kane as far away as possible so as to not inflict any damage on his boyhood club was the deal-breaker as Spurs finally stepped aside to let their record scorer go.",
      "It was a necessary part of the great Ange Postecoglou rebuild, with more than twice the possible final Kane fee chucked back into a squad in dire need of reinforcements across the board.",
      "Spurs finished 5th to qualify for a Europa League they would win and, so far in summer 2025, squander to hilarious and predictable levels.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Gareth Bale – £85.3m",

      "Daniel Levy tried to counter the swollen valuations clubs face when trying to spend huge transfer windfalls, splashing all of the Bale money on The Magnificent Seven before the Welshman had even completed his move to Real Madrid.",
      "It did not work all that well, with Eriksen the only unqualified success and “massive arguments” behind the scenes leading to the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m",
      "Antonio Valencia – £16m\nMichael Owen – free\nGabriel Obertan – £3m\nMame Biram Diouf – £4.5m",
      "Total: £23.5m",
      "“The money is there if I want to use it. The money was there in the summer if I wanted to use it,” said Sir Alex Ferguson in December 2009, desperately trying to shield those frugal Glazers by later adding: “I have no criticism of the owners over money because none is justified. They’ve given me £20m for three players already.”",
      "Thank you so much for my brand new Gabriel Obertan, glorious overlords.",
      "The Manchester United manager had targeted Karim Benzema and Franck Ribery to help replace Ronaldo before settling for Owen and complaining that “the prices we were quoted for players were not reasonable” in a market that was “inflated” by Real Madrid and Manchester City’s thriftlessness.",

      "James Justin – £8m\nAyoze Perez – £30m\nYouri Tielemans – £40m\nGeorge Hirst – £1m\nDennis Praet – £18m",
      "Total: £97m",
      "After squeezing what remains a record fee out of Manchester United, Leicester spread their jackpot across every area of their squad to mixed results. The Foxes built on consecutive finishes of 9th with Maguire in the side to produce back-to-back Champions League qualification challenges without him, ultimately coming 5th both times.",

      "Total: £19.2m/£70.2m",
      "Southampton put on a clinic on how not to redistribute a substantial transfer fee in the January 2018 window, making Guido Carrillo (no goals in 10 games) their record signing as they bid farewell to Van Dijk.",
      "The subsequent summer was slightly better but even then their best addition was a loanee from Liverpool, who presumably felt a little guilty.",
      "",
      "Everton: Romelu Lukaku – £75m",

      "Total £133.8m",
      "Everton are still feeling the financial effects of their resounding transfer incompetence in the 2017/18 season, when their reaction to selling a guaranteed 20-goal-a-season striker was to bring in loads of No.10s to create chances for a centre-forward they no longer had.",
      "Mind you, signing Cenk Tosun for £27.5m in January hardly helped.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Luis Suarez – £75m",

      "Total: £117m",
      "“Look at Tottenham. If you spend more than £100million, you expect to be challenging for the league,” is perhaps the single most disastrous sentence ever uttered by an eminently quotable Premier League manager.",
      "An attempt to shift the increasing focus and pressure on Liverpool not only backfired immediately – their title hopes imploded in that game against Chelsea two days later – but it created an unnecessary rod for the club’s back which sat uncomfortably all summer.",
      "As poorly as Tottenham executed their post-Bale spend, Liverpool’s effort to improve their squad with the Suarez money a year later was risible.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Romelu Lukaku – £74m",
      "Daniel James – £15m\nAaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m\nHarry Maguire – £80m",
      "Total: £140m",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer decided he needed a young, hungry, British core when given the permanent Manchester United reins, which is hardly surprising when he built much of his early managerial ethos around the Class of ’92 and Nou Camp-based corners because original thought is for nerds.",
      "The mere thought of a Sean Longstaff-Scott McTominay central midfield was enough to drive supporters to the point of impotent fury in 2019; by 2025 the former is the secret to survival for Leeds and the latter is Naples royalty.",
      "",
      "Leicester: Wesley Fofana – £70m",
      "Alex Smithies – free\nWout Faes – £15m",
      "Victor Kristiansen – £13.1m\nTete – loan\nHarry Souttar – £15m",
      "Total: £15m/£43.1m",
      "A combination of Chelsea playing summer-long silly beggars over Fofana and Leicester tightening the purse strings to uncomfortable levels restricted the Foxes to a dismal and faintly depressing summer window which not even additional investment in the winter could salvage. The foundations for relegation were established."

      "Benjamin Sesko is ‘impressed’ by Manchester United’s ‘efforts’ to sign him ahead of Newcastle this summer as RB Leipzig’s asking price has been revealed.",
      "Sesko is open to leaving the Bundesliga side this summer after they failed to qualify for the Champions League and after Arsenal plumped for Viktor Gyokeres despite interest in the Slovenian, Newcastle and Manchester United are now vying for his signature.",
      "United want a new striker after both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee failed to impress last season, while the Magpies are looking for a replacement for Liverpool-bound Alexander Isak after the Sweden international dropped his bombshell desire to leave the club on Thursday.",
      "After reporting that Newcastle had ‘opened’ talks with RB Leipzig over a deal for Sesko last week, journalist Nicola Schira claimed on Sunday evening that the Magpies have ‘an agreement in principle’ with the Slovenia striker.",
      "Schira wrote on X: ‘Benjamin Sesko has an agreement in principle with Newcastle for a contract until 2030. NUFC are now working to reach a deal with Leipzig.’",
      "But German journalist Guido Schafer insists that Sesko has given his preference to join United over Newcastle this summer, and Romano said on his YouTube channel on Monday that the Red Devils are ‘starting to move’ for the striker, with ‘concrete conversations’ being held over his transfer.",
      "He said: “For Sesko, Newcastle are ready to make something big but don’t forget also Man United. Man United have been discussing internally for days about strikers – Ollie Watkins but Aston Villa insist on keeping the player…Sesko but obviously financially it is not an easy deal.",
      "“But Man United also in the recent hours on Sunday night, on Monday morning made new contacts with Sesko’s camp. Not directly with the player, but with agents of the player to start conversations about eventual numbers, the contract, the project, the vision.",
      "“So Man United are starting to move, Newcastle have already presented their project and are prepared to match the financial request. So Newcastle are ready to make a very important proposal to Sesko and Leipzig. Man United have started the concrete conversation while they discussed his name internally for weeks.”",
      "And now Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg claims Sesko is ‘impressed by Man United’s efforts to sign him’.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Manchester United are not giving up on Benjamin #Sesko. As revealed today, #MUFC have presented the player with clear figures and their project. Sesko is impressed by Man United’s efforts to sign him.",
      "‘However: Newcastle are fully in the race and not backing down. An offer is ready to be submitted at any time. Leipzig are now demanding at least €80 million.’",
      "United boss Amorim insists any player who joins the club this summer will need to be fully invested in his project.",
      "He told the club’s media channels: “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already. Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it’s an important time in our club.”",
      "Man Utd have now made a ‘concrete’ ‘move’ to beat Newcastle to Sesko, according to Fabrizio Romano, with an ‘agreement in principle’ struck for the RB Leipzig striker.",
      "Man Utd face a potential knockout blow in the race to sign Benjamin Sesko as Newcastle are the ‘most serious’ contenders, according to reports.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has decided between a move to Man Utd or Newcastle as an ‘agreement in principle’ has been reached, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are set to discuss a potential deal to sign Benjamin Sesko in a meeting with Ruben Amorim next week, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Newcastle have ‘offered’ potential Alexander Isak replacement Benjamin Sesko an ‘important salary’ to convince him to leave Leipzig, according to reports.",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Raheem Sterling – Chelsea to Napoli\nChelsea have been very clear that Sterling has no future at Stamford Bridge, so Napoli’s interest should excite the winger if it is true that he would prefer to swerve Saudi or MLS for now to remain in Europe. The Serie A champions remain intent on signing Dan Ndoye from Bologna but if Forest win that race then Antonio Conte is quite willing to sanction a move for Sterling. Jack Grealish is also a possibility for Napoli.",

      "",
      "19) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nNo sooner had we reports of renewed interest from United in Watkins did we have the rebuttal from Villa. The England striker is considered by the Villans as ‘not for sale’. Which is what anyone looking to sell for top dollar would say at first. Watkins is valued at £60million by Villa. United would doubtless seek to negotiate down from there but we’re struggling to see where the two clubs find common ground here if this was a deal done in isolation.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike.",
      "",
      "17) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, reaffirming somewhat that the winger has a higher opinion of himself than most others do. Chelsea and Spurs have been linked but it has always been tentative. The noise has been building around Villa’s interest in Garnacho, but like United’s view on Watkins, they can’t pay the amount requested. With all the accounting sorcery prompted by PSR, we’re sure there’s a workaround here that leaves everyone happy.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nThe unfortunate Wissa news means Newcastle are now looking at Chelsea striker Jackson, who can leave this summer after the additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The Toon Army won’t be thrilled, but 24 goals and 10 assists in 65 Premier League matches isn’t *that* bad. Nothing on Isak, mind…",
      "",
      "",
      "14) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "13) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "12) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "11) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted.",
      "",
      "10) 🆕 Sam Johnstone – Wolves to Burnley\nWith James Trafford returning to Manchester City, Burnley are in the market for a keeper despite already having signed one. It seems they want to take Johnstone from Wolves’ bench to compete for their no.1 spot, and Wolves are quite happy to facilitate either a loan switch or a permanent deal for around £8million.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments…",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "7)🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle are trying to fight what feels like the inevitable and we should see something in the way of an offer from Liverpool this week. We can be almost certain the first bid will fail, but when the player is as keen to move as Isak reportedly is, the Toon are fighting the tide. The Swede just needs to hope that Liverpool’s desire matches his own.",
      "6) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, who is waiting for a Premier League club to spare him once again from playing in the Championship.",
      "",
      "5)🔼 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms agreed and the two clubs close to a compromise that will see Chelsea pay over £35million for the teenager. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nThis looked ot be off when Erik ten Hag said he could not afford to lose any more players this summer. But someone at Leverkusen has overruled the new coach by agreeing a £13million deal with Sunderland, who could pay another £4million in add-ons. Xhaka, who stated early his preference for Sunderland over Saudi, has been given permission to head to Wearside for a medical.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Joao Felix – Chelsea to Saudi\nChelsea, owned by Clearlake Capital with whom PIF have billions invested, are selling a player we’d almost all forgotten still plays for them to Al-Nassr for around £44million. That’s convenient for everyone, isn’t it? Unsurprisingly, this is going through quickly, with Felix already in Saudi.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nThe Colombian is spending most of his Monday in transit between Asia and Bavaria where he will undergo a medical after a fee of £65million was agreed. There’s half the Isak money…",
      "",
      "1) 🔼James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nPoor Newcastle. They are having a shocker, and City haven’t helped. Newcastle took forever to finally agree a deal with Burnley for the England goalkeeper, only for City to exercise their option to match any offer. Trafford will re-join City for £27million to compete with Ederson. Who, no doubt, is delighted at the prospect. A medical is due to begin on Monday.",

While there was the signing of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest, the Magpies failed to secure Ekitike, who were overtaken by Liverpool , who are now targeting their own striker Alexander Isak. They also saw Manchester City overtake them on goalkeeper James Trafford.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a ‘transfer decision’ on signing Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson with two reasons given for their verdict.",
      "The Red Devils are crying out for a new striker after Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee only scored seven Premier League goals combined in 2024/25.",
      "However, Man Utd have already missed out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres amid their financial difficulties and failure to qualify for Europe ahead of next season.",
      "These disappointments have forced United to turn to potential alternatives and Jackson has been mentioned as an option. It has been claimed that Chelsea could cash in on the forward, who is likely to be behind Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in the pecking order if he stays at Stamford Bridge.",
      "A report from Football Insider claims Chelsea want as much as £80m for Jackson this summer, with former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown claiming the striker’s “temperament” and United’s ability to get “better players for the money” are the two reasons for INEOS’ ‘transfer decision’ on this potential signing.",
      "“No, I wouldn’t expect that one to happen,” Brown told Football Insider.",
      "READ: Sesko ‘agreement in principle’ struck as striker chooses between Man Utd and Newcastle",
      "“I would be very, very surprised if Man United signed Jackson. There are concerns about his temperament and the mental side of his game, and I don’t think he’s consistent enough on the pitch to overrule those concerns.",
      "“If Chelsea are looking to get rid of him, that tells you whether he’s good enough for United.",
      "“I don’t think he’s the type of striker they need, and they’ll be looking at their other options. Especially when you consider the price it would take to get him out of Chelsea.",
      "“I expect he’s on a long contract there like all of his teammates, so they’re not going to let him go on the cheap, and definitely not to Man United.",
      "“For the money it would take to get him, there are better players they could bring in. He hasn’t done anything at Chelsea that would make him the ideal man for United.”",
      "Former Premier League winger Jermaine Pennant also claims Man Utd should look past Jackson, who would suit a move to Brighton.",
      "“I’m not sure if Nicolas Jackson is the man for a top team as we’ve seen during his time at Chelsea. It’s an interesting one to see where he goes if he leaves the club. He’s in the Darwin Nunez bracket for me – he gets loads of chances, but he isn’t prolific,” Pennant said.",
      "“If I were him, I’d look a little below that level – someone like Brighton. I think that could work because he’d do well there – they should be looking at him.",
      "“Manchester United are linked but I’m not too sure that’s the right move for the club – it could be another Rasmus Hojlund situation. He obviously believes in himself and thinks he should be at a top team, but I can’t see him being the number one for a top six side.”",
      "According to reports, Chelsea have submitted a ‘sensational swap offer’ to Premier League rivals Aston Villa as they eye England star Morgan Rogers.",

      "“We have ridden our luck, but I don’t think we were lucky.”",
      "It’s quite hard, we imagine based on absolutely no personal experience whatsoever, to speak with any great eloquence in the immediate aftermath of achieving something absurdly enormous. But we reckon Leah Williamson has come up with something quite wonderful here after England’s Euro 2025 triumph.",
      "Williamson, who genuinely might already have been the most Spoke Well, I Thought figure in women’s football, repeated the trick later in the same interview with a similar bait-and-switch: “Total disbelief, but at the same time I knew it was going to happen.”",
      "Both those statements appear to contain an unsolvable paradox, yet both in fact contain an essential truth about football, sport and – if you want to be a truly insufferable tagnut of a wanker about it – life itself.",
      "That second quote is really just a variation on the classic ‘name on the cup’ trope. Very obviously, no team’s name is ever on the cup. There is no such thing as destiny. No tournament is pre-ordained. But that doesn’t mean that the feeling of it being so is of no value or consequence.",
      "It can become self-fulfilling. It seems perfectly accurate to say that a huge part of England somehow winning this tournament boils down to England simply believing – knowing, on some level – they would do so. The sheer refusal to accept defeat is a huge part of the reason a team that led for one minute of the 360 minutes of knockout football they played in Switzerland was able to walk away with the prize.",
      "It’s that quote about luck that really grabbed us, though. We’d never really given much thought to the semantic difference between a team having luck and a team riding their luck. But when Williamson said it, we had some kind of eureka moment. Because it’s exactly and entirely correct.",
      "If you’re the sort of person who goes through life without a tinfoil hat on your head, then even giving a moment’s cursory thought to the idea of some teams or some players being intrinsically luckier than others is palpably absurd. It’s just such a childish notion when you think about it at all.",
      "Which is not at all to say luck does not exist, or play a large part in football. Of course it does. But it’s not ever what matters, not really, not by itself. And it’s not really what we’re saying, if we’re all honest with ourselves, when we say a team is ‘lucky’.",
      "Sheer dumb luck is probably more of a factor in sport (and, again, everything else) than any of us would care to admit. But the point isn’t that you had good luck; it’s that you capitalised upon it.",
      "England rode their luck in Switzerland. Again and again. To an almost ludicrous extreme. But what they did with that luck is what counts, what separates them from the rest.",
      "England’s desire, heart, determination, bottle, skill, talent and everything else helped them take the bits of luck that went their way and extract the absolute maximum possible. And like Williamson, we’re not at all prepared to write that off as just an accident. As itself just more good luck.",
      "And once you start down this road, you realise that distinction Williams draws between ‘luck’ and ‘riding your luck’ explains almost everything. There’s hints here of the classic ‘the more I practise, the luckier I get’.",
      "It’s about positioning yourself to be able to capitalise on those moments of fortune that come your way. To be remembered as a lucky side is really just to be remembered as one that made the most of that good fortune.",
      "Who remembers the lucky side that finished third? Absolutely nobody. Nobody is remembering lucky also-rans. Everyone remembers the lucky winners.",
      "When Manchester United were winning every trophy in sight under Sir Alex Ferguson, you’d hear this all the time. Lucky United. Another decision going their way.",
      "But while there may well be plenty of validity in the idea that United and big clubs in general get more decisions, what United under Ferguson were indisputably the best at was making any such good fortune count. Riding that luck.",
      "You see it still, now, with the more out-there of Online Arsenal Fans and their conspiracy-addled nudge-nudge wink-wink asides about the decisions that have gone Manchester City’s way, or Liverpool’s way, or PSG’s way or whatever.",
      "But of course those teams had luck go their way. You know which teams have a bit of luck going their way sometimes? All the teams. Absolutely every one of them. But one fairly obvious difference between the teams that win and the teams that finish second again is that the teams that win have made those moments of good fortune count more often.",
      "We’d suggest that the idea of a team being ‘lucky’ is rarely made in good faith, that whatever – if any – evidence that purports to support the position has been cherrypicked or manipulated. It is, by definition a glib and simplistic narrative designed not just to denigrate the target but to absolve you or your team from responsibility.",
      "It was the referees. It was that ricochet. It was that deflection. It was the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself. It was luck. It was, therefore, Not Our Fault. Being expected to compete against the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself is even more absurd than expecting a team to compete with 115 Charges FC.",
      "But Williamson has got to the heart of it. The lucky teams aren’t the ones that have more luck; they are the ones who make damn sure they make that luck more significant, more memorable. The ones that make it count for something.",
      "Maybe it is better to be lucky than good, but any amount of the former will get you nowhere without a healthy dose of the latter."

      "Diogo Costa\nManchester United have been linked with Portugal international keeper Costa before but Newcastle and Manchester City have both been mentioned as their staring contest with Burnley over James Trafford continues.",
      "It doesn’t feel like Porto will hold out for the full £51.9m.",
      "",
      "Aaron Ramsdale\nAfter suffering his third Premier League relegation in six seasons, all at different clubs and with a spell at Arsenal in between, England international Ramsdale can thank the £25m clause he inserted into his contract for the fact he’ll probably be back in the top flight soon enough.",
      "But Leeds, West Ham and a handful of others are yet to act on their interest, perhaps because of his wage demands and obvious curse.",
      "",
      "Edmond Tapsoba\nNewcastle are said to have offered £50m for Bayer Leverkusen defender Tapsoba; it is unknown whether or not they realise it might take as much as £80m.",
      "",
      "Castello Lukeba\nAn eclectic cast of Liverpool, Spurs and Bayern Munich have been mentioned in discussions over Lukeba’s future, with a suggestion that Leipzig might not necessarily hold out for the French centre-half’s entire £77.8m release clause.",
      "",
      "Ousmane Diomande\nCrystal Palace have already identified their replacement for Marc Guehi, whether the captain leaves this summer or not. But they will not be paying £69.1m for the Sporting centre-half if they do sign him.",
      "",
      "Miguel Gutierrez\nA whole host of clubs like the look of Girona left-back Gutierrez at £30.2m – he was once described as a ‘priority signing’ for Liverpool and Manchester United are known to be lurking – but any hopeful negotiators will have to deal with about 427 clauses Real Madrid still hold over him.",

Osimhen should be top of the Manchester United shopping list.",

      "“That front three if you played Ollie Watkins, [Bryan] Mbeumo, [Matheus] Cunha and you can mix that in with Amad, [Mason] Mount, whoever, that’s a hard day’s work for opposing defence on most days.”",

      "Andre Onana: Sell\nManchester United are reportedly open to selling Onana after another unconvincing campaign, but the Cameroonian wants to stay. Why wouldn’t he? He’s under contract at a Premier League club for another three years, earns £200,000 a week, and is 30 next year. Sure, he could get a fat(ter) wage in the Middle East, but he’s comfortable and knows there’s no chance he’ll lose his spot in goal if he stays.",
      "The Red Devils have bigger priorities with a smaller budget than desired and need to sell attackers before buying a new striker, unless they cheap out and go for Jamie Vardy or Dominic Calvert-Lewin. As alluded to, they’d need to sell Onana to sign a new goalkeeper, which would be the ideal scenario, because the ex-Ajax ‘keeper hasn’t been good enough.",

      "",
      "Diogo Dalot: Keep\nDalot’s versatility makes him an important player. He can play on either side and as one of Ruben Amorim’s three centre-backs. Despite being unconvincing so far under his compatriot, we don’t think it’s right to sell the Portugal defender.",
      "",
      "Matthijs de Ligt: Keep\nDe Ligt was fairly consistent in his first year at Old Trafford. There were a few blunders, but all in all, he’s been decent.",

      "",
      "Tyler Fredricson: Loan\nWith no European football to contend with, Amorim might want to loan out a few of his promising young players, including Fredricson. The 20-year-old defender played twice in the Premier League last term, with both matches three days after Thursday evening Europa League ties.",
      "",
      "Ayden Heaven: Keep\nLoaning Heaven wouldn’t be a bad idea, but his performances in a dysfunctional United team have been very promising. He didn’t play too often, but when he did, he arguably looked the most confident and talented player in Amorim’s defence. He could contribute next season, for sure.",

      "Harry Maguire: Keep\nTruthfully, Maguire suits a back three well. He might earn a colossal £190,000 a week and be out of contract next year, but the lack of potential takers means losing him for nothing next year might be the way to go.",

      "Harry Amass: Loan\nKeeping Amass wouldn’t be the worst idea, especially if Shaw leaves, but a year of consistent first-team football could be huge for him. He’s a top talent and has the potential to be one of Europe’s leading wing-backs. United have to get his development right. So, in other words, he’s the next Brandon Williams.",

      "The Real Madrid legend was brilliant in his first season at Old Trafford, but his form took an almighty nose-dive at the beginning of 2023/24, which he didn’t really recover from until Amorim’s arrival last winter. He has been fine playing central midfield in the 3-4-2-1 system, but it’s still painfully obvious that United need to sell him.",

      "Toby Collyer: Loan\nThere are not enough minutes available for young Collyer with no European football for United, so a loan makes sense.",
      "",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Keep\nThe captain carried United through the majority of last season. Without Bruno, there would have been no Europa League final run, and relegation might have been a real concern – if the bottom three hadn’t been so shockingly poor.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Keep\nUnited could alleviate some PSR concerns by selling Mainoo, and Chelsea and Spurs are two of the clubs linked with the 20-year-old England midfielder. It’s just not a good idea to sell him, though, is it?",
      "He’s one of the best players to come through the club’s youth academy in recent years and despite being off the pace for much of last season, he can be a brilliant player now and world-class in the future.",

      "Mason Mount: Keep\nClearly a very talented player, Mount’s career has been hampered by injuries, which have limited him to 19 starts for United in two years at the club.",
      "We reckon it’s a case of last-chance saloon at United for the 26-year-old. If he can prove his fitness and ability in 2025/26, then great. If not, next summer will be the time to cut ties.",
      "",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Keep\nUgarte hasn’t lived up to his £51m transfer fee yet, but he’s someone Amorim knows how to get the best out of. He’ll be better this season.",
      "",
      "Jadon Sancho: Sell\nThe first of seven attackers, Sancho is surplus to requirements after an average year on loan at Premier League rivals Chelsea. The Blues could’ve signed him permanently for £25m but preferred to pay a £5m penalty fee to send the 25-year-old back to Manchester.",
      "He returns to a team managed by Amorim, not Ten Hag, with whom he publicly fell out, but a change in manager isn’t enough to save his United career. Sancho’s best position might be in one of the wide 10 roles behind the striker, but it’s unlikely that he’ll get the chance to prove it.",
      "Juventus are the club most keen on signing Sancho this summer, but the winger’s salary is proving to be a huge stumbling block. There’s no doubt that he needs to take a wage cut if he wants to play regularly for any team in 2025/26.",

      "Antony: Sell\nDespite an outstanding six months on loan at Europa Conference League runners-up Real Betis, Antony doesn’t have a future at Old Trafford and is one of four currently ostracised as the club’s hierarchy desperately tries to sell them.",
      "His time in Spain was fruitful for him and United, who are delighted that the winger’s value has risen from around £15m to at least double that. Selling an £80m signing for £30m will be painful, but that’s still a helpful fee as the club’s centre-forward search goes on.",
      "",
      "Amad Diallo: Keep\nAnother rare bright spark in a rubbish United team last term.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho: Sell\nThe fourth and final ostracised player, Garnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and reportedly has interest from Aston Villa and obviously Chelsea. United want a huge £60m for the Argentine, which is wildly unrealistic. Regardless, head coach Amorim says the club will stand firm with their valuation, and if he isn’t sold, he’ll be welcomed back into the first team. Sure he will.",
      "Whatever the Red Devils receive for Garnacho will be deemed pure profit, which has become highly valued under current PSR rules. Despite what Amorim has said, we can see the 21-year-old leaving for closer to £45m at the end of August.",
      "",
      "Rasmus Hojlund: Loan\nTricky one, this. Loaning or selling Hojlund only makes sense if there’s enough time to sign a replacement after his departure, or if one has already been brought in.",
      "After a stellar 2022/23 campaign at Atalanta, there is interest from Serie A this summer, namely from Inter, who currently have Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram as their starting strikers.",
      "A buy option would surely be included in any deal, with an obligation unlikely unless it’s for a huge fee, like, say, £50m. After four Premier League goals last term, that’s never going to happen.",
      "He’s only 22, so selling now might come back to bite United on the arse. Giving him fresh surroundings for a year while Amorim and Ratcliffe try to clean an almighty mess could be perfect for Hojlund, who desperately needs confidence and a chance to prove he’s good enough to be United’s long-term No.9.",
      "",
      "Chido Obi: Keep\nThe lack of striker depth means Obi should stick around and get the occasional first-team opportunity.",

      "In fairness to the Dutchman, he’s slowly but surely improved after a poor start to life in England, with the pace of the league all a bit too much for him.",

      "9) Sunderland – £100.43m\nFive first-team signings have come in to no little cost. And the Black Cats are not finished.",
      "",
      "8) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "",
      "7) Manchester City – £126.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan and a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £132.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Atletico Madrid – £135m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "4) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

If they don't reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand other clubs are maybe waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise.",
      "\"I'm ready to receive the players. They have more competition. If they want to play in the World Cup, they need to play. I'm happy with that because I'll have more options. If they have to fight each other to play, for me it's perfect.\"",

      "\"At the moment, we need to be really careful when we sign a player,\" said Amorim. \"If we have to start the season with this squad, then I'm happy because all the players want to be here. That is the most important thing.",
      "\"With Bryan and Matheus, we are clearly a better team.\"",
      "United have always been in the market for a striker, but their focus is on player sales.",

      "\"I'm really pleased. They are really humble, that is really important, and they chose to be here. They had other options, Champions League options, they read everything people say about our club, but they chose to be here. That is a key point for me.\"",

      "Rashford will wear the No 14 shirt, which has been worn by many Barcelona greats in the past - including Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman, Thierry Henry and Javier Mascherano.",

      "Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.",
      "The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.",
      "LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.",

      "Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.",
      "England international Rashford had publicly said he would like to play for the Catalans this summer and had been interested in a move to the LaLiga champions in January, before joining Aston Villa on loan.",
      "Rashford's move is understood to have been given the green light by Barca head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.",

      "Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.",
      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",

      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",

      "\"I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.",
      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",
      "\"To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.",
      "\"I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.\"",
      "As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.",
      "Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.",
      "There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.",
      "And that's how it turned out.",
      "The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.",
      "When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.",

He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",

      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",

      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Picture courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",

      "Courtesy of Lisa Heaven",
      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."
