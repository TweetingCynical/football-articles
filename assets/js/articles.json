      "Alejandro Garnacho has been forced to play a substitute role in Man United's first two games this season and thought he had put his side ahead against Brighton - only to see his effort chalked off for offside",
      "Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho insisted \"God has something planned for me\" in a cryptic post after being left out of the starting XI by Erik ten Hag once again in their 2-1 loss to Brighton.",
      "The Argentine has been forced to play a substitute role in both of United's first two games this season, playing the final 30 minutes against Fulham and the Seagulls - assisting Joshua Zirkzee's late winner against the former at Old Trafford.",
      "But his late salvo wasn't enough to give him a starting spot against Brighton and he was unable to affect the game before Joao Pedro nodded in a dramatic header for Fabian Hurzeler's side in stoppage time.",
      "Earlier in the game Garnacho did think he had put the Red Devils ahead in the 69th minute - moments after coming on - when he tapped home from Bruno Fernandes' ball across the face of goal, but in a strange turn of events the goal was chalked off for offside after Zirkzee got in the way of the shot as it crossed the line.",
      "Garnacho was clearly devastated and couldn't hide his frustrations after the game - having been snubbed by Ten Hag then agonisingly having the goal taken away from him as he posted a message on social media platform X.",
      "Posting a picture of himself celebrating his offside goal against Brighton, he wrote: \"God has something planned for me, trust the process.\"",
      "Before the game, Ten Hag had spoken out about Garnacho's potential after being asked by a journalist if he thought the player was \"world class\".",
      "\"You have gone very quickly,\" Ten Hag responded. \"World-class is something where he has to go a long way. He has a high potential, 100 per cent. But last season he contributed and he can be a starting-XI player.",
      "\"It starts with hard work. That has brought him to where he is now and that will bring him to being a world-class player because I agree he has the potential.\"",
      "The Dutchman urged him to \"show\" he deserves more starts, insisting he was \"very pleased\" with the impact he made against Fulham, along with goalscorer Zirkzee.",
      "Garnacho enjoyed an impressive season with United last season and was one of the bright sparks amid a difficult campaign, scoring nine times and providing four assists.",

      "There was optimism for United this season after making a string of big name signings to kickstart a new era under chiefs Omar Berrada and Dan Ashworth, who have brought in Leny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt, and an opening win over Fulham at home looked like a great start.",
      "United are now under the microscope again after a tough campaign last year - though Onana chose to remain upbeat when asked about the club's ambitions this season.",
      "When quizzed about what United were targeting this term, he said: \"To win everything. We know what this shirt means so we have to go for every trophy we face, it's one of the biggest clubs in the world.\"",
      "Speaking further about the game, Onana said the United players were struggling to understand how they lost the game, adding: \"It's difficult for is to accept because we have a good game, we had more chances than them. It's difficult but we are still positive. We have big players, we are a big club and it's the second game of the season. A lot of big ambitions this season so we stay very positive.\"",

We concede two soft goals when we should act better as a team.\"",

      "Erik ten Hag has explained the reason why he swapped Mason Mount for Joshua Zirkzee at half-time of Manchester United's 2-1 defeat by Brighton on Saturday afternoon",
      "Mason Mount was substituted at half-time during Manchester United’s defeat by Brighton after reporting an injury.",
      "United were beaten 2-1 on the south coast as Joao Pedro’s 95th-minute header made the difference for Brighton. And the disappointing result was made even worse by an injury concern for Mount, who was brought off during the break for Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Mount managed just 20 appearances in all competitions last season following a £55million transfer from Chelsea due to injuries. The 25-year-old managed to begin their campaign fully fit thanks to pre-season, but Erik ten Hag gave some bad news in his post-match press conference.",
      "\"It was forced,\" Ten Hag said when asked why Mount was withdrawn. \"He had an issue, he mentioned an issue and I didn't want to take a risk. I don't know how much of a worry it is in this moment.",
      "\"But we have a good bench. If you can bring Zirkzee and don't hesitate, bring him off and you bring a player who has an impact and we see Josh had a great game.\" It remains to be seen how serious Mount’s knock is, but he is a doubt for United’s next match against Liverpool at Old Trafford next Sunday.",
      "Brighton were 1-0 up at half-time thanks to Danny Welbeck’s tap-in from Kaoru Mitoma’s cross which may have forced Ten Hag’s hand with changes anyway. Zirkzee, who scored the winner in the season-opener vs Fulham last weekend, was summoned and United levelled in the second half.",
      "Amad raced in behind and equalised via a deflection before United appeared to have gone 2-1 up through substitute Alejandro Garnacho. However, replays showed that Garnacho’s effort hit an offside Zirkzee before it crossed the line, forcing VAR to rule the goal out.",
      "Pedro was then left unmarked to nod in the winner in injury time and heap pressure onto Ten Hag already. \"I thought a draw would’ve been half acceptable but to lose the game, it puts an awful lot of pressure, I think, on Erik ten Hag and on towards the game next week against Liverpool,” Gary Neville told NBC Sports.",
      "\"I think the first half of the game, I don’t think any of us were surprised. It’s very difficult to play football without a centre-forward. The lads in the studio will tell you, you need a focal point up front. He corrected that at half-time by bringing Zirkzee on, but you’ve already wasted 45 minutes in the match and that’s a real problem.”",

      "The 26-year-old England international has become an easy scapegoat at Old Trafford since inking a bumper five-year contract worth £325,000-a-week last summer.",

      "Rashford saw an equaliser, a cutely flicked rebound, chalked off for offside during the first-half and his head quickly began to drop during this dramatic, yet forgettable, defeat.",
      "He made several penetrative runs in behind Brighton's backline, which camped high and struggled to turn on the stodgy, rain-soaked turf, but his team-mates failed to execute the final ball.",
      "And Rashford quickly became agitated, then infuriated, then simply began to sulk until the half-time interval.",
      "He was correct to feel aggrieved because the pass he required was not complex and it was not a one-off occurrence.",
      "However, Rashford also had to take some level of accountability for his eagerness as on more than one occasion, he simply went too hastily.",
      "From that point onwards, his contribution began to nosedive and on 65 minutes Rashford was already walking to the side of the field in anticipation that he would be subbed as Alejandro Garnacho prepared to enter the fray.",
      "Goalscorer Amad, spurred on by the tragic passing of his mother, upstaged Rashford once again with his direct dribbling and desire to attack his full-back, while Garnacho was unfortunate not to start.",
      "His impact was explosive and almost instant following his introduction.",
      "He looked to have fired United ahead but Joshua Zirkzee's questionable poaching instincts saw the goal correctly chalked off for offside by VAR.",
      "And as Rashford trudged his way around the back of Jason Steele's goal, past the travelling supporters and back to United's bench, you began to wonder how it has come to this.",
      "It took him what appeared to be an age to acknowledge the United fans, who were applauding in their numbers, and while he did eventually clap back, his head was down and his body language conveyed that he is not enjoying his football.",
      "Rashford's Euro 2024 setback should have ignited the fire within his belly but there has seemingly been no change on the mediocrity he served up last season.",
      "United's board of directors were here in their numbers and they will want to see more from one of the club's top-earners, who must respond to keep his place in Ten Hag's side with Amad in the ascendancy and Joshua Zirkzee looking to nail down a starting berth.",
      "Ten Hag has bigger fish to dry as he looks to pick the bones out of this late defeat but the most disappointing aspect about Rashford's demise is that he no longer has the confidence to beat his marker.",
      "His movements have become all too predictable and he would rather pause, turn and play a backwards pass as opposed to attempting a daring dribble.",
      "Brighton's £30m signing Yankuba Minteh is far from the finished article, he was utterly chaotic to watch at times, but he was always on the front-foot.",
      "Rashford has the end-product Minteh is lacking but currently seems incapable of putting it into action.",
      "Where is the Rashford that struck 30 goals in all competitions in 2022-23? Or the Rashford that top-scored for England at the World Cup? That player cannot go to waste.",

      "BRIGHTON 2-1 MAN UTD: Danny Welbeck's 100th club career goal and a late strike from Joao Pedro secured a memorable and deserved victory for the Seagulls against Erik ten Hag's side",
      "Manchester United were hit with a late Brighton sucker punch as the Seagulls secured a dramatic, stoppage time victory.",
      "Joao Pedro was the hero for the South Coast club as he nodded home late on to continue the hosts' perfect start to the campaign. Ex-Red Devil Danny Welbeck had opened the scoring from close range midway through the first half of Saturday's clash. The Seagulls continued to threaten through the striker, while veteran midfielder James Milner also had a number of chances.",
      "Despite that, Erik ten Hag's men found themselves level on the hour mark through Amad's deflected effort. Alejandro Garnacho then netted but saw his strike ruled out by VAR.",
      "The Red Devils' anguish was then even worse as Pedro took advantage of awful defending to score the winner. Check out all of the talking points from the Amex Stadium on a gutting afternoon for the Red Devils:",
      "It was certainly a surprise to see summer signing Joshua Zirkzee benched on the South coast. After all, the former Bologna man had secured the Red Devils three points against Fulham with a memorable debut goal.",
      "But supporters should not be surprised. Following the Dutchman's arrival, Erik ten Hag suggested that he would need to time to adapt to the demands of Premier League football. And his place on the bench against Brighton appears to be part of that process.",
      "It did not take long for Ten Hag to turn to Zirkzee as he replaced Mason Mount at half-time. He worked hard but was ultimately the villain for the Red Devils but more about that later on...",
      "From a current Red Devils striker to a former one, Danny Welbeck was left toasting his 100th career goal against his former side. Some horrendous defending saw two crosses failed to be cut out before reaching Kaoru Mitoma.",
      "The Japanese international picked out Welbeck, who slid in to poke home. And despite his strike coming against his former side, the former Red Devils academy graduate allowed himself a celebration considering his milestone.",
      "It's also now two goals in as many games for the forward at the start of the campaign - form he will be very keen to continue throughout the remainder of the season. It's also the sixth time he has found the net against Man United.",
      "Even after Welbeck's opener, Brighton had a number of opportunities to add to their lead. An excellent team move saw the Seagulls tear through their visitors, with ex-Liverpool star Milner given the simple opportunity to roll home.",
      "But he did not get enough purchase on his effort and Diogo Dalot got back just in time to clear the ball off of the line. Milner also fired a presentable effort from range over.",
      "Welbeck might have doubled his afternoon's work after another brilliant Brighton move but nodded right into the arms of Onana, while he then rattled the bar with another effort.",
      "Brighton's missed chances eventually came back to bite them as the Red Devils found an equaliser through Amad. The Ivorian winger raced down the right flank, cut inside Jack Hinselwood and let fly with a powerful effort.",
      "Both Lewis Dunk and Jan Paul van Hecke slid in to try and clear but the latter only served the thunder the ball into his own net. It was just the tonic the Red Devils needed as they threatened to lose control of the game.",
      "Man United thought they had claimed the lead after polishing off a stunning move. Amad released Bruno Fernandes down the right, who crossed towards substitute Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The Argentinian forward tapped home and wheeled off in celebration. Unfortunately, a stray knee from Zirkzee saw the goal chalked off.",
      "The ball had hit the Dutchman - who was offside and practically on the goalline. The officials did not see the touch initially but VAR intervened and correctly ruled the strike out to the frustration of Garnacho, Zirkzee and more.",
      "In honesty, the Red Devils did not deserve to win. And Brighton were probably the better side. They proved it late on too.",
      "Brazilian forward Joao Pedro was given acres of room in stoppage time and nodded home Simon Adingra's cross unopposed. It just added to Man United's woes and leaves Ten Hag with a lot of thinking to do as he attempts to find an answer to how the have lost the game.",

      "Hard-hitting defensive midfielder Casemiro couldn't contain his frustration with Manchester United skipper Bruno Fernandes during Saturday's disastrous loss at Brighton",
      "Frustration was obvious among Manchester United's players on Saturday – highlighted by experienced Casemiro's outburst at captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "During Saturday's 2-1 loss at Brighton and Hove Albion, the experienced defensive midfielder vented towards club captain Bruno Fernandes in the first-half, after failing to capitalise on a dangerous free kick. United won a free-kick midway into Brighton's half, with the 29-year-old Portuguese star stepping up to deliver a ball into the box.",
      "While an unmarked Casemiro connected with the ball, the Brazilian sent it soaring over the bar – much to his own disgust. But instead of turning his attention to his own effort, the 32-year-old decided to give Fernandes a piece of his mind on his delivery.",
      "Casemiro had to check his run during the free-kick, with the ball looking to land in the penalty area behind him - turning to his captain to berate his efforts. And while he could have easily put the Red Devils 1-0 up with a better header during the instance, Casemiro instead saw fingers pointed his way for Brighton taking the lead in the 32nd minute.",
      "The midfielder jogged back into the box as an unmarked Danny Wellbeck found the back of the net against his former club. Kaoru Mitoma picked the ball up deep into enemy territory, finding the Seagulls striker unmarked in the middle of the box for a tap in - the 100th goal of his Premier League career thus far.",
      "And social media users were quick to point out Casemiro's error at the other end of the pitch. One wrote: \"Maguire marked a man, same as Martinez, Casemiro left Welbeck unmarked, that’s the reason for the goal,\" while another complained: \"Casemiro jogging back kills me.\"",
      "Manchester United's late win on the opening game of the season last week, edging past Fulham 1-0 at Old Trafford, was quickly forgotten thanks to Joao Pedro's injury-time winner at the Amex, which will only further highlight the frustrations in the United camp.",
      "Erik ten Hag's players clearly have work to be done should they hope to chase at least a top-four finish, especially considering their dismal eighth-place finish in the 2023/24 campaign. Up next for United is arch-rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford next Sunday.",

      "Cole Palmer has proven an inspired signing for Chelsea following their swoop for the former Manchester City man but Jamie Carragher believes he could return to the north west sooner rather than later",
      "Jamie Carragher has backed Cole Palmer to complete a sensational move to Manchester United within a year.",
      "The England winger has enjoyed a brilliant year since leaving boyhood club Manchester City for Chelsea. The 22-year-old scored 25 goals in all competitions across a stunning debut campaign.",
      "That saw Palmer win the Premier League Young Player of the Season, PFA Fans' Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year awards. Despite that, it was still a difficult season for Chelsea.",
      "The Blues finished sixth under Mauricio Pochettino, who was eventually replaced by former Leicester boss Enzo Maresca. And Carragher believes Palmer could be on his way to Old Trafford should Chelsea struggle again this term.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap with Sky Bet, Carragher said: “Something’s just come to me here. If Chelsea have another poor season, we were talking earlier about Manchester United having a real problem on that right wing.",
      "“He [Palmer] is a big Man United fan isn’t he? Would that not be something that United should visit maybe in 12 months if it doesn’t go well? You know what, I think that could happen. Yeah, Cole Palmer to Man United.”",
      "As it stands, a move to Old Trafford looks highly unlikely. Palmer has only just put pen to paper on a new nine-year deal with Chelsea that runs until 2033.",
      "That new deal has seen the winger’s wages at Stamford Bridge rise considerably. Speaking after committing his future to the Blues, he said: “I’m delighted to sign this new deal.",
      "How many goals will Cole Palmer score this season? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "“I achieved a lot in my first season here and hopefully I can continue to experience great things at this club, both on a personal level and in terms of bringing success and trophies to Chelsea.”",
      "United have already invested heavily this summer ahead for Erik ten Hag’s third season at the helm. Defence has been their first aspect of concern having signed Leny Yoro from Lille before completing a double deal for Bayern Munich pair Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "United have also welcomed a new forward to the club this summer after signing Joshua Zirkzee from Bologna. The Dutch forward marked his debut with the winning goal against Fulham. Palmer is still awaiting his first goal of the campaign.",

      "Ruud van Nistelrooy was one of the big arrivals into Manchester United this summer, but one other former Red Devil believes the coach could one day become manager at Old Trafford",
      "Michael Owen believes Ruud van Nistelrooy could be in line to become the manager of Manchester United.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, 48, returned to Old Trafford as Erik ten Hag's assistant manager, just over a year after he resigned as manager of PSV Eindhoven due to a \"lack of support\". His time back on the red side of Manchester started well with a home victory over Fulham.",
      "The ex-Real Madrid striker's return to the club also comes soon after Ten Hag was widely believed to be destined for the sack. While the jury remains out on Ten Hag amongst the fanbase, Van Nistelrooy has been getting to work with a United side bolstered by the arrivals of fellow countrymen Joshua Zirkzee and Matthijs de Ligt, as well as 18-year-old central defender Leny Yoro and ex-Ajax star Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Owen believes the Red Devils legend could one day find himself in the dugout in the same way Ole Gunnar Solskjaer did.",
      "While speaking to OLBG, Owen said: “It’s an interesting situation for Ruud van Nistelrooy at Manchester United, because if it’s five games, 50 games or 500 games, Erik ten Hag will go at some point. When it does happen the club will look for a new manager and because that takes time, there is often an interim coach or a caretaker while that search happens.",
      "“So if Van Nistelrooy doesn’t leave before Ten Hag, you would think that he would get a handful of games as manager like Ryan Giggs and Michael Carrick have done in the past. Even Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was temporary and he did well enough to buy himself more time and eventually they had to give him the job.",
      "“It doesn't take a genius to work out that having been a manager and now being the assistant manager at his former club, Van Nistelrooy could get to manage Manchester United at some point. But I think at this stage he's obviously coming to the club to help Ten Hag change their fortunes around.",
      "\"I don't think he's got eyes on that prize just yet. But in the future I definitely wouldn't be surprised if he got to manage the team for a handful of games.”",
      "Owen is not the only person who think Van Nistelrooy could be managing the club in the near future. Rene Meulensteen, who was Sir Alex Ferguson's assistant manager for many years, also thinks Sir Jim Ratcliffe would consider Van Nistelrooy, if Ten Hag was to leave.",
      "The ex-Fulham boss told Gambling Zone: “I don’t think Erik ten Hag will be worried about Ruud van Nistelrooy potentially replacing him, he’s too focused on the job at hand.",
      "“But who knows what the future will bring. If United stutter at the start of the season and the results don’t go their way, Sir Jim Ratcliffe would consider Van Nistelrooy.",
      "\"But at the moment they believe that Erik is the right man and now we need to see what happens. It is an interesting development, what has happened at Manchester United because Ten Hag brought in his trusted staff and many of them have gone.",
      "\"Now he has brought in his friend Rene Hake, who was manager of Utrecht, as well as Van Nistelrooy, so he has identified what he needs.”",

      "The future of England international Jadon Sancho at Manchester United looks increasingly uncertain after a falling out between himself and manager Erik ten Hag last season",
      "Erik ten Hag said he still has a choice to make over the future of Jadon Sancho.",
      "The future of the England international at Old Trafford remains in question despite reconciling with Ten Hag earlier this summer. Sancho was initially banished last season from first-team training following a disagreement with the Dutchman last September. The winger was then sent out on loan to his former club Borussia Dortmund for the second-half of last season, where he helped the German side reach the Champions League final.",
      "While Sancho and Ten Hag are said to have made peace after last season's discord, the 24-year-old looked destined for a move away this summer with United working hard to move the Englishman on.",
      "Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and an unnamed Premier League club are said to be keen on a move. Sancho was omitted from United's squad altogether for their first Premier League match of the new season against Fulham last weekend.",
      "Yet, for United's Saturday lunchtime kick-off against Brighton, Ten Hag confirmed that Sancho had again been left out of his squad - despite being made to travel south - and added that a verdict over his future remains his to make.",
      "Ten Hag's side were ravaged by injuries last season with much effect on the manager, who has insisted in the run-up to the new season that \"survival of the fittest\" is his campaign mantra.",
      "Sancho looked to be the first and most high-profile casualty of this new philosophy when he was left out of the squad to face Fulham, albeit Ten Hag later said he had an ear infection and could not play.",
      "United have been busy in the transfer window this summer thus far, but the club remain firm in their pursuit of Paris Saint-Germain's Manuel Ugarte. Talks over a swap deal with PSG concerning Ugarte and Sancho collapsed earlier this summer.",
      "Thus the permanent sale of Sancho could help raise the necessary funds for United to get a deal over the line. While Juventus look to be in pole position, the Italians are struggling to meet United's £40million valuation - while matching his salary at Old Trafford would also be an issue.",
      "Asked about the potential for new signings before the end of the window, Ten Hag said: \"We will see, we always have to look to get better but that has to be the right options.\"",

      "It was suggested that the new Bayern boss had previously told De Ligt that he was his “No.1 defender” and that it was instead the German giants’ hierarchy attempting to sell him. But a spokesperson for Bayern has since said that Kompany never 'said words to that effect'.",
      "And the former Man City star has now hit back at suggestions that De Ligt was sold against his will. He said: “It would've been so stupid of me to say something like that. It wouldn't fit with what we've planned for the entire squad. It makes no sense”.",
      "Bayern chief Max Eberl has also offered his view on the decision to sell De Ligt. He said: \"We have to make decisions where we feel we can have the greatest possible success. We made decisions together with Vincent Kompany. Matthijs de Ligt has delivered very consistent performances.",
      "“We wanted an additional left-footer, which is why we brought in Hiroki Ito. That's squad planning, then we spend money, then you as a club have to earn money too. We spoke to the players very transparently and then made decisions and that's how we got the squad we have now.\"",
      "De Ligt, 25, made 73 appearances over two seasons for Bayern after arriving for big money from Italian giants Juventus. But he made just 16 starts in the Bundesliga last term as Bayern lost their title to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "He has been made to wait for his full United debut since making his move to Old Trafford. De Ligt has started on the bench for the Red Devils’ opening two games against Fulham and Brighton.",
      "Speaking after completing his move, the defender said: “As soon as I heard that Manchester United wanted me, I felt an excitement about the opportunity for a new challenge at such an historic club. In the conversations that followed, I was impressed by the vision that the football leadership set out, and the role they saw for me in it.",
      "“Erik ten Hag shaped the early stages of my career, so he knows how to get the best out of me and I cannot wait to work with him again. I know what it takes to succeed at the highest level, and I’m determined to continue that record at this special club.”",

      "Former England defender Joleon Lescott has named the one Manchester United player who stood out as his toughest ever opponent - and it's not one you'd expect like Wayne Rooney or Cristiano Ronaldo",
      "Joleon Lescott has thrown a curveball by naming Louis Saha as his toughest ever on-field adversary.",
      "The former England defender progressed through the ranks at Wolverhampton Wanderers. And it was during these formative years that he tussled with Saha, then a hotshot for Fulham.",
      "Saha later sparkled at Manchester United, netting 42 times in 124 outings under Sir Alex Ferguson's stewardship and clinching two Premier League crowns alongside a sought-after Champions League triumph in 2008. Despite that, he was often overshadowed in that golden era by United's glittering offensive line-up consisting of stars like Wayne Rooney, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "However, speaking on the Football's Greatest podcast with pundit Jeff Stelling, Lescott was asked: \"I don't think anybody will pick this guy but of course a footballer's perspective is very different to a football fan's perspective isn't it? So tell me, who is the No. 1 striker you've played against Joleon?\"",
      "Lescott responded with a surprising admission: \"Louis Saha – King Louis. I was at Wolves and these are players that have given me the toughest time. At Wolves, he's at Fulham Fulham are top of the league, averaged 2.5 goals a game. Top of the league first 10 games of the season so I'm aware this is going to be a tough game.\"",
      "The defender also opened up about a humbling experience he had on the pitch, saying: \"I go into the game thinking it's going to be tough... 0-0, I get man of the match thinking, 'It's not as tough as I thought'. Fast forward four weeks, I played him in the cup, I'm thinking, 'It's going to be the same'. He's obviously thinking, 'I need to up my level', and that was the first time I came across someone that in every attribute I valued, he was better than.",
      "\"If someone was faster, I was stronger, could tactically be better, physically could be better or whatever. Whatever they had, I could use a different attribute to navigate a better outcome not that I'm saying I dominated every opponent, but that was someone, the first person I came across that in every element of the game I considered important, he showed me that he was superior.\"",
      "Lescott continued (via the Manchester Evening News): \"He made me realise, 'Oh there's another level to go here, I can't just play on the things I think are important'. He scored, we lost 3-0. He scored a free kick with his right foot and a pen with his left foot and the ball come to him and he chipped it with the outside of his foot, ran one side the ball went the other side.",
      "\"I was just disorientated and he was just something that I'd never experienced, and the first time I experienced it and for that I always had so much respect for Louis. And then I got to play with him at Everton and I still call him King Louis now when I speak to him.\"",
      "Saha and Lescott teamed up at Everton in 2008, securing a notable fifth-place finish in the Premier League – Everton's second-best Premier League result after their fourth-place finish in the 2004/05 season. Lescott continued his career with Manchester City, West Bromwich Albion, Aston Villa and AEK Athens before retiring at Sunderland in 2017, while Saha followed a similar trajectory.",
      "After his time at Fulham, Saha joined United in 2004. He then had a four-year spell with Everton before transferring to Spurs, Sunderland and Lazio, finally hanging up his boots in 2013.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Brazilian midfielder Andre and Fluminense president Mario Bittencourt has admitted the club are willing to sell",
      "Manchester United have been put on red alert after Fluminense president Mario Bittencourt revealed he has promised to help midfielder Andre \"fulfil his dream of playing in Europe\".",
      "Reports from Brazil have linked Andre with both United and Wolves and Mirror Football understands that Wolves do hold an interest in the player, but are not actively pursuing a deal right now - putting United in pole position should a deal for Manuel Ugarte fall through.",
      "Andre was targeted by Liverpool last year, but Fluminense rejected their approach because they viewed the midfielder as a key part of their bid to win the Copa Libertadores. Andre ultimately stayed and Fluminense went on to lift the trophy, beating Boca Juniors 2-1 in the final.",
      "When asked about Andre's future, Bittencourt detailed Liverpool's attempts to sign the 23-year-old and admitted Fluminense are now willing to cash in on him if an appropriate offer comes in from Europe.",
      "\"Liverpool actually made an official offer last year during the Libertadores round of 16,\" Bittencourt revealed in an interview with Flashscore. \"Liverpool's directors contacted me directly, but I told them the player wasn't for sale at that time.",
      "\"We wanted to keep him for the Libertadores because we truly believed we could win it last year. We were fully prepared for that competition. Liverpool understood our position on the matter.",
      "\"He's the player we've expected for over a year to attract offers. If no offer comes, we'll keep the player and certainly increase his value even more. Offers might come in December, January or mid-next year. To be honest, the player and his agent have were very fair to us last year.",
      "\"It's the player who decides, the player leaves when he wants. It's not good to have a discontented player. Last year he said if we didn't want to sell, he'd stay to win the Libertadores. Now I've given my word to help him fulfil his dream of playing in Europe.\"",
      "Fluminense are said to value Andre at around £25million and Fulham had also been linked with a move for the midfielder, before completing the signing of Sander Berge from Burnley to replace Joao Palhinha.",

      "Manchester United are still looking to sort out a significant sale before the transfer window closes, but there's reason to suspect the certain player should be wary of joining Antonio Conte's Napoli",
      "Scott McTominay might be wise to be cautious over a potential move to Antonio Conte's Napoli if he leaves Manchester United.",
      "The Serie A heavyweights are rumoured to be keen on securing a deal for the Red Devils midfielder, who has once again been linked with a departure from Old Trafford following interest from Fulham. However, the Manchester Evening News have reported how life under Conte may not be plain sailing for the Scotland international.",
      "That's after Conte, 55, saw his time in England tainted by claims of discord within his Chelsea and Tottenham squads. The Italian managed Spurs until March 2023 but left under a cloud after openly criticising his team following a 3-3 draw with Southampton.",
      "Just before his exit, The Guardian reported some at Tottenham were itching for Conte to leave. It was alleged that several players wanted him out after what they considered to be poor treatment of the dressing room.",
      "And it wasn't just in north London where he faced opposition from his players after there were reports of discontent within the squad at Stamford Bridge too. After clinching the Premier League title with Chelsea in 2017, The Sun reported certain Blues stars were worn out by the coach's training regimes, which are known to be strenuous.",
      "\"Around us, there is a lot of b******t,\" Conte candidly told the press at the time, dismissing such speculation. \"I see in the past it happened the same with a lot of managers. A lot of b******t. They try to create problems between me, the club and players.\"",
      "McTominay looks set to face a crucial decision about his future at United with less than a week left in the transfer window. The £30million-rated midfielder reportedly wants to stay at the club he's been with since his childhood, but sources indicate United may be looking to cash in to bolster their transfer kitty.",
      "The Times reported Napoli have shown interest in a loan move for McTominay, which could be complicated by the fact the player has only one year remaining on his current United contract – though there is an option to extend that by a year, which would then allow for a loan with option or obligation to buy deal. Meanwhile, rumours are swirling that McTominay may be included in a deal to secure PSG's Manuel Ugarte.",
      "If McTominay were to make the leap to Italy, it would mark a significant change of scenery in a drastic shift for his career. However, the experiences of his Premier League rivals may suggest the prospect of being part of Conte's set-up at Napoli comes with its own challenges.",

      "That could reportedly rise to £3m, while United have included a buyback clause and a 30 percent sell-on clause in the deal. Fish is Cardiff's sixth permanent signing so far this summer after the additions of Chris Willock, Calum Chambers, Anwar El Ghazi, Alexander Robertson and Jesper Daland.",
      "\"I'm delighted,\" Fish told club media after completing his move to Cardiff. \"It took a while to get it over the line, but now I'm here, I can't wait to get going and embrace it. It's a huge club. The direction that the club want to go in, you've seen a lot of good signings in this window.",

      "\"For the last two years he was in Hibernian, so we watched him and we were interested in him in January too. We hope that he will progress with us in a good way. He is still 21 years old, just starting his career and he is good on the ball, good in duels, so he will add to our playing style.",

      "Fans may know Gary Neville as the ex-Manchester United star and pundit, but the former defender has been involved in many ventures away from football and enjoys a fast-paced life with wife Emma",
      "Whether it's for his football opinions or outspoken political views, Gary Neville is one of the most divisive and talked about pundits in the UK.",
      "By the time he hung up his boots in February 2011, Neville was regarded as one of the most successful players in the history of English football. He started and ended his career with Manchester United, making 602 appearances while winning eight Premier League titles, three FA Cups and two Champions League trophies along the way.",
      "Gary, 49, also played 85 times for the England national football team and was described by former Red Devils manager Sir Alex Ferguson as the \"best right-back of his generation\".",
      "Today, he is a household name thanks to his regular punditry appearances on television. But with an astonishing net worth, various business ventures and a wife who stays out of the limelight, Mirror Sport looks to delve further into the unique life of the former footballer-turned-businessman.",
      "Neville is well known in football circles for keeping himself extremely busy with all kinds of ventures ever since hanging up his boots. Neville’s 19-year football career for one of the biggest clubs in the world earned him significant money, but there are many other ways in which he has accrued his reported £70million net worth.",
      "Today, the Bury-born entrepreneur is the majority owner of Salford City FC, having bought the club with other class of ‘92 alumni in 2014 and overseen their rise to League Two. He also has a huge business empire outside of football, getting into property development in his early 20s and now owning a chain of hotels and townhouses.",
      "They include Hotel Football, which overlooks Old Trafford, as well as the Stock Exchange Hotel near Piccadilly Gardens. He is also involved in the St Michael’s Project, which aims to build apartments, hotels, offices and a high-end restaurant in Manchester’s city centre.",
      "He founded investment company Relentless in 2015, which specialises in ventures across the Manchester area. Unsatisfied with all of the aforementioned roles, he likewise runs a property and construction consultancy firm named Zerum.",
      "Neville is also a senior investor in E3 Creative, a digital creative agency which focuses on online marketing and corporate strategy. The ex-defender also invested in the hospitality sector with GG Hospitality and the higher education institution University Academy 92, which opened in September 2019 and offers \"broader courses than traditional degrees\" to the 400 students registered there as of 2022.",
      "While many of the above are his pursuits away from the limelight, he is better known to the public for his long-standing roles as a football pundit for Sky Sports and ITV. In January 2024, he joined Dragon’s Den as one of its investors on the 21st series of the hit BBC show.",
      "Neville’s hotel business alone has accumulated £20m in assets, according to Companies House, whilst his property development company has assets of £10.5m. His remaining businesses have combined assets of £40m. All the while, he is reportedly paid over £1m a year for his role on Sky.",
      "Gary met his wife Emma Hadfield, from Middleton, Greater Manchester, in 2004, when she worked as a shop assistant in the city. Three years later, the pair tied the knot in a lavish ceremony.",
      "The couple share teenage daughters Molly and Sophie, and lived in a mansion in Bolton, before making the move to Manchester city centre four years ago. In the early stages of their romance, Emma studied holistic therapy and is now a qualified counsellor and accredited 'Menopause Coach'.",
      "The philanthropist launched her new support network online at the end of last year, where she teaches women about the menopause and gives advice and support to others on how best to navigate it. In a candid post and video, the mum-of-two shared that she had been diagnosed with early menopause soon after her most recent birthday – sending her on a course of education and self-discovery.",
      "She now aims to share her wisdom with other women after qualifying as a counsellor in 2019. Gary, who has been in support of her latest project, wrote: \"So proud of my wife Emma with the launch of her new community for women.\"",
      "While other footballers sit back and enjoy pints of beer or turn to management after retirement, Neville came up with a master plan to build a futuristic carbon-neutral mansion in 2010, likened to the home seen in the children’s TV show Teletubbies.",
      "Following a lengthy row with neighbours, his project – based in the Bolton suburb of Greater Manchester – received the green light in 2012 as Neville sought to build a dream home for himself, Emma and their two daughters. That was only possible after he ditched plans to build a 130ft wind turbine.",
      "The house was going to be built into the ground and set over two floors but was never completed. The land sat empty for several years before the ex-England international abandoned building work in 2017.",
      "He originally put the plot up for sale in 2020 for £650,000, with the 8,000 square foot site still including Neville's eco-friendly plans. Neville eventually had to reduce his asking price for the five bedroom property to £500,000.",
      "Sky has slashed the price of its Sky Sports, Sky Stream, Sky TV and Netflix bundle in an unbeatable new deal that saves £216 and includes 1,400 live matches across the Premier League, EFL and more.",
      "With Ultra HD included at no extra cost, football fans can enjoy the 2024/25 season with crystal clear picture quality.",

      "Ugarte is free to leave PSG this summer, though the French giants are refusing to budge on their £51million valuation. United are keen to complete a deal for the midfielder, though they are also now focusing on outgoings.",
      "At the top of the list of those heading out the exit door is Jadon Sancho, who does not appear to be in Erik ten Hag's plans. Juventus are the latest team to launch a move for the attacker, with PSG having also considered signing the former England international.",
      "The news of those talks come as Gary Neville gave his seal of approval to the signing of Matthijs de Ligt, who arrived at Old Trafford earlier this summer. Here, Mirror Football rounds up all the latest Manchester United transfer news.",
      "Juventus have opened talks over a move for Jadon Sancho, with Manchester United keen to move him on. Sancho was left out of the squad for the opening Premier League game of the season and had been linked with joining PSG.",
      "But according to The Athletic, Juventus have now taken pole position in the race to sign the winger. The Serie A giants are in talks over a deal, though finding an agreement looks likely to prove difficult, with United holding out for a fee of £40m.",
      "They are also unlikely to sanction another loan move, though that is exactly what Juve want to do. The Turin side have made him a top target and there is a sense United may agree to a loan deal if Juve agree full coverage of Sancho’s salary, plus a loan fee and an obligation to sign him permanently at the end of the loan.",
      "United legend Gary Neville has topped Matthijs de Ligt to be the signing of the season. The Dutchman arrived just ahead of the win over Fulham, playing the final nine minutes of that match.",
      "De Ligt is expected to quickly become a starter under Erik ten Hag once he settles in. And Neville believes he could go on to become a key player for United, so much so he can be the star signing of the summer.",
      "Neville told Sky Sports: “I would like to think it’s going to be De Ligt. I would like to think De Ligt is going to be the best signing. I think these two (De Ligt and Neto) are going to have the most transformative impact on their teams. United have to go from eighth up to third or fourth, and Chelsea have to go from fifth.”",
      "PSG have once again left Manuel Ugarte out of their squad for Friday's clash against Montpellier. Ugarte also missed their opening day win over Le Harve, with the French giants keen to see the midfielder leave.",
      "United are his leading suitors, though talks remain ongoing with the two sides yet to reach an agreement over a fee. Boss Luis Enrique has made no secret of the fact that Ugarte is no longer in his plans, just a year after the Uruguayan arrived.",
      "Enrique said PSG plan to \"let go those we no longer count on.\" He added: \"We have no priority, we already have a team that has been champion, we are watching the transfer window, we are looking to see if a player appears at a normal price but we will not make excessive expenditure.\"",

      "French giants PSG had looked his most likely destination, as part of a swap deal involving Manuel Ugarte. But such an agreement now appears to be dead in the water, though United are still pursuing Ugarte.",
      "Instead, Juventus have now moved into pole position to sign Sancho. The Serie A giants have opened talks over a deal to bring the winger to Turin before the end of the window in six days time.",
      "But according to The Athletic, a financial agreement that satisfies both teams is expected to be difficult to achieve. United are looking for a fee of £40million for the 24-year-old, though no suitors have so far shown a willingness to match that valuation.",
      "Though they loaned Sancho out to Borussia Dortmund in January, the Red Devils are this time demanding a permanent sale only. Club chiefs would only consider another loan deal if it makes sense from a profit and sustainability view.",
      "That would mean Juve fully cover Sancho’s salary, as well as pay a loan fee and include an obligation to sign him permanently in the deal. There is a belief that United would rather keep Sancho than let him leave on loan without significant financial benefit.",

      "Erik ten Hag says Alejandro Garnacho has the “X-factor” - but claims he must work even harder to become world class.",
      "Garnacho is improving rapidly and he scored in the Community Shield before setting up Joshua Zirkzee’s late winner against Fulham to add to his 10 goals and four assists last season. The Argentina attacker is nailing down his starting place on the right side of United’s attack and Ten Hag admits he has fans on the edge of their seats.",
      "But Ten Hag also says he has further to go and that he must continue grafting to hit the world-class level. “A world-class player?” said the United boss.",
      "“He has to go a long way. He has high potential. He showed last season he can contribute and be a starting XI player. To make the jump and become a world-class player, it starts with very hard work. That brought him to where he is now and that will bring him to being that world-class player. I agree he has the potential.”",
      "Garnacho, 20, is the latest United wide player to excite fans, going back to George Best, Willie Morgan, Steve Coppell, Ryan Giggs, Andrei Kanchelskis, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "“I agree,” said Ten Hag. “Every club at the top needs players with the X-factor. Garnacho has it in him to become that player. We’ve already seen on occasions that he has shown the X-factor, so if you want to be that player that people are saying is world class, then you have to do it consistently. He has that skill.”",
      "Garnacho has made an impact coming off the bench in United’s first two matches, notching a goal and an assist, and Ten Hag says this attitude is what he wants from all his players. United face Brighton at the Amex on Saturday and Ten Hag said: “You have to prove it, show it every day on the training pitch and in every minute you can get.",
      "“It’s not only about the starters, it’s also about the finishers. I was very pleased last week that Zirkzee and Garnacho made the difference.",

      "Ten Hag admitted United were not ready for the start of the Premier League last Friday because of their number of players on international duty during the summer.",
      "Brighton are ahead of them in terms of their preparation because they had fewer players away. “I think for other clubs, who have many international players, we’re all in the same boat,” said ten Hag.",

      "There might come a time this season when Manchester United's miserable 2023/24 Premier League season will be consigned to history. We'll stop talking about it, stop using it as a tool for comparison. It suddenly won't feel all that relevant.",
      "For now, with the second stage of the Erik ten Hag era still in its infancy, it's going to condition how we view this team. It's the prism through which United are being judged early in the campaign.",
      "And if the judgements on the opening weekend were encouraging, this was more of a concern. It wasn't quite the collapse we associated United with so often last season. For a lot of the afternoon, they were harder to play against, more structured and more controlled. But they can't kick the addiction to chaos.",
      "United conceded a soft opener in a dull first half and when the game opened up after the break they rode their luck before a 95th-minute winner that felt like it should have been gift-wrapped. Failing to clear a corner and then forgetting to defend half the penalty area during the second phase felt eerily familiar. It came at a time when Brighton's pressure had been building.",
      "So a point that would have felt like it added belief to Ten Hag's new side vanished and the familiar questions returned. This team do look better, but are the improvements enough? They have got better as a pressing team and are more compact, but they aren't creating enough chances and are making defensive errors. It puts plenty of pressure on the Old Trafford game with Liverpool next week.",
      "Ten Hag's side actually won here in May but that felt like an anomaly. Brighton had won four of their last five Premier League meetings and in so many ways they are a club that United are now trying to ape under Ineos. They are United's bogey team but in so many ways their template as well.",
      "They need to be an elite version of Brighton but that is the aim. This is a club that gets so much right. Lose one highly-rated manager and they replace him with another that no Premier League club had considered. When he goes that, just repeat the process.",
      "After an exodus of players from the Amex in recent years it has been a more stable summer and they have spent more than United on new arrivals. All of them are young players with obvious resale value and many of them creative signings. There are players coming in front Mainz, Nordsjaelland and Gothenburg.",
      "It's noticeable that under 31-year-old head coach Fabian Hurzeler they play a similar style to Roberto De Zerbi. The wingers still fly forward, there are still two strikers and they try to bait the press when deep.",
      "That continuity and the transfer market hit rate is the envy of almost every 'big' club. United are no different. For too long they have lurched from one style to another, from one fad to the next. If either team deserved to win the game it was the Seagulls and in Hurzeler they seem to have another manager destined for the top.",
      "It will stick in Ten Hag's craw that he was beaten by a coach 23 years younger than him. He might have survived the summer but the pressure could easily increase early in the season and he has to avoid results like this.",
      "Sticking with him is the biggest gamble of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ownership. United are starting to get things right under Ineos and their summer transfer activity looks smart. They can't afford many more games like this.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United live blog from MEN Sport. It should be a busy final week of the transfer window for Erik ten Hag and Co, especially after the defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion exposed yet more holes in the squad.",
      "Despite hitting back in the second half - and even taking a brief lead before Alejandro Garnacho's disallowed goal - United were condemned to another miserable afternoon on the south coast after Joao Pedro's last-gasp winner. For Ten Hag, it came after the call to once again leave Jadon Sancho out of the matchday squad.",
      "The Englishman is in talks to leave United this summer, with Juventus the latest club expressing their interest in him. There will seemingly be other outgoings as well.",
      "Victor Lindelof and Scott McTominay could still be sold before the deadline as Dan Ashworth seeks to find them new homes away from Old Trafford. The latter is attracting more buzz and has already seen bids rejected. Napoli are now in the market for his signature.",
      "Ten Hag also spoke about Manuel Ugarte possibly (and now expectedly) arriving. His response - \"we always look for better\" - indicates that changes are afoot. Elsewhere and reported midfield target Andre is likely to leave Fluminese this window, his president has announced. That might be a deal to watch as silly season kicks into full flow for a busy last few days. Here is the place to keep up with the latest Manchester United headlines and stories.",
      "For more updates from Old Trafford on Man United and their transfer business, scroll down...",
      "Nothing surprises me with Danny Welbeck. I watched him as a young kid at Manchester United and he was a wonderful player.",
      "",
      "I couldn’t believe it when United agreed to let him go because I thought he had so much value, not only as a player but just around the place as well as a former academy player.",
      "",
      "I think he’s someone who players who have played against him respect more than some fans who don’t quite realise how difficult he is to play against. He’s a great professional too.",
      "Joe Cole believes United should be actively trying to sell winger Antony after the Brazilian 'cost' his team in their 2-1 loss to Brighton on Saturday afternoon. Since his arrival from Ajax for £80m last summer, the 24-year-old has been incredibly underwhelming and continued to confuse supporters and pundits alike as he made a weak challenge in the build-up to Brighton’s late winner.",
      "Manchester United brought on Antony who in all due respect, probably isn’t happy to just play 10 or 15 minutes. He’s an £80m player. He probably wants out the door at United and they probably want him out as well.",
      "You’re bringing him on and in that crucial moment when there’s a ball to be won, a body needs to be put on the line for your team and for your club, he didn’t do it and it cost his team. That’s the difference. If you look at the running the Brighton subs went through, it was fantastic.",
      "Read more transfer gossip",
      "Juventus have reportedly opened talks with United around a move for out-of-favour winger Jadon Sancho, but it will be 'complicated' to complete. Sancho was once again omitted from Erik ten Hag's matchday squad for their loss to Brighton, the second straight game to start this season he has been left out.",
      "He's here. I had a choice to make and we had some issues. We need a full squad and he is one of them. He has to compete for his position and from game to game, we will have a look. In the squad, we need every position double because it's going to be a long season.\"",
      "Both player and manager drew a line in the sand after a spat between them last September saw the star exiled from the first team for the entire season. GIVEMESPORT are now reporting that the Reds are looking at a £40m sale for the 24-year-old, while the Serie A side would prefer to sign him on loan.",
      "Read more transfer rumours",
      "Erik ten Hag will reportedly urge United to pay £51million to sign Manuel Ugarte permanently.",
      "The Sunday People claim that the United boss believes not bringing in more signings this week would be hugely risky, arguing that they must invest further. PSG are reputedly pushing the Reds to pay up despite a loan-to-buy deal being discussed as United have yet to meet Ugarte's asking price despite the player being keen to make the move.",
      "United have reportedly not offered to sign Atalanta midfielder Ederson as they are fully focused on completing the final steps of a deal to sign Manuel Ugarte. Fabrizio Romano reiterates that Ugarte is waiting for the green light from United as has been the case since making up his mind at the end of last month.",
      "United are said to be entering the final stages of the negotiation process in their chase for Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte. The midfielder has emerged as Erik ten Hag's final transfer priority before the window closes next week.",
      "Ugarte missed both of the Ligue 1 outfit's games to start the season as he tried to force a move out of France. Speaking to GIVEMESPORT, journalist Fabrizio Romano claimed that the two sides are close to an agreement, saying:",
      "Manuel Ugarte is quite close. Manuel Ugarte only wanted to go to Manchester United, so now they are at the final stages of the negotiations with Paris Saint-Germain. The agreement with the player is already there since the end of July, and the player has been pushing a lot to go to Manchester United.",
      "He spoke to the manager, Luis Enrique to tell him that he wanted to go. This is why he was not in the squad for two weeks in a row, and [it is] also very clear that the player doesn't consider any other possibility, only United.",

      "The deal that looks the most likely between now and the end of the transfer window is the signing of Paris Saint Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte. United have been linked with an interest in the Uruguayan for most of the summer.",
      "The club walked away from negotiations due to PSG’s high asking price, but it seems that the talks have now continued. MEN Sport understand that progress has been made on a deal with the club closing in on the midfielder.",
      "The priority will now be to get a deal over the line before next Friday’s deadline. The 23-year-old has been targeted as a potential long-term partner alongside Kobbie Mainoo in United’s midfield.",
      "Sancho has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford since his return from a loan spell with Borussia Dortmund at the start of the summer. The winger moved on loan to Germany for the second half of last season after a public falling out with manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "That issue has now been resolved, but Sancho continues to be linked with an exit. It is said that Juventus are interested in signing the player on a permanent deal, but the financial aspects could prove to be a stumbling block.",
      "United are said to want a fee of around £40 million for Sancho. If they can get that, then sorting a deal earlier rather than later would be a massive plus for the team, and allow them to reinvest the fee in the final days of the window.",
      "The club however, may have to settle for a loan deal. They will hope that any temporary switch will include an obligation to buy at around the asking price.",
      "If United are successful in selling Sancho for around the £40 million mark, then the money could be reinvested into a possible hijack of a deal for Brentford striker Ivan Toney. The England man was left out of the Bees’ opening game of the season last week due to the transfer speculation over his future.",
      "He has been heavily linked with a move to Saudi Arabia with Brentford turning down a £35 million bid from Al-Ahli. United have just two recognised strikers in their current squad in Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, with the former currently injured.",

      "Crossed perfectly for Amad to squander a fine chance with the game goalless and cleared off the line from Milner. 6",
      "Casemiro",
      "Started promisingly but his performance level started to drop and he was a defensive liability again. Took a back seat in the second half. 5",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Looking like a lad who has not had much of a breather in the past nine months. Might have come off sooner if United had better equipped midfielders. 5",

      "\"Of course, we can bring this goal back and go to explain this in detail and what should happen or what has happened,\" Ten Hag said. \"Most important is we have an overload, we played overload very good and then it's about bringing the final pass, bringing the players in tight positions, get the right finish and we did everything well there. It's, as you describe it, unfortunate.\"",

      "Taking into account rules regarding homegrown players and under-21s who don't have to be accounted for in the main group (and must have been born on or after January 1, 2003), this is the selection made. As per the current guidelines, United have a 24-man squad for the Premier League, but that could be shrunk further with certain departures.",
      "United are in a strong position when it comes to their goalkeeping department. Andre Onana has firmly established himself as number one at Old Trafford and will be looking to improve on the nine clean sheets he picked up in the Premier League last season.",
      "The Cameroonian shot stopper already has one under his belt after the win over Fulham on the opening day of the campaign. Turkish shot stopper Altay Bayindir made his debut in the FA Cup against Newport County last season and will likely play second fiddle this season, with Tom Heaton providing the Premier League experience in reserve.",
      "The departures of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Raphael Varane, Brandon Williams and Willy Kambwala made room for United to bring in Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui this summer.",
      "The Reds have bolstered their back line with three new arrivals in defence, but the injury to the young Frenchman Yoro, has been a disappointing pill to swallow. Had he not sustained the injury in pre-season, we may have seen more departures from the United defence.",
      "Both Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof have been linked with transfer moves away from Old Trafford, but they look set to stay beyond the current window.",
      "Manchester United look a bit light in the central area of the pitch, and it's no secret they're interested in PSG midfielder Mauel Ugarte. MEN Sport understand that progress has been made on a deal with the club closing in on the midfielder, who is viewed as the long-term partner to Kobbie Mainoo in the United engine room.",
      "Mason Mount's return to fitness has bolstered the options in midfield, with Bruno Fernandes, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro and Scott McTominay all fit for the start of the campaign. The latter of the quintet has been linked with a move away from Manchester this summer but looks likely to stay with the Reds despite reported interest elsewhere.",
      "21-year-old Hannibal Mejbri is someone who wouldn't need to be registered for United but looks set for a move away before the window closes. Championship side Burnley have been linked with the Tunisian international, who has just one-year left on his United deal.",
      "Cashing in now would be a wise idea, although a loan move hasn't been ruled out.",
      "Man United needed to add goals to their forward line this summer and the arrival of Joshua Zirkzee will hopefully do just that. A goal on his debut against Fulham was the best possible start to his Reds tenure.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund was the main source of goals last season but his injury means he'll miss the start of the season. At just 21, he doesn't need to be registered this season as his birthday falls after the January 1st cut off point.",
      "Amad Diallo is another whose made a bright start to the season with a goal against Brighton and Marcus Rashford is another healthy option up front. There does need to be a decision made regarding Jadon Sancho's future having been left out of the squad to face Brighton.",
      "The winger has been linked with a move to PSG but Juventus have now emerged as the front runners for his signature according to reports. A departure would be the best possible outcome for all parties.",

      "Manchester United are said to be entering the final stages of the negotiation process in their chase for Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Manuel Ugarte. The midfielder has emerged as Erik ten Hag's final transfer priority ahead of the window closing next week.",
      "Ugarte missed both of the Ligue 1 outfit's games to start the season as he tries to force a move out of France. Speaking to GIVEMESPORT, journalist Fabrizio Romano claimed that the two sides are close to an agreement, saying: \"Manuel Ugarte is quite close. Manuel Ugarte only wanted to go to Manchester United, so now they are at the final stages of the negotiations with Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "\"The agreement with the player is already there since the end of July, and the player has been pushing a lot to go to Manchester United. He spoke to the manager, Luis Enrique to tell him that he wanted to go. This is why he was not in the squad for two weeks in a row, and [it is] also very clear that the player doesn't consider any other possibility, only United.\"",
      "Elsewhere, Juventus have reportedly opened talks with United around a move for out-of-favour winger Jadon Sancho but it will be 'complicated' to complete. Sancho was once again omitted from Erik ten Hag's matchday squad for their loss to Brighton, the second straight game this season he's been left out.",
      "Both player and manager drew a line in the sand after a spat between them last September saw the star exiled from the first team for the entire season, but GIVEMESPORT is reporting that the Red Devils are looking at a £40m sale for the 24-year-old, while the Serie A side would prefer to sign him on loan.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer window may be coming to an end but there is still the potential for a few deals to be done before next Friday.",
      "The Reds have added a few senior players to their squad this summer with defenders Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui joining striker Joshua Zirkzee at the club. MEN Sport understands a deal for Manuel Ugarte is edging closer with United confident of getting a deal over the line.",
      "But as is the way in modern football, there is always room for more work to be done in the market. In our latest look at the media headlines we analyse the latest on Jadon Sancho's future as well as another potential arrival.",
      "According to Sky Sports’ Dharmesh Sheth, Juventus have an interest in bringing Sancho to their club this summer. It is believed that with a week to go in the window, the Turin club have become open to making their interest in the winger formal and have discussed personal terms with the Reds.",
      "United are thought to be open to considering reasonable bids for Sancho before the window closes.",
      "What MEN Sport says: United are open to selling Sancho before the window metaphorically slams shut and Erik ten Hag's comments during his pre-match press conference suggests not everything is as rosy as it may seem after the hatchet was buried between the player and the manager. Where United could struggle is getting a team to match his wage or Sancho considering a move which is lower than his current salary. Few clubs will be willing to spend £250,000 per week on the Englishman currently so the Reds may need to be pragmatic should they want Sancho off the books.",
      "According to Sport, United and Tottenham Hotspur are battling it out to sign Barcelona defender Andreas Christensen this summer. The former Chelsea man is thought to be willing to contemplate a move away from Catalonia after the emergence of wonderkid Pau Cubarsi.",
      "This fact, coupled with Barca's financial difficulties, has alerted both United and Spurs to the centre-back's possible availability before the deadline.",
      "What MEN Sport says: Adding a third centre-back this summer on the cheap would be the dream scenario for boss Ten Hag. At the beginning of the window, the ideal situation would be for the Reds to bring in three centre-backs into the team to compliment Lisandro Martinez. That has looked less and less likely as time has progressed but you have to say it would be perfect if a player like Christensen was to join, particularly because of his versatility.",

      "Maguire has not been this valued at United in almost three years. His strengths were more obvious when he was absent for the 2020-21 run-in as United sieved nine goals in five matches. Maguire recovered from injury to earn a place in the European Championship team of the tournament.",
      "The 31-year-old is arguably enjoying his best preparation for a major international finals. He was not visible in the training imagery United published on Tuesday but there is ample time to recover for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Coventry City.",
      "At last year's semi-final, Maguire was reeling from his role in United's two-legged collapse to Sevilla in the Europa League quarter-final. Without him on the pitch, United led 2-0. With Maguire on the pitch, they lost 5-0. He did not see Erik Lamela coming when his blind pass was intercepted and Youssef En-Nesyri got the fiesta started in the second leg.",
      "Maguire was suspended for the Cup semi-final against Brighton three days later. He still travelled and loitered during the stoppages. Some keyboard warriors attempted to vilify him for not engaging with the players as much as matchday captain Bruno Fernandes. Maguire was never going to pull rank and pull his kit on like John Terry.",
      "This weekend, Maguire is as certain to start at Wembley as the inheritor of his armband (if fit). United's other four senior centre halves are sidelined for the rest of the month, two are out of contract in June and Victor Lindelof is next year.",
      "Gutting an entire department can leave you without organs. United let Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra go in the summer of 2014 and only brought in one out-and-out defender in Marcos Rojo. The memory of Rojo once caused Ryan Giggs, United's assistant manager back then, to shake his head.",
      "Louis van Gaal thought Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans would be robust enough. Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair were drafted in. Daley Blind had to be rebranded as a centre back the following season.",
      "Maguire's contract has a maximum expiry date of 2026. He had one foot out of the door in the summer but he is now likely to stay. He is fit and not as urgent or obvious a sale as Lindelof.",
      "United still have a goal difference of -1 and the wall in front of their back four is made of plaster. Casemiro is on his last legs but would still start on one leg, such is the peripheral status of Sofyan Amrabat. The Moroccan has started one game in four months.",
      "Amrabat will be returned to Fiorentina and the retirement home of the Saudi Pro League is calling for Casemiro. Christian Eriksen has another year left on his contract but has started once this calendar year.",
      "Scott McTominay's contract length is the same as Maguire's and he might have been elsewhere by now had United not encountered a problem in Houston with Kobbie Mainoo's ankle injury. Selling academy graduate McTominay would represent pure profit with the profitability and sustainability rules.",
      "United valued McTominay at £40million last summer and he is enjoying his best goalscoring season. There is also the cachet of representing Scotland at the Euros. His value is far greater now, possibly too great for an ambitious Premier League club to table a bid.",
      "Anthony Martial is going and Jadon Sancho, Antony, Mason Greenwood, Amad and Facundo Pellistri could or should go. Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho are the only forwards assured of returning to Carrington when the summer transfer window closes.",
      "However mutually beneficial a departure would be for club and player, there may not be a market for Marcus Rashford. 'Can't' is on the Ineos compass of words they don't like, though.",
      "Some would argue United can't sell Maguire.",

      "A figure who deals with recruitment elsewhere in the Premier League succinctly summed up the problem that Jason Wilcox will face when he tries to cut deals for Manchester United this summer. \"When United call they get quoted £40million for a player available for £10million.\"",
      "Recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford will understand that assessment. Those working at the club have long referred to what is called the 'United tax'. As soon as they enquire about a player the price rockets, purely because they are Manchester United.",
      "They encountered it in Erik ten Hag's first window, when then football director John Murtough enquired about a young player with the knowledge that another club were close to a deal for £15million. That will be £28million please. \"You're Manchester United, you've got loads of money,\" Murtough was told.",
      "The irony here is, of course, that they really do not. Not in terms of transfer budget anyway. They are sailing close to the wind when it comes to the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) and having missed out on Champions League football they will see that war chest shrink even more.",
      "That reality is unlikely to stop clubs from trying to profit from United. A history of overpaying for transfers has contributed to that tax, let's not forget. Real Madrid and Ajax were delighted with the £70million and £85million they received for Casemiro and Antony a couple of years ago.",
      "This is a perception the new leadership team at United have to change. Despite on-field stagnation, they remain a giant of a football club in the minds of all their rivals and one that have the financial resources to be pushed around. That has to change because at the moment it isn't the case. Financial rules laid down by UEFA and the Premier League mean clubs can't spend that freely now even if they wanted to.",
      "In time it will be Dan Ashworth driving the change under Ineos to become a shrewder football club when it comes to recruitment decisions, but with the 53-year-old still on gardening leave from Newcastle United, technical director Wilcox is currently leading plans for this window.",
      "United will have to sell to fund the kind of moves they want to make, with a central defender and a striker at the very top of the priorities. Three key first-team incomings is the aim and more could arrive, but to achieve that several players will have to be sold.",
      "Wilcox will also have to show his recruitment acumen to get good deals in place for the players United target. It is going to make it difficult to recruit players from the Premier League, such as Jarrad Branthwaite and Ivan Toney, given selling clubs in the league usually stick a premium on top anyway.",
      "It's going to be a crucial first window with Ineos steering the direction of the football club as well. United's rapid decline this season has shown that improvements are required, but conversely, the slump has reduced the budget. It can easily become a catch-22 situation, you don't have the funds to close the gap to the top four and so you don't, which means you miss out on that crucial Champions League revenue the following season.",
      "That makes this a window they just have to nail. They can't afford for selling clubs to try and exploit that United tax.",

      "Of the Manchester United starting XI at West Ham in May, five at the very most will walk out for the Premier League anthem at the London Stadium on Saturday.",
      "Aaron Wan-Bissaka's recall is enforced by Diogo Dalot's suspension but Marcus Rashford cannot be certain of a return. Captain Bruno Fernandes can.",
      "The misfiring Antony is not assured of keeping his place and Christian Eriksen, back in team training this week, will likely be on the bench. Luke Shaw was in the midst of an accomplished run at centre half and Victor Lindelof was an ever-present. Tyrell Malacia has made one start since and required two rounds of surgery on his knee while Casemiro's absence with a hamstring problem is 51 days and counting.",
      "Of the starters seven months ago, only David de Gea and Wout Weghorst have permanently left but the lack of continuity partly accounts for United's erratic form in Erik ten Hag's second season.",
      "De Gea's flimsy attempt to repel Said Benrahma's back-pass of a shot was one of the last nails in his coffin. Ilkay Gundogan hammered in the last at Wembley a month later.",
      "As costly as De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, has been in the Champions League, there are bigger problems up the other end. United have not scored in three games.",
      "That last happened more recently than some may think - February and March 2021 during a stultifying streak of three goalless draws. Failure to score at West Ham would see another post-Ferguson record tumble: United have never gone four games without a goal since the Scot headed upstairs to the Old Trafford directors' box.",
      "There are uncomfortable parallels between Ten Hag's second season and Louis van Gaal's. United have four goals fewer than they did after 17 Premier League games in that soporific 2015-16 campaign, three more defeats and a point fewer.",
      "Only one of United's nine wins has been by more than a one-goal margin and the 3-0 defeat of Everton looks an anomaly. United were uncharacteristically clinical that day with three goals from four attempts on target: a wonder goal, a penalty and a counter-attack.",
      "The difference between the Dutch managers is there were growing calls for Van Gaal to go during his winter of discontent. United did not win a single game out of eight in December, lost four in succession and went out at the Champions League group stage.",
      "The tight turnaround post-Christmas of a game on Boxing Day at Stoke and against Chelsea on December 28 essentially reprieved Van Gaal. United were spirited and enterprising in a goalless draw with champions Chelsea, hitting the woodwork twice on a night United-themed Jose Mourinho scarves were sold on the Old Trafford forecourt amid the possibility of a mid-season approach.",
      "Ten Hag does not face a similar threat. The Ineos Group's minority stake has still not been ratified at the time of writing and the sole kingmaker at a club with an interim chief executive and a football director on borrowed time is the absentee landlord Joel Glazer.",
      "There is not an obvious and available upgrade as there was with Mourinho. The majority of United supporters would rather have Ten Hag over Graham Potter, a fine coach who oversaw magnificent progress with Brighton, but is more suited to succeeding Gareth Southgate as England manager after the European Championship.",
      "Potter is only at the top of bookies' chalkboards as he is free. He is followed by Zinedine Zidane and Julen Lopetegui, also both out of work. Antonio Conte and Hansi Flick are also up there.",
      "Fan power contributed to Van Gaal's downfall as thousands of season-ticket holders threatened not to renew if he remained for a third term. Ten Hag does not face a similar threat and authority to the United manager's role was restored with his appointment. Removing him would empower the minority of players looking to wait it out. The specific booing of a gaggle of players against Bournemouth was significant.",
      "United bowed to player power by sacking Mourinho a week before Christmas in 2018. Van Gaal's methods irked several players who continued to undermine him days before the FA Cup final but the spectre of Mourinho was ample motivation not to down tools. There was also the glory of the FA Cup to play for.",
      "Half-term reports are due after Boxing Day and it is already an unflattering look for United to have lost more games than they have won. United have a variable record at the London Stadium of three wins, three defeats and one draw. Ed Woodward later admitted the loss under Mourinho was one of the most difficult defeats he endured in September 2018.",

      "Sancho has not played since August 26 and he's been on an individual training plan since falling out with Erik ten Hag, who responded to his extraordinary outburst on social media by banishing him from the squad. It's been a great shame to see a chapter of his career - the world was once at his feet - wasted over something that should have been quickly quashed, but it would be foolish to underestimate egos in football.",
      "Although Sancho is remarkably the last United forward to have scored a home Premier League goal, he hasn't been missed and he's expected to leave in the January transfer window.",
      "\"It is about a culture and every player has to match certain standards,\" said Ten Hag two weeks ago. \"What will happen there, he knows what he has to do if he wants to return and it is up to him. We will see what will happen.\"",
      "Sancho has, rather crucially, still not apologised and that's why the stalemate with his manager has rumbled on into the winter. The player strongly believes he's not done anything wrong and he's refused to back down.",
      "Whoever Sancho is taking advice from clearly isn't qualified to provide him with counsel. His stubbornness has cost him months of his career and it wouldn't have taken much to apologise without meaning it.",
      "Sancho is known to be a pleasant and likeable person, from regularly engaging with fans to opening a pitch for kids where he grew up. However, there seems to be a lack of discipline in his life and Nemanja Matic recently said he was regularly late to training. There have also been timekeeping issues when he's represented England and Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Sancho needs to address that to progress in his career, but an apology is all he needs to make right now. Yet it's clear that's not going to happen and that his ego is standing in the way of a resolution. Interestingly, Raphael Varane this week discussed the challenge of becoming an elite player in a lengthy post on LinkedIn - where he doesn't post often - and he spoke of the importance of controlling ego.",
      "He wrote: \"As someone who has played international and Champions League football, I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I also know what is required to get here. A critical element of reaching the top level is making the right decisions for yourself.",
      "\"Many of these decisions stem from ego, something that for me is one of the most important things to keep control of, and can give you a better mentality when used correctly. In football and in life, I have found that, as long as you have a strong mindset and continue to act on it, you can reach new heights.",
      "\"The accolades and recognition you get are a consequence of the decisions you make. If you focus on the process and enjoy the small improvements rather than only focusing on the result, you can always achieve great things.\"",
      "It would be wrong to suggest a post from Varane was a subliminal message to Sancho but sometimes the shoe fits and it's the type of advice he should be listening to instead of refusing to apologise. Furthermore, Varane is well-placed to give such advice after falling out of favour with Ten Hag himself and seeing Jonny Evans start over him.",
      "Varane has started the last two games against Bayern Munich and Liverpool and it would be bizarre to see him moved back to the bench in the coming weeks considering his performance at Anfield.",

The United technical director has to walk past the front row of journalists in the press box to take his seat with the United analysts towards the back of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand. Occasionally, he will wave at his sons and wife Hayley.",

Fletcher first encountered a hirsute Van der Gaag when he collected stickers for his Scottish Premiership album in the mid-90s. Van der Gaag spent two years at Motherwell.",
      "Jack Fletcher first got the call to head across from the academy building, past the 'fountain of youth' and into the main team hub at Carrington in November. He has trained a handful of times with the first team while Tyler has started twice for the youth team.",
      "It is worth reminding the Fletchers do not turn 17 until March 19. The Manchester-born brothers have played for England and Scotland at youth level and Tyler has pledged his allegiance to Scotland while Jack has chosen to represent England.",

      "Jack was virtuoso in the FA Youth Cup win against Derby County at Old Trafford last month and his raking half-volleyed pass made it possible for Ethan Williams to notch the only goal. Fletcher's technique made Ben Thornley, the fleet-footed Class of '92 winger on co-commentary for MUTV in the press box, purr before it had even reached Ethan Wheatley.",

He ended the game bickering with an opponent. Fletcher's father excelled at playing the opponent rather than the occasion and Jack will have to learn from a galling evening in Wiltshire.",
      "United are reluctant to elaborate on the Fletcher twins' development. A source said staff want to \"keep it as low-key as possible\", perhaps conscious of overhyping two lads who would be in Year 12 if still at school, or fuelling any accusations of nepotism. An early ejection from the Youth Cup vindicates the reticence.",

      "Dan Gore couldn't help but smile throughout his post-match interview after making his Manchester United debut.",
      "Gore made his senior bow against Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and he fought an excitable grin as he answered questions. The game also coincided with his 19th birthday and his family were present to enjoy the occasion, which Gore described as 'truly special' after growing up supporting the club.",
      "“It tops the list of birthdays,\" Gore said while trying to keep his composure. \"I don’t think words can describe that feeling, seeing the fans, it is everything you’ve dreamed of, coming true. It means everything.\"",
      "Gore became the 247th player to make his debut from the academy that night, reward for making excellent progress and convincing Erik ten Hag he was ready.",
      "He trained with the first-team for 12 weeks before his debut and is known to 'train every day like his life depends on it', something which his former coaches at Burnley loved about him.",
      "Although Gore is a Salford-lad and he idolised Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo when he was a kid, he only joined United in 2018, having previously been at Burnley where he played as a forward, not a midfielder.",
      "\"He first came through the door when he was seven or eight,\" Lewis Craig told the Manchester Evening News. \"Burnley were very good at recruiting the Scouse and Manc kids and Dan was a raw, inner-city Manchester lad.",
      "\"Those types seemed to have that little bit more extra bite than your local kids. He was a forward when he came to us and he’d either play wide left or right or as the number nine and he was the top scorer through his age groups.",
      "\"He was quick and very strong for his size. He always had aggression and he was one of the kids who played on the edge, in terms of maybe making the odd bad challenge, but it was interesting because he was always respectful.",
      "\"He had great finishing ability in his younger years, one-on-one, going past people and he always had that bit where he was a winner. If he was getting beat, there was nobody on the pitch who hated it more and you could see that fire in him. Dan had that brilliant, real f****** horrible side to him, but he'd always be respectful with coaches and it wasn't a surprise when I saw him three months ago and he ran over and gave me a hug when I hadn’t seen him for years.\"",
      "Gore joined United at 13 and the decision was made to drop him deeper into midfield. \"My last day working for Burnley, I had to deliver his review to his dad,\" Craig said when asked about his position change.",
      "\"Although he was a great striker, I didn’t think he scored poachers goals, like your Harry Kane or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. He scored amazing goals and he was off the charts, but I thought he could be a better instinctive finisher.",
      "\"I remember his dad saying thank you because all he'd had for a couple of years was people telling him how good he was and nobody had said things to work on. He was prolific and he’d beat a few men and fire one into the top corner, but if someone wrapped a ball across the 18-yard box at speed, he probably didn’t have that instinctive finish in him every time.",
      "\"But he worked on it religiously. He always worked on stuff and he was in training early, even as a kid. I never pictured him as a midfielder because although his awareness was decent, it's different playing in that role. He’s developed his awareness now and when I see him driving the ball in midfield, it’s similar to how he played back then.\"",
      "Mike Hargreaves, who considers Gore as the best young player he's encountered, is another former Burnley coach who worked with the youngster and he spoke to the MEN about that period.",
      "\"I worked with Danny at Burnley from Under-9s to Under-12s and I took that age group all the way through, so I worked with him for quite a while, and outside of Burnley with my own coaching,\" Hargreaves said.",
      "\"Some of the things I’ve seen him do for United, he’s been doing since back then. He’s dropped deeper now, but when he played up front for Burnley he'd score over 100 goals each season and I’m not even exaggerating.",
      "\"There was a game at Blackburn once when we built possession well, Dan picked the ball up inside his own half and he just started running past people and he ended up finishing it off, which was unbelievable. There was another time when he faced someone up, stopped the ball dead and did the Yannick Bolaise showboating thing when he bent down and flicked the grass, so he had a little bit of cheekiness about him.",
      "\"He was a matchwinner and they were a really good group. I always thought It was just a matter of time before United would come in for him and I always expected that. I can’t think of many times he didn't have a good day.\"",
      "Hargreaves continued: \"His real stand-out qualities were he was hard-working, aggressive, he put himself about and he was a really exciting dribbler. He was fantastic with the ball and capable of sprinting repeatedly. His speed endurance was phenomenal, even at those ages. His attitude was great and he was demanding of his teammates and the standards of the session.",
      "\"Towards the end of Under-11s, we had a tournament on Blackpool’s pitch and it was a full-day affair. We played United in the final of that and Danny scored. They were just completely top draw that day as a group.",
      "\"I remember building up to that tournament for a few weeks and reiterating what we were building up to and you’d see a change in him, almost like a switch being flicked and a refocus. You could see he wanted to win.\"",
      "The burning desire to improve and win has seen Gore become a member of the first-team squad with Ten Hag in charge and he's worn the captain's armband when playing in academy matches this season.",
      "\"He’s captain material I'd say,\" Craig added. \"Almost like your old-school Roy Keane type with hard challenges, but he’s got unbelievable quality on the ball because he was a forward in the past as well.",
      "\"In that Under-21 group at United, there have been the likes of Shola Shoretire and Isak Hasen-Aaroen but it seems like there's been something missing in them, which doesn’t seem to be the case with Dan. If you leave him in an environment long enough he thrives and I think it's fair to say that Dan wasn’t a Burnley type of player, in the sense that he was probably beyond Burnley in terms of his ability.",
      "\"He would have played for Burnley’s first-team if he was still there and Sean Dyche would have been all over him, but there was always an acceptance of Dan was Salford, Man United and there were murmurings going on in the background. Kids get poached in academies all the time, but I think Burnley got looked after with the deal when he did go over. And I think he was given certain guarantees because United knew the talent they were getting.\"",
      "Gore was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side in 2022 and although Alejandro Garnacho was the poster boy of that campaign, his partnership with Kobbie Mainoo in midfield was instrumental in the success. More than 60,000 supporters watched the final at Old Trafford and Gore kissed the badge when the full time whistle went. It wasn't a surprise for a boy who used to wear a red thermal vest under his Burnley shirt.",
      "\"You can tell what Manchester United means to him when he plays,\" Craig said. \"I went to the Youth Cup final and I just thought he was outstanding, doing the horrible side of the game really well.",
      "\"I thought out of possession, Dan was excellent, picking up second balls and showing all the stuff he's added to his game as a midfielder and you can see he's got a real understanding of the game now.\"",
      "Hargreaves was also in the crowd and he briefly talked to Gore during the celebrations. \"I saw him right at the end when they were doing the lap of honour because I was sitting near the front, so I went down and shouted.",
      "\"He said 'aaaah Mike!' and I congratulated him, so it was nice to have that moment and I did have to laugh because near the end of the Youth Cup final, he was tapping his head and telling people to focus.",
      "\"That’s stuck with me because it’s something I do myself. We had great times at Burnley and he was the star of the group. I’ve got a great relationship with him and his dad, who was always very grateful for us looking after him.\"",
      "Gore has been on an upward trajectory since and Bruno Fernandes is understood to have been very welcoming to the youngster, taking a hands-on role in his integration into the first-team. Sources have also indicated Jonny Evans has been especially supportive and offered Gore plenty of advice since they started training together in mid-July, which the 19-year-old has appreciated.",
      "\"You’re around top players every day at United and you either adapt or die,\" Craig said. \"Even if he ends up making 100 appearances for United in the Premier League or with another club, he'll get the most out of himself.",
      "\"Ten Hag has been known for developing youngsters at Ajax and he doesn’t put people in who aren’t good enough. I'm really proud of him and it's lovely when you bump into him, or get a text.\"",
      "Hargreaves echoed those comments: \"It’s been brilliant to see him progress and I’m a United fan myself, so I'm extremely pleased because it's more than he deserves. I genuinely think he embodies what a United player should be, bringing excitement, being hard-working and holding himself in the right way.\"",
      "Gore recently shaved his head - going for a buzzcut style - and there was a large smile on his face when he revealed his new haircut to his amused teammates at Carrington. That wide grin doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon.",

      "Gary Neville has criticised Casemiro for his role in Brighton's late winning goal against Manchester United, accusing him of a \"lack of concentration\" as he left his position at the back post.",
      "Erik ten Hag's side suffered their first defeat of the season with a 2-1 loss to the Seagulls. Former United forward Danny Welbeck scored an opener in the first half, which was cancelled out by Amad after the break.",
      "However, Joao Pedro's stoppage-time header sealed the win for Brighton, adding to the Red Devils' woes after a challenging campaign last season. The team's defensive abilities were once again under scrutiny.",
      "Neville believes this result puts significant pressure on Ten Hag early in the season, particularly with an upcoming match against Liverpool. He singled out Casemiro for criticism, noting that the Brazilian had abandoned his post at the back before moving into midfield, leaving Pedro unmarked to score the decisive goal.",
      "\"Really depressing end to the game,\" he told NBC Sports. \"I thought a draw would've been half acceptable but to lose the game, it puts an awful lot of pressure, I think, on Erik ten Hag and on towards the game next week against Liverpool,\" reports the Mirror.",
      "Neville also commented on United's struggle in the first half without a clear centre forward, with Joshua Zirkzee only brought on for the second half - saying they \"wasted 45 minutes\".",
      "He commented: \"Then in the second half, the first goal as well was poor defensively, that last goal, I've just watched it then coming up to the gantry. When you clear from a corner, you've got to still defend as you're defending the second phase of a corner. I think particularly if you watch Casemiro, it looks to me, I've only watched it once back on the replay, it looks like he leaves his position at that back post and runs back towards central midfield.",
      "\"But then it leaves an acre of space in that back zone where there are three Brighton players queuing up. Lack of concentration, lack of focus and it does put some pressure on them.\"",
      "After the match, Ten Hag was openly critical about his team's performance, conceding that he had hoped for better execution and labelled both goals conceded against Brighton as \"soft\".",
      "\"There was more than one mistake. We have to talk about it,\" he said. \"We were close to winning this game, but definitely shouldn't lose the game. Today we should do better. In the Community Shield we should do better. Both goals are very soft goals. We should have done better.",

      "Manchester United suffered their first defeat of the season as they conceded an injury-time winner to Brighton at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Danny Welbeck had given the Seagulls a first-half lead and United rode their luck early in the second half before Amad equalised, cutting inside to finish with the ball deflecting in off a defender.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho then had a goal disallowed when his finish hit Joshua Zirkzee on the line, with the striker trying to get out of the way having slid in to try and convert Bruno Fernandes' cross.",
      "United looked like they were going to earn a hard-fought point but they defended a corner poorly in injury time and left acres of space for Joao Pedro to win it with a header.",
      "Pressing improvements",
      "One of the biggest improvements visible in this team in the first two weeks of the Premier League season is their pressing, both in terms of the structure and how aggressive they are when they do go.",
      "It certainly helps having Fernandes as a false nine, which also creates room for Mason Mount to play just behind him. Both are energetic harriers and Mount's intelligence in the press is a valuable weapon. It was noticeable he was instructing teammates when to follow him against Brighton.",
      "Fernandes twice caused panic from Lewis Dunk when closing him down quicker than expected, with Dunk forced to concede a sloppy corner in the opening stages. United's pressing is winning them possession in dangerous areas this season.",
      "That is perhaps a sign that the coaching changes are paying dividends. Rene Hake gave up a head coach job at Go Ahead Eagles to join United. They had an excellent season in the Eredivisie last term and while they were a flexible team, they were capable of pressing aggressively. It was a feature of their game.",
      "Hake looks to have influenced United in the same way and we can expect them to spend most of the season pressing like this. There looks to be a much better structure to United even at this early stage of the season and the desire from executives for Ten Hag to overhaul his coaching team already looks to be a smart call.",
      "Chaotic ending",
      "For all that United have improved on last season the final 20 minutes of this game were wildly open and it was Brighton who looked more likely to win it.",
      "It wasn't as chaotic as it often was last season until the game reached the closing stages and as United pushed for a winner, they left themselves open. The play swung one way and then another but in the final few minutes it was all Brighton.",
      "This is the area United needed to improve from last season and it isn't good news for Ten Hag that his team still look so open and so messy at certain moments. It was a disastrous ending for him and he had a face of thunder at the final whistle.",
      "In his post-match press conference, he lamented the failure to stop the cross but that was only one of the errors that contributed to the goal. He referenced the late concession against Manchester City in the Community Shield and lamented his side's failure to settle for what would have been a good point.",
      "Instead, it felt like they chased it as the game wore on. Having scored late against Fulham when they also opened the game up, they banked on a similar outcome. This time they were the ones getting stung.",
      "Maguire's costly mistake?",
      "There is no doubt Harry Maguire deserved to keep his place in the United side on his form of last season and his performance against Fulham, but if Ten Hag is looking for a reason to make a change and bring in Matthijs de Ligt, then he might have found it.",
      "Maguire's hesitancy in dealing with Joao Pedro's cross cost United after a good start against Brighton. Maguire and Noussair Mazraoui could have put the ball behind, but they dithered over what was an excellent cross. It allowed the ball to travel through to Karou Mitoma and then nobody picked up Danny Welbeck in the second phase of the attack.",
      "De Ligt is surely seen as the long-term partner for Lisandro Martinez this season and Maguire's one moment of uncertainty might mean the change is now made ahead of the fixture against Liverpool next weekend.",
      "Mount heading for familiar role",
      "This was as productive a 45 minutes as Mount has produced in the Premier League for United, adding quality on the ball to his excellence off it, but it also inevitable that he would be the one to make way when Ten Hag called for a striker to come on.",
      "Mount has had a good pre-season and has some momentum behind him at United for the first time, but he's also just not going to crack that first-choice midfield at the moment. As captain and most influential player, Fernandes is the first name on the teamsheet and Ten Hag described Kobbie Mainoo as the 'perfect midfielder' this week.",
      "That leaves Mount waiting for his chances. If Zirkzee comes in from the start next week then it's Mount who will miss out. Ten Hag wants depth this season and he wants two players for every position. He certainly has competitive in midfield and the England midfielder is an excellent squad option, but he will want more than that.",
      "New faces made to wait",
      "It's been a noticeable trend at the start of the season that not many of the players signed by Premier League clubs have gone straight into their new teams and that was certainly the case at the Amex.",
      "These two teams have spent more than £300m this summer but each fielded just one new signing. For United that was the cheapest of their new quarter in Noussair Mazraoui, with De Ligt made to wait behind Harry Maguire and Zirkzee still only selected on the bench.",
      "The Seagulls fielded Yankuba Minteh from the start and had club-record buy Georgino Rutter on the bench, but it's a case of being eased in for most of their new players. So while the Premier League has splashed the cash again, we're yet to see the full impact of so many of the new players.",

      "Jadon Sancho faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford as the clock ticks down to 11pm next Friday night.",
      "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag re-integrated the former Borussia Dortmund forward into the first-team this summer - despite their public spat last season - but with competition in his position and Sancho still a sellable asset there is an 'openness' to let him leave. The 24-year-old is among five United players who could be sold.",
      "Reported interest from Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea and Dortmund, where Sancho returned on loan to during the January window, present different proposed options on the table for him. Here, our writers discuss what he should do next and contemplate the best choice for United to maximise his value;",
      "For United, a decision on Sancho’s future should be all about the offers that arrive for the winger between now and deadline day. Juventus are the most heavily linked, but it is said that the club want a loan deal.",
      "United should only accept if the deal has an obligation to buy at the £40 million asking price that the club have set. A pure loan deal without an obligation, especially if United are contributing to some of the player’s wages, doesn’t seem to have many benefits for the club.",
      "It feels that unless United get the £40million asking price, either in a permanent deal or a loan with an obligation, then it may be better just keeping him at the club.",
      "The falling out between Sancho and Ten Hag seems to have been resolved, and the player has previously shown that he has the quality to make a difference in the Premier League. If he can re-find the form he showed for Borussia Dortmund in the second half of last season at Old Trafford, then it’ll only be a good thing for United this season.",
      "Despite it looking as though water had been firmly placed under the bridge between Erik ten Hag and Jadon Sancho, the latter could still depart Manchester United.",
      "Off the back of a fruitful loan spell at Borussia Dortmund, it is no surprise that interested suitors were queuing up outside Old Trafford, figuratively of course, with the view of taking on Sancho's services permanently. Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea all seem to have a genuine interest in the winger with the Italian club hot favourites.",
      "Sanctioning a loan departure is rather pointless, unless the deal includes a lucrative buy-option clause, with there no guarantee his value will have increased 12 months from now. Given the options out wide that Ten Hag has at his disposal, I think the club are better off keeping Sancho unless an offer in the region of £40million arrives.",
      "He won't be a starter at United but he will add some needed depth considering the struggles of Marcus Rashford and the injury issues both Antony and Rasmus Hojlund have faced since their respective arrivals.",
      "It has been a summer of back and forth for Sancho and United. It would almost be more of a twist at this stage if he wasn't to leave.",
      "The biggest thing will be getting a good price back. Given what has gone on it's not ridiculous that £40million is the benchmark, and with the sides who have shown interest so far being able to pay that sort of money, United can hold out.",
      "Sancho himself needs to be open as well. He is not going to get the wages that United are currently paying him. If he can come to a compromise and likes the prospective clubs available then it would suit all parties.",
      "As for where he ends up, that is a harder one to predict. Juventus have the need but are not as attractive as they used to be. PSG have the money but also a stacked frontline already, whilst Chelsea just aren't worth thinking about.",
      "Previous interest in Trevoh Chalobah and Ben Chilwell could leave a possible swap-deal open with the Blues but would that actually benefit United? Probably not. A straight-up cash sale is United's best bet here but it might not be for their suitors.",
      "I think both club and player need a fresh start and after the latest reports that Sancho would like to leave, United shouldn't stand in his way. After being left out of the Premier League opener with Fulham, the Athletic report Sancho reacted to the decision by 'reaffirming his desire to leave.'",
      "United should try and recoup as much as possible this summer while there is interest off the back of an impressive loan at Borussia Dortmund. However, at this stage, another loan move would be pointless as the club would prefer to get some funds after their summer spending so far.",
      "Having been valued at £40m after United paid a hefty £73m for his services, is an achievable fee for most clubs. But his high wages may come in the way of a potential transfer coming to fruition, however.",
      "If United are unable to offload him between now and the end of the transfer window, it may be beneficial for him to stick around to offer Ten Hag more squad depth. If he impresses between now and January, clubs could come in for him.",
      "In an ideal world, United would be able to cash in and recoup as much money as possible for Sancho, who set the club back £73million when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was manager. The former Manchester City youngster has no way near managed to repay that transfer fee or indeed the faith shown in him.",
      "Of course, there have been a few mitigating circumstances. Now, though, the onus is on United to sell and sell him quickly as his value will only go one way with another 12 months in the backdrop.",
      "Chelsea might (rightly) be considered as rivals if the Blues can get their house in order this season. However, at the risk of, potentially, strengthening another top-four contender, United must recognise the financial clout possessed at Stamford Bridge and take advantage; they have an open dialling line from Mason Mount moving in the opposite direction and that should prove useful.",
      "A match that had so much promise to be one made in heaven, hasn't transpired how any Manchester United fan would have wanted it to. Jadon Sancho has some memories from his time at Old Trafford whether it's goals away at Chelsea or openers against Liverpool.",
      "The relationship with Erik ten Hag has frayed and, already, the England international has been missing from a matchday this season. With two years remaining on his contract, it's best for United to cut their losses in order to recoup some of the reported £73million fee that they paid Borussia Dortmund for his services.",
      "Arguably, Sancho's stock is at its highest after his exploits at Signal Iduna Park last season. The 24-year-old returned to the club where he made his name and shone for Edin Terzic's side, helping them to the Champions League - where they were beaten by Real Madrid.",
      "With reports of Paris Saint-Germain's interest, the question remains where Sancho ranks in the pecking order with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho battling for the left-wing berth. On the opposite side, there are the likes of Antony and Amad, who has impressed when called upon by Ten Hag.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is reportedly set to begin his battle to overturn a four-year doping ban at the Court of Arbitration for Sport next week.",
      "The 31-year-old, who cost United a world-record £89m in 2016, was slapped with a four-year ban earlier this year after failing a drugs test following Juventus' 3-0 win against Udinese last August.",
      "Pogba's suspension came after Italy's anti-doping tribunal, NADO, found elevated levels of testosterone in his system. The positive test was later confirmed after a second sample was tested in October and resulted in Pogba being slapped with a four-year suspension from the game.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Pogba's appeal is set to be heard by CAS next week just days after the midfielder was provided with fresh hope that he could reverse his career-ending ban.",
      "That's after world No.1 tennis player Jannik Sinner escaped a ban despite failing two anti-doping tests back in March. The Italian was initially slapped with a suspension but later saw it overturned after he claimed that his positive test for the banned anabolic steroid clostebol was a result of contamination through his physiotherapist.",
      "The Mail adds that the ruling surrounding Sinner has been \"acknowledged\" by the Pogba camp and will be a \"key development\" as the 2018 World Cup winner looks to fight his suspension.",
      "After being hit with the suspension back in February, Pogba vehemently denied the claims and insisted he was \"sad, shocked and heartbroken\" by the verdict.",
      "\"I have today been informed of the Tribunale Nazionale Antidoping’s decision and believe that the verdict is incorrect,\" said the midfielder on Instagram. \"I am sad, shocked and heartbroken that everything I have built in my professional playing career has been taken away from me.\"When I am free of legal restrictions the full story will become clear, but I have never knowingly or deliberately taken any supplements that violate anti-doping regulations.\"As a professional athlete I would never do anything to enhance my performance by using banned substances and have never disrespected or cheated fellow athletes and supporters of any of the teams I have played for, or against.\"As a consequence of the decision announced today I will appeal this before the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\"",

Noussair Mazraoui is able to cover on the left flank but there is some speculation that United may want a player who is recognised in that position.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, the Reds are monitoring Robinson as the player to provide cover at left-back. However, they are waiting to see if the London club move for Fenerbahce's Ferdi Kadioglu before making an approach for the American.",
      "The thought process is believed to be that should Kadioglu sign for Fulham, then Robinson's game time will be hampered and thus the Reds would have a better chance of bringing him to Old Trafford for a lower price. Elsewhere, Inter are reportedly set to blow United out of the water for Juventus winger Federico Chiesa.",
      "According to Sport, United are one of five teams believed to have shown an interest in the Italian winger. It is understood Chiesa would be allowed to leave Juventus should a reasonable bid be submitted.",
      "However, the Reds are unlikely to sign the 26-year-old now with Inter preparing an 'astronomical' wage offer for the forward. There is thought to be some hope for United if they find the money for a new winger as Juve would prefer to sell him to a club abroad rather than enhance a direct rival.",
      "United though would need to make a sale in the final third of the pitch before signing any more attacking players.",

      "But Ugarte was left out of the PSG squad for their opening fixture of the Ligue 1 campaign last weekend and further talks have been held between the two clubs this week, with a deal now thought to be imminent. That is likely to be a season-long loan move with an obligation to buy.",
      "United have held firm on their valuation of the Uruguayan international and there was an expectation PSG would be willing negotiators. They need to sell players after another summer of heavy spending, including signing 19-year-old midfielder Joao Neves from Benfica for €60m.",
      "United were confident of landing Ugarte a week ago and during talks for other midfielders expressed confidence that they would get a deal done. A loan move wouldn't necessitate the sale of Scott McTominay, but the club remain open to offers for Casemiro and Christian Eriksen.",
      "Ugarte would be the fifth signing of the summer after Leny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui. United have spent £156m on players so far during the window with a net spend in excess of £80m.",

      "The Uruguayn's permanent exit was confirmed with a £5.1m move to Panathinaikos on Wednesday, with a further £1.7m due in add-ons, but the most eye-catching part of the deal was the size of the sell-on United had negotiated with the Greek outfit.",
      "Whether Pellistri shines or not in Greece, United will pocket 45% of his next fee. If the 21-year-old is sold at a loss that won't amount to much, but if he thrives for regular game time and lands a bigger move, then a substantial sum could be heading back to fill the coffers at Old Trafford. Pellistri will hope to find his way back to a big five European league and United will hope he can achieve that as well.",
      "Sell-on clauses have gradually become more common in the game and United are starting to latch on. Almost all of the deals they have done for the sale of academy players this summer have included sizeable clauses and one will be included when Maxi Oyedele finalises his move to Legia Warsaw.",
      "There was what was described as a 'sizeable' sell-on clause included when Willy Kambwala left to join Villarreal and around a 50% clause included in the deal that took Mason Greenwood to Marseille. United also included a sell-on when Alvaro Fernandez joined Benfica while most agreements also include buy-back clauses.",
      "This is now the common structure when academy graduates are sold and United have made up ground in this department. They have certainly been more proactive around selling young players since Erik ten Hag arrived at the club, with Anthony Elanga, Zidane Iqbal, Matej Kovar, Teden Mengi, Axel Tuanzebe, Ethan Laird, Charlie Savage, Noam Emeran, and Marc Jurado all leaving last summer.",
      "In Ten Hag's first summer in charge James Garner was the headline academy departure, moving to Everton when a 15% sell-on clause was included. United are tending to get higher percentages now and it is sometimes worth accepting a smaller fee to land the higher clause, protecting the club if the player suddenly thrives with exposure to regular football.",
      "United are yet to see a major benefit to these deals, but it's no surprise they are getting higher clauses in deals when two former Manchester City powerbrokers now work for the club, in chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox. City lead the way when it comes to profiting from academy sales and often doing so twice.",
      "This summer they banked around £10m from the deals that took Aro Muric from Burnley to Ipswich and Douglas Luiz from Aston Villa to Juventus. They could cash-in again if James Trafford is sold by Burnley and collected twice in quick succession last year when Romeo Lavia left Southampton to sign for Chelsea.",
      "In an era defined by stricter spending controls, buy-back clauses are becoming a key weapon for big clubs. United have had to sell to buy this summer and could yet be forced to sell Scott McTominay to raise the funds to sign Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The £40m or so they have raised from selling Greenwood, Kambwala, Pellistri and Fernandez has been helpful, but the fees heading to United for that quartet won't end there.",

      "The Swedish forward ended his seven-year stay at Old Trafford last summer, completing a £15million switch to Nottingham Forest. He went on to play a key role in their 2023/24 season success, helping them stay up in the Premier League.",
      "Remaining close with many at Manchester United, the 22-year-old took to Instagram with a cryptic message following Oyedele's revelation that he's departing the Premier League giants after a 12-year spell, signing with Poland's Legia Warsaw, reports the Mirror.",
      "Although Oyedele, 19, failed to make an appearance in United's first team, he expressed deep sentiments about the club, saying it will \"always be my home\" while announcing his exit on the social media platform.",
      "\"My time at Manchester United has finally come to an end. I want to say thank you to the only club I've ever known,\" the midfielder wrote. \"Honoured to say I've been at the club for 12 years and had some unbelievable experiences with some amazing teammates.",
      "\"Thank you to all the coaches, staff and the fans, I will never forget the memories I have made at this club. I wish everyone at Manchester United all the best as I leave ready to start the next chapter of my career. This club will always be my home and once again thank you. Once a red, always a red.\"",
      "Various United talents expressed their good wishes in the comments as Oyedele announced his move to a new club, with Kobbie Mainoo writing: \"My brother, all the best\" and recent acquisition Leny Yoro adding: \"All the best bro\".",
      "Instead of leaving a message, Elanga responded to Oyedele's post with a gif displaying a character from 'The Matrix' evading bullets, which has somewhat irked fans who interpreted it as the youngster 'dodging a bullet' by leaving.",
      "Some Instagram users suggested humour was at play, with one remarking: \"probs an inside joke to them\" while another fan didn't shirk from directly addressing Elanga, implying he wasn't stellar during his tenure in Manchester, commenting: \"Let's be perfectly honest, the best thing about Elanga was his song\".",
      "One observer bluntly wrote: \"Elanga was given a chance in the United first team and couldn't hold down a spot. He simply wasn't good enough,\" and another added: \"Elanga is a hater. The path to the 1st team is as clear as daylight and Garnacho and Mainoo have shown that, so will Collyer and Amass. Not everyone can make it.\"",
      "Furthermore, several supporters pinned 'salty' and 'bitter' tags on him due to what they see as an indirect swipe at the club. Last year, after Elanga's remarks describing Nottingham Forest's 2-1 triumph over United as \"personal\" following a challenging spell at his former squad, there were rumours about a potential rift with manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "Elanga, however, quashed speculation that the Dutchman's influence led to his Old Trafford exit in a chat with SoccerNews. nl, insisting: \"Was Ten Hag the reason I left United? No, I wouldn't say that,\" adding: \"I just wanted to play, that was especially important to me. I'm young and I don't want to sit on the bench all season, you know?",
      "Sign up to our United newsletter so you never miss an update from Old Trafford this season.",
      "\"When you're young you want to play, you want to make mistakes, you want to take risks. But he wasn't the reason for my leaving. There I mainly focused on myself, not on others.\"",
      "After concluding his stint with United, tallying four goals and equal assists across 55 appearances, Elanga moved to Forest and immediately established himself within their starting lineup, scoring five goals and contributing nine assists in 40 games so far.",

      "Manchester United must have hoped this season had closed the book on last season. Already it feels like an extension of the same chapter with another defeat in added time.",
      "After Arsenal, Fulham and Chelsea gave United a dosage of their own Fergie Time medicine, Brighton are the latest. This was reminiscent of the chaos that engulfed United in Erik ten Hag's second campaign when they shipped 20 goals in the 80th minute and beyond. Brighton inflicted an added-time loss on United two seasons ago, too.",
      "United's performance peaked in the first half. They ended that behind and when they did equalise on the hour it was against the run of play. If the victory over Fulham was a performance to build on, United have already crumbled.",
      "Ten Hag's in-game management will be scrutinised again. Their midfield left their back four exposed too often again. Kobbie Mainoo appears overburdened after a taxing nine months and the cumbersome Casemiro continues to start by default. Both somehow played out the full duration.",
      "That is on United's hierarchy as much as Ten Hag, for they have still not reinforced the central midfield, which had to be prioritised. The need for Manuel Ugarte is more urgent now.",
      "Beyond Mainoo, that department is shambolic. Ten Hag instead turned to Scott McTominay on possibly his farewell appearance. Antony arrived even later and his only impact was to concede a free-kick. Christian Eriksen has as much matchday involvement as a mascot.",
      "There is possibly another injury for United to contend with, too. Mason Mount made way at the interval and his replacement, Joshua Zirkzee, was a goal-stopper rather than goalscorer.",
      "Ten Hag will dwell on Amad's chance at 0-0 and Zirkzee's fateful intervention at 1-1. For the second successive week, substitutes Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho combined, only this time the offside Zirkzee was on the line to lucklessly divert Garnacho's goalbound tap-in over the line.",
      "Garnacho had just got back to the dugout from a thorough warm up when Amad received the ball. It was soon bouncing around the Brighton net. Amad was mourning the death of his step-mother on Friday but requested to play. On this, his fifth successive Premier League start, he lashed in his fourth United goal.",
      "There are particular prerequisites for a proper United winger and Amad undeniably possesses the resilience the club's greats had. He fluffed two goalscoring opportunities in a blunt first half but was sharp with his equaliser in the second.",
      "He will rue his miscued volley in the first half. That would have made it 1-0, rather than 1-1. United's wastefulness in front of goal has cost them two effective defeats before the end of August.",
      "There was a pat on the head from Amad when he earned a breather in the 90th minute. Ruud van Nistelrooy embraced him and there was more back-slapping from teammates before their heads dropped five minutes later.",
      "Across their three fixtures this month, Amad, Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes have each squandered at least two auspicious opportunities. Garnacho and Mount were impotent against Fulham, too, and the Zirkzee bounce denied them a 2-1 advantage at Brighton.",
      "That is at least nine good or great goalscoring openings. United have scored three times. Two of the three goals they have sieved have been in the 89th and 95th minute.",
      "Wing play influenced the scoreline. Kaoru Mitoma, sorely missed by Brighton last term, capitalised on Harry Maguire's uncertainty from Joao Pedro's centre and Welbeck crowned the tenth anniversary of his departure from his boyhood club with a sixth goal against United and the 100th of his impressive career.",
      "Welbeck, hugged by Van Nistelrooy during a stoppage, was applauded by the grateful United supporters when he was withdrawn. The nippy Simon Adingra crossed for the unmarked Pedro in the 95th minute.",
      "Zirkzee was one of four substitutes to warm up at the pause and his was the most rigorous as he was put through his paces by the United fitness coach Charlie Owen. Zirkzee replaced Mount, United's standout player of the half.",
      "The second half had barely got underway and Ten Hag instructed Garnacho to prepare for his introduction. After Rashford was flagged offside again in the 56th minute, United supporters broke into a rendition of \"Viva Garnacho\", imploring Ten Hag to send on their game-changer.",
      "Garnacho soon crossed the white line for Rashford. Goalless after three games this term and his performance level has gradually waned in these opening weeks.",
      "Early on, Ten Hag recommended Rashford reposition himself elsewhere. Rashford soon switched to the other flank, out of earshot, and was trapped offside from Andre Onana's clipped pass. Rashford vented, seemingly at Onana. Back on the left, he was much more histrionic at the defensive distribution.",
      "United resolved to spring Rashford through, only he was often offside. Even in the first phase prior to his disallowed goal, Rashford strayed ahead of the final man. Van Nistelrooy, a master of manipulating the offside rule years before the inception of the Video Assistant Referee, wagged his finger.",
      "Rashford's body language and impatience bear the hallmarks of a goalscorer struggling to score goals. The first half drew to a close with Rashford attempting a crossfield punt that was blocked. He glanced at the heavens. The rainfall got heavier. Rashford was still warmly applauded by the United followers he walked past when his number flashed up.",
      "Mount set out his stall with more harrying, beckoning his teammates into the final third after cornering Jan Paul van Hecke. Mount's switch of play to accelerate an attack drew applause from the optimistic United fans.",
      "It was the best and most influential 45 minutes from Mount in a United shirt. Gallingly for him, he was removed at the interval, a change likely enforced by injury.",
      "Ten Hag was piqued by Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot's positioning for their collaborations. Seconds later, Dalot dexterously created a glaring opening for Amad entirely of his own making. A goal continued to elude United's starting forwards until Amad regained the ball.",

      "Erik ten Hag has told his Manchester United substitutes to think of themselves as \"finishers\" after seeing two of them win the game on the opening weekend of the season.",
      "United's bench has had a productive start to the season, with Alejandro Garnacho scoring as a sub in the Community Shield, before the winger came on against Fulham to set up Joshua Zirkzee's debut goal.",
      "Garnacho and Zirkzee will hope that impact will get them into the team for Saturday's Premier League fixture with Brighton but Ten Hag has designs on a deep squad this season and admits some players will have to accept not being in the matchday 20 at times.",
      "For those who do make the squad but find themselves on the bench, Ten Hag has called on them to be ready to go and win a game, just as Garnacho and Zirkzee did last week.",
      "Rebranding replacements as 'finishers' was something the coach of England's Rugby Union team Eddie Jones did, with that trick copied by Gareth Southgate during this summer's European Championship. Ten Hag now wants a similar approach from his squad, having told players they must accept they won't play every game.",
      "\"You have to accept it, make sure you are in the first XI, make sure you are in the first 20,\" he said. \"You have to prove it, show it every day on the training pitch and in every minute you can get.",
      "\"It is not only about the starters it is also about the finishers. I was very pleased last week that Zirkzee and Garnacho made the difference, one gave the assist and the other made the goal, that is what we need across the whole season. You don’t win with 11 players, in games but also between games, you need more than 11 players to win the football games.\"",
      "Ten Hag has been keen to get the message across early in the season that players will have to accept missing out at times this season, citing Jadon Sancho's reaction to not being selected against Arsenal last September as something not to be repeated.",
      "The Dutchman wants a positive reaction from his squad whatever a player's status and said the group must reflect on what happened with Sancho and take lessons from it, while explaining his stance on discussing a decision with an individual..",
      "\"I think as a squad we have to reflect on that situation, there are things that are going to happen this season and we have to deal with it because that player can make the difference in the next game, next five games, because we have players in the squad who are all capable of playing in the first 11, or at least the first 15,\" he said.",
      "\"Each case is different. You can't explain for every game, but of course when the player has questions, when he doesn't understand I am always open to a conversation. Sometimes I will take the initiative but you can't explain for every game why you make so many decisions, you can’t explain them all.\"",

      "Vincent Kompany reportedly did not want to sell Matthijs de Ligt amid claims he told the player he was his number one defender heading into the new season.",
      "De Ligt was one of four major signings for Manchester United this summer, alongside Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro and Noussair Mazraoui. According to a report from the Athletic, the player was told by Kompany that he was not responsible for his sale and that he was his number one centre-back.",
      "It's said that De Ligt's camp felt that a choice had been made at board level. However, a spokesperson for Bayern has denied that Kompany ever said 'words to that effect.'",
      "The report also claims that De Ligt's camp felt Bayern were 'playing a game' during talks over his future. When asked about those claims, Kompany said: \"It would've been so stupid of me to say something like that. It wouldn't fit with what we've planned for the entire squad. It makes no sense.\"",

      "\"He played very solidly. But we made a different decision at centre-back, and we wanted to have a left-footed player, which is why we went with Hiroki [Ito].\"",
      "De Ligt, meanwhile, was determined to reunite with his former boss Erik ten Hag after their days at Ajax. \"Erik ten Hag shaped the early stages of my career, so he knows how to get the best out of me and I cannot wait to work with him again,\" he told United club media. \"I know what it takes to succeed at the highest level, and I'm determined to continue that record at this special club.",

      "Manchester United will make another trip to the Amex Stadium to face Brighton this weekend.",
      "United began the campaign with a 1-0 win over Fulham thanks to Joshua Zirkzee, who produced the matchwinner in the 87th minute with an intelligent finish at the Stretford End.",
      "That goal from United's first signing of this summer claimed the three points and Erik ten Hag has prepared his players to claim back-to-back victories at Carrington this week.",
      "United visited Brighton from home on the final day of last season, winning 2-0 thanks to goals from Diogo Dalot and Rasmus Hojlund, although the latter is still sidelined due to a hamstring injury he sustained in pre-season, which means he will be absent from the squad again.",
      "Here are five things to look out for in the game...",

      "£43",
      "Fernandes as the false nine?",
      "Bruno Fernandes started the new Premier League season just as he finished the last - playing as a false nine. Fernandes played in that role on the final day of the 2023/24 campaign against Brighton but that experiment failed and he was unable to have his usual influence.",
      "United improved when Hojlund was introduced to the game in the second half and scored twice, with Hojlund helping set up the first and finding the back of the net to make it 2-0.",
      "Fast forward to this month, Fernandes missed two chances against Fulham and would have surely converted those on another day, but Zirkzee has momentum going into the weekend.",
      "He should start down the middle and Fernandes should be relocated to his natural position in attacking midfield, which would see Mason Mount axed from the starting side.",
      "Garnacho or Amad?",
      "After a superb pre-season, Amad started on the opening day against Fulham and whether he did enough in that game to retain his role against Brighton is questionable.",
      "Although Amad looked bright when on the ball, he wasn't in the game enough and Alejandro Garnacho provided the assist for Zirkzee's goal after replacing him on the hour mark.",
      "Garnacho also scored in the Community Shield - he took that goal brilliantly - and it feels inevitable he'll return to the starting team. The youngster has the ability to take his game to another level this term and he must eventually provide more goals and assists at crucial moments.",
      "United used Garnacho's pace to play over Brighton's highline in May and it wouldn't be a surprise to see him play another key role in the tactical plan to exploit the opposition.",
      "Brighton's new manager",
      "Brighton are one of the best-run football clubs in the world. Their data-led recruitment allows them to sign quality players for minimal fees and flip them in multi-million transfers just a few years later and that recipe for success saw them embark into European competition last term.",
      "Roberto de Zerbi led Brighton into the Europa League, but he departed at the end of last season to join Marseille and he's been replaced by Fabian Hurzeler, who is just 31 years old.",
      "Hurzeler was aged six when United won the treble in 1999 and Casemiro, Christian Eriksen and Tom Heaton are older than him. The German is a rising star in the coaching sphere and he warned Brighton would have to 'suffer' at times against United on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"I games like Manchester United there will be moments where we have to suffer together,\" he said in his press conference. \"There will be moments where maybe United control the game.",
      "\"And then you have to stand together, then you have to suffer together. I would love if the fans are still behind us and supporting us. That’s our job, to build this connection with the fans, and it only works if we give a lot of input and a lot of energy on the pitch, and a lot of intensity.”",
      "You'll not be alone in watching Saturday's game and feeling old watching Hurzeler on the sideline.",
      "De Ligt or Maguire?",
      "Matthijs De Ligt has been signed to start and the expectation is he will partner Lisandro Martinez, but Harry Maguire started on the opening day and won't give up his place without a fight.",
      "Maguire enjoyed a renaissance last term and clawed his way back into the starting side, despite losing the captaincy, and will make more starts in 2024/25 than most expect him to.",
      "The former club captain performed well against Fulham and deserves to retain his starting place this weekend, which means the wait for De Ligt's full deal should continue.",
      "Removing Maguire from the team on the back of a faultless performance would send the wrong message in the dressing room and De Ligt can contribute off the bench again.",
      "Has anyone seen Sancho?",
      "Jadon Sancho was a notable absentee when United faced Fulham and Ten Hag, speaking to journalists after the win, confirmed that was partly due to an ear infection and partly tactical.",
      "Ten Hag clarified that Sancho was fit enough to be included in the 20-man quad but he opted to name Garnacho, Zirkzee and Antony as the attacking substitutes instead.",
      "The 24-year-old has been pictured in training ahead of the Brighton game but he could be left out again, which shouldn't be a surprise given his situation with the United boss last season.",
      "Ideally, Sancho would be sold in this summer transfer window, however, there are six days remaining for business and there doesn't seem to be a market for him.",

      "Manchester United have done the heavy lifting when it comes to their recruitment drive this summer.",
      "However, with nine days remaining for Premier League clubs to strike up further business, there might yet be more to come from Ineos and key figures behind the scenes. United are still in the market for another midfielder and their prime candidate - as it has been for several weeks - is Manuel Ugarte from PSG.",
      "It was thought that the proposed deal was dependent on outgoings - which are still being considered - but United are 'open' to a late change in approach for the Uruguay regular. The Manchester Evening News understands a loan with the option to buy could be priced-up to help them get Ugarte over the line before August 30.",
      "United are, meanwhile, prepared to sell five more players including Jadon Sancho this summer. Here, our dedicated reporters take a look at what could happen around Old Trafford between now and next Friday night's deadline, and offer up their dream scenarios for the closing days;",
      "Manuel Ugarte is a deal which needs to happen for United to call this transfer window a success. The midfielder could be United's most important signing of the summer and the difference between them finishing in the top four or not.",
      "Whilst Casemiro has looked better in the early stages of 2024/25, the 32-year-old cannot be relied upon for another season. After signing Ugarte, United's next priority should be selling several players who don't have a long-term future at Old Trafford, starting with Jadon Sancho.",
      "Victor Lindelof is another player who should go, although with his current injury that seems unlikely, whilst Christian Eriksen won't be much use this season. Scott McTominay may be worth keeping though, providing it doesn't impact a deal for Ugarte.",
      "The Scotland international proved his worth for Ten Hag's team last season and still remains a useful squad player. What United don't want though is keeping someone who doesn't want to be there which may necessitate a sale, regardless of how much he still offers.",
      "Heading into these final stages of the summer transfer window, United should have a clear goal in mind - signing a midfielder. To finance this, the Reds will more than likely need to sell McTominay which, for the right price, would be good business.",
      "If United can receive their valuation of £40m they will be laughing at that and considering the panic in the Napoli camp at present, this could well be doable too. After bringing in the money for the Scottish central player it is more than likely that Ugarte will be added to the team.",
      "The jury is out on the Uruguayan at present but there is still plenty of time for him to reach the heights needed to be a starter for United. Once again, the big issue here will be regarding his price tag with a loan move perhaps the wisest decision for now.",
      "After that, I am not sure that United would need to do any more business or be in a position to do any more for that matter. Sancho's sale is not necessarily the priority it once was and if the hatchet has well and truly been buried, there is no reason why he could not be a force this season.",
      "A loan deal for Manuel Ugarte looks to be on the cards for United in between now and the end of the transfer window. That signing would fill the position where the United squad are most in need.",
      "Getting the deal done on an initial loan does mean that funds raised through sales for the move won’t be so important between now and the end of the window. Therefore if no team reaches the £40 million asking price for Scott McTominay, then he will stay at Old Trafford for at least another six months before the situation is looked at again in January.",
      "Another source of income from player sales is Jadon Sancho. While the situation surrounding the public fall-out between him and Ten Hag now looks to have been resolved, it still feels that the player’s future lies away from Old Trafford. United have reportedly set an asking price of around £40 million, if they can get that, it would serve as a boost ahead of the January window.",
      "There’s no real other areas of the squad that obviously need strengthening for the remainder of the season. If the Ugarte signing gets over the line then the concentration should therefore be on outgoings.",
      "On paper, the dream scenario for United between now and 11pm on August 30 is rather simple. However, due to complex deals taking shape and one or two players facing uncertain futures at the club, the business that should map out - both in and out of Old Trafford - is anything but straightforward.",
      "A permanent sale for Scott McTominay would enable United to press ahead with Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Amid one or two question marks over his transfer fee, though, Ineos might be better-served following their 'new' plan and signing the Uruguay international on loan instead. That would allow them to keep McTominay around for one final year as his goals would be an additional bonus in a reduced, bit-part role.",
      "Cashing in on Jadon Sancho would be ideal, too, to perhaps allow United to bring in another striker. Ivan Toney is not exactly an essential recruit, but he could be a useful addition to injured Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee up top if United feel the need to spend whatever money they get from Sancho on an alternative profile.",
      "United's dream end to the transfer window would start with cashing in on Jadon Sancho and Scott McTominay before reinvesting that income into their defence and midfield. Victor Lindelof should also be off, freeing up his wages more than necessarily a transfer fee.",
      "Manuel Ugarte seems to be who they want, so agreeing to a loan deal with Paris Saint-Germain would be ideal, with an option rather than an obligation to buy the Uruguay international. Then, the dream scenario would be returning for Jarrad Branthwaite and signing the third central defender that the club have been open to signing this summer.",
      "That would represent a complete overhaul of the position and be necessary after offloading Lindelof. Branthwaite, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro would finally adequately address that problem position in the squad, allowing the new hierarchy to address other areas over the coming windows.",

      "He featured for the club’s U16, U18, and U21 sides last season, winning the Goal of the Season award at both U16 and U18 levels. He made nine appearances for the U18s, his goal being a crucial equaliser in the 2-2 draw with Derby County.",
      "His two appearances for the development squad came as a second-half substitute in the Premier League 2 clashes against Derby and Middlesbrough. This year he is expected to be given a prominent role in the U18s side and awarded with the experience of joining in with first-team training.",

      "Manchester United are looking to bring defensive midfielder Manuel Ugarte into their team before the end of the summer transfer window next week.",
      "The Uruguayan midfielder comes with big expectations to meet in the centre, particularly after last season's woes in the middle of the park. Too often United found themselves cut open with the mix-and-match central defenders left unprotected from the attacking hordes.",
      "Casemiro was often blamed as being off the pace in the midfield which forced United to lack a defensively minded player in the centre. Upon his arrival at Old Trafford, you would expect Ugarte to form a partnership with Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "During the summer, we saw how Mainoo blossomed alongside Declan Rice for England at the European Championships and having a player who can effectively mop up in front of the back line should allow Mainoo to roam forward and show off his attacking capabilities. One person who is confident Ugarte can produce this role is former United striker Diego Forlan.",
      "He told ESPN Uruguay last year that he had spotted the midfielder's potential early and expressed: \"He is very important in the middle to free Valverde and Bentancur. Defensively he adds a lot. If I were a coach, I would love to put Ugarte in the middle.\"",
      "Having that anchor in the centre should not only allow Mainoo a bit more freedom but also give captain Bruno Fernandes the opportunity to focus solely on his offensive work.",
      "While both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee are showing promise with the latter happy to drop deep to start a build-up and link-up play, the Reds need a player like Fernandes to showcase his creativity. He should not be preoccupied with defensive duties - this should be left to Mainoo and Ugarte.",
      "Having Fernandes dictating play in the upper third of the pitch should not only help the young centre-forwards but also bring into play Marcus Rashford who is on a journey to rediscover his form. At his worst, Rashford looks isolated on the left flank but with Fernandes given more freedom to create, there is an opportunity there for the winger to be reintroduced into the attack more regularly.",

      "He's exclusively played for some of Europe's biggest clubs at just 25 years old and arrived in Manchester this summer with the sort of pedigree most footballers dream of having. United signed De Ligt from Bayern Munich for €45m (£38.4m) with a potential further €5m (£4.2m) in add-ons earlier this month and that seemed a reasonable fee.",
      "Considering the experience De Ligt has and the potential upside to his arrival, his transfer seemed like smart business from United. Yet he may have to wait longer than expected to make his full debut for the club because Harry Maguire got the nod against Fulham last week.",
      "De Ligt has been signed to start and the expectation is he will partner Lisandro Martinez, but Maguire started on the opening day and won't give up his place without a fight. Maguire enjoyed a renaissance last term and clawed his way back into the starting side, despite losing the captaincy, which demonstrated his impressive resilience and determination.",
      "The 31-year-old has avoided injury for most of his career and was unfortunate to pick up two separate issues last term, a groin problem in December and April's calf injury. Some questioned the commitment of United's players last term and Wayne Rooney said in May that a few members of the dressing room were hiding behind injury, but that couldn't have been further from the truth with Maguire, who put his body on the line for the club.",
      "United's defenders dropped like flies and Maguire could have opted for a spell on the sidelines to get fully fit when his body was tested in April - but he didn't and continued. Maguire played through a knock away from home against Bournemouth on April 13 and was spotted clutching his left thigh in pain. Although it seemed likely he would be substituted at half-time, he received treatment in the dressing room and emerged for the second period.",
      "United played Coventry in the semi-finals of the FA Cup a week later and Maguire didn't train between games, yet he played 120 minutes and pushed through another issue. He is the type of character who will always be welcome in a United dressing room and his dedication hasn't gone unnoticed by fans, whose relationship with him has healed.",
      "Maguire picked up where he left off against Fulham and was one of United's best players, making crucial interventions when Fulham were close to Andre Onana's goal and seeming to meet every ball that was crossed into the box with his head. It would be wrong to name Maguire on the bench against Brighton on the back of that impressive performance, which means the wait for De Ligt's full debut should go on.",
      "De Ligt was introduced in the second half against Fulham and some fans will prefer him to start over Maguire at the Amex Stadium but it would send the wrong message to the squad. Maguire didn't put a foot wrong and the starting role should be his for as long as he continues to deliver strong performances. If Maguire underperforms then replacing him with De Ligt in the starting XI will be logical but he should start until then.",
      "Understandably, there is a clamour among supporters to see De Ligt start because he is brand new and shiny, but Maguire was excellent last season and won't be displaced easily. He is certainly not a glamorous player but he's dependable. He put an awful two years behind him last season and will make more starts than most expect in 2024/25. The defender has fought for his starting place previously and will do so again.",

      "Manchester United have been told they could earn up to £500million by selling the naming rights to a potential new stadium.",
      "It was soon established after Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority takeover that one of his priorities for the club was to improve their facilities. Old Trafford has deteriorated massively under the Glazers, falling well behind their competitors in Europe.",
      "A task force was put together to explore the options for regeneration, and last month they concluded a new build would be the most prosperous option. A 100,000-seater ground on club-owned land adjacent to Old Trafford has been recommended.",
      "It's estimated cost is £2billion - but a quarter of that could be reclaimed just from its name, according to Dr Rob Wilson, a professor of Applied Sports Finance at Sheffield Hallam University. With reports claiming United plan to keep Old Trafford as a second venue, he feels there's full scope for it to become a sponsorship vehicle.",
      "Speaking hypothetically with regards to United's new kit partner Snapdragon, Dr Wilson told Casasdeapuestas.bet: \"I think in terms of figures, if it was Snapdragon, they'd look to try and tie that into their shirt sponsorship and some of their other activities.",
      "\"It could do one or two things that could suppress the value because Snapdragon put another 30 on top of their £70million shirt sponsor to make it a round number. I think the stadium naming rights could be worth probably £50m a year in their own right.",
      "\"So if other companies get involved in that, then you've got a misalignment of brand. So Snapdragon might say that they need that and we'll do a £150m deal for shirt and stadium naming rights.",
      "\"You could see it go up a little bit higher but somewhere in the region of about £50m per season, they’d want something long-term. So that’s £500m over 10 years.\"",
      "He also pointed out that giving a new stadium a sponsored name from the off - like the Etihad or the Emirates - tends to be better received than adapting an iconic stadium name, like Barcelona have done with the Spotify Camp Nou.",
      "Dr Wilson feels Snapdragon in particular could be a wise choice of partner. The company, a subsidiary of US tech firm Qualcomm, offer long-term security, again much like Etihad and Emirates do for Man City and Arsenal respectively.",
      "He continued: \"What's really clever about what United are currently doing is that Snapdragon are about to go on the next wave of their journey, which is all tied up in tech, which means that it has longevity as a brand in the same way that Arsenal with Emirates and Manchester City with Etihad went for emergent Middle Eastern airlines that have got these big growth trajectories.\"",

      "United are up and running in the Premier League after a 1-0 win over Fulham thanks to summer signing Joshua Zirkee’s late winner. Despite penning a new contract in the summer after leading the team to FA Cup glory, it is imperative Ten Hag improves on last season’s dismal eighth place in the Premier League.",
      "A run of poor results would crank up the pressure on the Dutchman, who added Van Nistelrooy and former Utrecht boss Rene Hake to his backroom over the summer. It has been speculated that Van Nistelrooy could be first in line to steady the ship if Ten Hag is sacked.",
      "Meulensteen, a first-team coach under Sir Alex Ferguson between 2007 and 2013, says the potential for Van Nistelrooy, who has previously managed PSV Eindhoven, to replace his countryman cannot be completely dismissed.",
      "“I don’t think Erik ten Hag will be worried about Rudd van Nistelrooy potentially replacing him, he’s too focused on the job at hand,” Meulensteen told Gambling Zone.",

      "“It is an interesting development, what has happened at Manchester United because Ten Hag brought in his trusted staff and many of them have gone. Now he has brought in his friend Rene Hake, who was manager of Utrecht, as well as Van Nistelrooy, so he has identified what he needs.”",
      "Sign up to our United newsletter so you never miss an update from Old Trafford this season.",
      "Meulensteen, 60, was surprised Van Nistelrooy, who was linked with the Burnley job before it went to Scott Parker, didn’t go back into management this summer. He said: “I've stayed in touch with him and he's obviously keen to carry on in management and I thought that's what he's going to do.",

Clinton excelled for the latter last term, scoring four goals and assisting four others in 20 Women's Super League (WSL) appearances and playing an integral role in Spurs’ charge to their first ever Women’s FA Cup final, though she was ineligible to play against her parent club and eventual victors United at Wembley.",
      "Her impressive form saw her receive her first senior England call up earlier this year. She made her first full start against Austria after two appearances off the bench, and duly made an impact with her first international goal in a 7-2 win for the Lionesses.",
      "Clinton impressed so much at Tottenham that the club were keen to make her stay in the capital permanent. “She cannot stay because she’s not a part of us next year,\" manager Robert Vilahamn told The Athletic in April. \"But if you ask me if I want to buy her, there would be a high potential I want to do that.\"",
      "However United boss Skinner has always been unequivocal in his stance on the 21-year-old, insisting that her long-term future lies in Manchester. \"All I hear is Tottenham want to keep Grace, of course they want to keep Grace,\" he said when quizzed on the club's plans for Clinton back in May. \"She's a fantastic player.",
      "\"We don't get the credit that we identified her qualities at Everton, we brought her to Manchester United, gave her six months, sent her on loan at Bristol – she got experience. She then went on loan to Tottenham to get more experience. I don't think people recognise that – there is a plan for each individual we bring into the club.",
      "\"With Grace, it's absolutely worked. I want to bring her back to the club and be part of what we're doing because I think she has a huge say in how we'll play.\"",
      "And Clinton has now voiced her commitment to the Reds, insisting her ambition is to add more silverware to the club's collection. \"To go to Tottenham and get confidence was just amazing,\" she said at the start-studded awards ceremony on Tuesday night. \"And to improve obviously personally. The aim is always to win trophies with Manchester United.\"",
      "On her award, Clinton added: “It’s such an honour to be voted by the unbelievable players that play in this league. It’s the best league in the world. “To go out on loan, learning as a young player and being recognized is lovely. I’ve played with confidence and when you play with that then you see the best version of a player. Tottenham have been a massive part of my journey, and I can’t thank them enough. Goals and visualisation are important to me but most of all just enjoying playing. If I’m enjoying myself then I play my best football.”",
      "Clinton also featured in the PFA Women's Team of the Year, alongside Manchester City stars Khadija 'Bunny' Shaw, Yui Hasegawa, Lauren Hemp, Khiara Keating, Alex Greenwood, Laia Aleixandri. She beat out a host of talented players to earn the award with Lauren James, Aggie Beever-Jones, Khiara Keating, Maya Le Tissier and Jess Park among the names on the Top Six shortlist.",

This was United's first competitive game in 13 years, their first competitive outing since the Glazer regime opted to disband their senior women's team after deeming it not to be part of the club's \"core business\".",
      "The team was peppered with familar faces. Alex Greenwood, now captain of Manchester City, teed up Arnot to score the winner. Lauren James, who returned to childhood club Chelsea for what was - in 2021 - a British record fee, started in midfield, while current United stars Ella Toone, Millie Turner and Leah Galton also featured.",
      "\"For a team that has only been together for six weeks they weathered the storm quite well,\" manager Casey Stoney told BBC Radio 5 Live after the game.",
      "\"I recruited from the second tier, they've stepped up and shown they are more than capable of playing a level above that. There's no pressure from the club to get promotion but these players want to be playing in the top flight. They're history makers now.\"",
      "In spite of Stoney's measured assessment of United's ambitions, the Reds did achieve promotion at the first time of asking, subsequently finishing fourth in their first season in the Women's Super League (WSL). And now, just six years on from that League Cup victory over Liverpool, United are a card-carrying member of the top flight's elite.",
      "Stoney's departure in the summer of 2021 was a blow but her replacement, former Birmingham City boss Marc Skinner, has presided over the most successful period in the club's history. In 2022/23, the Reds took the title race to the final day, posting a club-record points tally in the process while also reaching the FA Cup final.",
      "Last term, despite a disappointing fifth-place finish in the WSL, United beat Tottenham Hotspur to the FA Cup trophy; a reality which would have seemed inconceivable on that momentous afternoon at Prenton Park more than half a decade ago.",
      "While the Reds have come a tremendously long way since then, it is fair to say this summer has not been without its challenges. First came the revelataion that Skinner had been handed a one-year contract extension - a decision which was not universally popular with the United fanbase.",
      "Then came the exodus of some of the club's biggest stars. England goalkeeper Mary Earps left to join Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), citing United's transitional state and her own ambition to compete for more silverware as her chief motivating factors. Club captain Katie Zelem also departed on a free transfer, as did fan-favourite striker Lucia Garcia.",
      "All of this unfolded has against the backdrop of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's barely concealed apathy towards Skinner's side. The INEOS chief gave a tone-deaf interview to Bloomberg, in which he conceded plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "This was swiftly followed by United Women being ousted from their state-of-the-art Carrington training facility to make way for the men's team while their own building gets a revamp, though it is understood Skinner and his players will still have access to all the necessary facilities.",
      "Still, the emergence of reports citing concern from the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) and of agents' apparent unwillingness to throw their players into the maelstrom that is Manchester United have been concerning.",
      "That said, the Reds have recruited shrewdly in the transfer market, with the acquisition of Brighton & Hove Albion striker Elisabeth Terland and Swedish defender Anna Sandberg, in particular, inspiring excitement, while the appointment of Dan Ashworth as sporting director inspires hope of tangible change at the club.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said in an open letter to supporters last month.",
      "\"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United. Women’s football is arguably the most exciting area of growth in the global game, and we want to be part of that.",
      "“Last season’s FA Cup win was a fantastic landmark as our first major women’s trophy, and how we want to build on that with Marc, his staff and the players.\"",
      "Indeed, six years on from that win over Liverpool, United now have all the ingredients in place to be truly successful. The Reds may already have made history in the years since their reformation but, with the WSL set to be more competitive than ever next term, it is clear the hard work is only just beginning.",

      "Dan Ashworth has met with Manchester United Women's players after a turbulent summer for Marc Skinner's side.",
      "United have come in for criticism of late number after a number of high-profile players, including England goalkeeper Mary Earps and captain Katie Zelem, were allowed to leave the club on free transfers, while co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe sparked controversy when he admitted plans for the women's team were \"TBC\".",
      "Fan frustration was further compounded when it emerged Skinner's side were set to be moved out of their state-of-the-art training facility to accommodate the men's team while a £50m refurbishment of their Carrington facilities was underway.",
      "However, Ashworth's long-awaited arrival from Newcastle United last month has offered some cause for optimism, with the sporting director having previously been a huge advocate for the growth of the women's game during his time with the Magpies and in his previous role at Brighton & Hove Albion. And the 53-year-old has now met with Skinner and his players as they ramp up their pre-season preparations at St George's Park.",
      "Pictures shared on the club's website show Ashworth giving a speech to the women's first-team squad and shaking hands with stars such as Ella Toone and Millie Turner. This comes after he outlined his vision for the Reds in an open letter to supporters.",
      "“Delivering a successful women’s team and a thriving, productive academy are both key objectives of my job, and I have a strong background in both areas,\" Ashworth said last month. \"Women’s football was an important part of my remit in past roles with Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and the FA, and it will be the same at Manchester United.",

      "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Canada international Simi Awujo on a three-year deal.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder joins the Reds from the United States collegiate system, where she represented the University of Southern California’s USC Trojans. Awujo made her senior international debut for Canada at 18-years-old and has 19 caps for her country to date, reaching the quarter-finals of this summer’s Paris 2024 Olympic games.",
      "Reflecting on her move to Manchester, Awujo said: “To say that I’m a professional footballer for Manchester United is insane. I’m so excited for the season ahead, what the future holds here and just to be a red devil. I cannot wait to play in front of the great Manchester United fans.”",
      "Manager Marc Skinner added: “Simi is an exciting young talent who we are delighted has chosen to continue her football journey with us here at Manchester United. Our wonderful fans can expect a midfielder with international pedigree, who will only develop further in our competitive English game.”",
      "Awujo is United's fifth signing of the summer following the arrivals of Dominique Janssen, Melvine Malard, Elisabeth Terland and Anna Sandber. The Reds finished fifth in the Women's Super League (WSL) last term and won the Women's FA Cup. They will get their new campaign underway against West Ham at Old Trafford on Saturday, September 22.",
