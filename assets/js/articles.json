      "Manchester United have already been linked with several moves ahead of the January transfer window. Ruben Amorim’s primary focus will be to extend his side’s four-game unbeaten run in the Premier League, but United’s transfer plans will also be being formulated behind the scenes.",
      "The Red Devils drew with Nottingham Forest at the weekend, ending United’s win streak but not completely halting their momentum. Amorim appears to be getting a tune out of his team, though not all of his players are fully firing.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is one of those who have recently come under scrutiny due to not having the same type of impact as fellow new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. However, the striker played the full 90 minutes against Forest, unlike some of his United teammates who are struggling for regular game time.",
      "Amorim has already admitted that he expects some players will ask to leave the club in January and one United star has been linked with a move to Napoli. The Italian club have revitalised the careers of both Scott McTominay and current United loanee Rasmus Hojlund since the pair left Old Trafford.",
      "Sky Sport Italia reports that Napoli plan to target Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window. The 20-year-old midfielder submitted a loan request in the summer and is yet to start a league game this season.",
      "It is claimed that United are not considering a permanent sale, but would prefer Mainoo to join a club abroad, rather than another Premier League side. Napoli want to bolster their midfield after an injury to Kevin De Bruyne and would like to sign Mainoo on loan with an option to buy.",
      "This situation could see United repeat their past mistake of allowing players to join Napoli, only to watch them thrive in Italy. United loanee Rasmus Hojlund has scored four goals in eight games this term, while former midfielder McTominay was named Serie A MVP last season.",
      "Gary Lineker appears to have agreed with claims Benjamin Sesko has made a slow start at Manchester United - although the former Match of the Day host has backed the forward to succeed. The young striker was signed from RB Leipzig in the summer but has scored just twice in 11 appearances.",
      "Sesko’s recent performance against Forest was criticised by United legend Gary Neville. However, Lineker has been impressed by United’s new frontline and believes there is still more to come from Sesko - it may just take time for the striker to fulfil his potential.",
      "\"One thing I would say is that their recruitment for the first time in some time looks pretty good,\" Lineker said on the Rest is Football podcast. \"Cunha looks a really good player and Mbeumo looks a really good player.",
      "\"Sesko I think might show something, I think he is promising, so I think it has been better recruitment, but time will tell on that as well.\"",
      "Former England manager Gareth Southgate has shared his stance on a possible return to the dugout. Southgate led the Three Lions to two Euros finals during his tenure before stepping down last year.",
      "He was recently linked with the United job before the club’s upturn in results. However, Southgate has admitted he is not desperate for a return to management.",
      "\"I had an amazing time [as England manager],\" Southgate told the BBC. \"Obviously the great thing with England was there is the high purpose that you are … you know, I joined the FA to try to help English football to become better, to help youth development, in particular.",
      "\"I somehow stumbled and ended up in the first-team manager’s job, and we had a pretty good period. But I am not desperate to stay in football. I have had 37 years in football.",
      "\"You can never say never, because I have just seen Martin O’Neill at his age go to Celtic, but it is not something that is high on my agenda at the moment.\"",

      "David Beckham will be knighted on Tuesday. The Manchester United and England legend will be recognised for services to sport and to charity and received the news this summer.",
      "Beckham is one of English football's most recognisable figures and was made an OBE in 2003. Having been reportedly considered for a knighthood since 2011 he will finally become Sir David after he was announced as a recipient in King Charles' Birthday Honours list earlier this June.",
      "The 50-year-old played a vital role in securing the London 2012 Olympics, has been a Unicef ambassador for two decades and has been working with King Charles and The King's Foundation since 2024.",
      "As part of his Windsor Castle ceremony, protocol will see Beckham kneel on his right knee whilst the King or a different member of the Royal Family touches his right shoulder and then his left with a bar sword blade.",
      "Speaking in June when Beckham was announced as a recipient, he told PA: \"Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour.",
      "\"To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career, and it was literally a boyhood dream come true.",
      "\"I'm so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I'm grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment,\" he added.",
      "\"It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I'm immensely proud and it's such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.\"",
      "He also took to Instagram after he informed his mother of the honour and captioned a picture: \"Mum cried when she arrived, cried during lunch and cried when I was leaving. It was a special moment for us all.\"",
      "After Beckham's ceremony he will choose to go by his new official title of Sir David Beckham. Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was knighted in 1999 and he admitted that he was unsure about adopting the new title but was advised to by his family.",
      "\"I put it to the family,\" Ferguson told United's official magazine in 2000. \"Cathy was a bit, 'Oh, I don't know, what would your father think?' And my son said, 'Mum, it's nothing to do with Dad's parents.",
      "\"They're gone. They'd be proud of him — you can't refuse this, it's recognition of what he's done.' We had a discussion and decided it was right.\"",
      "Beckham's wife, former Spice Girl Victoria, will also accept a new title after Tuesday's ceremony and will now be referred to as 'Lady Beckham.' The footballing icon could have been attending such a ceremony much sooner were it not for some emails being leaked in 2017 that allegedly criticised the honours system and committee.",

      "Former Manchester United goalie David De Gea has emerged as a rare bright spot in Fiorentina's struggling season. The ex-Spanish international joined the Serie A team last year after a year-long stint as a free agent.",
      "His impressive performances earned him a fresh three-year contract at the Artemio Franci Stadium. Despite his continued good form, the ex-Red Devils keeper hasn't been able to prevent La Viola from plummeting to the bottom of Serie A.",
      "While the campaign is only ten matches old, there is a genuine threat the two-time Italian champions may get relegated to Serie B. Throughout the campaign the Italian media have also made their mind up on De Gea.",
      "The Premier League victor has managed two clean sheets in 10 league games, but the forwards haven't been pulling their weight. Consequently, Stefano Pioli's squad, along with Verona, are the only two teams yet to secure a single league win.",
      "Their latest match saw them suffer a 1-0 defeat at home to Lecce. Quotidiano Sportivo commended De Gea's performance, stating he wasn't to blame when \"disaster struck\" and Medon Berisha netted for the visitors.",
      "However, he's been demonstrating his leadership by facing the media following the club's losses. Following a 3-0 defeat to Inter Milan, he spoke with Firenze e Dintorni where he expressed his contentment with the club.",
      "He said: \"As soon as I arrived at Fiorentina, I immediately felt at ease. Viola Park is incredible and played a role in my final decision. With the staff, teammates, and staff, I feel like I'm part of a big family.",
      "\"I'm happy in Florence and the Florentine atmosphere. The fans are special. It's one of those places everyone would love to visit, and I'm lucky enough to live there. It's small, but it's beautiful to live there, and the food is special. All these aspects contributed to my decision to stay, with the desire to bring home a trophy.\"",
      "While Fiorentina are winless in the league, they are top of the Conference League table with two wins, eight goals scored and two clean sheets. However, when asked to compare their displays in the league and in Europe, De Gea was brutally honest.",
      "He said: \"The level of these two teams we faced in the Conference is lower than in Serie A. We played well in the Conference, but in the league we're not the same because it's tougher, we play against strong teams.",
      "\"We're struggling a lot and you can feel it in the locker room too: the only solution is to work and fight game after game. Certainly no one expected this start to the season.",
      "\"We haven't won yet, and we're struggling. The team isn't performing well, but we have to stay positive. We need to believe more among ourselves.",
      "\"We have to believe more than anyone else, raising the bar and winning games. Serie A is tough, but that's football: we have to stay united with the fans, it's very hard for them too, but we have to follow the same path.\"",

      "Manchester United's Amad Diallo has hit back at a 'false' social media claim that he visited his 'pregnant wife' after Saturday's 2-2 draw against Nottingham Forest. The 23-year-old winger scored United's second goal at The City Ground, helping Ruben Amorim's side to secure a point and extend their unbeaten streak to four matches.",
      "Despite heading into the Nottingham match on a three-game winning streak, the Reds had to settle for a draw. After Casemiro put United ahead, Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the tables, putting Forest 2-1 up. However, Amad found the net in the 81st minute, ensuring a point for Amorim's squad.",
      "Following the match, a social media post claimed that Amad had visited his 'pregnant wife', accompanied by two photos. The account, boasting over 33,000 followers, posted: \"Amad Diallo visits his pregnant wife after the weekend game. Impossible not to love them [red love heart emoji and goat emoji].\"",
      "In response, Amad dismissed the claim and called for respect for his privacy. He retweeted the message, commenting: \"Spreading false information will not help you promote your page [cross mark emoji] A bit respect for my privacy.\"",
      "It was later suggested that one of the photos included in the original tweet was AI-generated, prompting Amad's reaction.",
      "Amad Diallo's first goal of the season for Manchester United came against Nottingham Forest, a feat made all the more impressive considering his deeper role since Bryan Mbeumo's summer arrival.",
      "Despite not being in as many scoring positions, Amad nearly bagged a second late on, only to be denied by a line clearance from Murillo, which could have secured a potential match-winning third goal for the Reds.",
      "United head coach Amorim was full of praise for Amad in his post-match comments. He said: \"Amad has a lot of talent, he is growing up really fast. I think we have a lot of players that are young and talented but we need to help in all the details.",
      "\"He is improving a lot, he can play in different positions, I think he can be so much better. More consistent in every detail, when he receives the ball, in build-up, when he is in the final third.",
      "\"You could see in the first half he had some opportunities. In a lot of games, he has that opportunity coming inside and the shot is not there yet. We are working on that, so he has potential to do better.\"",

      "Manchester United's latest transfer pursuit could inadvertently pave the way for Barcelona to secure Marcus Rashford on a permanent basis this summer.",
      "The 28-year-old moved to the Catalan club on a season-long loan deal after being deemed surplus to requirements at United. Rashford had previously endured a brief loan stint at Aston Villa last term amid mounting friction with new boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "With the January transfer window approaching in under two months, clubs are already eyeing potential signings – and United have emerged as active participants. Amorim's squad are understood to be pursuing a fresh striker option, with Brazilian talent Vitor Roque reportedly catching their attention after being 'reborn' in his homeland.",
      "Palmeiras secured Roque's services from Barcelona in February for approximately £22million, establishing a new record as South America's most costly transfer.",
      "The forward endured a difficult spell at Barcelona, managing merely two goals across 16 outings, yet his fortunes transformed dramatically following his Palmeiras switch.",
      "He has swiftly rejuvenated his prospects, bagging 17 strikes and contributing five assists during his debut campaign at the club.",
      "The striker now harbours ambitions of earning a place in Carlo Ancelotti's Brazil setup for next year's World Cup.",
      "Should United genuinely pursue Roque, they may need to exercise patience until summer, given the youngster's desire to remain in Brazil through June.",
      "Beyond that point, Spanish publication Sport suggests he 'would be open to a new adventure.'",
      "A crucial element in any potential deal between United and Roque would be Barcelona's sell-on clause, rumoured to be 20%. This means if Amorim's team were to sign Roque for £50m, Barcelona would pocket £10m from the sale.",
      "Such a financial boost could then aid the La Liga titans in securing a permanent move for Rashford. Barcelona have an option-to-buy clause worth £28m, although they are not compelled to trigger it.",
      "A new striker would also provide competition for Benjamin Sesko, who has found it challenging to make a significant impact in the Premier League so far, netting just twice in his first 11 games.",

      "Meanwhile, Kai is currently part of the United academy with ambitions of emulating his legendary father's career. Despite only being 16, he has already starred for the Reds Under-18s side.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his development was halted by a nasty foot injury which left him devastated. Whilst side-lined, he tuned in to watch Rashford shine in La Liga.",

In the caption, he wrote: \"Home win, good vibes. Thanks for your support. Tieree that one was for you as promised.\"",
      "Sadly for Kai, many of his latest posts haven't been as upbeat. When he picked up his injury, he shared a post on social media with the caption \"Life can't get worse,\" which left many fans feeling sorry for him.",
      "It marked a crushing blow as he'd been excelling whilst featuring for United's development squads.

      "\"He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",
      "In other news, Rashford expressed his delight at his goal against Elche. He said: \"I just try to do the right things on the pitch. Even today, I could have had more assists or goals. Sometimes the decision making to shoot or pass was wrong, but I am going to have days like this.",
      "\"The important thing is always the team and today we won. So I am happy for this. My focus is not so much on the output. If I am doing the right things, I know I will always be able to score and assist. My focus is with the team, to build relationships and feel comfortable.\"",

      "Barcelona are already set for a relative discount on Marcus Rashford but could be in line to save even more money. The Spanish club are able to sign England international Rashford for around £26million next summer, when his current loan deal ends, but Manchester United could play a part in that sum coming down further.",
      "That's because Ruben Amorim's side have been linked with a swoop for Brazil star Vitor Roque. If you're wondering how that affects Barcelona, it relates to a sell-on clause that could net them millions.",
      "Barca signed Roque from Atletico Paranaense in 2023 but sold him to Palmeiras 18 months later. In addition to the £22.4million fee they received - a record for Brazil's Serie A - they are understood to have included a 20 per cent sell-on clause.",
      "Roque, now 20, was one of the highest scorers in Brazil's top flight last season with 13 goals. That has prompted talk of a return to Europe, with Sports Illustrated (via Football Espana) naming United, Chelsea and Tottenham as potential buyers.",
      "A fee of €50m (£44m) has been mooted, with Barca entitled to €10m (£8.8m) of that total. That would effectively amount to a discount of roughly one third on an already low fee for Rashford, a player previously considered a £100m talent.",

      "He scored his second La Liga goal over the weekend as Barca beat Elche to stay second in the table, but manager Hansi Flick is still expecting more from the 28-year-old. \"When you see the chances he has, one or two goals more will be good, also for him,\" Flick said.",

      "For a brief moment, it looked like Manchester United might finally be steadying the ship. Three straight wins - a first such run in nearly two years - had prompted talk of progress, of momentum, of Ruben Amorim starting to find his feet.",
      "But Saturday's 2-2 draw with relegation-battling Nottingham Forest - which, without Amad Diallo's late wonder strike, would have been a bitter defeat - served as a sobering reminder that United's problems run far deeper than a handful of recent results.",
      "The team still can't control matches for long spells. They still look fragile when put under pressure. And for all the talk of Amorim's fresh ideas and new energy, United continue to feel like a work in progress - a side torn between transition and tradition.",
      "The draw at Forest didn't just halt momentum, it exposed the awkward balance in Amorim's evolving 3-4-3. The system can look slick when United dominate possession, but it quickly falls apart when they're forced to scrap, claw and defend in numbers.",
      "At the centre of it all sits Bruno Fernandes - captain, talisman and perhaps, inadvertently, one of United's biggest tactical headaches. With that in mind, here are three takeaways from United's worrisome weekend.",
      "Fernandes has been relatively effective in Amorim's 3-4-3, operating as one of the two central midfielders. When United are on top and the ball is theirs, his creativity and quick passing can be invaluable. But in tougher away games - like Forest - his presence in that role becomes a liability.",
      "He isn't mobile enough to cover ground or disciplined enough to maintain shape, which leaves United's midfield exposed. It's reminiscent of Cesc Fabregas under Antonio Conte at Chelsea - a fine footballer, but too lightweight for the intensity and structure required in a two-man midfield. Conte's decision to favour N'Golo Kante and Nemanja Matic brought Chelsea balance and, ultimately, a Premier League title.",
      "United may be able to carry Fernandes in that role for now, especially against weaker sides. But if Amorim truly wants to build a side capable of challenging for major honours, he may need to take the bold step of moving Fernandes further forward - or out of the team altogether.",
      "The problem, of course, is that pushing him higher up risks displacing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, both of whom look far more natural as inside forwards in this system. There's also the fact that Fernandes, for all his tactical limitations, remains a talismanic, goal-scoring fan favourite and one of the few United players whose form has held steady through recent turbulent seasons.",
      "Still, if Amorim stays, so too does his 3-4-3 - and within it, Fernandes increasingly feels like a square peg in a round hole. Some will argue he's too good to drop and worth shoehorning into the side - but forcing him into a role that doesn't suit him could ultimately cost United when it matters most.",
      "It's a tricky puzzle to solve, but if the Red Devils truly aspire to be a top side again, they must be willing to leave out even the biggest piece if it means the whole picture fits together better.",
      "If United's midfield is to function properly, one player simply has to be part of it: Kobbie Mainoo. The 20-year-old brings a rare blend of composure, mobility and intelligence that United sorely lack. He can glide past a press, move the ball forward with purpose and still has the discipline to protect his back line.",
      "For a 3-4-3 to work, you need balance, control, vigour. Mainoo ticks all those boxes - and pairing him with a true holding midfielder, whether that's Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte or a summer signing like Carlos Baleba, makes perfect sense.",
      "Amorim's decision to freeze him out has baffled many. In the games where United struggle to control the tempo, Mainoo could make the difference. Where someone like Fernandes brings risk, Mainoo brings rhythm - a sense of calm that allows others to play. If Amorim wants to create a midfield capable of dictating the game instead of just reacting to it, reintroducing the youngster should be the first step.",
      "Two-man midfields demand not only structure and discipline, but also energy - the ability to cover ground, press intelligently and recover quickly in transition. Amorim seems set on pairing Casemiro and Fernandes, but that combination simply lacks the mobility and intensity the systems requires against the very best.",
      "Casemiro no longer has the legs to dominate large spaces on his own, while Fernandes's strengths lie in creativity and chance-making rather than defensive work or ball recovery. Without a more dynamic partner like Mainoo, United's midfield risks being overrun - solid on paper, but sluggish in reality.",
      "The other glaring issue is out wide. Amorim's 3-4-3 relies heavily on wing backs who can stretch the pitch and defend intelligently. Right now, United have neither.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is the only natural fit, but he's been inconsistent. Amad is being wasted at right wing back, while Diogo Dalot continues to fill in on the left despite being right-footed. It's an awkward setup that leaves United far too exposed in transition and far too blunt going forward.",
      "If United are serious about making this formation work, the January window - and next summer - must be about finding proper wing backs. Players who can bomb forward, deliver quality and recover quickly. They spent over £200million last summer on forwards when £50-100m on two elite wing backs would have made far more sense.",
      "Now, they're being linked with expensive midfielders like Baleba and Elliot Anderson. But unless they fix the flanks, the structure will keep collapsing. The system depends on balance, and until United find proper wing backs, Amorim will keep trying to build a house without walls.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United star Juan Mata has recognised the challenges faced by the club when it comes to getting out of a tough spell. The Spaniard was United's record signing when he joined from Chelsea in January 2014 but the club struggled to turn big spending into big results.",
      "Now 37, Mata is playing his club football in Australia. He has seen United head coach Ruben Amorim and his predecessors struggle with momentum while watching from afar and believes it's nothing new.",
      "\"But if you get a momentum like this now, hopefully they can build from it and not think about the bad results that they had in the beginning. Momentum is key, and hopefully, this is a moment in the season where they really change and look up and not down anymore.",
      "\"Results have been better with three wins, one draw, and no losses. Hopefully, that can create a sense of momentum within the dressing room; with the confidence of the players and also with the connection with the fans.\"",
      "After a slow start to the 2025/26 season, with just seven points from six matches, United have found some form. They have 10 points across their last four outings, winning three in a row before drawing at Nottingham Forest on Saturday.",
      "Casemiro headed Amorim's team into a half-time lead, but goals from Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head before Amad's late volley rescued a point. United missed a chance to strengthen their hopes of Champions League qualification but still sit just one point outside the top four.",
      "Amorim was pleased with the way his team recovered to going behind, even though they weren't able to win. \"Comparing [to] the recent past we had, some games [in] these big bad moments we struggle so much more than today, we managed to control the emotions, to put the ball on the ground and try to push the opponent to the final third,\" the Portuguese boss said.",
      "\"We managed to score, we had a big opportunity in the end. But we lost two points and that is the feeling, but we have the next week to work and to try and get these points in another stadium.\"",
      "He added: \"The big teams, sometimes when you have a bad moment, you know how to respond. When you cannot win, you cannot lose. I had that feeling today in the team, that we are not going to lose this game, and that is a good feeling.\"",

      "Rumours linking United with a move for Filling are not necessarily a surprise, with the 20-time English champions' name often used to spark further speculation for players ahead of a transfer window.",
      "Filling has made 11 appearances for AIK's first team this season, netting three goals in all competitions and is seen as a potential future star in Sweden.",
      "Due to Brexit rules, United's academy is primarily limited to recruiting within the UK. At just 16 years old, Filling would not have been able to join United in January, contrary to what reports suggested.",
      "United, along with the other Premier League and EFL clubs, are prohibited from signing players outside the UK until they turn 18, and all transfers from European nations require a work permit which are allocated using a points system.",

      "Kana-Biyik, who turned 18 in January, was in the final year of his contract. United finalised his signing in July and promptly loaned the young striker to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport.",

      "The Frenchman might be a Liverpool player, but he's not been shy in admitting a former Everton player donning the Red Devils shirt scored his most memorable goal. Rooney's strike is regarded among the greatest ever scored in the Premier League - and landed the Premier League Goal of the 20 Seasons award in 2012.",
      "It was also named as United's Goal of the decade and came at a vital time with Sir Alex Ferguson's side on the cusp of the title. City were a coming force, but United were still top dogs in Manchester and needed to prove it once again.",
      "Nani had opened the scoring in the first-half before David Silva scored a fortuitous equaliser after Edin Dzeko's shot hit his back and went in. Rooney would have the final word though and it is a goal that has stuck with Liverpool's new boy.",

      "\"I was so bad in that game,\" he has claimed upon reflection. \"It's one of the worst games I've ever played. I couldn't control a ball. I think it's more of an iconic goal because it's the derby, you score and win the game 2-1. But you don't practise overhead kicks.\"",
      "Nani provided a deflected assist to follow on from his opening goal - with Rooney admitting the looped cross worked in his favour. He said: “The deflection [from Nani’s cross] actually helped me, because it slowed the ball down and gave me time to adjust myself, turn my body.\"",

The thing about that goal is that Nani's goal will be forgotten - and it was fantastic. His first touch, taking it past the defender, rolling it into the net, it was unbelievable.

      "Former Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag is reportedly among the candidates being considered by Wolves. The Premier League's bottom side are looking for a new boss after sacking Vitor Pereira on Sunday and Ten Hag has emerged as a surprise option.",
      "Wolves lost 3-0 to Fulham on Saturday and that proved the final straw for Pereira, who was dismissed just weeks after signing a new three-year contract. The Portuguese manager was appointed in December 2024 to replace Gary O'Neil - and O'Neil is now in talks over a return.",
      "The former midfielder is out of work currently and is engaged in talks with the club he led for 16 months. But The Athletic reports that Wolves are also considering over options, including Ten Hag, who is also available following his sacking by Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "Ten Hag was dismissed by the German side after just three matches in September. That was his first job since his two-and-a-half-year stint with United, where he won the League Cup in 2022 and the FA Cup in 2023.",
      "He was sacked by United last October, with current boss Ruben Amorim coming in to replace him. Ten Hag is on a shortlist alongside former Middlesbrough coach Michael Carrick and Rob Edwards, who is currently leading Boro in the Championship.",
      "Wolves are rock-bottom of the Premier League having taken just two points from their 10 matches. They are the only side in the league without a win and are currently eight points from safety ahead of their trip to Stamford Bridge to play Chelsea on Saturday.",
      "On the sacking of Pereira, Wolves executive chairman Jeff Shi said: \"Vitor and his team worked tirelessly for Wolves and helped guide us through a challenging period last season, for which we are grateful.",

      "The Whites were well beaten at the Amex and that has seen their German boss become the bookies favourite in the sack race. Vitor Pereira had been top of that list having overseen 10 games without a win from the start of the season, but Wolves pulled the trigger at the weekend.",
      "It leaves them bottom and without a manager as several other clubs now look over their shoulders. A win for West Ham has condensed things with the Hammers in 18th just five points shy of Newcastle in 13th.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo is by no means a man out of the water and he's not had the instant impact he would've hoped for. Nottingham Forest recently got Sean Dyche on board and, whilst they battled to a draw with Manchester United, they remain in the bottom three.",

The Blues won on the road which led to boos ringing out at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as several players rejected their manager's request to clap the fans. The bad blood coming as a surprise to some given the team sit fifth.",
      "There is no such bad feeling on the other side of north London. Mikel Arteta's Arsenal side won at Burnley on Saturday and finished the weekend with a six point advantage over Manchester City. Despite some early criticism they have looked imperious and are being increasingly backed to win the title.",
      "Pep Guardiola will have been pleased to see his side rise to second, bouncing back from last weekend's loss at Villa. Bournemouth tasted a rare defeat but Andoni Iraola continues to perform miracles with the Cherries still in the top four.",
      "Despite the noise around Slot there was never any danger Liverpool were considering a change. His counterpart on Saturday, Unai Emery, is still the man Villa trust with their immediate future whilst newly promoted Sunderland can credit much of their stunning start to the season to manager Regis Le Bris.",
      "Crystal Palace got back to winning ways at the weekend as they downed Brentford with Oliver Glasner still performing impressively with the Eagles.",
      "Amorim may have enjoyed a renaissance, the peak of which was a win at Liverpool, but doubts continue over his suitability in Manchester. He's still wedded to his system and beliefs and, should results begin going against them again, then the noise with again gather volume.",
      "David Moyes is a safe pair of hands and, whilst unfashionable, often gets results. His Everton side are not riding high though and drifting closer to the drop could see some unwanted attention coming his way. The same could be said for Eddie Howe, who has seen Newcastle lose four of their ten games.",
      "It was a less than ideal summer and whilst he's overseen a steady rise there is always a feeling that the Saudi Arabian owners will want to see a progression towards their lofty ambitions.",
      "Tottenham and Chelsea have shown themselves to be cut throat so nothing is out of the question when it comes to Frank and Enzo Maresca - with the latter getting the better of the former at the weekend. Marco Silva, another London manager, is out of contract with Fulham this summer and you wonder whether the two parties feel they've gone far enough together.",
      "Nuno's win over Newcastle was much needed for the Hammers, with the ill-feeling in the London Stadium only growing. Burnley's loss means they remain close to the relegation zone and Scott Parker has suffered relegation in the past, which will hang over him.",
      "The same can certainly be said of Farke. He took Norwich down several years ago and struggled again shortly after. He was linked with the exit door before a ball had even been kicked, but he retained enough good faith after winning the Championship to remain in his post.",
      "Leeds were poor at Brighton and need to show more grunt on the road if they want to retain their top flight status. The recent loss at Burnley will also have only harmed Farke's status.",

      "Marcus Rashford believes he should have even more goals despite his brilliant start to life at Barcelona. The on-loan Manchester United forward joined the Catalan giants in the summer until the end of the season.",
      "And he has enjoyed a brilliant start with his temporary employers. Rashford’s goal in the weekend’s 3-1 win against Elche saw him make it six goals and seven assists in 14 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Despite that, Rashford believes he should have done even better had his decision-making been improved. He said: “I just try to do the right things on the pitch,\" Rashford told reporters. \"Even today, I could have had more assists or goals, sometimes the decision making to shoot or pass was wrong.",
      "\"But I am going to have days like this. The important thing is always the team and today we won. So I am happy for this.",
      "\"My focus is not so much on the output. If I am doing the right things, I know I will always be able to score and assist; my focus is with the team, to build relationships and feel comfortable.\"",
      "And while Rashford wants to improve further, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has given his verdict and agrees with the forward. Speaking after the weekend’s game, the German said: \"When you see the chances he has, one or two goals more will be good, also for him.",
      "\"But we can be happy with him, of course. I am very happy with him. He can play on this level and I am happy he shows it, for the fans and for the club, and also for the teammates he is a very important player.\"",
      "Rashford will be aiming to extend his hot form this coming week, with Barcelona facing a hectic run of fixtures. The Spanish giants take on Belgian outfit Club Brugge on Wednesday in the Champions League ahead of a showdown with Celta Vigo in league action.",
      "Flick will be desperate for a number of victories, with Barcelona already off the pace in the race for the league title. They already find themselves five points behind fierce rivals Real Madrid.",
      "The club also have a decision to make over Rashford’s future. They have an option to buy him permanently at the end of the season for a fee of around €30million (£26.2m).",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United considered six men as their next manager - Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter among them - before eventually changing their approach and landing on Ruben Amorim as their next manager following the sacking of Erik ten Hag almost a year ago.",
      "The Dutchman was dismissed after a dire start to the season and United move to land the Portuguese coach, then at Sporting Lisbon, but he hadn't been on their radar months earlier.",
      "After United won the FA Cup in 2024 they begun sounding out potential new managers with Ten Hag under pressure despite his Wembley success. Tuchel was a man without a job having left Bayern Munich and met club chiefs in Monaco, but was keen for a break.",
      "Potter had just come off a miserable spell at Chelsea, leading to questions over his credentials at the top level, yet he remained a possible appointment. Roberto de Zerbi, Mauricio Pochettino, Thomas Frank and Marco Silva were also on the shortlist, according to The Athletic.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox did speak to Amorim, and was impressed, but felt going from Sporting to a United side needing a rebuild would be too challenging.",
      "It is understood that a proposal was made to De Zerbi, who had just left Brighton, but he turned down their approach for financial reasons and shortly after took the gig at Marseille. Frank and Silva had both seen their stocks rise whilst operating in west London with Brentford and Fulham respectively.",
      "Neither man chose to make the jump. Frank has since left the Bees to become Tottenham boss but Silva remains at Fulham. Thiago Motta, who had impressed at Bologna and would join Juventus, was seen as another rising talent alongside Amorim, but no move was made.",
      "When push came to shove and United opted to axe Ten Hag, leaving the club in 14th after three wins from nine league games, they did turn to Amorim. He had continued to impress at Sporting and his record of two league titles, three domestic cups and a win percentage of 71 percent was too tempting.",
      "United met him for a five-hour meeting in Seville on October 18, where he laid out his vision, and were impressed with what he had to offer. Amorim expressed hesitancy multiple times about taking over the job in mid-season but it was made clear to him that it was now or never and he made the jump.",
      "The club's leading lights have repeatedly stuck by the decision to appoint the Portuguese boss, despite his dismissal record since taking charge. Sir Jim Ratcliffe recently claimed he needed three years to prove he was a top coach.",

      "Becks has used parts of his considerable fortune to invest in co-owning teams like Inter Miami and Salford City. And he was attending the Ammies' recent win over Swindon Town when he made a confession regarding one habit that gets on his wife's nerves.",
      "When asked if he watches a lot of football, he told Salford's official YouTube channel: \"I do actually. I do. There's just something...even if it's on in the background, I love it.",
      "\"Victoria hates it. But she hates the fact that when I've got the football on in the background, she's like, 'You're not even watching it.' I'm like, 'Yeah, but [smiles]...'\"",
      "'Posh' might have hoped her beau's obsession with football would wane once his playing career came to an end. And yet the opposite appears to be true in light of his investments over the years.",
      "Victoria was likely aware what she was marrying into when she first started dating the United legend in 1997. But more than a quarter of a century on from their first meeting, Beckham joked his football fascination sometimes still leads to bedroom tensions.",
      "\"I was very professional and regimented, actually,\" said Beckham when asked if he had any pre-match rituals as a player. \"Always used to eat the same food, do the same thing, bed early.",
      "\"If I was wearing a new pair of boots, I used to wear 'em in [smiles]...in bed. [I'd] try not to fall asleep but would fall asleep sometimes wearing the boots. Just so they'd mould a little bit. Back in the day, you'd get a new pair of boots, and they'd be quite stiff.",
      "\"So you'd bend them, throw them around a little bit, then put them on and wear them. Wear them around the bedroom...don't do it anymore obviously. Every now and again for Victoria, y'know [laughs].\"",
      "It's clear marrying a footballers means agreeing to humour the obsession beyond the lifespan of their playing career. However, not every ex-player boasts the budget to pursue their passion in the same manner Beckham has.",
      "In his defence, David has been seen accompanying Victoria to countless fashion shows over the years, including those to support her own brand. And therein may lie Becks' justification for watching (or not) as much football as he pleases.",

      "Barcelona recovered from El Clasico disappointment with a 3-1 triumph over Elche as Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford got back on the score sheet. The Catalan giants failed to beat Real Madrid last time out but Rashford once again had a key role to play in turning their fortunes around.",
      "Days after celebrating his 28th birthday, Rashford capped off Barcelona's performance by netting their third goal, although certain Spanish media outlets remained critical of his display. And despite accumulating six goals and seven assists across 14 appearances under Hansi Flick this term, the United exile expressed dissatisfaction with his own showing.",
      "\"I try to give my best. I could have done better against Elche and I promise to improve because I'm not entirely happy with my performance overall,\" he said after the final whistle. \"We work hard to win. We're taking it one game at a time. We need to keep playing as a team. This is Barca, and the demands must always be at their highest.\"",
      "He continued: \"Yes, it's a very, very important win. It's always important, after a defeat, to win the next match; that's the most important thing. Overall, I'm very happy today. Of course, confidence is essential in football, and the only way to build it is through hard work and winning matches.\"",
      "The switch to Spain has naturally presented challenges for the England international, though a standing ovation upon his 74th-minute substitution indicated supporters are satisfied. Ex-Barcelona defender Lluis Carreras highlighted one particular element of Rashford's game where he feels improvement is still needed.",
      "\"I find it hard to believe; he has some issues, he plays in a position where he can't be perfect,\" he told Cadena Ser about Rashford's approach. \"He can't receive the ball and pass it back immediately; he has to try things, and he's not sharp there.\"",
      "Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo echoed more positive sentiments regarding Rashford's display. The publication branded Rashford an \"asset\" whilst offering greater analysis of his performance.",
      "\"Having secured a starting spot while awaiting further significant returns, the Englishman helped launch the counter-attack against Elche's daring tactical plan,\" read the review. \"He was quite involved, experiencing both good and bad moments, until he sealed the victory with a stunning goal that showcased his best qualities.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Marca gave its own assessment of proceedings and emphasised Rashford's decisive contribution in wrapping up three points. Victory proved vital after dropping points against Real last time out, with the United loanee inspiring Flick's side to bounce back.",
      "The report particularly highlighted the technicality of Rashford's finish and read: \"Elche hit back with a goal by Rafa Mir in a 42nd-minute breakaway, but Rashford added to Barcelona's lead with a left-footed shot from a difficult angle in the 61st for his sixth goal of the season at his new club.\"",
      "Finally, Flick heaped praise upon his forward's contribution while noting the opportunities were there to do even more. Yet the manager's comments were generally positive.",
      "\"One or two more goals would have been good for him,\" said the Barcelona manager. \"I'm happy with him; I know he can play at this level and he's shown it. He's an important player.\"",

      "Manchester United appear unlikely to convince Endrick to depart Spain in January due to their lack of European football this season. The Real Madrid star is reportedly seeking a loan move to secure regular playing time ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "A number of clubs have been linked with the 19-year-old as he aims to push his way into the Brazilian squad for the prestigious tournament next summer. However, ESPN Brasil has outlined the four demands the teenager and his team have regarding his next club, and it looks like Ruben Amorim's side will fall short.",
      "Endrick wants to be part of a team in one of the top five leagues or one of the top three clubs in Portugal. The club must also be competing in Europe this season, either in the Champions League or Europa League.",
      "While United have the first demand sorted, their lack of European football during this campaign poses a problem. The Red Devils failed to qualify for Europe after finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham last season, rendering them to just domestic competition this year.",
      "Endrick also wants to be part of a side that has an emphasis on attacking football and are realistically competing for the league title in their country. Amorim's side have bounced back from a faltering start with three wins and a draw in their last four matches, but a push for the title may prove to be too much for the squad this season.",
      "The Brazilian star is also planning for regular game time at his new club, which could prove to be tricky for Amorim if he did want to sign the exciting talent. Given the lack of European football, United are only playing once a week for the most part after they exited the Carabao Cup prematurely at Grimsby Town.",
      "With both stars planning to head to AFCON in December and January, fans may feel that Endrick would slot in nicely in their absence. However, this may not be enough to guarantee regular minutes for the teenager, and he is likely to opt for another side who can promise him what he wants.",
      "One such side is Aston Villa, who are participating in the Europa League and are in need of attackers to fuel both their domestic and international campaigns. The Premier League side have expressed an interest in bringing the youngster in on a loan on January but face competition from many sides across Europe, as per the Daily Star.",
      "United, Villa, Juventus and West Ham are all reportedly interested, as well as European giants Borussia Dortmund. Sky Germany reported that the Bundesliga side, who have dealt with Madrid on numerous occasions, have emerged as a potential destination.",
      "And despite giving Endrick just 11 minutes of gametime this season, Real boss Xabi Alonso believes the star still has a part to play at the Bernabeu this season. Speaking before his side's win over Juventus in the Champions League, Alonso said: \"Endrick on loan? We're not at that point yet. The competition in attack is intense.",
      "\"We have to be prepared for every game. Endrick, Gonzalo, and Brahim have to be ready. They're going to come in, and have to be ready. This is the elite, and we need a lot of good players.\"",

      "Luke Shaw handled a question about receiving criticism from Roy Keane brilliantly when he spoke in September.",
      "Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby defeat and Keane ripped into him after the game, saying he'd been \"getting away with murder for years\" and was reluctant to make a tackle.",
      "The 30-year-old responded when he talked to journalists after Manchester United's win against Chelsea. \"I think sometimes you just have to take it on the chin,\" said Shaw.",
      "\"He's [Keane] got a lot of experience. He was one of the best captains ever for Man United. Of course it hurts. I think criticism is part of being a football player. I listen to it. But for me, I think he was right.",
      "\"I think that last week, I wasn't at my level at all. I don't need Roy Keane to tell me. I think after the game I knew that. I knew that, but of course it hurts. I'm not getting any younger now. I need to be consistent. I've had a lot of ups and downs, but for me now, it's about keeping that consistency at a high level.\"",
      "It was a measured response. Shaw demonstrated his experience by giving a thoughtful answer and he deserves huge credit for also responding on the pitch across the last six weeks.",
      "Shaw was excellent in the first half against Nottingham Forest, winning all four of his duels and recording a pass completion rate of 90 per cent. He was a commanding presence and made several important interceptions.",
      "Diogo Dalot had a game to forget at left wing-back, but Shaw mopped up at the back to deliver another performance that will attract the attention of England manager Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Shaw will play himself back into the England squad if he maintains his current performance levels, and has enjoyed a good campaign so far if you ignore his blip against Manchester City.",
      "United's failure to qualify for European football and an early Carabao Cup exit has benefited Shaw, whose body has struggled with the load of playing a game every three or four days.",
      "Although Shaw's quality has never been questioned, he has spent far too much time on the sidelines during his United stint and an injury has usually been just around the corner after a good run of form.",
      "This season should be different due to the reduced workload. Shaw has longer to recover and prepare, so it would be incredibly disappointing if he picks up an issue when there are fewer games.",
      "Fans have joked that the secret to Shaw performing consistently is playing in a World Cup season or a campaign before a European Championship because his best seasons have tended to be before major tournaments.",
      "Lisandro Martinez has returned to full training and will compete with Shaw when he is available for selection again, but the Argentina international may struggle to regain that starting role.",
      "Shaw has the left side position of the back-three nailed down. Ruben Amorim has not asked him to play at wing-back, where he previously played for England.",
      "That has helped Shaw to avoid injuries. The wing-back roles in Amorim's system are physically demanding, and even Shaw would concede that he no longer has the legs to play that role.",
      "Amorim enjoyed an October to remember and Shaw was crucial in important wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, so he merits a recall to the England squad when it's announced this week.",
      "Shaw responded on the pitch after Keane's criticism - and that is what a professional should do.",

      "At the beginning of the season some Manchester United supporters were concerned that Casemiro was being prepared for a starring role in 2025/26.",
      "While the 33-year-old played well in the Europa League last term as the Reds reached the final, the midfielder's performances in the Premier League suggested he could no longer cut it in the English top flight.",
      "However, what a difference a few months make. Casemiro has been key to United's recent unbeaten run and on Saturday at Nottingham Forest he was once again one of the stars of the show.",
      "The Brazilian handed United the lead in the first half to make it two goals in two games and move his tally for the season up to three.",
      "Away from the goals, Casemiro is doing a brilliant job protecting the back three. No longer being asked to cover vast areas of the midfield, he sits in front of the defence and allows Bruno Fernandes the freedom to play further forward, with the United skipper knowing he has the protection needed next to him.",
      "Casemiro is seemingly now one of the first names on the teamsheet for the Reds, and on Saturday it was the first time since the final day of last season that he has managed to play a full 90 minutes. His importance as the anchor of the midfield cannot be understated and, given Manuel Ugarte's underwhelming showings since his move to England, Ruben Amorim would be struggling without him.",
      "While this is great news for United in the short term, it does leave the Reds with a glaring transfer question: At the end of the season, what comes next?",
      "Casemiro is out of contract in the summer, although there is a one-year extension option United could trigger in his deal. The Brazilian is one of the highest paid players at Old Trafford and he will be 34 by the time United come to make a decision on the midfielder.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United could choose to extend Casemiro's stay, but he would need to agree to a significant pay cut.",
      "If the club allow him to leave, they will likely need to spend big money to replace him.",
      "When United asked about the availability of Brighton's Carlos Baleba in the summer they were told he would cost £100m. Baleba's performance levels have dropped this season and so the south coast side will do well to get anywhere near that figure if he does leave next summer, but that gives you an idea of the money needed to buy a top-class midfield operator.",
      "If United do sign a central midfielder in the summer, there's also the question of whether it would be a smart move to keep Casemiro at the club to act as a mentor for whoever arrives.",
      "If the Brazil international leaves then it would be left to Ugarte to play that role as the only other defensive midfield option at the club, yet he's hardly in a position to help others amid his own struggles.",
      "Keeping Casemiro might make sense, but there's also a strong case to be made for moving him on.",
      "It's a question nobody saw coming but one United need to answer.",

      "Amad's fantastic strike in the 81st minute meant United avoided a defeat to one of the Premier League's bottom three teams. After a decent start in the Midlands, the Reds found themselves 2-1 down in a matter of minutes after half-time.",
      "Amorim stuck with the same team that defeated Brighton and Hove Albion the week prior, and when Casemiro opened the scoring from Bruno Fernandes' corner, optimism of a fourth straight win was high.",
      "Two goals in two minutes through Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head, and United spent the final 40 minutes of the contest chasing an equaliser. Fortunately, that goal came. But Amorim's substitute behaviour has left questions to be answered.",
      "The Portuguese brought Diogo Dalot off in the 68th minute for Patrick Dorgu after a difficult afternoon for the Portuguese. Nine minutes later, Noussair Mazraoui replaced Leny Yoro. Both changes occurred in the backline, although Mazraoui's involvement was marked by an increased presence in the middle third.",
      "Left on the bench were Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte, Mason Mount and Joshua Zirkzee. Amad, Casemiro, and Bruno Fernandes were all having decent individual games, as were Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo; therefore, the decision not to disrupt the momentum made sense.",
      "However, Benjamin Sesko's performance was lacking, so much so that the striker has been on the receiving end of some harsh words from Gary Neville. The former United defender delivered a brutal assessment of his performance at the City Ground. \"I'm no further forward with him. The jury is out,\" he told NBC Sports.",
      "\"He's well off it compared to the other summer signings that Man United made up front in Cunha and Mbeumo. He looks awkward, he had a couple of really good opportunities in the first half - when balls got played over the top. And his touch wasn't quite right.",
      "\"For £80million, you can say he's young, or has a lot of potential and he's only just settling in, but you still want to see a bit more.\" Sesko stayed on the pitch for the entire game, while Zirkzee, who is understood to be keen on a January move, was kept on the bench.",
      "Beyond Zirkzee, Amorim has no other striker option to choose from, meaning the likelihood of Sesko seeing out the entirety of games is high, regardless of how impressive or poor he performs.",
      "At Forest, Sesko completed just nine passes and had an xG of just 0.16. All three of his attempts went off target and he managed only two touches in the opposition box - perhaps the most worrying stat of them all.",
      "Away from the striker, there were also problems with Dalot's display. Unlike Sesko, the full-back was replaced by Dorgu after being caught sleeping for Savona's goal at the back post.",
      "Both players are naturally included in Amorim's strongest XI, but given the nature of the two positions and their importance to the system, concerns will persist in the long term. The January transfer window opens in less than two months now, and it's becoming clearer what the United boss needs next.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Sesko's arrival in England was always going to take some time, and there have been many signs of optimism so far. But without a centre-forward in the squad to choose from when a change is needed, his development is being limited.",
      "Links to Real Madrid's Endrick in recent weeks sound tempting. The Brazilian hasn't played a minute for Xabi Alonso's side yet, and a temporary move to provide stiff competition in attack is something Sesko needs.",

      "AIK Fotboll forward Kevin Filling has played down rumours that he could join Manchester United.",
      "A report had claimed United were close to signing Filling from AIK for around €3million (£2.6m).",
      "United sources clarified the report was wide of the mark. The Swedish press subsequently stated the rumour was not true, but Filling was still asked about the claims when he spoke to reporters at the weekend.",
      "When Filling was asked what he knew about links to Old Trafford, he explained to Fotboll Direkt: “It’s nothing special. I don’t know much. I’m focused on AIK and that’s where all my focus lies. And do the best I can in every game. Every chance I get. Continue to deliver more points.\"",
      "It's not uncommon for United to be mentioned in transfer reports in order to give agents leverage.",
      "Filling has made 11 appearances for AIK's first team this season. The youngster has scored three goals in all competitions and is considered a potential future star in Sweden.",
      "United's academy is essentially limited to a UK-based recruitment search due to Brexit rules. Filling is 16 years old, which means he could not join United in January, as reports suggested.",
      "Premier League and EFL clubs are not allowed to sign players from abroad until they are 18, and all transfers from European nations require a work permit to be allocated using a points system.",
      "United still operate in the European market when opportunities arise and were proactive in wrapping up the signing of Enzo Kana-Biyik on a free transfer from Le Havre in the summer.",
      "Kana-Biyik celebrated his 18th birthday in January and had entered the final year of his contract. United completed his signing in July and immediately sent the young forward on loan to Ineos-owned FC Lausanne-Sport.",

      "Ruben Amorim joked not even the Pope could persuade him to change his formation at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim is wedded to the 3-4-3 formation and United spent £215million on players with the skillsets to thrive in the system in the summer transfer window.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed to play in the No.10 roles. The attack was overhauled, but there was a feeling that United had made a mistake by not signing a new midfielder.",
      "United decided to go another season without a midfield recruit. That position will be the priority at the end of the season, but a new wing-back should also be at the top of the shopping list.",
      "The wing-backs are crucial in Amorim's formation. They provide width, quality in attack and defensive cover. They must have an engine to get up and down the line. It's a specialist role in the system.",
      "Amad has nailed down the right-wing back spot and delivered some excellent performances from that role throughout October, but there are question marks on the opposite side.",
      "Diogo Dalot was poor against Sunderland, despite his throw-ins being effective. He was the worst performer in the first half against Liverpool, albeit he recovered to end the game strongly. He was fine against Brighton and then took further backwards steps against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Dalot's versatility has been a selling point throughout his career. The 26-year-old is willing to play wherever he is needed, but his performances indicate he is far more comfortable when operating on the right.",
      "Following some unconvincing displays from Patrick Dorgu, Amorim has played Dalot at left wing-back in recent weeks, which was logical given his experience and the importance of the games.",
      "Dorgu was removed from the firing line after showing signs of greenness. The Denmark international is still developing his game and Amorim preferred Dalot during a run of games that he needed to win.",
      "Dalot was replaced by Dorgu in the 68th minute at the City Ground last weekend, but he might have been hooked at the interval if there had been a better option on the bench.",
      "The majority of Nottingham Forest's attacking play came down Dalot's flank and he was too passive in the build-up to Morgan Gibbs-White's goal, failing to prevent the cross into the box.",
      "It will be fascinating to see whether Dalot retains his starting role against Tottenham. He does not deserve to keep his place, but Amorim may still consider him ahead of Dorgu.",
      "Dorgu was always bound to need time and patience. United signed Dorgu for an initial €30million (£25m) from Lecce, who banked a club-record transfer fee for the 21-year-old after persistent negotiations.",
      "He arrived in the winter window and joined a struggling dressing room. \"It was difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season,\" Dorgu said when he spoke in August.",
      "United believe Dorgu has the attributes to become a top player. \"I had interest from big teams in Italy as well, so it (United's interest) wasn’t a surprise,\" he said. \"If you're doing well, the big teams are going to look. I was surprised that they were really aggressive to get it done quickly, and I was really happy for that.\"",
      "How long Dorgu needs to reach his potential is another matter. He was a heavily data-driven signing and has the ideal physical attributes to play at left wing-back, but his final ball must improve.",
      "That's why United may need to sign a new left wing-back at the end of the season. United will know by then whether Dorgu is ready to start regularly, but it might be sensible to sign a player in that role who can hit the ground running, someone who doesn't need to improve.",
      "The wing-backs are crucial in Amorim's system and he needs the right personnel.",

      "Marcus Rashford will have to take a pay cut in order to join Barcelona at the end of the season, it is being reported. When the Spanish giants signed the Manchester United forward on loan in the summer, they included an option-to-buy clause in the deal worth £28m.",
      "He's enjoyed a brilliant start to the campaign, scoring six goals and providing seven assists in just 14 games. Rashford was given a standing ovation at the weekend, too, for his role in Barcelona's 3-1 win over Elche at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium.",
      "The England international scored the third and final goal for Hansi Flick's side on Sunday evening, smashing the ball against the underside of the crossbar. Last month, Rashford outlined his plan to stay at Barcelona despite having taken a pay cut to finalise the loan deal.",
      "According to European football expert Andy Brassell, the Catalan outfit want to sign the United loanee permanently, so long as he's prepared to take another pay cut. Speaking on the Trans Euro Express podcast, he outlined Barcelona's financial situation.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "\"Yeah, they're gonna make an honest man of him, it seems, and not just ask him to commit to another year's loan, which I've always suspected would be the case for obvious financial reasons,\" said Brassell. \"I mean, look, in terms of what he's actually produced while he's there, it's a no-brainer to want to keep him.",
      "\"He's been absolutely brilliant. I think he's been allowed a little bit more latitude by the fact that Raphinha's been injured and has been a regular face in the crowd or on the sidelines, and starting argy bargy after El Clásico.",
      "\"But look, Rashford has fitted in really well. Hansi Flick's very pleased with him. He got another great goal, a terrific finish left-footed from an angle to see off the game against Elche, which they eventually won 3-1.",
      "\"Elche, tougher opposition than they might seem on paper. And they have Iñaki Peña, the former Barcelona goalkeeper in goal, who had a really good game [on Sunday], I thought.",
      "\"And look, he's clicking with their best players. He's clicking with Lamine Yamal; he's clicking really well with Fermín [López] as well. Barca look like they're gonna score goals with Marcus Rashford in the team. It's that simple.\"",
      "While not many players would accept another pay cut, Brassell outlined the relationship between the club and the player. The European football expert continued: \"I think the mutual happiness of the relationship so far is very important.",
      "\"The fact that there is interest in Rashford, clearly, especially with a view to England and the World Cup next summer, in how he's doing over here. But, it does feel maybe from his perspective that there's enough distance for him just to be able to get his head down and get on with the game without sort of, I guess, microscopic levels of attention.",
      "\"Clearly, working with Hansi Flick is a real bonus. Barcelona have got an option which is around, thought to be around 30, 35 million euros. As we've underlined, Barcelona don't have tons of money, but I think when you bear in mind that they could amortise that over the length of a contract, that they are planning to give Rashford another pay cut, if he will accept it.",
      "\"Obviously, he's already taken a pay cut to go there, but he is speaking their language, and I don't mean Catalan. And I think the plan is that they will give him a longer contract with the same sort of money that he's getting at the moment.",
      "\"So, it works out to be spread over a longer period of time, which is how they will make it work financially. And look, long may it continue. It's good for England, it's good for him, and we wanna see him doing his stuff.\"",

      "Particularly since the arrival of Pep Guardiola on the other side of Manchester, there has been an obsession in English football with dominating possession.",
      "However, this season has seen a change in tack from Premier League coaches. The more direct approach has been welcomed back and having less of the ball is on-trend again, with Manchester United one of the teams keen to get from back to front as fast as possible.",
      "In the victory over Sunderland United had more possession, but against both Liverpool and Brighton the Reds were comfortable without the ball, particularly against the Seagulls. Ruben Amorim's side were compact and waited for the right moment to pick them off.",
      "Against Nottingham Forest, United had to change back to being the team in possession. United have been most dangerous in recent weeks when they have been in transition but in Forest they found a side that wanted to do exactly the same.",
      "Sean Dyche has built a managerial career off making teams hard to beat. His teams are often physical and do not need to have the ball to provide a threat.",
      "With the hosts happy to sit back, it was on United to have the ball and try and make things happen. Unfortunately for them, they found Forest tough to break down.",
      "The Reds were not as free-flowing when they had the ball and were only ahead at half-time thanks to a goal from a corner. In the second half, their good luck ran out.",
      "Inside five minutes Forest had the lead and United knew they needed to break them down to get anything out of the game. Amad's wonder strike saved the day but for large parts of the second half it was hard to see where the equaliser was going to come from.",
      "From that perspective, the weekend draw should be seen as a warning to the Reds.",
      "United are now a team that are happy to play on the counter and try and catch teams unaware. However, there will be more occasions to come - against the likes of Burnley, West Ham and others - where the Reds will need to be the team dominating the ball and they will have to find a new way to win those games.",
      "In those matches, United would be wise to be quicker with the ball. When they looked most threatening against Forest they were spreading play quickly through Bruno Fernandes and causing overloads, particularly through Amad and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Once the tempo slows, that is when the opposition look comfortable, so for Amorim the task must be to ensure that energy remains high. Make no mistake, the Reds' play has improved since October and undoubtedly United would have lost that game last season.",
      "But if they are to become genuine top four challengers both this season and moving forward, Amorim needs to find a way of winning matches when they are the ones setting the tempo.",

Amad, 23, scored United's second goal at The City Ground to ensure Ruben Amorim's side earned a point and stretched their unbeaten run to four matches.",
      "The Reds were on a three game winning run heading into the trip to Nottingham, but, despite taking the lead through Casemiro, they had to settle for a draw. Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head and put Forest 2-1 ahead, before Amad netted in the 81st minute to grab a point for Amorim's men.",
      "After United's trip to Forest, a social media post claimed Amad visited his 'pregnant wife', with two photos included. The account, which has over 33,000 followers, on X wrote: \"Amad Diallo visits his pregnant wife after the weekend game. Impossible not to love them [red love heart emoji and goat emoji].\"",
      "Responding to the tweet, Amad shut down the claim and asked for people to respect his privacy.",
      "Quoting the message, Amad said: \"Spreading false information will not help you promote your page [cross mark emoji] A bit respect for my privacy.\"",
      "It was later alleged that one of the images included in the initial tweet was AI-generated, hence Amad's response.",
      "Amad's goal against Forest was his first of the season. He has been playing in a deeper position since the arrival of Bryan Mbeumo in the summer and hasn't got into as many goalscoring positions.",
      "However, Amad could have scored another for United late on, as his rasping volley was cleared off the line by Murillo, denying the Reds what might have been a match-winning third goal.",

      "The Premier League winner has kept two clean sheets in 10 league matches, but the attackers on the pitch have not been able to play their part. As a result, Stefano Pioli's side, along with Verona, are one of only two teams to have not recorded a single league victory.",
      "They suffered a 1-0 defeat at home to Lecce in their most recent match. Quotidiano Sportivo praised De Gea's display, also stating he was not at fault when \"disaster struck\" and Medon Berisha scored for the away side. Nevertheless, he has been showing his leadership by speaking to the press when the club has lost.",
      "After a 3-0 loss to Inter Milan, he spoke with Firenze e Dintorni where he even said he was happy at the club. He said: \"As soon as I arrived at Fiorentina, I immediately felt at ease. Viola Park is incredible and played a role in my final decision.",
      "\"With the staff, teammates, and staff, I feel like I'm part of a big family. I'm happy in Florence and the Florentine atmosphere. The fans are special.",

      "The only positive in Fiorentina's campaign has been in the Conference League, where they have won both matches and scored five. When asked to compare their club form and Europe, he dealt his team-mates a stern dose of reality.",
      "He said: \"The level of these two teams we faced in the Conference is lower than in Serie A. We played well in the Conference, but in the league we're not the same because it's tougher, we play against strong teams.",

      "Manchester United's latest transfer interest could end up helping Barcelona sign Marcus Rashford on a permanent deal this summer.",
      "The 28-year-old joined the Spanish giants on a season-long loan after being made available for transfer by United. Last season, Rashford spent a short spell on loan at Aston Villa following growing tension between himself and new manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "With the winter transfer window less than two months away, clubs are already being linked with new targets – and United haven’t gone under the radar.",
      "Amorim's side are reportedly keen to sign a new striker, and Brazilian international Vitor Roque is said to be of interest, with the 20-year-old having been \"reborn\" in Brazil.",
      "Palmeiras signed Roque from Barcelona in February for around £22million, making it the most expensive transfer fee paid in South American football history.",
      "Roque struggled to make an impact at Barcelona, scoring just twice in 16 appearances, but since joining Palmeiras, he has quickly revived his career, netting 17 goals and providing five assists in his first year at the club.",
      "The striker is now hoping to secure a place in Carlo Ancelotti’s Brazil squad ahead of next year’s World Cup.",
      "If United are serious about signing Roque, they may have to wait until the summer, with the young forward keen to remain in Brazil until June. After that, Spanish outlet Sport claim he \"would be open to a new adventure.\"",
      "A key factor in any potential deal between United and Roque would be Barcelona's sell-on clause, believed to be 20%. That means if Amorim's side were to sign Roque for £50million, Barcelona would receive £10million from the sale.",
      "Such a windfall could then help the La Liga giants fund a permanent move for Rashford. Barcelona hold an option-to-buy clause worth £28million, though they are not obligated to activate it.",
      "A new striker would also bring competition for Benjamin Sesko, who has struggled to make a big impact in the Premier League so far, scoring just twice in his first 11 appearances.",

      "Manchester United loanee Andre Onana has insisted that he does not fear any opponent on the football pitch and would not define himself as a loser since moving to Trabzonspor on loan in September.",
      "Onana began the season as back-up to Altay Bayindir after suffering an injury during pre-season. The Cameroonian was given his chance to impress against Grimsby Town but a poor performance sealed his fate at Old Trafford.",
      "On deadline day, Senne Lammens joined United and after the window closed, the Reds took advantage of Turkey's extended market to allow Onana to leave on loan. The deal with Trabzonspor is a straight loan switch with no option to buy, but the goalkeeper has impressed his new club.",
      "He has not lost a game since his debut against Fenerbahce and has kept two clean sheets in his last three appearances. In an interview with Sporx this week, Onana spoke confidentally about his style of play and attitude towards being a goalkeeper.",
      "\"I never fear anyone. Because in this life, I only fear God,\" he explained.",
      "\"Therefore, to be honest, no one can scare me. For me, most of the time, the important thing is to try to do what's best for the team.",
      "\"If I need to play out from the back, I first analyse. Is the opponent pressing? Are they pressing with the winger, the striker, or are their centre-backs stepping up? These are the things I need to see when the ball is at my feet.",
      "\"I track how the opponent moves and look at the options before making my decision.\" United fans would argue that Onana did not distribute the ball as well as was expected during his time at the Theatre of Dreams, but the 29-year-old refuses to see that as a failure.",
      "\"Looking back, my career has really been amazing,\" he continued. \"There have been many ups and downs in this process, but that also meant a lot of learning moments, a lot of experiences.",
      "\"Coming from Cameroon and playing in Barcelona, Ajax, Inter, Manchester, and now in Trabzonspor is magnificent. Coming from there and looking at today, seeing what I've achieved in the last 10-11 years - amazing, really amazing.",
      "\"Every time I put on my boots or gloves, I want to win. Because at the end of the day, that's what we play for.",
      "\"We play to win, and I’m not afraid of anyone. When I step onto the pitch, I either win or I learn. I don’t see myself as a loser. If I don’t win, I take it as an opportunity to learn.",
      "\"Let me give you an example: my first match here was against Fenerbahce. We played well, but we didn’t win. But I don’t see it as a loss. I learned something, for instance, I learned how the referees are here.\"",
      "Onana's Trabzonspor now sit second in the Super Lig table and are just five points behind league leaders Galatasaray. Next up for them is a trip to the table-toppers on Saturday evening.",

      "Dorgu was shown a straight red card in United's 3-2 win over Ipswich Town in February after a high challenge on Omari Hutchinson. The £25million signing got a slight touch on the ball but followed through and caught his opponent late on the top of the shin.",
      "He was initially given a yellow card before England was advised by VAR to review the incident on the pitch-side monitor. After a brief check, the decision was overturned and Dorgu was sent off.",
      "At the time, England was seen explaining the decision before brandishing the red card and former PGMOL chief and ex-FIFA referee Keith Hackett admitted that it opened the referee up to backlash.",
      "\"The red card issued by Darren England is correct, this is a challenge with excessive force, that endangers the safety of his opponent,\" he told Football Insider. \"Frankly, [when refereeing myself] I monitored the player leaving the field of play without engaging in any discussion, it is easy in the heat of the situation to be accused of saying something.",
      "\"You should monitor for sure, but there is no point of explaining why the player is being sent off, it is pretty obvious when you make a challenge with such force.”",
      "This week, the Premier League have announced their match officials appointments for the weekend's action and England will be in charge for United's trip to the City Ground. Scott Ledger and Akil Howson will be his assistants, with Bobby Madley joining the managers in the technical area.",

The players who were unused substitutes against the Seagulls or played limited minutes at the weekend took part in Sunday's training session, as did a number of academy players who were called up to boost the numbers.",
      "The club have released a short video of the training session and MEN Sport picked out three key points from the workout.",
      "Before Brighton, Amorim confirmed that Mason Mount was a doubt for the fixture, which instantly caused concern given his track record with injuries.",
      "He managed to be fit enough for a place on the bench but was not risked against the Seagulls. He took part in Sunday's training session and looked to be moving freely as he aims to regain his place in the team on Saturday.",
      "As the current back-up goalkeeper, Altay Bayindir was involved in the session along with Tom Heaton. The Turkish goalkeeper took part in a small-sided game with the outfield players.",
      "While United have looked to be more direct with Senne Lammens in goal, being able to play out from the back is still a big part of modern-day football, and Bayindir is clearly keen to get the practice in with his feet.",
      "Harry Maguire was not spotted participating in the session having missed the win over Brighton through injury.",
      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",

      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",

      "United suffered a big setback at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ruben Amorim's future subsequently dominated headlines, but Amorim has enjoyed an October to remember.",
      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's effective approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said last Friday.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Ex-Man Utd defender Jonny Evans has named two of his former team-mates at Old Trafford as “on another level to the rest of the team”.",
      "The former Northern Ireland international called time on his playing career at the end of last season with Evans taking over as head of loans and pathways at Man Utd.",
      "Evans had spells at Man Utd between 2006-15 and 2023-25 with the centre-back playing 241 times in all competitions for the Red Devils over those two periods.",
      "The 37-year-old won three Premier League titles, one FA Cup, two League Cups, one Champions League and a FIFA Club World Cup during his time at Old Trafford.",

      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Caicedo, Wolves, Rice, Farke, Liverpool, Frank, Emery and more…",
      "“The both of them, they’d do things, more on the training pitch than anything, and you’d think, “I didn’t even know that existed. I’ll never be able to get to that level.” It’s just a different level.”",
      "As well as playing with some legendary players, Evans also came up against some particularly special players with the former Man Utd star naming Luis Suarez as his toughest foe.",
      "Evans added: “I’d go straight to [Luis] Suarez at Liverpool. I’d probably go Suarez, [Didier] Drogba and [Sergio] Aguero. Over the years those three stand out more than the others.”",
      "On Suarez, he added: “You just never knew what you were going to get with him. He’d bobble the ball through your legs. He could do everything. He was strong, brave, a real handful.”",
      "Announcing his retirement in June this year, Evans said in a statement: “I want to officially announce my retirement from my playing career, not with sadness, but with pride, gratitude and excitement for the next chapter ahead.",
      "“I’ll be forever indebted to the managers, coaches, staff and, of course, my team-mates, that I have had the privilege of working alongside throughout my 20 years in professional football.",
      "“Having had experience of loans myself, I know the crucial role that they can play within a player’s development. I am excited to help further develop the pathway to our first team and continue the legacy of young players thriving at Manchester United.”",

      "Should it all go pear-shaped, there is a clear favourite to replace him and that is certainly not Emery. He won’t get another shot at the Emirates after that first stint, but he does deserve a crack at managing an elite club again because it appears he’s taken Aston Villa as far as he can.",

      "Alternatively, it would be Steven Gerrard and Aston Villa really don’t want that…",
      "",
      "Bournemouth are among a host of Premier League teams that will *definitely* be searching for a new manager next year as Andoni Iraola is destined for grener pastures.",

      "But Coventry City gave him a chance to redeem himself last November and he’s not looked back since, taking the Sky Blues from 18th to the top of the Championship and this is why his team have become so good. This confirmed his place as the best manager from England’s so-called ‘Golden Generation’ and talk of a return to the Premier League is fully justified, even if it probably won’t be with Chelsea.",

      "Once he’s gone, FA Cup holders Palace can surely only go downhill from their current lofty heights of playing in Europe and 78-year-old Hodgson would not need to be asked twice to come out of retirement *again* to steady the ship.",
      "",
      "It’s been apparent for several years that Silva would exit Fulham once he receives a good offer for an upwards move, which would be warranted given how well he’s done at Craven Cottage.",

      "This is the latest of Pep Guardiola’s coaching experiments at the Etihad, and it may be one of his last as he’s due a Klopp-esque break from management. His successor looks likely to be his regen in La Liga, though Mancini proved by talking to Nottingham Forest that he’s keen on a return to the Premier League. His return makes sense, even if that’s purely because it could also lead to Mario Balotelli’s comeback.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should now be aiming for a top-four finish in the Premier League after their recent run of form, according to Lee Sharpe.",
      "The Red Devils were in poor form earlier in the season as Amorim, who took Man Utd to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last term, faced questions over his future but things have turned round a bit in the last month.",
      "Man Utd won three games in a row for the first time under Amorim recently before a 2-2 draw on the road at Nottingham Forest took their unbeaten run to four matches in the Premier League.",
      "When asked what he’s made of Amorim’s first year in charge, Sharpe exclusively told Football365 on behalf of Adventure Games: “Yeah, I think a little bit indifferent and up and down. I think we’ve seen flashes of brilliance and flashes of not such good stuff. But I think we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I think we’re seeing his system, his philosophy, coming into effect.",
      "“I think that they’re creating a lot of chances and not quite putting enough away at the moment, but dominating teams like like he was hoping to do early on, but just didn’t.",
      "“Defensively, still a little bit of frailty at times, and teams possibly getting a few too many chances against them. If they start putting chances away then that sort of gets pushed to push to the side, really.",
      "READ: Five Manchester United stars who need to be replaced with upgrades, including one summer signing",
      "“So a little bit indifferent and inconsistent, but I think we are starting to see the fruition of his, of his work now, and I think we’ve seen some good stuff.”",
      "When asked what the target should be for Man Utd this season, Sharpe added: “I think top four is a realistic goal. I think the last couple of weeks, with the results they’ve had beaten Liverpool away, a good win against Brighton, who are a bit of a tricky team and a bit of a bogey team for United at home, and won that comfortably.",
      "“A little bit disappointed against Forest, but again, creating chances with Forest with the new manager and the new manager sort of lifts, I think it was always going to be a tricky game.",
      "“So to be unbeaten in the last four is a real bonus and a real confidence builder for the team. And I think that’s what, that’s what the team needs now. The fans need a bit of confidence that they can put a string of results together.",
      "“And they don’t have this sort of high and low and high and low, this roller coaster ride that’s been going on for the last 12 months.",
      "“And I think we can, like I say, we can see a little bit of that coming now, and the more results they can put together, the more that confidence grows. And I think top four can be a realistic place to look.”",
      "Wolves getting rid of Vitor Pereira leaves two joint-favourites in the Sack Race, though one manager is surely the most likely to go next…",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "Are Man Utd set for a return to the Champions League? A landmark decision by Ruben Amorim for Nottm Forest bodes well.",
      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Man Utd boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the initial six-man shortlist.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?"

      "But there are few coaches more meticulous and prescient in their planning when Maresca accurately predicts the opponent’s approach, as proven by his call to play Reece James in midfield because “we expected them to play with Sarr, Bentancur and Palhinha” so “we needed a little bit more physicality in the middle”.",
      "It must help to possess an off-the-ball cheat code like Caicedo. There has surely never been an assist more representative of a player’s specific skillset than a double tackle before laying the ball off to a forward to score.",
      "The Ecuadorian has already matched his best tally for combined goals and assists in a Premier League season, is the leader for combined tackles and interceptions in 2025/26, and perhaps most impressively as the midfield general in a ludicrously ill-disciplined team, has been booked just once this campaign.",

      "In the case of Rice especially, it can no longer be said that he doesn’t bring enough to the attack.",
      "His set-piece consistency and quality is among the best in world football. He has carried the ball almost 700 cumulative yards further than any Arsenal teammate, and more than every other Premier League player bar Jan Paul van Hecke and Elliot Anderson. Only 10 players have made more passes into the final third.",

      "Thankfully not in either the performance or the result. A more balanced midfield and attack was complemented by a solidity in defence encouraged by the innate familiarity between Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson on the left.",
      "The positive development of Hugo Ekitike in particular asks some awkward questions of which round holes the club’s two most expensive square pegs fit inside, because the ultimate endgame for Liverpool is Florian Wirtz lavishing countless chances on Alexander Isak every game.",

Brighton had drawn each of their last five home games against newly promoted – and ultimately relegated – clubs dating back to November 2023, finding increasingly absurd ways to slip on otherwise inadequate banana skins like Sheffield United, Ipswich and Southampton.",

      "Marco Silva had resisted deploying Alex Iwobi more centrally for long enough on the basis that it would cost Fulham too much on the left flank. But the successful integration of Kevin has granted the Cottagers more than enough technical ability down that side and the modest challenge of Wolves at home made playing a single natural defensive midfielder more palatable.",
      "Sander Berge was excellent in that role but using Iwobi as his partner gave Fulham far more creative thrust than usual through the middle. The Nigerian’s seven shot-creating actions were the most by a Fulham player in a Premier League game since February.",

      "There is a lot to be said for that after Amorim seemed to spend much of last season hiding incompetence and frequent defeats behind the pretence of necessary ‘suffering’, and a great many fans pretended it was an unavoidable part of this rebuild.",
      "The football has returned to Casemiro, who played a full 90 minutes for the first time this season. Amad is among those stepping up when the chips are down instead of just staring aimlessly at Bruno Fernandes. And the World Cup year iteration of Luke Shaw has been unlocked.",

Twelve different players have assisted a Premier League goal for Manchester City in 2025/26 – at least two more than any other club – with nine setting up the Norwegian alone. Though some have clearly not noticed.",
      "Bournemouth themselves provided support with a recklessly high line which Manchester City cut through the middle of twice. Both Haaland’s goals came from Marcos Senesi being drawn out of position and leaving actual acres of space for the striker to attack, but Rayan Cherki had to get the pass right both times.",

Ange Postecoglou’s side wasted chance after chance against Chelsea before conceding twice within seven minutes of the second half and collapsing. Forest recovered from a frustrating deficit against Manchester United with two goals in 102 seconds after the restart.",

      "It’s a far cry from the “one-liner” Frank delivered to describe his “principles” a week after being appointed: “If you don’t take risks, you also take risks. So it’s important we take risks. Risk is you need to play forward. If you don’t risk the ball, you can’t create things. We need to be brave.”",
      "Spurs – and one player in particular – cowered against Chelsea. The home form is rotten, there are early signs of dissent in the squad and there is a slightly Nuno-flavoured sense of an exclusively mid-table coach having his shortcomings more ruthlessly exposed at a higher level.",

      "So obviously Villa tried to build from the back and play precisely the sort of game Liverpool needed to rediscover their spark.",
      "Slot also noted how Liverpool “didn’t concede a set-piece” of note, having struggled against those recently. If football is about accentuating your own strengths and targeting the weaknesses of the opponent, Emery took a curious approach which achieved the opposite.",

      "Keith Andrews believes Schade to be ready to become “a more prominent figure within the team”, to take on a greater “level of responsibility” and “lead by example”.",
      "It is an intoxicating thought at a club which has unearthed and polished some phenomenal attacking gems in recent years. The four biggest sales in Brentford’s history were all forwards and the rapid Schade has threatened to follow in their footsteps.",
      "But at 23 with barely 100 top-flight league appearances, yet simultaneously the most experienced player in Brentford’s attack at this sort of level, it is a burden which can weigh heavy. Schade ranks fourth for minutes under Andrews this season, the highest of any forward, and his performances do not always warrant that sort of trust.",
      "If the Bees are not able to break on the counter at will it is difficult to see what Schade brings. The more technical Reiss Nelson option should be explored more thoroughly in the coming weeks.",

      "Tavolieri explained: ‘Mainoo, convinced he could succeed under Antonio Conte, is tempted by a move to Serie A, and the Italian champions might agree to a loan with an option to buy that could become mandatory if certain conditions are met, particularly those related to the number of matches Mainoo plays in the second half of the season.",
      "‘Whatever happens, negotiations will continue between the parties, but Manchester United has already made it clear they would prefer to see the player in a foreign league rather than in the Premier League, where several options have already been ruled out.’",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario has soared to the top of this ranking having conceded just one from a PSxG of 3.2.",
      "",
      "Henderson had a serene afternoon against Brentford, dealing with the two shots allowed on his target to keep a first clean sheet in six. The Palace keeper will doubtless fancy himself as England’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans are raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to nod in agreement. Of the ever-presents, only David Raya has conceded fewer goals.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds…",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "A drop of 0.5 in his overall score after the 2-2 draw at Forest even if there is little the Belgian could have done to prevent either of the hosts’ goals.",
      "",
      "Still only David Raya has kept more clean sheets than Pope who, like the rest of the Newcastle team, did not have a good day at West Ham.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, he’s looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season.",
      "",
      "No keeper has saved a higher percentage of the shots he’s faced than Raya’s 84.2%, perhaps because Arsenal just don’t give up chances of any reasonable quality. The Spaniard has faced only one shot on target in the last four games.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",
      "",
      "One of three keepers to keep out a penalty this season, Pickford just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as England’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth are buzzing with their latest keeper plundered from the Chelsea stockpile, with Petrovic part of a completely revamped defence. Which has not been impenetrable. Only two keeper have faced more shots on target.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool keeper enhanced his standing in this metric during his last Prem appearance at Palace – not that it did Liverpool much good in the first of their four consecutive Premier League defeats – before feeling a twang in the next game at Galatasaray.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Only three keepers have faced more shots on target so facing 10-man Wolves was some welcome respite for Leno.",
      "",
      "One of the biggest climbers this weekend, despite conceding three at Brighton. The first of which he left his goal unattended to close down when he might wish he’d stayed within his posts, and the third came after he gave the ball away in the build.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct. There is a keeper at the club who might do a job.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award has had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list, from a position of strength to somewhere a lot less competent. Conceding direct from a corner against Bournemouth and then from around 30 yards didn’t help his cause. Little Sels could do about either of Manchester United’s goals but Big John is still breathing down his neck.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence.",
      "",
      "Martinez began the season well but his form has tailed off. Mo Salah doesn’t often need a helping hand but Martinez provided the assist for Liverpool’s opener at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United haven’t lost. Coincidence?",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno. Though perhaps not for long.",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he is currently keeping the wrong company down here.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow.",

      "Tables are fun, aren’t they? And we’ve got loads of them, based on all the metrics you could possibly need. Create your own too, between any dates or on a specific date. Enjoy yourself here.",

      "It has been widely reported that the England international wanted to join Barcelona in this year’s January window, though his poor form over 18 months and huge salary presumably put them off.",
      "Instead, Rashford had a spell on loan at Aston Villa and returned to form, grabbing four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances in all competitions.",

      "Despite Amorim’s recent changes, the wing-backs arguably still remain the most important component of Man Utd’s 3-4-3 formation and their current crop are not up to standard.",
      "This is partly not their fault, as the squad inherited by Amorim did not have a natural wing-back, and players have had to adapt to a new role. Amad Diallo has made this position his own, but the same cannot be said for Dalot.",
      "Diallo’s adaptation has been smoother due to his attacking strengths and work rate, but Dalot is very much a full-back playing at wing-back, and unless he’s playing against Trent Alexander-Arnold, that shows.",
      "Dalot has had a greater career at Man Utd than most suspected and his versatility is useful, but they are hamstrung in attack on whichever flank he operates and a specialist wing-back is needed to replace him if they are to become more effective.",
      "",
      "Dorgu is the one natural wing-back signed by Man Utd during Amorim’s reign, though his start to life at Old Trafford has left much to be desired.",
      "It has been a tale of peaks and troughs for the 21-year-old, who is clearly incredibly raw as the holes in his game are adding to his inconsistency.",
      "Dorgu supposedly has three qualities that could eventually turn him into the ‘best’ left-back in the world, but we are not currently seeing what Amorim sees as he’s fallen behind Dalot in the pecking order in recent weeks.",
      "Man Utd’s summer business was positive, but it is puzzling that they decided to overlook strengthening at wing-back and centre-midfield, and those areas cannot be ignored in January or next summer.",
      "",
      "After waxing lyrical about Man Utd’s impressive summer signings, you might be confused at Sesko being mentioned, but hear us out…",
      "Yes, Sesko has had a positive start at Old Trafford. His two goals in 10 Premier League games do not tell the whole story as he has the necessary physical attributes to develop into a brilliant No.9 for Man Utd in the long term.",
      "But Sesko does need to be given time to reach that level, as he, like Rasmus Hojlund, is a project for the Red Devils, and all parties would benefit from an extra injection of quality up front to give their summer signing room to breathe.",
      "Harry Kane is obviously the dream signing for Man Utd in this context and a certain clause makes a 2026 transfer positive, though the club could even look further down the list of proven Premier League strikers and sign Ollie Watkins or Danny Welbeck to add another option to set up Sesko to flourish at Old Trafford in the short, medium and long term.",
      "",
      "Man Utd are not far off in the centre-back department as Leny Yoro is good and will eventually become really good, while Matthijs de Ligt has proved to be a smart signing and a great fit for the central role in the back three.",
      "There are question marks over the left-sided centre-back, however, as Shaw has been one of their weak links this season. Injuries have hindered him as he’s previously shown he can be one of the best full-backs in Europe, but he is currently a far cry from that standard.",
      "At this stage of his career, this role in a back three is suited to Shaw, but he’s been caught out on many occasions in recent months and, much to the anger of Roy Keane, has been “getting away with murder”.",
      "The imminent return of Lisandro Martinez could solve this problem if he’s the same player he was before his cruciate ligament injury, or Man Utd could go down the better route of hijacking Liverpool’s move for Marc Guehi, who has been showing at Crystal Palace that he’s the best left-sided centre-back available and would be another statement, albeit unlikely, signing for INEOS.",

      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, with Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner before Wolves decided to get rid on Sunday.",
      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but an excellent win against Newcastle buys some time there and leaves the fast-spinning finger of doom pointing now upon Daniel Farke at Leeds. It is literally impossible to keep up, but suffice to say there now really are only a very small handful of managers considered entirely safe.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 15 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former now, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a five-point lead over Newcastle with a game in hand, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. It will very much do, and importantly provides a significant buffer for Le Bris and his team as they continue a tough little run of games.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City perhaps remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but that’s still significant progress on where they were a month ago when it felt far more certain. And not in a good way.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. Currently five points outside a largely daft top eight, and that won’t do, no matter what the mitigation.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 19 Premier League games, and just one from five very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raises the stakes. Feels like a really big week for Frank now with key home games in Europe and the Premier League to come before the interlull.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, and he’ll have been enormously grateful Spurs were so thoroughly wretched on Saturday evening.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of the previous season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table after 10 games feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis reached full-blown levels before Saturday’s much-needed win over Aston Villa, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "It was six defeats in the last seven games, and five straight losses in domestic competitions before they stopped the rot against Villa. It was a result that really was sorely needed to prevent the genuine possibility of something truly extraordinary happening to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re only just at one-quarter distance this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s miserable trio managed.",
      "",
      "That was a very, very good time to face Wolves, and Marco Silva took full advantage to end a losing run that was just beginning to tip him and Fulham towards trouble. We remain convinced of this: Fulham and Silva are both better off with each other than without, and both parties would do well to pause before thinking of doing anything rash.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed despite a decent point against resurgent Manchester United.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, he desperately needed a statement performance and result to suggest he might be in possession of possible solutions. The win against Newcastle provided exactly that and surely buys him some time at least.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should now be aiming for a top-four finish in the Premier League after their recent run of form, according to Lee Sharpe.",
      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "Are Man Utd set for a return to the Champions League? A landmark decision by Ruben Amorim for Nottm Forest bodes well.",
      "A report has revealed just how close Roberto De Zerbi came to being named Man Utd boss and how Ruben Amorim wasn’t on the initial six-man shortlist.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has informed one Manchester United star how he can become the “best in the world” in his position.",
      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?"

      "Right wing-back Amad Diallo scored a stunning equaliser for Man Utd against Nottingham Forest, but former Premier League centre-back Ashley Williams has explained why he thinks he is a “problem” for Amorim because he’s too good in the attack not to play, but he doesn’t look good when defending.",

      "“This is not a player you want defending. He’s in the team because of his attacking play and he’s such an honest lad that he ends up doing lots of defensive work and then it looks bad on him.",

      "Ruben Amorim has challenged a Manchester United to be “so much better” despite the fact he saved the Red Devils in their last Premier League match.",
      "United lost their three-game winning streak when they drew 2-2 in the league with Nottingham Forest. The Red Devils were 1-0 up at the end of the first half through a Casemiro goal.",
      "But Forest hit twice in the space of two minutes at the start of the second half two go ahead, and though United pulled it back through Amad Diallo with nine minutes of regular time left, securing the draw, they were unable to add a fourth win to their streak.",
      "There are suggestions that Amad’s goal was the best that will be scored all season – he struck the ball on the volley from the edge of the box and it sailed into the right side of the Forest net.",
      "It was Amad’s first goal of the season to go with two assists, in a deeper role – wing back – than he was used to playing prior to Amorim’s arrival at United.",
      "The Ivorian has been challenged to be better than he’s currently being, though, with the manager feeling there is more to come from him.",
      "He said: “Amad has a lot of talent. We have a lot of players who are young and talented. He can be so much better and be more consistent. You could see in first half he had some opportunities. He has potential to do better.”",
      "On the game on the whole, Amorim said: “If I think about game, we lost control for five minutes. I feel in the recent past if we had had this situation [from 1-0 up and 2-1 down] we would have struggled so much more than today.",
      "“My feeling is we played well but we dropped a little bit of energy. When we have the full energy we are the better team. My players are giving everything but we have the potential to do better.",

      "Perhaps the best single month in post-Ferguson Manchester United history was enough to coax Jason Wilcox out from the shadows to reluctantly explain how the “clear plan” at Old Trafford was bearing fruit.",
      "The Director of Football shouldered a fraction of the public-facing responsibility Ruben Amorim carries every week, confirming a complete narrative volte-face for a club which had started the season with two wins from seven.",
      "It took just three consecutive victories for the complexion to transform, for the hierarchy to toot their own horn, for Manchester United to go from perennial crisis to Champions League-adjacent. When the bar is lowered towards the core of the actual earth by accepting finishing 15th, any and all positives are magnified.",
      "But as Wilcox said, one of the keys is to “not get too carried away when we win and not get too disappointed when we lose”. It remains to be seen quite what Manchester United do with a draw at Nottingham Forest in a game they should have won and could have lost.",
      "It instinctively feels far more like a point gained than two dropped. The Manchester United of last season would probably lose that game. There is clear development in the mentality and character required to go from a position of relative comfort to a sudden and total collapse.",
      "Casemiro scored from another Dyche-infuriating corner that never was and the visitors seemed in control. Forest had threatened but Luke Shaw in particular was excellent.",
      "Then half time happened. Forest scored twice within the restart as Manchester United crumbled under a couple of high crosses. Morgan Gibbs-White headed in the equaliser to finish a sublime move, before Nicolo Savona nipped in to capitalise on some haphazard defending.",
      "In those moments it is difficult to blame the manager; these were specifically individual player errors. Amad was weak in challenging Gibbs-White, and Diogo Dalot compounded playing Savona onside with reacting far too late to the danger. Amorim has deserved the blame for most of his 19 defeats in a year, but would have ranked far down the list of culprits for his 20th.",
      "That such finger-pointing was ultimately never needed is testament to the power of momentum. It swung so abruptly and violently in Forest’s favour at the start of the second half, but was also something Manchester United could harness once the shock wore off. While the winning streak is over, the confidence and conviction which came from it was evident in the final half an hour.",
      "Amad levelled with a stunning volley and almost secured a stirring win with another effort Murillo blocked on the line in stoppage time. But a chaotic draw in a game with 35 shots almost perfectly equally split between two flawed yet improving teams was a fair result on the balance of play.",
      "Manchester United are a work in progress – left wing-back is becoming a problem position and the expensive assortment of forwards signed this summer need to establish more consistency – but that progress is finally clear to see. A result and performance which won’t lead anyone to “get too carried away” nor “too disappointed” is no bad thing.",
      "READ NEXT: The five ‘right’ signings Manchester United should make after statement of intent",
      "Of course Arsenal are top. Of course Wolves are bottom. Of course Liverpool can’t defend. Of course Sunderland are fourth. All of this was obvious.",
      "Arsenal are title favourites because they are top of the actual table, but also because of a huge improvement in one Liverpool are struggling in.",
      "Here are 20 manager ‘shock returns’ including Erik ten Hag to Man Utd and Jurgen Klopp to Liverpool after Gary O’Neil was targeted by Wolves…",
      "Actual football fans in stadiums love a long throw, a set-piece and a punt downfield. Do not listen to the snobs.",
      "Moises Caicedo v Declan Rice should be interesting later this month, Liverpool are back on track, and why Daniel Farke should never manage Newcastle.",
      "Eddie Howe ‘almost could have taken anyone off’ against West Ham but as he alluded, it wouldn’t have made much difference. Newcastle are a disaster away."

      "As Real Madrid defender Alvaro Carreras prepares to mark Mohamed Salah against Liverpool on Tuesday evening, Adam Bate speaks to the player's former coach at Preston North End to discuss a remarkable rise for the ex-Manchester United reserve...",
      "Tuesday 4 November 2025 06:20, UK",
      "Alvaro Carreras has been a revelation at Real Madrid. After pocketing Lamine Yamal in El Clasico, the left-back blasted home his first Madrid goal against Valencia on Saturday evening. Why on earth did Manchester United allow him to leave Old Trafford?",
      "As he makes his return to the North West of England for Real Madrid's Champions League game against Liverpool on Tuesday night, it is Carreras rather than Trent Alexander-Arnold who looks the pick of the club's new signings under Xabi Alonso.",
      "Having blossomed at Benfica, the 22-year-old already appears a bargain buy - even at the £43m fee that Madrid paid for him. It all seems a little strange when United were muddling through with Sergio Reguilon and Sofyan Amrabat at left-back not long ago.",
      "Gallagher was first-team coach at Preston throughout the 2022/23 Championship season for which Carreras was named as the club's young player of the year, having been United's reserve-team player of the year in the preceding season. He developed at Deepdale.",
      "\"Straight away, you could see real quality in his game,\" recalls Gallagher. \"We played him as a left wing back, but you could see he was very comfortable on the ball. He got people off their seats from left wing-back with his dribbling skills and his passing skills.\"",
      "He adds: \"Technically, he is very good. But he has got an unbelievable mentality as well in that he wants to learn. First and foremost, he is a really good kid with a nice personality, very respectful. That stood out because he had to learn quickly at Preston.",
      "\"In the Championship, it is tough. You have to be robust, you have to win your duels. That is something that he showed because when the going got tough, to be fair to him, as well as all the quality, he would roll his sleeves up and have a real good go too.\"",
      "Preston boss Ryan Lowe had to manage his minutes, benching him for both games against Millwall, for example, letting him acclimatise. \"Sometimes you need to do that with young players, take them in and out. It was his first loan too,\" explains Gallagher.",
      "\"That might have been the moment that the penny dropped for him but he was never afraid to get stuck in. He got a few kicks that season but he just got on with it and the Preston fans loved him for it. He was going into tackles and coming out with the ball.\"",
      "Carreras is now taking that approach into the Champions League. Against Juventus recently, he won all 11 of his duels in a 1-0 win at the Bernabeu, becoming the first defender to win that many duels without losing one in the competition in over a decade.",
      "Gallagher wanted to take Carreras on loan to Stoke the following season but the player had lined up a move to LaLiga with Granada before being permitted to depart United permanently for Benfica in January of last year. Madrid came calling in the summer.",
      "It was the chance for Carreras to return to the Spanish giants, having been part of the academy in Madrid prior to signing a four-year deal with United at the age of 17. Gallagher was among the first to text his former player congratulating him on the move.",
      "\"One thing with Alvaro and his personality, he will really believe in his ability. He will probably have thought he was good enough to play for Manchester United long ago and he was brave enough to go and prove it. Now he has his dream move to Real Madrid.",
      "\"It is not a surprise to me that he is doing so well now. What I always say about the best young players is that you only have to tell them once and that was true of Alvaro. When it sticks with a young player first time then you just know that they are going to the top.",
      "\"His attitude was fantastic. He wanted to learn, do the extras after training and to develop. He wants to be play at the highest level and he will soon be playing for the Spain national team, going to World Cups and stuff like that, because he is that good.\"",
      "Indeed, he has already shown himself to be an asset for Madrid in both defence and attack this season. His eye-catching display when given the daunting task of marking Yamal against Barcelona quashed any lingering doubts about his defensive acumen.",
      "\"Alvaro would have relished that too,\" says Gallagher. \"He would have gone into that game thinking about coming out the other end of it believing that he is the best full-back in the world.\" Next time out against Valencia, he won a penalty and smashed in a stunning goal.",
      "\"He has good quality to create in the final third. He is a modern-day full-back but he has also got that thing where he will work so hard to get back and help the team. Preston fans loved that about him but all coaches and fans take to someone like that.",
      "\"He plays with that personality, energy and belief in himself. It is not overconfidence but just belief in his own ability. It is why he is at one of the best clubs in the world.\" A triumph for the exceptional Alvaro Carreras, somehow overlooked at Manchester United.",

      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"The ball's definitely not gone out, and the fact that the linesman has made a judgment call from about, what, 70 yards. The referee was closer. I know he's a bit of a different angle, but the referee was definitely closer.",
      "\"It's just too far to say. But again, this is twice in two weeks now and I'm thinking to myself, well, there's goal line technology.",
      "\"Maybe that can be used across the whole byline, but then obviously, they can't change the rules this year, but it's definitely something they need to look at for next year, because it will cost teams ultimately.",
      "\"I think you can look at that in 10 seconds, and it will be cleared up and there will be no debate. They have enough time to look at that and make a decision.\"",

      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It strikes his arm on the way through, but the rule is, has he scored? No, so he is not penalised for that.",
      "\"Is it deliberate? No, it brushes his arm on the way through, so it is not a deliberate play, so the game goes on, it gets cleared and he shoots.\"",

      "DERMOT SAYS: \"The fact they were pushing and shoving each other and all right, he's raised his arm, probably a bit higher than he wanted, but he's pushing.",
      "\"Stuart's got to decide, is it violent? Is it an act of brutality? He said: 'No,' he's obviously relayed to the VAR what he's seen, VAR has checked it back. The referee said, yellow card only.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"As much as I like a physical game, I look at this situation, I'm like, if someone puts their hand on my throat in the street like that, you're gonna get an aggressive reaction from me.",
      "\"So in that instance, I'm saying that should be a red card, because obviously Mac Allister can't do that, right? Mac Allister has made the most of it. He's gone down, right? And that's probably because if he reacts, he'll get a red card too.",
      "\"So I think he's gone down there, and obviously, it's something that the official should have picked up.",
      "\"But I look at that and I say that is aggressive, because again, I reiterate, if that happens off the football pitch and someone does that to you, you're going to react in a certain way, which probably be aggressive, or you're going to call HR!\"",
      "INCIDENT: Gianluigi Donnarumma complained he was held by David Brooks as Bournemouth netted an equaliser from a corner at Man City.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I thought it was a goal. I've seen refs take a much different approach. It's not a good punch. I don't think the forward does much wrong.\"",

      "\"He's six foot seven, and his span upwards would probably be about nine feet. I don't understand why he's complaining there.",
      "\"He's complaining because he's punched that, but it's a bad punch and a goal has come of it. It's definitely not a foul. And I think keepers, again, I feel like they get too much protection, and in that scenario, for the referee, fantastic decision.",
      "\"He should be commanding that area more. The only person I've seen say it was a foul is Guardiola. What are we saying now? It's a non-contact sport.",

      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"If he does get a red card there, I say, I understand why he got it, but then after that, I can understand as well why it's a yellow card. It's an aggressive challenge. It's one of those orange card challenges.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez is only shown a yellow card despite a studs-up high challenge on Spurs midfielder Joao Palhinha.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I definitely do not think this is a red card, his feet are up and it is a glancing blow, he has not gone through him, it is almost sideways. If he was in front and had gone through like that, he is in big trouble, but because of the angle he comes in at, he does not get the force or contact and so does not make the impact.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"I really like this decision from the ref. Enzo has tried to make an honest challenge there and just toe the ball away and as he has toe the ball away, his foot is obviously up, but his foot has hit the side of Palhinha's knee, so in that instance, it is not a reckless tackle, or a high challenge. From certain angles and a high speed, it looks a red.\"",
      "INCIDENT: West Ham have a penalty overturned by the VAR after it was deemed Malick Thiaw had got a touch on the ball first in his challenge with Jarrod Bowen.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Yes [right decision made], but I will also say when I first saw it I thought penalty, so I can understand why the referee [Robert Jones] first gave a penalty. When I saw the first replay, I knew it would be overturned.\"",
      "JAY BOTHROYD: \"He has not touched the ball enough, the ball has not even changed speed, it is so minute that it should be given as a penalty, it is a crazy decision.",
      "\"You cannot say every time that you touch the ball it is not a penalty. He blocked Bowen from getting to the ball, so it is a penalty!\"",
      "The decision took over three minutes - was that too long?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It was quite protracted and that is why I do not want to see more intrusion [by the VAR], it can be slicker.\"",

      "However, the Sweden striker has quietly been going about his business and at Burnley, he produced his best 45 minutes in an Arsenal shirt so far - before he was forced off at the break with a muscular injury.",

      "It was an all-action display that showed his strength, his power, his pace, and his instinct to be in the right place at the right time to score, which is what ultimately Arsenal bought him to the club to do.",
      "\"Everything,\" Mikel Arteta said when asked what impressed him about Gyokeres's display. \"His high press, his position and his touches. His threat in behind, the way he linked play, the way he gets us from these situations to transition moments. I think he was in a really good moment. It's a shame that he felt something.\"",

Chelsea, who before this game had conceded the most expected goals from set pieces this season, stood up and were counted against the Spurs set piece machine that had blown away Everton last weekend.",
      "Enzo Maresca's side didn't concede a single shot from set piece situations as Robert Sanchez commanded his area like he was the king of the skies. Yes, Spurs' delivery was unusually poor but the goalkeeper time-after-time took the pressure off his defenders by coming to catch and purposefully punch clear high balls.",
      "In a season where being able to defend your box under pressure from dead balls counts for a lot, Chelsea took a huge step in the right direction with this resolute defensive showing.Lewis Jones",
      "Jefferson Lerma had only made one Premier League start since the start of the season before the visit of Brentford to Selhurst Park - but he took his chance with both hands after Adam Wharton was ruled out through illness.",
      "The Colombian played a pivotal role in Crystal Palace's opener, latching onto a floated free-kick from Yeremy Pino and guiding a header into the path of Jean-Philippe Mateta, who did the rest. For their second, it was his long throw that Nathan Collins headed into the back of his own net.",
      "The nature of the second was ironic, given just how much of a threat the Bees have been from long throws this term. But Lerma was adept in that area before it was on trend.",
      "He won five of his seven duels on the day, too, and overall proved to Oliver Glasner that, while he is playing a bit-part role at the moment, he is ready and waiting to step up from the off whenever he's required.Dan Long",
      "Manchester United's winning run in the Premier League was brought to a halt at three at the City Ground as Nottingham Forest's quick start to the second half proved to be enough for the spoils to be shared. And in truth, Ruben Amorim's side only had themselves to blame.",
      "The Red Devils had gone into half-time with an albeit controversial lead, but were good value for their advantage. But what happened when the teams returned to the pitch was nothing short of a disaster.",
      "By minute 50, Morgan Gibbs-White and Nicolo Savona turned the game on its head. And the United players just didn't look like they were with it in the slightest.",
      "It forced them to be in a position they haven't been in over the course of the last three matches - chasing a goal. And more often than not, Amorim's men have struggled in this very circumstance as when teams set up against them in a low block, they just can't break them down.",
      "Thanks to Forest's set-piece woes and a wonderful strike from Amad Diallo, they took something back up north with them. But it could've been more if they hadn't stayed asleep at the start of the second 45.",
      "Post-match, Amorim bemoaned his team's lack of energy away from home, saying that they \"need to work on bringing the same away from home,\" as they do at Old Trafford. They may be showing signs of improvement, but this is one bad habit that they are clearly yet to shake.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White said he and his Nottingham Forest team-mates were frustrated not to take three points against Man Utd. It's been a long wait for a second Premier League win of the season, with their first coming way back on the opening weekend on August 17.",
      "They were good value for the win, too, looking comfortable until Amad Diallo's wonderstrike. Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi went close to extending their advantage before that late equaliser and the Expected Goals data shows in their favour as well - 2 vs 1.15.",
      "But until Forest solve their set-piece problems, they are going to find winning matches hard. For all the controversy about the award of United's corner for Casemiro's opener, the defending from it was poor. Forest were static, the Brazilian given too much space to rise and head in.",
      "Amad's strike also came from a corner, when the ball was only half-cleared. That makes it 16 Premier League goals from set-piece situations conceded by Forest in 2025. That's the most of any other side in the competition.",
      "It's an obvious weakness. At least boss Sean Dyche can be encouraged that, if he solves that issue, he is developing promising signs elsewhere in Forest's play.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton's dominant win over Leeds saw them pick up their first clean sheet of the season - but Fabian Hurzeler's side provided a masterclass in defending from the front.",
      "The Seagulls' press was frenetic from the first whistle to the last, and didn't give the Leeds defence a moment of peace with the ball.",
      "The first shot on target for the visitors didn't come until the 85th minute - according to manager Fabian Hurzeler, that was just as much the result of the attack as the resolute defence.",
      "\"The clean sheet was well deserved. Everyone worked hard for it - not just the midfielders, but the defenders and the strikers.\"",
      "Consistency is the key from here on out for Hurzeler - but if the high press is this effective every week, the sky is the limit for his team.Noah Langford",
      "Leeds' struggles away from Elland Road continued with a limp performance on their way to a comprehensive defeat at Brighton, and this was perhaps the worst of the bunch.",
      "Their ineffective attack has been a key theme away from home this season - their only goals on the road came in their win against 20th placed Wolves.",
      "Leeds had only converted a staggering six per cent of their shots in October compared to 23 per cent for their opponents. November didn't start much better, as they only managed their first shot on target in the 85th minute against Brighton.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin looked lost at sea once again at the head of the Leeds attack - his only half-decent chance came from a 25-yard effort that was always veering wide. Brendon Aaronson and Noah Okafor, his partners in attack, looked nowhere near as dangerous as they did against at home against West Ham.",
      "A ferocious West Yorkshire atmosphere has been able to spur Leeds to home victories this season - but a boost in attacking quality is needed if they want to pick up points on the road.Noah Langford",
      "Despite having just watched his win-less side lose 3-0 loss at Fulham to remain rooted to the foot of the Premier League, beleaguered Wolves boss Vitor Pereira was still in a defiant post-match mood down by the River Thames, insisting they were capable of avoiding relegation.",
      "The Portuguese pointed to last season, when he replaced Gary O'Neil at Molineux with Wolves having also not won any of their opening 10 league games of the campaign, as is the case this season, only for them to then embark on a six-match winning run that saw them finish in 16th.",
      "However, things feel different this time, not only because no team in Premier League history has ever stayed up with just two points from their opening 10 matches [Wolves had picked up three under O'Neil at the same stage last season], but also more pertinently because of the quality of the three promoted sides this campaign.",
      "Pereira said he has tried everything to get back to winnings ways - a new shape and different players at Craven Cottage - but admitted after what he called his side's worst display since he took over last December, he still \"does not have the answer.\"",
      "For his and Wolves' sake, let's hope he finds it soon…Rich Morgan",
      "Hits and misses is a fun concept but Liverpool's win over Aston Villa highlighted the fine margins. Arne Slot's side ended their four-game winless streak as their pressing was rewarded for the opening goal, Villa making what Unai Emery called \"a huge mistake.\"",
      "The natural conclusion to draw was that Villa were foolish to attempt to pass out from the back, especially against a Liverpool side that have struggled against the long ball. But Villa came close to opening the scoring as a result of passing out from the back.",
      "Morgan Rogers struck the post with that chance, the move having been started by Emi Martinez in the Villa goal - the culprit for the error that led to Mohamed Salah's breakthrough strike. Matty Cash also struck the frame of the goal in the first half.",
      "\"The first 30 minutes we were fantastic continuing the way we did against Tottenham and Man City showing our capacity to dominate some times and create chances,\" explained Emery, adding: \"Of course, we need goals, but we hit two posts today.\"",
      "Slot acknowledged his team's fortune on the night. \"Maybe we were a bit more on the lucky side than we have been in the last few weeks. a mistake of their goalkeeper and a deflection led to two of our goals but these are the margins we are talking about.\"",
      "He added: \"In other games, we have created more in open play than we did today but football is about results not the chances you create from open play.\" Slot and Liverpool have found that out the hard way lately. This was Villa's turn to be on the receiving end.Adam Bate",

      "Amad Diallo produced a stunning volley to grab a point for Man Utd at Nottingham Forest as their winning run was halted by a rollercoaster 2-2 draw.",
      "With nine minutes to play and Forest looking comfortable, Amad cracked in a super left-foot strike when Nikola Milenkovic's header fell to him on the edge of the box. He then thought he'd hit a 94th-minute winner only to be denied by a goalline block by Murillo, capping a game packed with drama.",
      "United had led at half-time through a controversial Casemiro opener which sparked fury around the City Ground. The officials had awarded a corner when replays did not conclusively show all of the ball had crossed the line and the Brazilian subsequently headed in.",
      "\"It's not out,\" said former Premier League referee Mike Dean on Soccer Saturday. \"The ball is nowhere near out. It's just a guess by the referee.\"",
      "Forest had conceded from a corner which should have been given as a goal-kick at Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "Afterwards, Forest boss Sean Dyche called for a review of the rules, with VAR currently unable to intervene in those situations. \"We talk about the margins in football, we talk about VAR,\" he said. \"Why's it not brought in?",
      "\"Last week, really poor decision, cross goes in. This week, really poor decision, cross, goes in. Well get VAR on it then because it takes eight seconds to go 'it's in' or 'it's out'.\"",
      "Forest were fuelled by the injustice on Saturday, with Morgan Gibbs-White brilliantly heading in an equaliser three minutes into the second half before Nicolo Savona - who had been the player judged unable to keep the ball in for the controversial corner - pounced to prod in Forest's second.",
      "Nottingham Forest: Sels (6), Savona (7), Milenkovic (6), Murillo (8), Williams (7), Luiz (6), Anderson (8), Ndoye (6), Gibbs-White (8), Hudson-Odoi (7), Igor Jesus (6).\n\n\nSubs:  Yates (7), Awoniyi (6), Sangare (N/A)\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), Yoro (6), De Ligt (6), Shaw (7), Amad (8), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (7), Dalot (6), Mbeumo (7), Cunha (7), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Mazraoui (6)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Morgan Gibbs-White (Nottingham Forest)",
      "Bruno Fernandes drilled a low shot against an upright as United sought to swing the contest again but Forest weren't far off a third, with Igor Jesus heading wide from close range and Callum Hudson-Odoi blasting narrowly off target.",
      "Amad's firecracker left Forest ruing those misses and in the end they were indebted to Murillo's quick reactions.",
      "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche:",
      "\"It's not conclusive. I've seen it back. Apparently today, the assistant referee can see 78 yards away. It's got to change. That's two in a week. Two decisions that are not right have gone against us in a week. Yes, of course, we then have to deal with the situation which we didn't do as well. But it is tough when there's a lot of noise about corners at this club and then they give corners that aren't corners.",
      "\"We had one last week, one this week. It's very tough on the team to take decisions like that. We talk about the margins in football, we talk about VAR, why it is not brought in? Last week, really poor decision, cross goes in. This week, really poor decision, cross, goes in. Well get VAR on it then because it takes eight seconds to go 'it's in' or 'it's out'.\"",

      "\"I think we dropped the energy level. You can feel it when our team is not at the top of their energy and aggression. You can feel it. We managed to score again, we tried to win the game, we had a big opportunity in the end. We missed that little bit of luck. We need to work to bring the same away from home as we do in our stadium.",
      "\"We are getting better. Everyone can see. We are getting that feeling that if we can't win, at least we aren't going to lose. The way we press, the urgency with certain things, I think we did better last Sunday. We need to be like that in every game.\"",
      "On Amad's equaliser: \"It's something good for the fans. It was a really important goal for us. But I'm more focused on the 90 minutes. And what we did good. That's what I'll tell the players. Sometimes I forget that part and I judge the players when I see the games. But, we are doing things right. We are controlling the game. Of course we can do so much to grow. But there are a lot of things we are doing right.",

      "Newcastle's £69m striker Nick Woltemade is contributing more than goals as Alexander Isak starts slowly at Liverpool; The Radar column also looks at the man-management techniques being used by Fabian Hurzeler on Charalampos Kostoulas and Brighton's other young players",
      "Sunday 2 November 2025 12:24, UK",
      "",
      "💪 Woltemade's strong start for Newcastle🔹 Kostoulas being challenged by Hurzeler🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Nick Woltemade scored his third header of the season in Newcastle's Carabao Cup win over Spurs on Wednesday. The 6ft 6in striker is proving difficult to handle. And not just aerially.",
      "His tally of six goals in only 760 minutes includes two ingenious flicked finishes, one against Union Saint-Gilloise and an even better one against Brighton. There was a penalty lifted into the top corner against Nottingham Forest as if struck with a pitching wedge.",
      "It is a fitting level of variety for a player who is difficult to define. Woltemade has the physical profile to play the role of a targetman. His presence has allowed Newcastle to send more passes long in line with the Premier League's shift towards directness.",
      "He has scored headed goals against Wolves and Arsenal as well Spurs. Not many strikers can claim to have bested Gabriel Magalhaes this season but Woltemade towered over him when scoring Newcastle's opener against the Gunners in September.",
      "As is becoming increasingly clear to his new audience, though, he is also an excellent technician capable of a light touch as well as brute force. He is comfortable holding onto the ball in tight spaces. He drops deep and pulls wide to link the play. He can even dribble.",
      "His team-mates certainly value his all-round contribution. \"He is so big, it is a little bit easy for him to score goals with his head but he is a very good player,\" said Sandro Tonali after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He runs all 90 minutes every time. He plays with us, the midfielders and the defenders. He is the first defender and the first striker.\" Eddie Howe added that he \"set the tone\" for Newcastle's pressing.",
      "He is already loved by Newcastle supporters. His arrival, for £69m from Stuttgart in the summer, having previously been a target for Bayern Munich, has helped to ensure that, so far, at least, the departed Alexander Isak has not been missed.",
      "It has escaped nobody's attention that Woltemade has comprehensively outperformed his predecessor, who is yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool, his only goal since his record £125m transfer coming in the Carabao Cup against Southampton.",
      "Yoane Wissa's injury absence has added to the pressure on Woltemade to perform and he continues to deliver. He has more Premier League goals, with four, than any of the 18 other strikers signed by Premier League clubs during a summer transfer window which featured unprecedented spending on forwards.",
      "It is all the more impressive given he has played fewer minutes than many of the other players in the list, including all of Chelsea's Joao Pedro, Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres, Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike and Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "He is of course a different type of player to the man he has replaced. He is not generating as many shots or creating as many chances as Isak last term but he offers an aerial outlet, wins more duels, makes more pressures and regains possession more frequently.",
      "His heat map hints at a broader remit.",
      "While Isak was focused on stretching opposition defences with runs in behind, Woltemade is more likely to be seen further away from goal, helping to construct attacks as well as finish them.",
      "Woltemade is still acclimatising to certain aspects of the Premier League. Issa Diop and Calvin Bassey subjected him to rough treatment which often went unpunished against Fulham last weekend, much to the striker's frustration.",
      "But overall the speed of his adaptation has been hugely impressive. His challenge now is just to continue in the same vein.",
      "So, is his current scoring rate sustainable? Woltemade has scored four goals from four shots on target in the Premier League. Factor in his goals in the Champions League and Carabao Cup and, amazingly, it is six from six shots on target overall.",
      "He has reached that tally from chances worth only 3.46 expected goals, an overperformance which suggests a reversion to the mean may lie ahead. And yet, his actual goal total could easily be higher.",
      "Woltemade hit the post from close range in last weekend's 2-1 win over Fulham and struck the underside of the crossbar in the game against Nottingham Forest, during which he also had a goalbound effort blocked by defender Morato inside the six-yard box.",
      "Newcastle may ultimately need to service him with more scoring opportunities. They will need their wingers to contribute more goals too, with Jacob Murphy, Harvey Barnes, Anthony Gordon and Anthony Elanga having only found the net once in the Premier League between them so far this season.",
      "But in Woltemade right now, they have a player giving them exactly what they need, filling an Isak-shaped void, contributing a lot more than just goals, and, two months into the season, winning the battle of the Premier League's new No 9s.",
      "From Newcastle to Brighton, where it has been a slower start for Charalampos Kostoulas, another of the Premier League's newly-signed strikers having joined from Olympiakos for £31.4m in June.",
      "The 18-year-old came with a reputation as one of Europe's most exciting young frontmen and finally earned a first start in Brighton's Carabao Cup tie against Arsenal on Wednesday having scored his first goal from the bench against Manchester United.",
      "Unfortunately for him, it did not last long.",
      "Kostoulas looked menacing from the left flank in the first half at the Emirates Stadium but he was withdrawn at the interval with Fabian Hurzeler citing \"physical reasons\" afterwards.",
      "\"He needs to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League, he needs to adapt to the demands,\" said the Brighton boss.",
      "The 32-year-old talked up the importance of \"honest feedback\" having been firm with Baleba over his performances following a summer of transfer speculation. Hurzeler has taken him off at half-time on three separate occasions this season. \"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside,\" he said.",
      "Clearly, Hurzeler is pushing Kostoulas in the same way. And even if it feels uncomfortable, the striker should keep in mind that his team-mate appears to have benefitted. Baleba was Brighton's best performer against Arsenal, dominating the midfield in the first half and demonstrating the potential Hurzeler is trying to extract.",
      "No Dean Huijsen, no problem for Bournemouth. They have another young gem at centre-back in Veljko Milosavljevic.",
      "The 18-year-old Serb is pushing to face Erling Haaland and Manchester City on Super Sunday having helped Bournemouth keep a clean sheet against Nottingham Forest last time out.",
      "Sunderland host Everton on Monday Night Football. Tune in from 6.30pm ahead of the 8pm kick-off.",
      "Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and Tottenham's issues playing through midfield featured in last week's column. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes' stunning record for Man Utd ahead of his 300th appearance."
