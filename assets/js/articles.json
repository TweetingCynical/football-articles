      "Manchester United could lose more than £150million worth of signings for nothing when their contracts expire next summer. There is still time to recoup some of that money, though, and the January transfer window could be key.",
      "The bulk of that £150m-plus sum comes from £80m centre-back Harry Maguire and £60m midfielder Casemiro. Tyrell Malacia cost approximately £13m, while the fourth member of the quartet - goalkeeper Tom Heaton - cost nothing.",
      "With Heaton tipped to retire and Malacia yet to play this season after United were unable to offload him last summer, the focus is on the other two. Maguire and Casemiro both seemed destined for the scrapheap a year ago but have both enjoyed varying degrees of resurgence since Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag as manager.",
      "Maguire has scored some important goals under Amorim after opting to stay and fight for his place, including memorable winners against Lyon and Liverpool. After sealing victory at Anfield, though, he indicated he wasn't sure whether he will still be a United player next season.",
      "\"I'm in my last year now, so this could be the last time I played at Anfield for this club, so it's really important that I've come here and ticked that one off,\" he said. United triggered an extension in Maguire's contract last term, but reports in October suggested he could be offered a new deal on reduced terms.",
      "Casemiro is another who could be forced into a pay cut. United brought the Brazilian in from Real Madrid in a 2022 deal which could yet see them pay out an extra £10m in add-ons, with mixed results.",
      "He impressed in his debut campaign in England, helping United win the Carabao Cup and qualify for the Champions League, but struggled in the next two seasons to the point that a summer exit was mooted. The 33-year-old has bounced back to become a starter under Amorim this season but is one of the highest earners in the Premier League and is unlikely to command the same high wages even if he stays at Old Trafford.",
      "Other players could also leave in January, with Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo attracting interest. However, Maguire, Casemiro, Malacia and Heaton are the four who are in danger of leaving for nothing.",
      "There has been Saudi Pro League interest in Casemiro, while Maguire was courted by Premier League clubs including West Ham when an exit looked to be on the cards. Whether either would entertain a January exit is another matter, with both keen to represent their respective national teams at the World Cup and potentially deciding staying put provides the best chance of that happening.",
      "England boss Thomas Tuchel has yet to call upon Maguire but insisted the 32-year-old remains in consideration when discussing options earlier this year. \"He is always in our thoughts, he is always a threat from set-pieces, he has a big personality and he steps up in difficult times, as you can see at his club. He is always in our thoughts,\" Tuchel said in May.",
      "Casemiro returned to Brazil's squad in June after more than 18 months without a cap, and has established himself under new manager Carlo Ancelotti. He captained the Selecao during friendlies against South Korea and Japan in October, and has more than a fighting chance of making the squad for the World Cup.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Harry Maguire has provided a fitness update after giving Manchester United an injury scare over the weekend. Maguire was taken off due to a suspected hamstring issue during United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Saturday.",
      "The stalemate in North London saw United add Benjamin Sesko and Casemiro to their injury list ahead of the international break. Maguire was left out of the England squad by manager Thomas Tuchel for the November round of World Cup qualifiers against Serbia and Albania.",
      "Instead, Maguire has been at Carrington working on his fitness ahead of the return of Premier League football next week.",
      "Amid worries about Maguire's fitness and fears that the defender may have sustained an injury, an update has surfaced with the United star posting on social media.",
      "The second post saw Maguire pose alongside United coach Mike Clegg, which also featured a caption. \"Bike done,\" wrote Maguire on the post, accompanied with a green tick emoji and a bicep emoji.",
      "Despite the positive news about his condition, United still face a nervous wait to find out if Maguire will be fully fit and ready to play when Premier League action resumes on November 24, where the Red Devils will take on Everton in the Monday Night Football.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim was quizzed about Maguire's potential injury setback following the stalemate with Spurs.",
      "Amorim explained: \"With everything that happened, Harry [Maguire] has to come out, Casemiro has to come out and Ben [Sesko].\"",
      "The return of Premier League football after the international break will see United have their busiest spell of the season so far, with eight fixtures in the top flight before the end of December.",

      "They are also willing to offer a loan switch with an option to make it permanent depending on appearances and also whether they make European football next season.",
      "Zirkzee has found himself out in the cold at Old Trafford this season and has yet to start a Premier League game.",
      "There may be an opportunity if Benjamin Sesko is out but his injury is not thought to be serious, although United boss Ruben Amorim has been reluctant to allow players to go if it leaves him short.",
      "Zirkzee is anxious about getting enough game time and minutes to ensure that he is contention for the Holland World Cup squad. He has won six caps but is now facing being left out in the cold for Holland because of his situation at Manchester United.",
      "Everton and West Ham are both trying to improve their forward options and may also be open to January moves. But Zirkzee may prefer Italy and a guarantee of game time and a better chance of putting himself in the frame for next year’s World Cup.",
      "Everton have also been linked heavily with Ivan Toney who may be able to move in January from his time in Saudi Arabia.",
      "PSV are also keen on a January loan deal and are considering a firm offer while Juventus have also been linked with Zirkzee if United sanction a loan move.",

      "Ruben Amorim will rely on Manchester United's academy stars to help provide cover come the turn of the year. The Red Devils will be forced to utilise the full extent of their depth as the Africa Cup of Nations gets underway in December, and United will look at who they have at their disposal rather than turning to the January transfer market.",
      "Amorim will rely on the club's prospects to fill out his squad and cover any absences from players heading to Morocco, as well as any long-term injury to Benjamin Sesko. United will avoid any rash January signings, and their priority remains signing a midfielder in the summer, per reports.",
      "Sesko’s injury leaves Amorim with an out-and-out striker, with Joshua Zirkzee his only alternative forward. Zirkzee has played just 82 Premier League minutes this term and is being linked with a move away from the club.",
      "United will see Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui likely depart for AFCON, with the competition running from December 21 and until January 18. Mbeumo is the club's top scorer after arriving at Old Trafford from Brentford in the summer.",
      "Without any transfer activity, those exits will likely see room open up on the bench. Against Tottenham, Amorim was already forced to call upon Jack Fletcher, son of United legend Darren, to continue the club's record of naming an academy product in every squad for 87 years.",
      "Speaking after his team's draw with Tottenham, Amorim did not rule out activity in the winter transfer window. The Portuguese coach admitted that AFCON poses a problem, but without European fixtures, Amorim conceded that adding new players would also create future issues.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON],\" he said. \"But we already knew.",
      "\"Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "If United struggle for forward options, it could see Chido Obi return to the fold. The young striker played eight times under Amorim last term.",
      "This term, the striker has four goals in 11 appearances for the under-21s. Fellow striker Gabriele Biancheri also matches that tally, while Shea Lacey has three goals in nine appearances from the wing.",

      "The Football Association of Slovenia has moved to bring an end to the club-versus-country row involving Benjamin Sesko. The forward picked up a knee injury during Manchester United’s 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur last Saturday.",
      "He had been due to link up with the Slovenia national team for their World Cup qualifiers against Kosovo and Sweden, but did not report for international duty at the Slovenian FA’s headquarters in Brdo pri Kranju on Monday and has instead stayed at Carrington for further treatment on an injury that is not thought to be serious.",
      "But Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek was left furious by the call for Sesko to remain in Manchester and claimed he had been kept in the dark by United.",
      "He demanded his country be shown \"maximum respect\" and even threatened, according to the Daily Mail, to cause a \"diplomatic incident\", as he would have preferred his own doctors to examine the forward.",
      "But despite Kek’s claims, Slovenia’s national federation has revealed it has received all the relevant medical documentation and accepted United’s diagnosis as they aim to put the row to bed.",
      "“The medical team of the Slovenian national football team received the complete medical documentation from Manchester United regarding Benjamin Sesko’s health condition following his injury on Saturday, including the current clinical picture and the examinations performed,” a spokesperson told the Daily Mail.",
      "“Unfortunately, the injury currently does not allow for the training process. In the coming days, additional examinations and the start of treatment are planned at the club, so Benjamin will unfortunately not be able to participate in this national team action. We wish Benjamin a speedy recovery and a return to the football field as soon as possible.”",
      "United believe they followed the necessary protocols in terms of withdrawing Sesko from the squad. However, a furious Kek claimed earlier this week: “With all due respect to a great club like Manchester United, we have officially not received anything yet; no papers, no documents.",
      "“We would certainly like to get them. We want our medical team to also take a look at it. Our doctor is an expert in this field. We don’t have just anyone in this position.",

      "He added: “The national team is something very special and I expect maximum respect from everyone.",
      "“Slovenia deserves that, even if on the other side there is a powerhouse like England, and something as extraordinary as the Premier League. After all it has been quite some time since England defeated Slovenia and that in itself says something about us.”",

The 52-year-old has now reaffirmed his desire to manage back in England after being sacked by Besiktas at the beginning of the season in their UEFA Conference League qualifier against Swiss side Lausanne.",

Amorim recently celebrated a year in charge of United and has been enjoying some better form of late, but Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink hasn’t been convinced at all by the Portuguese manager.",
      "The club splashed over £200million in the summer transfer window to bring in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens after suffering a dreadful 2024/25 campaign. Amorim could only manage a 15th-place finish in the Premier League with 42 points – the club’s lowest position since 1989/90 and lowest points tally since they were relegated in 1973/74 – while they were beaten by Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim has stuck to his 3-4-2-1 formation throughout and has 21 wins, 14 draws and 19 losses from his 54 matches in charge so far. That simply isn’t good enough, according to Hasselbaink, who is refusing to buy into the renewed positivity around the club.",
      "“Yes, they have been in a final in Europe but lost against a poor side – Tottenham were a poor side last year. He has got a lot of work to do, a lot of work. I don’t think they are creative enough, not like they used to be.”",
      "Despite what Hasselbaink thinks, United’s bosses are understood to be pleased with Amorim’s work recently. They are targeting a return to Europe next season and believe they are going in the right direction both on and off the pitch.",

      "“When you are winning, you can say that you have convictions and you are loyal to your ideas, but you learn when you lose, when you are under pressure and I learned that when I’m under pressure, I’m stronger on my ideas and I keep with my ideas.",
      "“Of course, it’s really important to feel the support of everyone in the club, especially the fans that help you, to give you that confidence to continue on your path, but that was the biggest learning point: when I’m under pressure, I can stick with my plan.”",

The teenager has not missed a game in the Championship since arriving at Hillsborough and has completed 90 minutes in the last 10.",

      "Ruben Amorim felt “powerless” and “upset” in training during his time playing in Qatar, according to his former coach Mauricio Larriera. It wasn’t too long ago that the Manchester United manager was playing football himself, having spent the 2015/16 season with Al-Wakrah.",
      "The former Portuguese midfielder had previously broken through the youth ranks at Belenenses in 2003 before making a move to Benfica five years later. Towards the latter part of his career, Amorim spent three seasons on loan at Braga and the Qatar Stars League side, where he worked under Uruguayan legend Larriera.",
      "But Larriera insists that things didn’t always go smoothly for him and Amorim in Qatar, with frustrations sometimes getting the better of the now Red Devils boss in training and in matches. That anger was down to the passionate Amorim’s own high standards and desire for the team to do better, which meant his manager occasionally had to provide him with some perspective.",
      "Larriera revealed in an interview with O Jogo last year: \"He always played very well, but unfortunately he was sent off in one game. No, in two. And he apologised to me for it. It's part of the game, but he was even more upset than me when things didn't work out. The impotence he felt overcame him.",
      "\"In one game he got two yellows and we ended up losing. In the other it was for a foul, a bit due to tiredness and a bit due to impotence. He felt very powerless. In training he'd get upset and we'd say to him, ‘Ruben, please don't get upset’. Sometimes it was him, ‘Mauricio, please don't get upset’.",
      "\"He didn't understand certain things, Qatar was in the process of growth. When he was angry, I'd hug him and say, ‘Relax, Qatar is like that’. He'd tell me the same thing.\"",
      "While Amorim was able to learn from Larriera during his year-long spell with Al-Wakrah, in which he scored two goals in 14 appearances, the coach also admitted he had the chance to learn and better his own management skills thanks to the midfielder.",
      "He continued: \"It allowed me to raise the level and quality of my training. He helped me perform some highly complex exercises. We lived in the same place, drank mugs of black coffee and talked for hours, sharing many things. He allowed me to get to know an exceptional human being and a class A footballer.",
      "\"I could see that he was very interested in all our plans, game plans, everything, but I didn't realise he was thinking of becoming a coach. He retired there and I think he was 32, very young. I wanted him to stay there and he didn't. I wasn't with my family, it was tough when he left... he told me to stay, that I was fine, that they knew me.",
      "\"We lived in the Four Seasons, I met his wife, she was pregnant. We went for lunch and dinner a couple of times, we talked about a lot of things, football too, but above all about life. We were together in a place in the world that was very strange to all of us. I didn't suspect that he would become what he became, an elite coach in Europe and the world.",
      "\"Ruben was always very open with us, he opened his heart and his wisdom to me. I don't know if we had any footballing arguments, there could have been, but there was always a complicit smile.\"",
      "Shortly after hanging up his boots, Amorim made the brave decision to step into the world of football management, taking a job at Casa Pia in 2018.",
      "He impressed with the minnows before taking charge of Braga in 2019, where he won a Taca da Liga in his maiden season. That earned him a big move to Sporting CP in 2020, where he enjoyed four hugely successful years with the Portuguese giants, clinching two Primeira Liga titles and Taca da Ligas apiece.",
      "In November last year, Amorim was announced as Erik ten Hag's successor at Manchester United, as an era of uncertainty for the Dutchman finally drew to a close. But, if the 40-year-old thought his time in Qatar was stressful and frustrating, his first year at Old Trafford proved more turbulent than he ever could have imagined.",
      "Amorim in his first season guided United to their worst-ever finish in the Premier League, down in 15th place, as he largely failed to implement his unique philosophy and achieve success. He reached the Europa League final last term, where his side failed to qualify for the Champions League after suffering defeat to an equally shambolic Tottenham.",
      "He has constantly had to face scrutiny over whether his ideas can translate to a big English side like United, with speculation rampant over how long it will be before the club’s hierarchy lose patience and sack him. His win percentage at United, at just under 40%, is one of the lowest of any permanent United manager since World War II.",
      "Amorim finally secured back-to-back wins for the first time earlier this season and his side are currently seventh in the league. Their only realistic shot of winning silverware this campaign is the FA Cup.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Following disagreements with two separate bosses, he has been shipped out on three different temporary moves, initially returning to former club Borussia Dortmund, where he helped fire the German giants to the Champions League final.",
      "His loan switch to Chelsea last term included a £25million obligation-to-buy clause. Yet the Blues opted to pay a fifth of that sum as a penalty fee rather than make the deal permanent.",

      "Villa hold no obligation or option to secure him permanently at the season's end, leaving him free to choose his next destination. Former Red Devils frontman Solskjaer has now reflected on Sancho's initial period at United, having been in charge when the Manchester City academy product joined in July 2021.",
      "\"The club did [chase Sancho] he was the best option that we had,\" Solskjaer revealed on Stick to Football. \"We wanted to take the next step, not from moving away but add in the last third players that could break teams down. Jadon's skill, link-up play, he offered something different and he was unlucky, before he came he went on holiday and then all this diving but he got an infection in his ear so he was in hospital.",

      "He has since flourished in Italy and played a crucial role in helping his new club clinch the league title last season. His performances saw him come 18th in the Ballon d'Or rankings.",

      "The former United chief, who left the club back in November 2021, has now shared his views on McTominay's departure and explained why he perhaps couldn't unlock his full potential.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee has been described as an ideal signing for Roma in January. The Italian side are just one of a flurry of teams lining up to make a move for the Manchester United forward in the next transfer window.",
      "The Dutchman, who signed for United in a £37million deal from Bologna in 2024, has failed to earn significant playing time under Ruben Amorim. Zirkzee has played just 82 Premier League minutes this season and has not started a game.",
      "The 24-year-old is said to want to move to improve his playing time to aid his chances of earning a spot in the Netherlands World Cup squad next summer. An exit is not nailed on, however, with United already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo to AFCON.",
      "That may not deter suitors, with West Ham evaluating the forward, as Niclas Fullkrug is eyeing a return to the Bundesliga. Everton too, are in the market for a striker with Zirkzee on their shortlist alongside Ivan Toney.",
      "David Moyes is said to be chasing a different profile of forward to Beto and Thierno Barry. The Toffees are likely to face stiff competition from Italy with clubs hoping to facilitate a return to the country for Zirkzee.",
      "Napoli and Juventus have previously been linked with an attempt to land Zirkzee, while Roma are also said to be interested. Gian Piero Gasperini is currently without centre-forward Artem Dovbyk until early 2026 and attacking stars Paulo Dybala, Leon Bailey and Evan Ferguson are also carrying issues",
      "On-loan star Ferguson has yet to find the net with Roma, and it has been suggested he could return to Brighton, as Roma look to the January transfer window. Former Serie A striker Jeda, reckons a deal for Zirkzee could offer an exciting prospect for all parties involved.",
      "“Zirkzee would be the ideal forward for Gasperini’s Roma, because he has good feet, strong technique, and manages to attack the space,” Jeda told Retesport.",
      "“Dovbyk could be regenerated under Gasp, who was working on his fitness levels and his movements. However, if there are two strikers who are struggling to score, then you need to look around and find someone more suited to the role.”",
      "Speaking on where Zirkzee could make an impact, Jeda explained Roma's struggles, despite sitting second in Serie A and level on points with table-toppers Inter Milan.",
      "“They played most of the game in the Milan half, but didn’t attack the space enough to really do damage,\" he said. \"Gasperini wants his forwards to combine with their teammates, be quick and intense in the movement, have first touch passes to open up the space for the wingers to come in.”",

      "The England international has hit the ground running in La Liga with Barcelona after his loan switch from United. Rashford's future has long been in question with Ruben Amorim still at the helm, but all signs are pointing towards a potential permanent departure for the England star, given Barcelona have the option to sign him on a full-time basis come the summer.",
      "After being sidelined at United, Rashford has had two loan stints away from the club, first with Aston Villa and now Barcelona - but his performances have earned him a recall to the Three Lions squad.",
      "It was under Solskjaer's reign that Rashford made the most appearances for United, and his most productive, netting 55 goals in 135 matches and providing 36 assists.",

      "But the club remains on the lookout for potential new recruits and Adeyemi’s situation at Dortmund has caught their attention. The 23-year-old has been at Dortmund for three years, having broken through as a teenager at Red Bull Salzburg, but reports in Germany suggest relationships are fraying.",
      "Adeyemi has three goals and three assists in 14 games this season and has clashed with manager Niko Kovac recently. He threw a bottle at the bench after being substituted last month in a 1-0 win over Koln, drawing a public scolding for his behaviour from Kovac.",
      "“I think that's unnecessary,” the Dortmund manager said. “It's okay that he can be angry sometimes, but that's unnecessary, he's an adult.” Kovac was visibly frustrated with his performance in the 1-1 draw with Hamburg on the weekend and things have reportedly come to a head.",
      "Bild says that talks are ‘in full swing’ behind the scenes over Adeyemi’s long-term future at the club. He is currently tied down until June 2027, but his new agent Jorge Mendes is pushing for fresh terms, which would include a £70million release clause.",
      "Mendes is known for orchestrating big-money transfers and United know him well, with the Portuguese agent having been behind United’s acquisitions of Leny Yoro and Manuel Ugarte in recent years.",
      "Adeyemi is known for his eye-catching speed and is able to play on both wings. He has 29 goals and 22 assists across 121 appearances for Dortmund and United will be keeping a close eye on how his relationship with Kovac develops in the coming weeks.",
      "Speaking after Dortmund’s 4-1 defeat by Manchester City in the Champions League recently, Kovac tried to find positives in Adeyemi’s performance after he lasted 81 minutes at the Etihad Stadium. “I want to keep it general: the passing quality that City showed compared to us was better,” he said.",
      "“Karim had a few situations, but he didn't succeed. He lacked precision and accuracy. But I am satisfied that he earned the chance in the first place.”",
      "United are understood to be prioritising the signing of a central midfielder in the January transfer window, with Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba among the players they admire.",

      "It has been a year since Amorim took over at Old Trafford after leaving Sporting CP last November. While the Portuguese coach helped guide his team to the Europa League final last season, their defeat to Spurs and dismal league season left United without any European football this campaign.",
      "The 40-year-old reportedly showed his frustration with one current United player at a pivotal team meeting near the end of last season. Amorim's attempts to cultivate a new attitude within his squad have since been bolstered by the club's summer signings and less hectic fixture list.",
      "Upon joining Manchester United last year, Amorim may have been delighted to be reunited with Manuel Ugarte, who had been a key player during his time at Sporting. However, the manager reportedly did not shy away from calling out the midfielder's attitude in a team meeting following the club's Europa League final defeat.",
      "While Alejandro Garnacho was told that his future lay elsewhere, Amorim also pulled no punches when addressing Ugarte. The Athletic reports that the United boss criticised Ugarte after feeling that the midfielder had let his work-rate slip since leaving Sporting.",
      "Amorim believed Ugarte had become comfortable at United, and the manager \"did not recognise him\" as the same player. It was a bold decision for Amorim to call out one of his former stars. However, it is said to have had an overall positive impact on the United squad, who appreciated the manager's honest feedback.",
      "Mayor of Greater Manchester, Burnham, has insisted that public money will not be used to help fund Manchester United's new stadium. The Red Devils shared their plans to build a 100,000-seat stadium earlier this year, with co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe suggesting that the government could help fund the project.",
      "A Mayoral Development Corporation has recently been established, focusing on the regeneration project around the ground. However, Burnham has stated that no public money will be used to aid the construction of the stadium.",
      "\"It's not about giving them money because we have a really clear principle here at the start of this journey with the Mayoral Development Corporation,\" Burnham told The Added Time Podcast. \"Manchester United will be paying for the stadium. There will not be a penny of public money going into that.",
      "\"But we have absolutely a role to play in making everything around the stadium as good as it can be because of the economic benefit that brings. If you think about it, there is a train station behind the stand there and it's not been used for a number of years for safety reasons.",
      "\"Part of it would see that station relocated a little bit, maybe a bit nearer Lou Macari's chippy or somewhere near there, and that would then reopen and massively benefit existing communities, Gorse Hill, Stretford and the people who live there, so the public benefit of this would be massive. Thousands of new homes, thousands of new jobs, so it's much wider than the ground itself.\"",

      "Former Manchester United forward Mark Hughes has put his stunning £5.5million mansion up for sale for a third time. Located in Cheshire, the property spans approximately 8,892 square feet and sits on around two acres of land.",
      "Hughes spent 13 years at United across two spells, initially making his breakthrough aged 20 in the early 1980s before returning to Old Trafford in 1988 following stints with Barcelona and Bayern Munich.",
      "In total, the 62-year-old made over 450 appearances for the Red Devils in all competitions, scoring 161 goals during that time.",
      "His playing career also saw him represent Chelsea, Southampton, Everton and Blackburn Rovers before hanging up his boots in 2002.

      "Manchester United are the subject of legal action for a historic sexual abuse allegation against a former employee.",
      "It is understood the allegation relates to Billy Watts, who worked at The Cliff - the club's former training ground - in Salford during the 1980s as a caretaker and groundsman. Watts, who died 16 years ago, has been accused of subjecting the male victim to 'sexual and physical abuse when he was a child'.",
      "It is alleged in the civil claim, filed by Lawyers at Simpson Millar last week, that the club failed to protect the claimant from abuse while he was under their supervision and care. They did not reveal whether the complainant – who cannot be named for legal reasons – had been a youth player at United.",
      "It has been claimed by lawyers that thus far the club have declined to 'engage constructively' with the legal process, despite its previous participation in the 2021 Sheldon Review, which documented several allegations of abuse involving Watts and confirmed internal disciplinary action against him in 1989.",
      "The Athletic previously reported that after the internal disciplinary action, Watts was moved to a role away from the club's youth team players. Watts departed United months after he was relocated.",
      "In a statement at the time, United stated that 'multiple interviews' had been conducted with employees in relation to the allegations with information and available records submitted to the Sheldon Review - The Football Association's independent review into child sexual abuse in football.",
      "The Mirror approached Manchester United for a comment. The club declined to comment.",
      "Although Watts wasn't mentioned by name, the 2021 report, headed by Clive Sheldon KC, referred to accusations that 'concerned a caretaker at the club, who is now deceased'.",
      "Abuse Law Expert at Simpson Millar said: “Our client has shown enormous courage in coming forward after so many years. He, like many survivors, has had to relive incredibly painful memories in order to seek justice.",
      "“While Manchester United contributed to the Sheldon Review, its approach to this legal claim has been disappointing. Survivors deserve more than sympathy—they deserve meaningful engagement and accountability.”",
      "Simpson Millar have also stated the case 'exposes a clear gap between the public commitments made by institutions following historic abuse inquiries and their private handling of individual claims'.",
      "At the time of the Sheldon Review, a United statement said: \"We have cooperated fully with the Sheldon review in an effort to make sure we were as comprehensive on this important matter as we could be. This involved conducting multiple interviews as part of our wide-ranging enquiries pursuant to the review.",
      "\"These included a former employee who had conducted the disciplinary process against the former caretaker in the 1980s, and other current and former employees who worked at the club in the ’70s and ’80s.\"All interviewees provided their full cooperation and information relating to the former caretaker has been included in Manchester United’s submissions to the review.",
      "\"Identifying facts from historical allegations is never an easy process and their report will include any issues relating to Manchester United that are considered relevant by the review team.\"",

      "Former Manchester United and England goalkeeper Mary Earps received a mixed reception as she returned to Old Trafford, with cheers greeting her during the warm-up for Paris Saint-Germain before some boos were heard in the opening moments of the match.",
      "The 32-year-old is back at the ground for the first time since her departure to the French side in June 2024. Earps has been in the spotlight recently following the publication of her autobiography, 'All In'.",
      "A passage from the book sparked debate when she revealed details of a discussion with England manager Sarina Wiegman regarding Chelsea goalkeeper Hannah Hampton. The book claimed that Earps raised concerns about the younger stopper ahead of the tournament.",
      "According to Earps, Hampton had been 'disruptive and unreliable' during Euro 2022, and she is understood to have told Wiegman that selecting the 24-year-old again amounted to 'rewarding bad behaviour'. The claims drew criticism from England supporters and pundits, which prompted Earps to issue a public response.",
      "Taking to Instagram after the reaction, Earps wrote: \"It is not easy to be as vulnerable and open as I have been in the book, and I also understand that my honesty and rawness will divide opinion. That's okay, everyone is entitled to feel what they feel and I respect that.\"",
      "Before the match, the goalkeeper confessed she was bracing herself for a chilly reception at Old Trafford. However, the reality of the evening didn't quite match her expectations, with Earps only receiving boos when she first touched the ball.",
      "\"I'm probably expecting a little booing,\" she admitted. \"I hope it's a little bit, but it might be a lot. A few of the fans have come out to support me at PSG, but United is their No.1 team. I understand that.\"",
      "When quizzed about the possibility of Earps being booed, United head coach Marc Skinner also stepped in to discourage any potential animosity towards his former player. \"Deep down I know Mary is a good person,\" he stated.",
      "\"I'm sure part of bringing out a book is bringing out controversial stuff that will help sell the book. I know that she has to defend that publicly.",
      "\"Knowing the human she is, I'm sure she will be getting criticism that she won't like. It's part of the other side of releasing a book.",
      "\"But she's a great person, she doesn't need me to say that really. I hope people toe the line with criticism, but I'm sure Mary understands the situation she's put herself in.",
      "\"She's on a platform where people are interested in what she says, so that's a credit to her and to her hard work. The goalkeeper we had at the start, to the one that left, was not the same person. She transformed.\"",
      "Earps will be aiming to disappoint the home crowd with her performance. United are entering the game on a high, having secured two victories from two matches in the Champions League, while PSG are yet to get off the mark in this season's tournament.",

It is reported that staff will be provided with new guidelines outlining what club-related content is not appropriate to share on personal channels.",
      "Senior club officials are said to believe that too much unsanctioned content is released into the public domain by staff with access to the first team. Telegraph Sport reports that United have no desire to be 'killjoys' but do not believe they are being unreasonable to have stricter rules over content from within the club.",
      "It is noted that the club have never had any issue with staff sharing official content that they have contributed to. But the move is said to have enjoyed a mixed reception.",
      "Some argue that highlighting pride in work at the club on social media was a positive action, and that the move to restrict it is an overstep. Others suggest that Sir Alex Ferguson ’s reign came with strict oversight over what was made public.",
      "United's sporting director, Jason Wilcox, recently discussed the culture the club are striving for among all staff. “At the heart of it is our people, it’s really important,” Wilcox said.",
      "“I have a saying: feel like a family, perform like a team, and if we can feel like a family and create this atmosphere where we are able to have honest conversations, we’re able to give feedback, we’re able to have new ideas, no one gets offended. This is the environment that we’re trying to create.”",
      "Despite the clampdown on what escapes the club's inner facilities, Manchester United supporters are being offered the chance to tour the club's new Carrington training complex. It will become part of some Old Trafford stadium tours.",
      "United fans will be provided with access to the dressing room, gym, recovery areas and press conference room, in addition to the players’ lounge. They will not be permitted to take photographs of United’s inner sanctum, however.",
      "The £50million hub was opened in August and will see tours arrive at the end of the season. The June start will come as their players jet off for the World Cup. The club will charge £100 for adults, over 65s and under 16s, it is said.",

      "Manchester City are understandably delighted that the Etihad Stadium has been selected as a host venue for Euro 2028.",
      "City have invested heavily in the stadium and believe that has been the key to their selection as a host venue, but the truth is Manchester United have had a hand in the decision.",
      "Euro 2028 will be played in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Old Trafford is the largest club football ground in the UK, but it withdrew from the venue selection process two years ago.",
      "United did not want to commit their stadium to being involved in the tournament amid ongoing discussions over the future of Old Trafford, and a mutual decision was reached with the Football Association to withdraw it from consideration, which meant the Etihad's bid to host in Manchester went unchallenged.",
      "Simply put, you could argue the Etihad has only been chosen to host Euro 2028 games in Manchester because Old Trafford couldn't commit to hosting during the tournament.",
      "City will likely feel that they would have been selected as a host venue regardless. The Etihad will expand capacity to over 60,000 when the North Stand redevelopment is complete.",
      "The Medlock hotel is part of the club's £300million expansion project, and it will boast 401 rooms in what has been billed as City's new \"entertainment destination\" in the new year.",
      "When the hosting venues were confirmed this week, City's managing director of operations said: “Hosting five matches as part of Euro 2028, including England’s opening match should they qualify directly, will be a special moment for the club, the city, and most importantly – its people.",
      "“Manchester has a proud history of hosting some of the world’s best sporting and cultural events, including the Commonwealth Games in 2002, which kick-started the sports-led regeneration of this area of Manchester.",
      "“Thanks to our work alongside Manchester City Council and the club’s continued commitment to investing in world-class facilities, we are proud to continue bringing the best of the world to Manchester, and in turn, showcasing the best of Manchester to the world.”",
      "City chiefs would have backed the Etihad to be selected ahead of Old Trafford in a potential venue battle due to their investment in facilities, but the bottom line is that Old Trafford has a greater capacity.",
      "Only Camp Nou (Barcelona), the Bernabeu (Real Madrid), Signal Iduna Park (Borussia Dortmund) and Olympiastadion (Hertha Berlin) hold more fans than Old Trafford from clubs in Europe.",
      "Old Trafford has a capacity of 74,197, which might have ultimately put the ground ahead of the Etihad had a decision been required from UEFA between the two venues for Euro 2028.",
      "United's home is regarded as an iconic football arena, whereas the Etihad lacks that rich history as a relatively newly-built stadium. Both grounds have similar public transport links and are close to Manchester city centre.",
      "Old Trafford would have had a greater capacity and a wealth of history in its favour, although there is no denying that the facilities at the Etihad are better after continued investment.",
      "We'll never know which stadium would have won in a potential Euro 2028 venue battle, and it's great to see the Etihad be selected to host five games due to the benefits it will bring to the region.",
      "The leader of Manchester City Council, Councillor Bev Craig, said: \"Manchester is known the world over as a great footballing city and we could not be more excited to be welcoming such a prestigious tournament, which is enjoyed by millions of fans around the world, to our city.",
      "\"We're a city where football runs deep in our DNA and we're counting down the days to UEFA Euro 2028. As well as our unrivalled love for football, the city brings together an exceptional network of partners who are working tirelessly to ensure a world-class experience for players, fans, and visitors alike.",
      "\"As well as enjoying some fantastic football from world-class players at the top of their game right here on our doorstep, we'll be going all out to maximise the benefits to Manchester of hosting the tournament, and with a projected economic boost to the local economy of over £200million, it's an absolute win-win for the city and for local residents.\"",
      "The £200m economic boost for Manchester can only be a positive.",

      "When Woodward made that comment, United were trailing Manchester City by 19 points in the Premier League, which further stoked tensions among an already disgruntled fanbase.",
      "Woodward rubbed supporters up the wrong way, but he was right. United are commercial giants and their global fame, sponsorship deals and broadcast revenue mean the coffers will never be empty.",
      "The club's latest financial figures were published in September, revealing a record revenue of £666.5million, despite the failure to qualify for any form of European football this term.",
      "However, United are still losing money when interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation are included, although the net loss was £33m in 2025, down from the £113m loss in 2024.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe launched an audit following his investment into the club and immediately began to cut costs. The scale of the cuts have been controversial and the identity of the club has been damaged - but September's financial numbers show Ratcliffe's changes have had the desired effect.",
      "Every outgoing penny at Old Trafford is now scrutinised. Ratcliffe has ordered his regime to leave no stone unturned in the effort to save money, so the current sponsorship situation will be a priority.",
      "United are in discussions to find a new sleeve sponsor and training kit sponsor. Their training gear £24m per season agreement with Tezos concluded at the end of June, and the £20m per season sleeve sponsorship deal with DXC Technology will expire at the end of the current campaign.",
      "For four seasons, DXC has been featured on the club’s home, away and third kits, providing global brand exposure for the tech company. The multi-year partnership has also seen DXC use their expertise to improve the way United engage with fans through their digital platforms.",
      "The Premier League permitted sleeve sponsorship from the start of 2017/18. United announced the first sponsors of their sleeves, Kohler, for the following campaign under a multi-year agreement. That deal ended in 2022, which led to DXC coming in.",
      "The Tezos-branded training kit had been worn by United's first-team squad across the last three years, and the logo had also featured on the training kit worn by the women's team.",
      "Matheus Cunha was pictured in a Tezos-sponsored hoodie in unveiling pictures when he signed from Wolves, but the deal had expired by the time of Bryan Mbeumo's arrival.",
      "Tezos replaced AON as the club's training kit sponsor when they struck their deal in 2022. United were without a training kit sponsor in 2021/2022 after the conclusion of their agreement with AON.",
      "History has repeated itself this season. United are currently without a training kit sponsor, but sources have indicated there is a \"strong pipeline\" of prospects for both sleeve and training kit sponsorships.",
      "The Tezos and DXC deals were thought to be worth a combined £44m per season, so it's crucial that United negotiate the best deal they can find from that \"strong pipeline\" of prospects.",
      "There is confidence within the club that similarly lucrative sponsorship deals will be agreed, but it will be interesting to see whether they are worth less, or whether the sleeve and kit sponsorship rights could be sold as part of a single, more comprehensive package.",
      "It's possible that United's lack of success will finally have an impact on how much they will command from sponsors. Marriott International's deal with United ended in the summer due to its company-wide cost-cutting, but perhaps it might have continued if the club had been performing better.",
      "Marriott International may have decided to extend their deal if United had been prominent in the Champions League, for example. Obviously, their decision might have been completely unrelated to results, but performing well on the pitch can only be a positive when trying to get the best sponsorship deals.",
      "It seems likely United will announce new partners for sleeve and training kit sponsorship in the near future. They have an opportunity to further boost their revenue with those new commercial deals.",

      "Radek Vitek would \"love\" to play for Manchester United but is realistic about where his career could take him.",
      "In the summer transfer window Vitek signed for Bristol City on a season-long loan and he's been a revelation at Ashton Gate, starting every league game and keeping five clean sheets.",
      "The 22-year-old has made some great saves. Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber recently said of Vitek to the Bristol Post: “Very impressed, very impressed, and sometimes even a little bit surprised. He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "Vitek has continued to go from strength to strength. The youngster had previous loans with Austrian side FC Blau-Weiß Linz and Accrington Stanley, and he is benefiting from those experiences.",
      "\"It's true, it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said about signing for Bristol City. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach.",
      "\"It was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year. It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive. I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek continued: \"I'm still quite young, but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Vitek joined United's academy from Czech Republic club Sigma Olomouc when he was a teenager in 2020. \"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" he said.",
      "\"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign. It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home, but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously, my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my teammates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Vitek delivered a man-of-the-match performance in United's opening pre-season friendly against Rosenborg in 2024, but he didn't join the summer tour of the United States because he was due to leave on loan.",
      "Nonetheless, Vitek has been tipped to return to United and challenge Senne Lammens for the No.1 spot. \"I'm taking it step-by-step and we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" he said.",
      "\"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything. Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
      "Vitek signed a new United contract until 2028 before joining Bristol City on loan.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the latest Manchester United transfer news and rumours.",
      "The Reds are reportedly stepping up their pursuit of Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson. The England international has been one of the standout players for Forest this season despite their struggles after an impressive campaign last year.",
      "It is also being reported that Casemiro’s future remains uncertain as he heads into the final few months of his contract at Old Trafford. It is claimed that United would like to reduce his wages, but Casemiro is reportedly unwilling to accept a pay cut.",
      "Having not lost since late September, United headed into the latest international break on a high, especially after their late fightback against Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "However, the one negative from the 2-2 draw at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was the early departure of Benjamin Sesko. The MEN understands that Sesko will continue to be assessed at Carrington this week, but sources have indicated the injury is not thought to be a major issue.",
      "With all of that being said, follow along below for all the latest United transfer news, rumours and updates.",
      "United are said to be increasingly keen on pursuing Antoine Semenyo during the winter transfer window.",
      "CaughtOffside cites sources when claiming the club wants to move fast so that competition from Arsenal, City and Liverpool does not compromise any deal. It reported that Semenyo could cost over £65million and potentially closer to £80million, but Bournemouth are reputedly not willing to sell.",
      "Radek Vitek has spoken about his future at United while on loan at Bristol City.",
      "I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me. I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United, who has come here to watch my games, and I have a good connection with them.",
      "I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything. Obviously, long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day, but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.",
      "Benjamin Sekso and Karim Adeyemi played together 38 times while they were teammates at Red Bull Salzburg, including at their feeder club Liefering and for the under-19s.",
      "The former set up his striker three times across those matches, including in the Austrian Cup final, with Sesko returning the favour once.",
      "Harry Amass is poised to continue his spell at Sheffield Wednesday beyond the January transfer window.",
      "United signed 18-year-old left-back Amass in August 2023 after he spent his early years with Watford. The Reds are delighted with Amass' performance on loan, leading them to decide to prolong his stay with the Championship side despite their off-the-field issues, as per the BBC.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday feel Amass has made real progress during his initial months at Hillsborough.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted his shock at how the club allowed Scott McTominay to move on.",
      "The Scot was sold to Napoli for £25.4m in the summer of 2024, and has flourished in Italy ever since.",
      "Solskjaer told the Stick to Football podcast: “I was almost shocked because you need or want a core of the local lads, ones who get the club. Scott did. For me, I think he’s shown in Italy how good of a player he is.\"",
      "Roy Keane added: “I’m always wary when lads leave, for a club like Napoli now but it’s a different challenge to Man United and he’s done well.",
      "“Good luck to the lad but I still wasn’t hanging my hat on him every week going, ‘He will be the lad that will bring Man United back.’ When you’re classing him as a squad player and someone says, ‘Here’s £30m,' it’s not a bad deal.”",
      "Harry Maguire has shared an update on his injury scare, which will relieve Ruben Amorim and especially the United hierarchy ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "The experienced centre-half suffered a hamstring issue during the 2-2 draw at Tottenham and had to be withdrawn.",
      "But it's not a long-term problem, it seems, and means United won't have to turn to the market to fill the void in the second half of the season.",
      "Maguire shared a couple of posts on his Instagram story to show he was working on his fitness during the international break.",
      "Manchester United extended their unbeaten run in the Premier League to five games against Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "Spurs were seconds away from only a fourth Premier League home win in 2025 when Mathys Tel and Richarlison struck late on to put them 2-1 up.",
      "But Matthijs de Ligt struck deep into stoppage time to rescue a point for United.",
      "The Reds face Everton after the international break before concluding November against Crystal Palace.",
      "Games against West Ham United, Wolves and Bournemouth kick start December, and United are 20/1 with Bet365 to win all five games.",
      "Roma are reportedly exploring attacking options for January as they continue talks over Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "The MEN reported last month that Zirkzee wants to leave United in January and, despite his struggles, is unlikely to be short of offers.",
      "Spanish side Sevilla are keeping tabs on Zirkzee's situation, while West Ham United have also been linked with a move for the forward.",
      "Roma were one of the first clubs to be linked with a move for the forward, but according to Corriere dello Sport, Cologne star Said El Mala has also caught the eye of the Italian side.",
      "The Football Association of Slovenia has moved to calm down the club-versus-country row Benjamin Sesko has found himself caught up in.",
      "Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek was left furious earlier this week after he claimed he had been kept in the dark by Manchester United over the injured striker and demanded his country be shown “maximum respect”.",
      "Kek had threatened, according to the Daily Mail, to cause a 'diplomatic incident' and would have preferred his own doctors to examine Sesko. Instead, the forward, who picked up a knee injury against Tottenham Hotspur at the weekend, was examined by United’s medical staff and has stayed at Carrington for further treatment rather than link up with the Slovenia national side.",

      "Ruben Amorim's first Manchester United signing has been brutally slammed by a former club scout. Amorim has overseen two trading periods during his 12 months at Old Trafford, with five senior signings made and just under £250million spent.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens were the players acquired this summer with all four impressing to some degree. Patrick Dorgu was the first signing made by Amorim when he joined from Lecce in a £29.2million deal in the January transfer window.",
      "The Denmark international appeared to be perfect for Amorim's wing-back system, but he has struggled for regular starts this season, particularly when Amad is deployed on the opposite flank.",
      "Read more here",
      "Former Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has had his say on Jadon Sancho's time at Old Trafford.",
      "The English winger joined United in the summer of 2021, but fell out of favour at Old Trafford under both Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim. After being sidelined from the squad by two different managers, he has been sent on three separate loan spells, the first of which saw him return to his former club Borussia Dortmund, where he played a crucial role in getting the German side to the Champions League final.",
      "He was loaned to Chelsea last season, with his move including a £25million obligation-to-buy clause. However, the Blues chose to pay a fifth of that as a penalty fee for not exercising that option.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United have reportedly been put on red alert about the possibility of signing Borussia Dortmund star Karim Adeyemi. The speedy forward is enduring a difficult spell at Dortmund and is unsettled as the January transfer window approaches.",
      "Bild report, via the Mirror, that talks are ‘in full swing’ behind the scenes over Adeyemi’s long-term future at the club. He is currently tied down until June 2027, but his new agent Jorge Mendes is pushing for fresh terms, which would include a £70million release clause.",
      "Manchester United find themselves in a predicament when it comes to deciding Casemiro's future.",
      "On the one hand, the Brazilian has managed to become an integral part of Ruben Amorim's team this season. We have said time and time again that United look worse when the midfielder is not on the pitch.",
      "Full credit goes to Casemiro for this. Last season he looked like he would never return to a point where he could perform week in, week out, in the Premier League.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Former Manchester United striker Louis Saha has dismissed the notion that £28million is a bargain price for Barcelona to sign Marcus Rashford.",
      "\"I think Marcus Rashford does provide a bit of worry,\" he said, via OLBG. \"You have to manage him. What happened to him at United?",
      "\"I think something could happen again so I think that he has to have his own objective. I think he needs to come back to that level and maintain that to be in the World Cup and win it. That's what I hope for him.\"",
      "Read more here",
      "Amorim has also acknowledged that the seriousness of Benjamin Sesko's knee problem might affect their strategy.",
      "\"We have to check everything, we have to check what has happened with Ben,\" he said.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON], but we already knew. Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",
      "\"But let's see when the window is open, if we can improve the team and try to prepare something that happened. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "That update suggests that some form of talks have been held whether that be internally, with Forest or to Anderson's camp.",
      "Ivan Toney is reportedly open to a Premier League return in January amid speculation around a potential move to Manchester United. The 29-year-old has spent the last 15 months in Saudi Arabia after he left Brentford to sign for Al-Ahli in August 2024.",
      "Since his move to the Middle East, Toney has scored 41 goals and provided eight assists in 59 appearances. With the ex-Peterborough man netting 11 of those in 15 matches this season, talk has increased that he could be set for a move back to English football.",
      "Toney is thought to be considering a return to the Premier League following his exit from Brentford last summer. It's added that numerous top-flight clubs have made enquires about a January deal, with Everton and Tottenham among those interested.",
      "While there is no specific mention of United's name in the report, the Reds wanted Toney before he went to Saudi Arabia. After impressing for Gareth Southgate's England at Euro 2024, the Old Trafford club considered Toney as a striker option as they tried to strengthen their front line.",
      "Welcome to our live coverage this morning as Manchester United head into the November international break feeling much better about themselves amid a five-match unbeaten run.",
      "The Reds return to action on Monday, November 24 at home to Everton (8pm kick-off) before a trip to Crystal Palace six days later. Attention will also soon be turning to the January transfer window, which opens on New Year's Day before closing on February 2.",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim felt \"powerless\" and \"upset\" during training sessions while playing in Qatar, his former coach Mauricio Larriera revealed. It wasn’t too long ago that the United boss played football himself, having spent the 2015/16 season with Al-Wakrah.",
      "The former Portugal midfielder first came through the academy at Belenenses in 2003 before securing a switch to Benfica five years later. Towards the end of his playing days, Amorim spent three seasons on loan at Braga and the Qatar Stars League side, where he was coached by Uruguayan legend Larriera.",
      "But Larriera admits that life in Qatar wasn't always plain sailing for him and Amorim, with the latter’s frustrations sometimes spilling over during training and matches. That anger stemmed from the passionate Amorim's own lofty expectations and hunger for the side to perform better, which occasionally meant his manager had to offer him some much-needed perspective.",
      "Larriera said in an interview with O Jogo last year: \"He always played very well, but unfortunately he was sent off in one game. No, in two. And he apologised to me for it. It's part of the game, but he was even more upset than me when things didn't work out. The impotence he felt overcame him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"In one game he got two yellows and we ended up losing. In the other it was for a foul, a bit due to tiredness and a bit due to impotence. He felt very powerless. In training he'd get upset and we'd say to him, ‘Ruben, please don't get upset’. Sometimes it was him, ‘Mauricio, please don't get upset’.",
      "\"He didn't understand certain things, Qatar was in the process of growth. When he was angry, I'd hug him and say, ‘Relax, Qatar is like that’. He'd tell me the same thing.\"",
      "While Amorim gained valuable knowledge from Larriera during his year at Al-Wakrah, where he scored twice in 14 matches, the manager revealed the midfielder also improved his own coaching abilities.",
      "He explained: \"It allowed me to raise the level and quality of my training. He helped me perform some highly complex exercises. We lived in the same place, drank mugs of black coffee and talked for hours, sharing many things. He allowed me to get to know an exceptional human being and a class A footballer.",
      "\"I could see that he was very interested in all our plans, game plans, everything, but I didn't realise he was thinking of becoming a coach. He retired there and I think he was 32, very young. I wanted him to stay there and he didn't. I wasn't with my family, it was tough when he left... he told me to stay, that I was fine, that they knew me.",
      "\"We lived in the Four Seasons, I met his wife, she was pregnant. We went for lunch and dinner a couple of times, we talked about a lot of things, football too, but above all about life. We were together in a place in the world that was very strange to all of us. I didn't suspect that he would become what he became, an elite coach in Europe and the world.",
      "\"Ruben was always very open with us, he opened his heart and his wisdom to me. I don't know if we had any footballing arguments, there could have been, but there was always a complicit smile.\"",
      "After retiring, Amorim took the bold leap into management by taking the job at Casa Pia in 2018. He impressed with the minnows before taking charge of Braga in 2019, where he won a Taca da Liga in his maiden season. That earned him a big move to Sporting CP in 2020, where he enjoyed four hugely successful years with the Portuguese giants, clinching two Primeira Liga titles and Taca da Ligas apiece.",
      "Last November, Amorim was confirmed as Erik ten Hag's successor at Manchester United, bringing an end to a long period of uncertainty surrounding the Dutch manager. But, if the 40-year-old thought his time in Qatar was stressful and frustrating, his first 12 months at Old Trafford would prove far more challenging than he could ever have anticipated.",
      "In his first season, Amorim led United to their worst-ever Premier League finish, down in 15th place, as he struggled to successfully instil his unique philosophy and achieve success. He reached the Europa League final last term, where his side failed to qualify for the Champions League after suffering defeat to an equally dismal Tottenham.",
      "He has constantly faced questions about whether his ideas can be successful at a big English club like United, with rampant speculation about when the club's hierarchy might lose patience and sack him. His win rate at United, just shy of 40%, is among the lowest of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "Amorim finally managed consecutive victories for the first time earlier this season, and his team currently sit seventh in the league. Their only realistic chance of lifting a trophy this season lies in the FA Cup.",

      "Andy Burnham has reiterated \"not a penny of public money\" will be granted to construct Manchester United's new stadium.",
      "In March, United unveiled ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art 100,000-seater stadium at an event in London and co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said the project could be completed by 2030.",
      "Ratcliffe floated the idea of taxpayers partly funding the £2billion project, saying: \"People in the north pay their taxes and there is an argument you could think about a more ambitious project in the north which would be fitting for England, for the Champions League final or the FA Cup final.\"",
      "Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has previously stated that no public funding would be granted for the stadium itself, and he reiterated that stance to The Added Time Podcast.",
      "However, a Mayoral Development Corporation has recently been established for the regeneration project surrounding the stadium, which will bring huge economic benefits.",
      "Burnham said: \"It's not about giving them money because we have a really clear principle here at the start of this journey with the Mayoral Development Corporation. Manchester United will be paying for the stadium. There will not be a penny of public money going into that.",
      "\"But we have absolutely a role to play in making everything around the stadium as good as it can be because of the economic benefit that brings. If you think about it, there is a train station behind the stand there and it's not been used for a number of years for safety reasons.",
      "\"Part of it would see that station relocated a little bit, maybe a bit nearer Lou Macari's chippy or somewhere near there, and that would then reopen and massively benefit existing communities, Gorse Hill, Stretford and the people who live there, so the public benefit of this would be massive.",
      "\"Thousands of new homes, thousands of new jobs, so it's much wider than the ground itself.\"",
      "Burnham confirmed the aim of bringing the 2035 World Cup final to Manchester, saying: “I am closely involved to the point where we’ve just asked parliament to establish a Mayoral Development Corporation. So that is a vehicle, a legal entity, that will oversee the wider regeneration of the whole area.",
      "“That is more my responsibility, the wider environment around any new stadium. It’s a huge opportunity for us as a city and a region. If you think about that area, it’s the area around the old Salford docks.",
      "“You’ve got Media City on the other side. This could be a global location if we get it right. I know people here kind of struggle to see why it impacts life on this end of the M62 [Liverpool], but actually there are freight terminals behind the existing Old Trafford that send lots of trains through Manchester city centre.",
      "\"That is a major cause of the chaos on railways across the north because it causes blockages in Manchester. Therefore, every train coming across the country is often then late getting over to Liverpool.",
      "\"So it’s a project that actually makes sense on loads of levels. It actually would lead to the freight tunnels being relocated to St Helens and therefore growth here [Liverpool].",
      "\"It’s a major growth project for the whole of the north west. And the enticing prospect in my mind is if we really get it moving, I think there’s a fairly high likelihood that we will be hosting the women’s FIFA World Cup in 2035.",
      "\"Imagine a final at that new Old Trafford. It would be quite something, wouldn't it?\"",
      "The design of the new stadium has been paused while discussions progress regarding the acquisition of land. The rail yard surrounding Old Trafford is owned by Freightliner and that land is crucial to the plans.",
      "United are optimistic of agreeing a deal to acquire the land for new stadium project.",

      "Sources have indicated the injury is not thought to be a major issue, and despite Kek’s claims, Slovenia’s national federation has revealed it has finally received all the relevant medical documentation and accepted United’s diagnosis in a bid to ease the tension.",
      "“The medical team of the Slovenian national football team received the complete medical documentation from Manchester United regarding Benjamin Sesko’s health condition following his injury on Saturday, including the current clinical picture and the examinations performed,” a spokesperson told the Daily Mail.",
      "“Unfortunately, the injury currently does not allow for the training process. In the coming days, additional examinations and the start of treatment are planned at the club, so Benjamin will unfortunately not be able to participate in this national team action. We wish Benjamin a speedy recovery and a return to the football field as soon as possible.”",

      "“We are prepared to do everything for that and we have never sent anyone on the field if there was the slightest risk.”",
      "The forward was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but he lasted just half an hour before having to be replaced as his side drew the game 2-2 thanks to Matthijs de Ligt’s stoppage-time equaliser.",
      "And Kek added: “The national team is something very special and I expect maximum respect from everyone.",
      "“Slovenia deserves that, even if on the other side there is a powerhouse like England, and something as extraordinary as the Premier League.",

      "Hughes enjoyed 13 years at United during two separate periods, first breaking through as a 20-year-old in the early 1980s before rejoining Old Trafford in 1988 after spells with Barcelona and Bayern Munich.",
      "The now 62-year-old accumulated more than 450 appearances for the Red Devils across all competitions, netting 161 goals throughout his time at the club.",

      "Harry Maguire has issued a fitness update after handing Manchester United an injury scare at the weekend.",
      "Maguire was substituted with a suspected hamstring problem during United's 2-2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Saturday. The draw in north London saw United have Benjamin Sesko and Casemiro added to the injury list going into the international break.",
      "Maguire was not included in the England squad by manager Thomas Tuchel for the November round of World Cup qualifiers. Instead, Maguire has been at Carrington working on his fitness ahead of the return of Premier League football next week.",
      "Amid concerns about Maguire's fitness and fears the defender may have suffered an injury, an update has emerged with the United star posting on social media.",
      "Maguire took to Instagram to send two messages to his 5.5million followers. The first message saw Maguire enjoying a hot drink at United's training base, accompanied with the caption: \"Quiet morning at Carrington\".",
      "The second post saw Maguire pose alongside United coach Mike Clegg, which also featured a caption. \"Bike done,\" wrote Maguire on the post, accompanied with a green tick emoji and a bicep emoji.",
      "Despite the boost over his condition, United still face a nervous wait to discover if Maguire will be fully fit and available to feature come the return of Premier League action on November 24, where the Reds will face Everton in the Monday Night Football.",
      "Amorim was asked about Maguire potentially suffering an injury after the draw with Spurs.",
      "At the time, the boss said: \"With everything that happened, Harry has to come out, Casemiro has to come out and Ben [Sesko].\"",

      "Old Trafford is not a host venue for the 2028 European Championship because it was withdrawn from the venue selection process.",
      "Manchester United's stadium is the largest club football ground in the United Kingdom, but it was withdrawn from the Euro 2028 venue selection process two years ago due to the club's intention to redevelop it.",
      "United did not want to commit their stadium to being involved in the tournament, and a mutual decision was reached with the Football Association to withdraw it from consideration.",
      "Old Trafford was shortlisted by the FA in their preliminary bid dossier submitted to UEFA for the tournament, but United subsequently announced plans to review Old Trafford's future.",
      "After discussions between United and the FA, it was agreed that the stadium would be removed from the list of potential host venues as guarantees could not be made for its use in 2028.",
      "United have since decided to rebuild Old Trafford rather than redevelop the current ground.",
      "In 2023, United released a statement to confirm they had withdrawn Old Trafford from the list of potential venues, saying: “Manchester United was pleased to put Old Trafford forward as a potential host of UEFA Euro 2028 matches and proud of the strong case we made.",
      "“However, during follow-up discussions with the FA, it became clear that we were unable to provide the necessary certainty around availability of Old Trafford due to potential redevelopment of the stadium. As a result, we have mutually agreed to withdraw from the shortlist of potential hosts.",
      "“We are committed to maintaining Old Trafford’s status as the largest and most iconic club football ground in England and look forward to future opportunities to host international matches and major events at the Theatre of Dreams.\"",

      "Denmark manager Brian Riemer has challenged Patrick Dorgu to nail down a starting spot for his country.",
      "Dorgu started in Manchester United's opening two games of the Premier League season, however, he was dropped to the bench against Burnley before starting the next three games.",
      "Ruben Amorim dropped Dorgu again in a recent run of matches against Sunderland, Liverpool, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, preferring Diogo Dalot to start at left wing-back.",
      "Dalot struggled at the City Ground and Dorgu was recalled to face Tottenham last weekend.",
      "The 21-year-old has struggled to establish himself as the first choice on the left side at Old Trafford, and he is facing a similar predicament when he plays for Denmark.",
      "Speaking to Bold, Denmark boss Riemer explained: “It’s Patrick’s turn. He’s a player who deserves more playing time than I’ve given him. Based on his achievements, he could have received more playing time. But there is no doubt about Patrick's qualities. He is a player who has everything.",
      "\"His physique cannot be better, he is fast and aggressive. He has the whole package, but he is still a young man and therefore has not been in the difficult situations with decisive matches",
      "\"He has to listen carefully when we train. When you're young, you have to adapt. Because there's a big change in how we play and then the way Manchester United plays.\"",
      "He added: \"The situation regarding the left back on the national team is that the difference is very small. Patrick can, with good performances, cause me even more doubts in the future. That's also how football should be. No one should be self-made. If you play, it's because you've done well.\"",
      "United signed Dorgu from Lecce in the January transfer window for €30million (£25m), with a potential €5m (£4m) in add-ons.",
      "\"It was difficult and I was thrown into everything, but I feel I dealt with it good. I just try to bring a lot of confidence into this season,\" Dorgu said when he spoke in August.",
      "United believe Dorgu has the attributes to become a top player. \"I had interest from big teams in Italy as well, so it (United's interest) wasn’t a surprise,\" he said. \"If you're doing well, the big teams are going to look. I was surprised that they were really aggressive to get it done quickly, and I was really happy for that.\"",
      "The defender started just once for Denmark during the September and October international fixtures.",

      "Marcus Rashford was paid the ultimate compliment by those at Barcelona's 4-2 win over Celta Vigo after his two assists for Robert Lewandowski. The 27-year-old has now racked up 15 goal contributions in 16 appearances since joining the Catalan giants on loan from Manchester United.",
      "Alongside his corner being headed home by the Poland international to complete a hat-trick, Rashford created two big chances on the left. Lewandowski guided home his first cross into the box with Lamine Yamal benefiting from another of Rashford's passes.",
      "The latter did not count as a direct goal contribution with an attempted interception taking the ball into Yamal's path. Despite his influential role, Rashford missed some good chances to score and he also picked up a second yellow card of the season.",
      "That booking was not because of a bad foul though, with Rashford shown a caution for time-wasting when he slowly departed the pitch after being subbed off for Ferran Torres in the 88th minute.",
      "While it was likely done to run the clock down, Rashford's decision to slowly trudge off may have been done as he was taking in the applause with the travelling contingent all standing to clap his performance.",
      "It was not a faultless display by Barcelona though, with two goals conceded for the sixth time this season. Barcelona were far better in the second half however, which prompted Flick to be asked about that 45-minute outing specifically.",
      "\"I always think to say something about the experts, former players and coaches, but no, I will not do it,\" Flick revealed while smiling when asked in his post-match press conference if the second period was an example of how to execute his playing style.",
      "\"I'll give you too many things to speak about and it's too much noise! But, yes, for me it's like that. We will analyse this match like we analyse every match and try to make things better. This is our job. Not everything was good; we will speak about this.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"For me, the most important thing is [the players] have the confidence and belief in what we're doing and the second half is a good example of how we want to do it.\"",
      "On the overall performance, he added: \"Yes, [I am satisfied]. I appreciate a lot what I saw today. At the moment, it's like, especially in the first half, we made some mistakes, more than in the second half, and they use it. Two mistakes for the goals.",
      "\"But what I saw, also in first half, we controlled the game. It was a really good match with the ball, and especially in the second half, we defend much better.",
      "\"I think the second half gives us confidence also for the next matches. This is what we need. When you can make pressure on the opponent it's a good way. We did it. I like what I saw, especially in the second half.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring with an impressive header in the first half. Up until the last six minutes, the Reds looked like they were going to win the game but Mathys Tel's deflected strike and Richarlison's header put them on the brink of defeat.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's late header rescued a point as United made it five games unbeaten in the Premier League.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at some of the moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Spurs' reminder",
      "There's no forgetting what happened back in May when United faced Tottenham - and Spurs are making sure of it. Walking on the High Road side of the stadium, you pass one of the main receptions. Peak inside and the Europa League trophy is on full display with fans at 9am queuing for photos with it.",
      "It took the home supporters less than three minutes to chant ‘Champions of Europe, we know what we are’. That returned in added time before De Ligt silenced them.",
      "United defensive fluidity",
      "United were at their fluid best in the first half. When Spurs were in possession, United dropped into a back four with Luke Shaw pushing into a central midfield position.",
      "But he was not the only one to move positions. Harry Maguire found himself on the wing trying to cross into the box and at one stage Patrick Dorgu was almost in a centre-forward role as Bryan Mbeumo covered at wing-back.",
      "Fluidity is clearly what Amorim wants to see moving forward.",
      "Set-piece instructions",
      "Set-piece coach Carlos Fernandes was often on the edge of the technical area in the first half. Shortly before the break, you could see him barking instructions to United's defenders and he was clearly unhappy with one player's position as he flagged down Amorim to have a word.",
      "But Fernandes doesn't just dish out criticism. He was full of praise for De Ligt after one clearance and he will have been delighted to see the centre-back score from a corner at the death.",
      "Amorim’s Mbeumo instruction",
      "Not that he needs much encouragement but Amorim was keen to ensure that Mbeumo's levels did not drop against Spurs. He was quick to urge him to make forward runs whenever Amad had the ball.",
      "United looked at their most dangerous when they were playing direct down the flanks.",
      "Amorim warning before goal",
      "In the second half, Amorim sent a warning to his defence when they were leading 1-0 to ensure they stepped up. On this occasion it was Patrick Dorgu who had dropped too deep and he quickly moved up the pitch to ensure he was in line with his teammates.",
      "For Richarlison's late goal, Manuel Ugarte did not step up quickly enough to catch him out. When he watches the goal back Amorim will be furious.",

      "Sesko was introduced from the bench in the 58th minute at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, but he lasted just half an hour and was forced off the pitch after receiving treatment for a knee injury.",
      "United had to finish the game with 10 men because Amorim had used all of his substitutions.",

      "\"The English striker improved his pressing performance and delivered three corners that resulted in goals,\" read one passage from the newspaper's coverage. \"Rashford worked hard to press in defence better than in recent matches, outpaced [Oscar] Mingueza and ended up being decisive with three crosses that ended in goals, two to Lewandowski, one of them from a corner, and one that Ilaix [Moriba] deflected and Lamine Yamal finished.\"",
      "The same analysis praised Rashford's \"excellent passing ability\" and explained how crucial his pressing was in disrupting Celta's flow. Meanwhile, El Pais emphasised that Rashford was \"the Barcelona player who is taking on defenders most often when he receives the ball at his feet.\"",
      "The publication also described the Englishman's \"superb\" delivery to Lewandowski for the decisive goal at 2-1. Sergio Carreira's early equaliser kept the contest level for much of the opening period, with Borja Iglesias again restoring parity before half-time.",
      "However, it wasn't entirely positive, as Sport highlighted the attacker's \"unforgivable mistake\" when he squandered a clear one-on-one opportunity against Celta goalkeeper Ionut Radu. That error proved particularly costly at the time as Carreira netted his equaliser immediately from the subsequent Celta breakaway.",
      "\"He [Rashford] had time, space, and every option, but his finish was weak, almost a pass to the goalkeeper,\" read one excerpt. \"The clearest chance of the match evaporated without consequence...or at least, without the desired one.\"",
      "Yet another section of the same publication celebrated Rashford for the contributions that did prove effective. His \"exceptional attacking performance\" was considered especially impressive given Lamine Yamal endured a difficult opening half in Vigo.",
      "Sport's evaluation put the Englishman on a pedestal: \"Rashford was a constant threat from the start of the match. He wasn't clinical with his first scoring opportunity, and in fact, Celta's first equaliser came after the England international squandered a one-on-one with Radu that could have put Barcca 2-0 up.",
      "\"However, this setback didn't faze Marcus, who ended up having a magnificent game and being the originator of three of the team's four goals at Balaidos. His crosses for Lewandowski's second and third goals were impeccable, and the Polish striker made the most of them.\"",
      "Rashford, whose long-term future in Catalonia is still far from certain, enters the international break having registered at least one goal or assist in seven of his previous eight league appearances. England manager Thomas Tuchel will be hoping to see this form continue when the Three Lions face Serbia and Albania in their forthcoming fixtures.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Scott McTominay has urged Napoli to sign Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window, with the Scotland international speaking to Antonio Conte about his former teammate.",
      "Mainoo has fallen drastically down the pecking order at Old Trafford under Ruben Amorim. After being a regular last term, the 20-year-old has played just eight games so far this term.",
      "Amorim has preferred Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in midfield in Premier League games, with Mainoo coming off the bench in seven of the first 10 games. However, he was an unused sub in the 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest and was left out of the squad entirely against Tottenham, due to a knock.",
      "With United already out of the Carabao Cup and not playing European football, Mainoo's minutes are expected to be limited until the January transfer window, which could place his World Cup hopes in doubt.",
      "A temporary move has been tipped ahead of the reopening of the window, with Napoli strongly linked. Previously, it had been reported that the Italian champions would be willing to pay his full salary to bring him to Naples.",
      "Now, The Sun have reported that McTominay is doing all he can to reunite with Mainoo in Serie A. The 28-year-old left United in 2024 and scored 12 goals in his first season, winning the Scudetto.",
      "Sources have told the outlet that McTominay has informed Conte that he should sanction a move to sign Mainoo. \"Scott has been to see Conte and told him to get Kobbie,\" the source said.",
      "\"He's told him all about his strengths and what an outstanding player he is. He knows all about him from his time at United and thinks he would be a great addition to the squad, whether it's on loan or a permanent deal.",
      "\"Kobbie has been brought up the right way at United having been in the academy since he was a little boy. He would fit straight in and give Napoli a boost.\"",
      "In a recent interview, Amorim admitted there simply isn't room for Mainoo in his squad. \"Every minute we are using to prepare the future with a lot of games and less training,\" Amorim told beIN Sports.",
      "\"We are giving a lot of information, we are working on our fitness because we need to keep momentum during the week with good training, really intense.\"",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘prepared to pay’ a huge fee to fend off competition from rivals to sign Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest.",
      "Anderson has been a revelation since joining Forest from boyhood club Newcastle United ahead of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "The 23-year-old started his career as a winger, but he has quickly developed into one of the best defensive midfielders in the Premier League.",
      "The Forest standout has broken into the England squad and looks likely to start for The Three Lions alongside Arsenal star Declan Rice at next summer’s World Cup.",
      "Before this tournament, Anderson could secure a move away from Nottm Forest, as he is attracting interest from several Premier League clubs.",
      "Man Utd is among the clubs linked with Anderson and they are known to be in the market for a new centre-midfielder.",
      "READ: Man Utd should face striker transfer ban until they sign a midfielder",
      "The Red Devils are in the market for a new No.6 as they need to sign a long-term replacement for Casemiro, though they had a move for Brighton star Carlos Baleba fall through in the summer over his reported £100m valuation.",
      "United did not have the necessary budget to complete this deal as they had already spent around £230m to sign Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens, though a midfielder is likely a priority for Ruben Amorim and Co. next year.",
      "Now, a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims Man Utd are ‘preparing to pay’ 100 million euros (£88m) to sign Anderson next year.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Manchester United are undergoing a midfield rebuild and have identified Elliot Anderson as a fit profile: young, promising, and an England international. Sources within the club confirm that Anderson is their “number one target” to strengthen the midfield.",
      "‘The player’s willingness is also highlighted: sources close to the situation state that Elliot Anderson would welcome a change of scenery and joining the ambition of a big club like Manchester United, a fact that could tip the scales in the negotiations.’",
      "It has also been suggested that the Red Devils could sign another new attacker in January, as Sesko is currently out of action with a slight injury, while Mbeumo and Amad Diallo will soon be unavailable as they will compete at the African Cup of Nations.",
      "Therefore, a report from Football Insider claims Man Utd have been ‘forced into a complete transfer U-turn’ as they may ‘have to sign a striker’ in the winter.",
      "The report claims: ‘Sources say that the Red Devils will have to sign a striker in January if Sesko has sustained a long-term injury.",
      "‘Of course, the January transfer window is notoriously difficult to do business in, with clubs unwilling to let their star players leave. If United are forced to sign a striker, then they may have to settle for an option further down their shortlist.’",
      "Casemiro’s revival has got Manchester United out of their midfield hole. But Ruben Amorim cannot afford to gamble on the Brazilian carrying the Red Devils into Europe.",
      "TEAMtalk can reveal an offer is being prepped for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson from Manchester United in January.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are hoping to complete an audacious double deal in January as they target Elliot Anderson and Jarrad Branthwaite.",
      "Former Man Utd winger Lee Sharpe insists that the Red Devils should look to upgrade Diogo Dalot with the defender “sloppy in his decision-making”.",
      "Crystal Palace, Everton and West Ham are definitely at risk as we rank the top ten non-Big Six stars most likely to secure an upwards transfer to a giant in ...",

      "",
      "It’s bad when you’re ranking the latest long winless start to the season which has seen you have to bin off the manager you’ve just given a brand new contract against your club’s other long winless starts to the season which have seen them have to bin off the manager you’ve just given a brand new contract.",

      "In football, as in comedy and indeed life itself, timing is everything. And this season Newcastle’s timing is absolutely terrible.",
      "It started in the summer, with a mess that was not particularly of their own making but a mess nonetheless. The late-summer explosion of Alexander Isak Saga was terrible timing.",
      "There is no good time for that kind of shenanigans, but your man Macbeth had it right: If it were done when ‘tis done, then ‘twere well it were done quickly.",
      "Shakespeare scholars remain divided on whether the daft Scottish over-thinker had protracted transfer sagas specifically in mind there, but there’s no doubting that once the outcome of the Isak caper was clearly not going to go Newcastle’s way, it would have been far less painful had it all played out earlier in the summer. Had Newcastle had time to put a proper plan in place.",
      "We’ve all had our fun at the saltiness pouring out of Bayern Munich’s unhappiness at Newcastle paying such crazy money for Nick Woltemade, because Bayern believe they have a divine right to hoover up all good German players should they wish to do so. But they did have a little bit of a point. It was a wild amount of money spent in a wild fashion.",
      "He isn’t really the right profile of striker for Newcastle’s football, but his purchase was one of pure desperation. A transfer about optics as much as it was about football. Newcastle had to look like they were doing something to address the cavernous hole being left in their gameplan, even if what they did wasn’t really a great idea.",
      "It is to Woltemade’s enormous credit and just in general quite funny that despite it all, and despite Newcastle’s wider struggles, that he has fared at least as well as and in several cases – including above all Isak’s – far better than any of the other big-money final-piece-of-the-puzzle strikers signed over the summer.",
      "But Newcastle’s bad timing in the summer has reared its head again. If challenged to sum up Newcastle’s Premier League season in a word we would, until the last couple of weeks, have gone for ‘nondescript’. Not good, not bad, not particularly noticeable one way or the other.",
      "They hadn’t had the same result in successive games and were kind of chugging along in that big pack of teams in mid-table. The eye-catching stuff was coming in the Champions League and in their Carabao defence.",

      "Early 1-0 leads at West Ham and Brentford have ended in consecutive 3-1 defeats. That’s bad enough, but doing that right before the November international break when there is literally nothing happening and two weeks of dead air simply must be filled with any old sh*te?

But nowhere is that more profound right now than at Liverpool, who were riding high at the last update having just beaten Arsenal and apparently up and on their way to at the very least fighting to retain their title.",
      "They’ve got none of that now. Having somehow contrived to lose five of their last six Premier League games they have slipped all the way down to eighth. And to add to the embarrassment, that means now sitting below the Big Six’s two resident banter clubs, Spurs and Manchester United, even after a weekend where those two both spent their time being too daft even to pull off a win against the other.",
      "The worst thing for Liverpool, really, is that the run of bad results has felt far more compelling than the run of good results. That five-game winning run that kicked off their title defence involved far too much seat-of-the-pantsery. Had it been delivered by anyone other than the champions themselves, nobody would have been particularly taken in by wins that so often required desperately late goals and quite often getting out of jail after throwing away leads in ridiculous circumstances.",
      "Their recent run of defeats, though? That’s felt far less forced. Sure, it’s also involved some more late drama, but generally a side outplayed and outthought. And it’s a wide variety of sides they’ve now shown themselves vulnerable against.",
      "If you’re losing deservedly in successive weeks against set-piece merchants Brentford and open-play snobs Man City, it does start to feel like this could be a you problem.",
      "The failure to launch of Liverpool’s new-look attack has attracted plenty of headlines, understandably given the vast sums of money chucked at it, but the more significant problems have occurred further back. Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate are both struggling, performing way below previous levels. Milos Kerkez has found the Premier League far harder at Anfield than he did at the Vitality.",

Despite being entirely ill-suited to that, and very obviously much less suited to it than a Spurs squad that couldn’t do it by the end. Even the success Postecoglou did enjoy with Spurs in the Europa League involved, towards the end, precious little of anything that looked much like Angeball.",
      "By the time Forest came to their senses, Postecoglou’s winless run had plunged them so deep into a relegation fight that having been hubristic enough to believe they were above such mundane concerns had to accept they had no other concern at all. A season that should have been about trying to take the next step up the ladder towards English football’s actual elite with a really capable squad is now all about avoiding relegation under the ultimate firefighter himself, Sean Dyche.",

Two successive wins from behind have not yet lifted them out of the relegation zone but have at least taken them out of the deepest doldrums and offered, for the first time this season, a compellingly plausible roadmap under Nuno Espirito Santo to avoiding catastrophe this season.",
      "And a catastrophic relegation really did appear to be West Ham’s fate during a harrowing start to the season where even vaguely competing – never mind winning actual points – appeared entirely beyond them.",

      "Outside the relegation zone and not having had to change managers just yet at the November international break is definitely a position Burnley would’ve taken if offered it in August, but this is not the fortnight you want to spend stewing on defeat in a six-pointer at West Ham.",
      "The sight of Nottingham Forest also becoming less silly at the same time is another problem for Burnley, a club that knows however well they do their fate will be inevitably intertwined with just how silly certain numbers of other clubs are being. And West Ham and Forest really were being very silly for a good while back there.",

      "This kind of predictable unpredictability is great for the rest of us, especially with Fulham apparently unable to deliver their usual sterling work on this front this season, but probably gets a bit annoying after a while for fans. It could be a lot worse, obviously, but beating the teams they’ve beaten and not even having a top-half spot to currently show for it does feel a bit daft.",

      "We’re being very harsh and perhaps extremely greedy here but… should Palace actually be doing a bit better?",
      "Sure, they’re in the middle of the greatest period in their entire history, but it has now become slightly incongruous to see a team and manager who have had their balls so relentlessly tickled for so very long now sitting in mid-table below some very, very stupid clubs.",
      "They are obviously a very good team with a very good manager doing very good things. But they are still tenth, and that just feels vaguely underwhelming somehow.",
      "Which itself, of course, is pretty strong evidence for the extent of Palace’s recent overachievement. This is the club that famously finished 12th every year with 40-something points. That exceeding that already feels a little meh does highlight just how good they’ve got. And how fast.",
      "",
      "Got to laugh, haven’t you? They are really, really trying to be a sensible team under a sensible manager, but it just refuses to happen. Still impossible to know whether they are or will be good under Thomas Frank, still not much easier to know what ‘good’ actually looks like for Spurs this season. What’s the actual aim? The point?",
      "That long-awaited trophy win has brought so much joy but robbed the club of what had become its driving focus over the last few years. Throw that into a club in such a state of on-field and off-field flux, and the uncertainty and instability is understandable. The fans aren’t just at a loss to know what constitutes success this season; in a post-Levy world they don’t even know where to aim their ire if they don’t get it.",
      "How much the swirling uncertainty plays a part in their wildly differing home and away form is hard to measure, but it feels too clear to ignore altogether. Only rock-bottom misery-bound Wolves have a worse home record than Spurs. Nobody has a better away record.",
      "It does seem unlikely that both those things remain true for long; the key will be which moves more compelling toward the other. It’s Spurs so we don’t really know – and we genuinely wouldn’t bat an eye at the sight of them finishing fifth or 15th this season – but you the nagging suspicion is that it’s the away form that will shift most.",
      "That’s what the eye test and data all suggest. Another good Spurs bit this season is that they remain relentless xG botherers. According to the boffins they should have scored way fewer and conceded way more goals than is in fact the case.",
      "Now significantly overperforming their xG is nothing new to Spurs. Historically it’s been because, in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, this profoundly silly club possessed two of the most profoundly sensible finishers. When your two main goalscorers both consistently, year after year, exceed their xG then it should come as no surprise that a) you as a team will exceed your xG more often than not or more widely that b) playing with that outcome in mind becomes not just understandable but advisable.",
      "All perfectly logical and explainable. So how do we explain what’s happening now? How do we explain that a team that struggles to create pretty much anything is still wildly exceeding its xG while its most reliable finisher is a f***ing centre-back?",
      "And the only explanation that really works is, simply: Spurs, that.",
      "",
      "We couldn’t understand them as a football club, so we simply stopped trying and started treating them as something else.",
      "Which is fine everywhere except here, because how to rank the mood at so unfathomable a club? Third in the league and not technically out of title contention despite themselves is pretty good, though, and especially for a team that clearly has levels it’s not yet reaching.",
      "They’re not even as inconsistent as you think they are, not really. The defeat to Sunderland was maddening and avoidable, but it’s also the only defeat in a nine-game run across three competitions that features seven wins. The draw in that run? A really daft one as well, obviously, against Qarabag in the Champions League.",
      "They do appear determined to just chuck one of those games in every now and then to keep us all guessing, keep us all on our toes.",
      "",
      "A couple of hefty defeats, at Manchester City and then particularly at Aston Villa, have just harshed the buzz a bit for the Cherries, but from where they were in the summer to where they are now is still pretty crazy.",
      "We’re not sure anyone should really be able to cope with losing the players Bournemouth have lost with so apparently few consequences. This led us to believe some kind of witchcraft was involved, and we now believe losing 4-0 at Aston Villa to be an over-cautious act of misdirection and deception designed to put us all off the scent.",
      "It won’t work, Andoni. We’re entirely crazy, and you’ve just if anything made us more suspicious. We’re watching you.",
      "",
      "So, are they good now, or what? We demand to be told.",
      "Our gut feeling is that they still aren’t actually good, but they are no longer at least actively bad. They’ve been slightly fortunate at various points across this redemptive run of results, and quite how much they’ve benefited from the gentle luxury of a one-game-a-week schedule granted by their own incompetence might become clearer in December when they join everyone else in overindulging through the Busy Festive Period.",
      "But look, two months ago you’d have been laughed out of town even for proposing the question ‘Are Man United good now?’ so the progress is real and undeniable. And it’s very, very funny that they are above Liverpool in the league table now.",
      "",
      "We are in full hands-up mode here, because we thought they would be absolutely buggered without Thomas Frank and a great many of their best players and having entrusted their continued Premier League security to a rookie manager.",
      "Instead, turns out they are absolutely fine, and that promoting the set-piece coach was a genius idea because, if anything, they’ve just got even better at scoring from set-pieces. Can already count Aston Villa, Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle among their victims this season since defeat at Nottingham Forest on the opening weekend of the season, already a strong contender for most deceptive result of the season.",

      "It’s already been a season of two halves for Aston Villa, which is a decent effort really when we’re not even a third of the way through the thing.",
      "For six games it really was bleak, the disappointment at how last season ended bleeding into a moribund start to this campaign, one in which five of their first six games ended either 0-0, 1-1 or a 1-0 defeat with the one exception a 3-0 paddling from Crystal Palace.",
      "It really did look and feel like something coming to an end. A bold and often brilliant attempt to disrupt the established Premier League elite under the astute leadership of Unai Emery, a manager who really quite recently found a club battling against relegation back to the Championship.",
      "Didn’t feel at all right that it might happen with nothing tangible to show for it, Villa having bollocksed some pretty presentable trophy opportunities, including but not limited to last season’s FA Cup and the Europa Conference League the year before – a competition not even West Ham had managed to West Ham up.",
      "But now, 10 games and eight wins later? All is once again well and the positive vibes are there for all to see. They’ve started beating decent teams in compelling fashion, even if the two defeats during that run are curiosities – against mid-crisis Liverpool in the Premier League and at Go Ahead Eagles in the Europa League.",
      "That Europa League defeat feels particularly incongruous, sitting as it does between deserved wins over Spurs and Man City in the league but also in stark contrast to what we think is in fact responsible for turning Villa’s season around.",
      "European football can be a curious beast. It can be both benefit and burden, often in the same season and occasionally even at the exact same time.",
      "Villa and Newcastle are not remotely the same club, but they are essentially trying to achieve the same thing: muscle in on the big boys’ turf. And we really don’t think it’s entirely a coincidence that they keep alternating Champions League status at the expense of both each other and whichever Big Six clubs happen to be in the process of fumbling about at that particular time.",
      "Newcastle are doing perfectly well in the Champions League, but its toll is already visible on their doom-spiralling league form. And ‘success’ in a competition you have no realistic chance of actually winning isn’t really worth it when your domestic form suffers.",
      "Villa, by contrast, are in the very winnable indeed Europa League which changes everything. There is not the same stress or toll on the same group of players. There is greater scope for personnel changes and the greater possibility that success in one competition boosts the other rather than the reverse.",
      "We’re not saying Villa are better off out of the Champions League, because who knows how different their summer might have looked had they made it. There’s also the financial implications of which tournament you’re in, which for Villa – who continue to fly close to the PSR wind – are more significant than their rivals.",
      "But missing out on the Champions League isn’t all bad. Spurs fans were widely mocked for ‘celebrating’ their Arsenal-scuppering defeat to Man City that may have cost them a Champions League place. A year later, they won the Europa League.",
      "There really is absolutely no reason Villa can’t go and do the same this season, and even if they don’t the Europa League has already had a positive kick-starting effect on their season. That divide between the bad and good parts of their season to date sits conveniently but not coincidentally on the moment their Europa League campaign began.",
      "And there really is every chance for things to get better yet, with Leeds, Young Boys, Wolves and Brighton to come in the first couple of weeks after the international break, before what does admittedly look like an absolute tw*t of a December where they have to play Man United, Chelsea and for some reason Arsenal twice.",
      "",
      "Something is happening. They’re still going to need a bit of help from Arsenal, but something is happening. They are the last club Arsenal would want to see looming over their shoulder, and Arsenal the club City would feel most confident pursuing.",
      "For both clubs, there is just so much muscle memory at play.",
      "The likelihood remains that City do come up short and that will mean a previously unthinkable two consecutive seasons without the title for Pep Guardiola. But even if that does happen, he appears reinvigorated and engaged again with the challenge of turning a new-look squad playing a slightly different version of Pepball into challengers once more.",
      "For so much of last season, Guardiola just clearly wasn’t enjoying himself or the challenge as City’s season collapsed in on itself around this time last year.",
      "At that point, there appeared a very good chance he wouldn’t even still be in charge of City this season, never mind back challenging at the very sharpest end of the title race.",
      "And history does tell us that if Pep’s City are in the title race at all, they generally come out on top.",
      "It still seems pretty clear that Arsenal are the best team in the country, but City and Pep know better than most that title races involve more than just that.",
      "",
      "You couldn’t blame them if some old memories are resurfacing, some wounds reopening. Their first dropped points – and first conceded goals – in ages happening the same weekend Man City produce a statement mauling of Liverpool to cut the lead back to four points.",
      "It’s understandable, when you’ve finished second for three seasons in a row, that nagging doubts are par for the course.",
      "But really, there is no need to be alarmed. A 2-2 draw at Sunderland is a far better result than might have been expected to be the case. Plenty of good teams will go there and lose before the season is out.",
      "And Arsenal are still clearly the team to beat in the title race this time. They have comfortably the best defence, an elite midfield and an attacking method that boils p*ss yet gets the job done with confirmed regularity.",
      "They have the deepest squad by far among the contenders as well as the most sustainable, repeatable method. For all the moral panic about set-piece goals, the only valid criticism is about becoming too predictable and reliant. But Arsenal are no more reliant on set-piece goals than City are on Erling Haaland ones.",
      "And that draw at Sunderland draw was moments away from being to our mind the perfect result. Had they managed to win 2-1, having gone behind, with open-play goals, away against a really decent team, it would have answered so many questions – fair and unfair – while also shutting down the noise around clean sheets and all-time defensive records before they became a distraction from the main business at hand.",
      "Right now it really does feel like the season where Arsenal end that wait for a trophy, and that really should involve winning (at least) one of the big two given the way they’ve started both at home and in Europe.",

They’ve just given Arsenal as good a game as anyone this season, with the first half at the Stadium of Light perhaps the best anyone, anywhere has yet played against the champions-elect.",
      "And they’re doing it time and again. There’s no longer any mystery to them being as high up the table as they are; they’re just playing that well.",
      "They’ve already pretty much taken relegation off the table, and while it’s fun to compare them to previous promoted sides they’ve already surpassed, it’s also now largely pointless. To consider this Sunderland team in terms of what promoted teams can or should achieve in their first season. How Sunderland compare to Southampton is simply no longer relevant.",

      "Manchester United have five central midfielders to choose from, and in the two midfield roles in their 3-4-2-1 system, they generally use the same two men. Bruno Fernandes has played the most of any of those options, and Casemiro the second most.",

      "Blues insider Simon Phillips has revealed that Mainoo’s name is cropping up at Stamford Bridge, after they held talks with his agent in the summer.",

      "Though Mainoo isn’t getting much game time at Old Trafford at the moment, the Red Devils won’t want to strengthen a direct competitor, and after not allowing the midfielder to leave in the summer, it feels unlikely he’ll be given the nod to exit now.",
      "Mainoo will be desperate for something to change, though, having only started one game all season – against Grimsby in the League Cup – while 45 minutes is the most he’s played in a single Premier League game this term.",

      "Notable examples are the likes of Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and of late, Kobbie Mainoo.",

      "Amass, 18, has played seven times for United’s senior side, and is currently out on loan at Championship club Sheffield Wednesday – his parent club are paying his full wages to give him opportunities – where the left-back has scored once in 11 games.",
      "While Wednesday are struggling towards the bottom of the table, Amass has been a shining light.",
      "There have been suggestions of a recall in January, but the Sheffield Star‘s Alex Miller has reported discussions over the left-back’s future are ongoing after a discourse began at the weekend.",
      "Rob Staton has since revealed Amass will not be recalled, with the expectation being that he stays for the rest of the season.",
      "Speaking to the Star, the left-back is clear on what he needs to do during his loan spell.",
      "He said: “It’s about going back as a better player.",
      "“At the moment I haven’t really thought too much about it even though it is coming. I just want to play in the games and a lot of stuff has happened higher. We’re waiting for things to get straightened out and we’ll sort it out closer to the time. But at the moment I’m just enjoying playing here.”"

      "He had a successful loan spells at Preston, and then moved to Granada for another loan, before United lost faith and sold him to Benfica for around £5million.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says a poorly ear was to blame for Jadon Sancho’s struggles under him at Manchester United but can’t put his finger on why Marcus Rashford “didn’t enjoy himself” at Old Trafford.",
      "Solskjaer oversaw 149 games as United manager between March 2019 and November 2021 before being replaced by Erik ten Hag, and was pushing the club to sign Sancho for much of his time at the helm, eventually persuading them to sign the winger for £73m from Borussia Dortmund in the summer before the Norwegian was sacked.",
      "Sancho has never caught fire at United and has since returned to Dortmund on loan, before temporary switches to Chelsea and now Aston Villa.",
      "And Solskjaer, who is currently out of a job having been sacked by Besiktas after just 29 games, has claimed that Sancho being hospitalised with an ear infection just before arriving at United meant he was unable to get the best out of him.",
      "Speaking to The Overlap, Solskjaer said: “We wanted to take the next step — not move away from what we had, but add something different in the final third.",
      "“We wanted players who could break teams down, and Jadon, with his skill, link-up play, and little passes around the box, gave us that.",
      "“He was unlucky, though. Before he joined, he went on holiday, as you do, and ended up getting an ear infection.",
      "“He was in hospital and really struggled for his first 10 days or so before he could even start training with us.",
      "“That hasn’t really come out before. So, yeah, I never really got to play with him properly, because by the time he was finding form again, I was already on my way out.”",
      "While Sancho struggles to make an impact at Aston Villa, Rashford thrived under Unai Emery at Villa Park in the second half of last season and now he United loanee is pulling up trees in Barcelona, contributing six goals and nine assists in just 16 games for the Catalans, who are sure to take up the option to make his loan permanent for £30m at the end of the season.",
      "And Solskjaer, while admitting that Rashford “didn’t enjoy himself” at United, can’t work out any one reason why.",
      "“I’ve not spoken to Marcus since I’ve left, I text him a little bit but circumstances,” he said while appearing on Stick to Football.",
      "“I don’t know what’s happened in his life but you can see he’s certainly enjoying it now in Barcelona.",
      "“It looked like he didn’t enjoy himself here. I don’t think that’s just Man United [not enjoying it], it’s everywhere.",

      "Sancho has had an awful time of it at Old Trafford following his £73million move in 2021. We’re now into the fifth season since then and the winger has spent time away from United in three of them.",
      "He’s been on loans back to Borussia Dortmund, as well as to Chelsea and Aston Villa, meaning he’s played just 83 games for United, in which he’s been directly involved in 18 goals.",
      "In his current spell at Villa, Sancho has failed to score or assist in eight games, and was substituted off after coming on as a sub in the win over Manchester City.",
      "With his loan set to last all season and Sancho’s United contract up beyond that spell – with an option for a one-year renewal – insider Pete O’Rourke has speculated on the Red Devils’ thoughts.",
      "“If he’s not part of United’s plans going forward, maybe it is best that they just cut their losses on him and everybody can move on and Sancho can go and put down roots at a new club as well because, undoubtedly, there’s a top player in there,” he told Football Insider.",
      "“His time at Man United, they spent big, big money on him, around £70million. It just doesn’t work out for either party.",
      "“He spent most of his time at Old Trafford alone. He had a loan spell at Dortmund, Chelsea and now Villa. I think really now United are probably thinking it’s probably best for them to let him go on a free transfer and get those wages off the book.”",
      "There have been suggestions that that is the route United will go down, with the only other option to recall him from his loan and sell him, but that would of course require a side to register their interest in him.",
      "There is an intriguing option for Sancho, a return to Dortmund, but they don’t want to spend a fee on him.",
      "Indeed, a separate Football Insider report has revealed that Dortmund are keen on re-signing the winger, but only if he becomes available on a free.",
      "They would surely be one of the first sides he’d look at if he does become available, knowing the wages on offer there would be decent, if not what he was making at United.",
      "Sancho has obviously had success at Dortmund previously – directly involved in 120 goals in 158 games, including three goals and three assists in 21 games during his last loan, after he’d struggled at United.",

      "It’s the last and dullest international break of the year, with January around the corner, so the sudden uptick in players being linked with Manchester United is absolutely and unavoidably inevitable.",
      "Conveniently for the gossip-mongers (yes, we know), Benjamin Sesko sustained an injury against Tottenham at the weekend.",
      "The instinctive reaction to any such blow is to look to the market for a replacement. Endrick, perhaps?",
      "That, of course, ignores the obvious solution to a problem that does not yet exist.",
      "Ruben Amorim has a number of options within his squad to replace Sesko as the frontman. Either Matheus Cunha or Bryan Mbeumo could play up instead of off, while Joshua Zirkzee still exists, even if he could be away in January.",
      "Even if none of that were true, United should be banned from signing anyone who identifies as anything other than a midfielder until they have filled the gaping hole in Amorim’s squad.",
      "The manager, now a year in post, is finally seeing some shoots of positivity after a chastening 12 months which many did not expect him to last.",
      "But that good work could yet be undermined with one tackle or tweak, or anything that leaves Amorim without Casemiro.",
      "For numerous reasons, it is astonishing how important to United that Casemiro has become once more. Barely a soul outside of the Brazilian’s family thought he wasn’t finished, and even some of his relatives probably agreed that ‘the football had left him’.",
      "Now, though, Casemiro has regained the influence he enjoyed on United through his first season in 2022/23. It is not just that United are currently a better team with the 33-year-old, it is how much worse they become without him.",
      "MORE: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",
      "This was hoped to be Manuel Ugarte’s breakout season having had a year to settle following his move from PSG, but Amorim’s admonishment at the end of his first campaign does not seem to have registered.",
      "To play in the base of midfield, that only leaves Kobbie Mainoo, who Amorim really does not fancy for the role. It feels wrong to write – given Mainoo’s obvious class – that there is no place for the academy graduate in Amorim’s box midfield. Perhaps there is a glimmer of hope from reports that Amorim is also spending time on drilling United in 4-3-3, but given the manager’s fanaticism for three at the back, Mainoo seems destined only ever to be a bit-part player under Amorim. In which case, for his sake, he needs to get away.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is doing a stellar job in a role that doesn’t suit his best attributes either but, quite simply, if you manage Manchester United, you find a way to play Fernandes.",
      "Beyond Casemiro and Fernandes, Amorim is out of options. Certainly of the quality necessary to take United back into Europe, which is what will define the season, and the manager, as a success or failure.",
      "In which case, in the unlikely event he isn’t already, Amorim needs to be badgering his board for the midfielder they knew they needed in the summer but never bought.",
      "With it being such an obvious flaw, there are plenty being linked with the Red Devils with less than 50 days until the window opens.",
      "Elliot Anderson. Adam Wharton. Carlos Baleba. Joao Gomes. Conor Gallagher. Alex Scott. It’s not that any will do. But it almost is.",
      "Of course, United’s scouting department don’t work on that basis, despite previous impressions to the contrary. They will identify the best, most suitable target. Then almost certainly decide he’s too expensive and, therefore, unattainable in January.",
      "And they may be right. It would take obscene offers for Palace to part with Wharton or for Forest to flog Anderson in January. Prices are hardly likely to tumble in the summer, especially if either England international makes a positive impression at the World Cup. But their clubs, you would think, would be far less motivated to sell mid-season.",
      "So a stop-gap may be necessary and United should not be too proud to admit that. Casemiro will be out of contract next summer so by then they would need two midfielders anyway. Even if they are prepared to wait until after this season for their primary midfield target, they still need one to avoid a wholly unaffordable gamble to make it to May.",
      "Until they source that midfielder, given how these huge recruitment departments are seemingly incapable of doing more than one thing at once, United should be thinking of nothing else.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘prepared to pay’ a huge fee to fend off competition from rivals to sign Elliot Anderson from Nottingham Forest.",
      "‘This feels like a seismic moment in England’s planning for next summer’s World Cup’, apparently. Does it f***.",
      "Liverpool have learned their chances of a blockbuster January move for Semenyo amid strong new claims that he asked to leave Bournemouth.",
      "Are Liverpool speedrunning Manchester United’s descent into a banter club? They have spent a lot of money to get this rubbish.",

      "Diogo Dalot has been blasted for not being good enough in attack or defence for Manchester United by a man who really, really hates “high fives”.",
      "Dalot is now one of the longest-serving players at United having joined the club as a 19-year-old in 2018 and only Bruno Fernandes has played more minutes under Ruben Amorim than the full-back.",
      "Capable of playing on the left or the right, Dalot has started seven of United’s 11 Premier League games this season but was dropped for Patrick Dorgu for the trip to Tottenham after his less than convincing display against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Dalot is often seen celebrating tackles and defensive work, and congratulating teammates for their contributions, and former United full-back Paul Parker isn’t a fan of the Portuguese star’s cheerleading.",
      "“Dalot’s making far too many mistakes, unnecessary mistakes. He’s more interested in high-fiving people when he makes a tackle than actually doing his job properly,” Parker told Metro via online casino Unibet.",
      "“So, high-fives don’t win you games of football. By the time you’ve done your high-five, they could have actually bounced off of your great tackle and gone and scored a goal. So, high-five at half-time or after the game. So, no, you can’t trust Dalot there.",
      "“You’re not getting enough quality in the final third from him as well. He doesn’t do enough defensively. He switches off too much, his clearances are poor, very poor, that’s one reason.”",
      "Explaining his penchant for high fives and fist bumps, Dalot once said: “Us defenders, we don’t score goals too often, so these are our little goals during the 90 minutes.",

      "Parker also took aim at midfielder Manuel Ugarte, insisting Amorim must “keep him on the bench” rather than using him to save Casemiro’s legs late in games.",
      "“He hasn’t done that well,” Parker said. “I quite liked him because he was a breath of fresh air when he arrived, someone who wanted to run around and he got stuck in, very rarely lost possession even when under pressure.",
      "“But when he comes on now, United concede. They generally concede. At best they start to be under pressure, and that’s because of someone like Casemiro’s coming off for him. So, at the moment in time, if I’m the manager of Manchester United, no need to make systematic changes.",
      "“Full-backs might change, but the middle stays the same. Get continuity in that midfield. Even when things are going okay and you’re 1-0 up and the team look comfortable, they can be more comfortable.",

      "Good for them, their managers, their clubs and for us watching, but not good for those players who have reaped the reward of their absence through increased game time.",

      "But the £40m summer signing did produce two excellent and very different assists in that game, dinking a delightful cross in for Malo Gusto with his right foot and then embarrassing Santiago Bueno with some very impressive dribbling at speed before squaring the ball for Pedro Neto with his left.",
      "Enzo Maresca has nothing but good things to say about Garnacho’s work-rate in training and in games, which is entirely at odds with the views of former boss Ruben Amorim, and the Argentina international has been clear of Jamie Gittens in the Premier League pecking order even while returning to peak match sharpness having missed out on a proper pre-season at Manchester United.",
      "But Cole Palmer will soon return from injury, obviously plays in Chelsea’s best team as Chelsea’s most influential attacking player, and we have Garnacho as the player to make way.",
      "Enzo Fernandez has been excellent in the No.10 role in Palmer’s absence and Chelsea look far better with Moises Caicedo and either Reece James or Romeo Lavia in the pivot behind him. Which means Palmer may revert to the right, where he has arguably been at his most devastating for Chelsea anyway.",

      "Amorim can be credited with the 30-year-old’s uptick in form, for playing him on the left of his three centre-backs to save his patched-up Lego legs, and for his man-management of a player whose produced his best form under those who nurture and hail his good qualities rather than calling him a big ol’ fatty a la Jose Mourinho.",
      "“Luke Shaw is a world-class player,” Amorim said in July amid talk over Shaw leaving the club. “That is my feeling. You can feel it in the small things; when he touches the ball, the ability to play one against one.”",
      "It’s not at all clear who Amorim would favour between Shaw and Lisandro Martinez, who is now back in training, as they have never been fit at the same time in Amorim’s year-long stint.",
      "And feels like a choice between the seven out of ten, know-what-you’re-getting Shaw and more of an X-factor player in Lisandro Martinez, who’s a man for big moments but can also make horrendous ricks, particularly when not having played for a while.",
      "Amorim doing “something different” against Tottenham, which paid off until he made a mess of things with his substitutions, suggests he’s (finally) reached a point with this United squad where he can be slightly more adventurous, and Martinez represents a risk which admittedly could rock the boat too much but could also be a point of difference to take them to the next level.",

      "Only Caoimhin Kelleher and Jose Sa are below Mamardashvili in the Premier League goalkeeper ranking, and we suspect we would have to go back an awfully long way to find a Liverpool player with less than 0.6 points per game (PPG). Alisson has 2.5 PPG this season.",

Not actually the winner though, despite a celebration to the contrary, and he also missed – not just the goal but the ball – when handed a huge chance to open the scoring in the first half and has nothing close to Haaland’s goal record besides to merit his inclusion in the team.",
      "Thomas Frank’s problem is that Tottenham appear to have signed a collection of strikers who were at one point billed as stars of the future but are undergoing a collective mask-slip in north London to expose them as overrated frauds.",
      "The degree with which Randal Kolo Muani doesn’t want to be at Tottenham is comical and Mathys Tel’s sole method of scoring goals is via massive deflections, meaning Richarlison is essentially keeping his place by default until Dominic Solanke returns.",
      "Frank didn’t fancy Solanke before his ankle injury, handing him only brief substitute appearances in the two Premier League games for which he was fit at the start of the season. But while the 28-year-old is far from a polished finisher and we suspect a new striker will be high on Spurs’ list of priorities in 2026, he at the very least occupies defenders and opens up space for the players around him, and something is better than the nothing Richarlison typically provides.",
      "",
      "It’s difficult for us not to allow our appreciation for Eze – we love the guy – to influence our opinion of him. Everything he does on a football pitch, including for Arsenal this season, looks so gloriously effortless and we can’t help but be drawn to him on the basis of everything he does and says off it too. What a guy.",
      "But, but, he hasn’t been all that great, has he? It’s too early to tell if his relative lack of impact at Arsenal is down to their style in comparison to that of Crystal Palace, but Mikel Arteta is very unlikely to persist with an aesthetically pleasing footballer as a manager who’s all about getting the edge over teams by any means possible.",
      "Martin Odegaard was a bit pants last season compared to his standout displays the season before, but he was back at his peak against Olympiacos, splitting them open at will, before this latest injury. And remarkably the captain has 19 shot-creating actions in just 294 minutes of action this season, compared to Eze’s 27 in 1,147 minutes.",
      "In a presumed bid to score more goals from open play, the reintegration of Odegaard to the starting line-up is surely key, and we saw nothing from Eze on the left to suggest he’s a better bet than either Leandro Trossard or Gabriel Martinelli on that flank.",

      "But we would suggest that calling Patrick Dorgu “a dud” reflects far worse on Piotr Sadowski, who worked as a scout at United before his departure in August 2024, and those who decided to lean on his opinions for seven years at the club, than it does on Dorgu himself, or whoever made the wise call to send Sadowski packing, if indeed that’s how his exit transpired.",
      "Dorgu was the first signing made under Ruben Amorim when he joined from Lecce in a £29.2million deal in the January transfer window, and when it was put to Sadowski that the 21-year-old might be an example of unsuccessful recruitment by Amorim, he replied: “A dud, I definitely agree.",
      "“And he was brought in for €30 million. Honestly, having recently worked at Blackburn Rovers and operating on a much lower transfer budget, I would have had no problem finding a few players at Dorgu’s level for Manchester United, but not for €30m, only up to a maximum of four.”",
      "The comments have the pang of an embittered former employee who refuses to accept a quite evident improvement in recruitment at Manchester United under Amorim.",
      "In search of “a dud” to prove his point he couldn’t pick any of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo or Senne Lammens as they’ve all been frustratingly competent, Benjamin Sesko has flop potential but it’s probably too early and Sadowski may very well have recommended his signing as United’s Central European scout, which leaves Dorgu as the only option for his lazy, unfounded take.",

      "According to FBRef, vs full-backs in Europe’s top five league’s this season Dorgu’s in the 74th percentile for shot-creating actions, the 79th for key passes, the 81st for progressive carries and the 99th for touches in the opponents box.",
      "For those of you crying foul at an unfair comparison as Dorgu’s played at wing-back ad not full-back, he’s also in the 86th percentile for interceptions and the 91st for tackles won. He’s essentially an excellent one-on-one defender who gets forward and creates chances regularly.",
      "And it’s not as though those stats are painting a picture of Dorgu different to the one we’re seeing – and we suspect Sadowski isn’t seeing – when watching Manchester United games. He’s a talented young footballer who may be the long-term solution at left wing-back for United. He also might not be. Time will tell.",

      "Man Utd ‘consider it urgent to make a significant improvement in that area as they prepare for what could be a major rebuilding process’ with the Red Devils ‘well aware that their current squad lacks the rotation and freshness needed to compete at the highest level’.",

      "The report adds: ‘The English club is prepared to invest in one or two players who can guarantee an immediate impact. However, Manchester United are also proceeding cautiously: reports indicate that the team will not make any hasty signings in January but is waiting for clear opportunities.’",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano recently brought an update on potential moves by Man Utd for Gallagher and Stiller, he said: “Conor Gallagher could be an opportunity, but Atletico Madrid didn’t want to let him go in August.",
      "“So let’s see what happens in the January window. Angelo Stiller is also a player they appreciate from Stuttgart, but I don’t see a German club selling one of the stars in the January window at all.",
      "“So January is not going to be easy. It’s going to be about opportunities in the summer could be different. And for sure, Manchester United in 2026 will add again, at least one midfielder.”",

      "United are well versed in bringing young talents through into their first team. In times gone by, Gary and Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt all made their way to the first team through the academy.",
      "Of late, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho are some of the big names to have followed.",
      "The latter was prised away from Atletico Madrid, while more recent academy players to join from other big clubs include Ayden Heaven and Chido Obi.",
      "Now, United are being linked with a man being called a ‘prodigy’ by Sky Germany – Hertha Berlin midfielder Eichhorn.",
      "‘All of Europe’s top clubs’ are said to be interested in Eichhorn. There are 11 named in the report, in the Bundesliga, there is: Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, RB Leipzig and Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Elsewhere in Europe, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and United are said to be keen.",
      "The market for Eichhorn is said to be ‘unprecedented’ with his release clause activated in the summer.",
      "Eichhorn is the youngest player in Bundesliga 2 history and has played nine games this term, showing there is faith in him to perform in senior football.",
      "That said, he’s not awfully high on any stats compared to older players in the league. His best asset has perhaps been recovering the ball, which Eichhorn has done 3.6 times per game so far this term.",
      "He does commit a lot of fouls though – 15 already this season, which has led to five yellow cards and a suspension.",
      "It is unlikely that he’d be thrown immediately into senior football if he made a move to a big club, and his performances against players his own age have seen him standout, so he’d surely be a great asset in academy football.",
      "Playing as a defensive midfielder, in four games for Germany under-17s so far, Eichhorn has scored twice, with both goals coming in a 4-0 victory over Luxembourg.",
      "It feels likely that if Eichhorn continues to perform for the under-17s side – which he has captained in every game he’s played – the midfielder will be given opportunities in the older teams.",
      "Where he ends up in club football currently remains to be seen, but the German is in a good position with some big sides after him."

      "Despite that interest, the Scotland international is ‘very happy with life in Italy’ and Napoli ‘don’t want to put him on the market at all’.",
      "Naples journalist Vincenzo Credendino explained earlier this year why McTominay has flourished under Conte, he told the BBC: “Conte changed his system to put him in the best conditions to play.",

      "“It’s not a coincidence. McTominay is perfect for Conte as Conte is perfect for McTominay.”",

      "The Red Devils’ goal output has improved this season but Sesko’s performances have been disappointing with just two Premier League goals to his name in 11 appearances.",
      "Sesko picked up a knee injury in their 2-2 draw against Tottenham at the weekend with fans worried that it could be a serious ACL injury.",
      "However, Fabrizio Romano yesterday insisted that it isn’t his ACL and that Sesko’s injury won’t be a “super long one” like “six, seven, eight months”.",
      "Romano wrote: “We are still waiting for an official statement from Manchester United, but my understanding is that the injury from Benjamin Sesko is not a super serious injury. So, it’s not an injury that is going to take, I don’t know, six, seven, eight months to see Benjamin Sesko available on the pitch again.",
      "READ: Ruben Amorim authority rising on one-year anniversary at Man Utd",
      "“Well, let’s wait for the final test made by Manchester United, the medical staff. So, we wait for an official statement, but the initial feeling after the injury from Manchester United staff at the moment is quite positive.",
      "“So, it’s not going to be a super serious or long one. It’s going to take some time, but it’s not going to be a super long one.",
      "“And so, that’s a positive news for Manchester United, of course, and also could have an impact on the January transfer window because Ruben Amorim after the game said, ‘Let’s see about the injury of Benjamin Sesko. Maybe if it’s a serious one in January, we might have to do something in that position,’ but at the moment, again, doesn’t look like an ACL injury, so a super long one.”",
      "There had been rumours that Man Utd could sign a new striker in the January transfer window anyway with Joshua Zirkzee rumoured to be on his way out.",
      "Brazilian striker Endrick has been one of the names mooted but now Brazilian outlet Globo Esporte has claimed that ‘it’s only a matter of time before Endrick joins Lyon for the final stretch of the 2025/26 season.’",
      "It is understood that ‘the French club is already exchanging drafts with Real Madrid to expedite bureaucratic aspects of the contract to be signed at the end of the year’.",
      "The report adds: ‘Negotiations began in the second half of November, and from the very first moment, the 19-year-old welcomed the transfer to France . Not even the recent interest from Manchester United, following the injury of Slovenian Benjamin Šeško, changed Endrick’s mind; he seeks a leading role and playing time to fulfill his dream of representing the national team at the World Cup.’",
      "Brazil head coach Carlo Ancelotti revealed that he advised Endrick to speak to Real Madrid in order to work out what his best move was for the second half of the season.",
      "Ancelotti said recently: “Yes, I spoke with him (Endrick) at the beginning of this season. He was injured, but now he’s fine, back, and he has to think with his entourage about what’s best.",
      "“Talk to the club, to see what’s best for him. Endrick is very young, this won’t be his last World Cup. He could play in the 2026 World Cup, because he has the quality for it, but he could also be in the 2030 World Cup, or the 2034 World Cup, and maybe even the 2038 World Cup.”",

      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "A quite silly 2-2 draw against Forest was probably a bigger setback for that lad off the internet whose long-overdue haircut is once again as far away as ever than it was for Amorim, who was backed when things were going appallingly and isn’t about to get canned now they’re going really quite well. Could probably have done without another silly 2-2 draw at Spurs to follow it, but at least it wasn’t yet another defeat against a Spurs team that has become the scourge of the Manchester clubs for some reason.",

      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 20Premier League games, and just one from six very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. The absolute state of that moribund defeat to Chelsea raised the stakes. A thumping Champions League win over Copenhagen and a very stupid draw against Manchester United is probably just about enough to keep him out of the international break firing line.",
      "",
      "Four points from two games against Manchester United and Leeds has given Forest the lift they badly needed and leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair.",

      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable and leaves Liverpool languishing in eighth.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "Hitting the November international break outside the bottom three does feel like it counts as mission thus far accomplished, but defeat in a six-pointer at West Ham has removed all wriggle room.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and what is now officially an iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. League position can mislead given the congestion behind Arsenal and a bloated mid-table, but Newcastle are now closer to the bottom three than they are to 13th-placed Everton, and whatever the mitigation that just won’t do.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest. It’s deep trouble now.",
      "",
      "We still think they’d regret it if they pull the trigger, but it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbles up in what’s shaping up to be a really bad season to lose your mid-table mojo.",
      "And the November international break is never a good time for a manager to reach looking as short of solutions as Silva has in recent weeks.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘monitoring’ a left-field No.6 target as a new midfielder is a ‘priority’ for the Premier League giants.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly ‘chuckled privately’ at the suggestion that he and Ange Postecoglou were in the same situation after Tottenham beat Manchester United to the Europa League, making a “bigger ...",

      "Ruben Amorim smashed a television ‘with tears forming in his eyes’ after a Manchester United loss, which saw the respect of his players grow as they ‘totally understood his strength ...",
      "Even Ruben Amorim might have doubted that he would make it through a year at Man Utd. But the manager reaches his anniversary feeling more empowered than ever…"

      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

      "Ross Barkley",
      "A seemingly shrewd addition to Unai Emery's squad when signed for just over £5m from Luton Town in 2024. Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.",

      "Marcos Senesi",
      "In the absence of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, following their moves to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, Senesi has become a fundamental cog in a Bournemouth side battling for a spot in the top five of the Premier League this season.",

      "Adam Smith",
      "The 34-year-old signed a one-year extension with the club in 2024 but is now approaching the end of his deal with the Cherries. Smith joined permanently in 2014 and was labelled a Bournemouth \"legend\" in the statement confirming his previous deal.",

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",

      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo left Manchester United after his second spell came to a sour end following a bombshell interview in 2022; the Al Nassr forward says, despite an upturn in form at Old Trafford the Premier League club is not on the right path and needs to change",
      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""
