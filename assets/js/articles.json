      "Kobbie Mainoo and Michael Carrick after the win over Manchester City(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Ruben Amorim didn't deserve to be sacked according to some people. But in the space of one Manchester derby, Kobbie Mainoo proved that the Portuguese's dismissal was the right decision.",
      "Amorim, for whatever reason, decided to neglect one of the best young midfielders in English football during his time at Manchester United. He saw him as a deputy for Bruno Fernandes - who doesn't need one because if he's fit, he plays - and nothing else.",
      "His decision felt bizarre and criminal in equal measure. And in the end, it became self defeating, because Amorim no longer has a job at Old Trafford. Of course, Mainoo does.",
      "Amorim's treatment of Mainoo - who had risen to prominence under Erik ten Hag to the extent that he was promptly promoted into England's senior squad for Euro 2024 - left the boyhood United fan disillusioned and wanting to leave.",
      "Imagine that. Wanting to leave your hometown club, the one you supported as a child, the one which scouted you at the age of six and signed you at the age of seven.",
      "Mainoo had spent the last few weeks speaking to Napoli. He, like the rest of the world, hadn't failed to notice how former team-mate Scott McTominay has taken his game to new levels with the Italian champions, under the guidance of Antonio Conte. He was keen to do the same for himself.",
      "With Amorim ruining his season, he know his chances of being named in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the World Cup this summer were getting worse by the day.",
      "However, the Serie A side can forget about signing Mainoo now. He has forgotten all about moving to the Amalfi coast. His focus is back on the club of his heart, and thriving at home once more.",
      "Mainoo reminded everyone what a top class player he is during United's destruction of Manchester City at Old Trafford on Saturday. He was the epitome of composure and class in a high-octane game, again looking like the player who held United together at times in his breakthrough season and started for the Three Lions in the final of Euro 2024.",
      "He was the outstanding midfielder on the pitch, one which included Fernandes and Ballon d'Or winner Rodri. So good was Mainoo, Rodri was insignificant from start to finish.",
      "And all of this in his first league start of the season.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo looks reborn following the sacking of Ruben Amorim (Image: Neal Simpson/Allstar, Getty Images)",
      "It's understood Michael Carrick spoke to Mainoo after being appointed as interim manager, telling him that he would be a part of his plans between now and the end of the season.",
      "Telling him to focus on re-establishing himself in the United team.",
      "And telling him to prove Amorim wrong.",
      "Within 90-plus minutes, he has done just that.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness cost Mainoo half a season. He can't get that back and it might be too late for him to impress Tuchel enough to take him to USA this summer.",
      "However, at a time when United are in serious need of some more genuine quality in midfield - but seem unwilling to send the money to get it - the fallen giants will feel like a new signing has arrived shown up again.",
      "Mainoo does not turn 21 until April. He has a long, potentially brilliant, career ahead of him. And United should make sure the bulk of it is with them - whatever happens in the dugout.",

      "Raheem Sterling has not played this season at Chelsea(Image: OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Chelsea may have changed the man in the dugout, but they haven't changed their feelings towards Raheem Sterling as of yet.",
      "The winger has endured a miserable spell since signing from Manchester City in 2022 and was frozen out under Enzo Maresca. Liam Rosenior is now in the hotseat and he's already admitted he will need to have a discussion with the Englishman sooner rather than later.",
      "Sterling's form at Stamford Bridge has not justified a recall and the quality available to Rosenior means there is no guarantee that Sterling would even get into the starting XI, but clarity is needed on both sides.",
      "The winger has Napoli weighing up a move, according to Sky in Italy, but the player himself would rather stay in England where his family are settled. Sterling was once among the Premier League's top performers, excelling under the guidance of Pep Guardiola in Manchester.",
      "With England he was a shining light, scoring match winners at Euro 2020. Now he's nowhere near the Three Lions picture, he's nowhere near the Chelsea picture. A fresh start may be beneficial for all involved, even if it means making some difficult decisions.",
      "Sterling is one of a number of players who turned out that night at Wembley against Italy, coming agonisingly close to ending the country's wait for a major trophy. Some of their age profiles would suggest they are approaching, or would be in, the absolute peaks of their careers. Instead, just getting onto the pitch is hard for some.",
      "Kalvin Phillips has just turned 30. The midfielder was a mainstay alongside Declan Rice during that tournament, all whilst becoming an iconic figure at Leeds. He was named England's Player of the Year in 2021. His rise was such that he was faced with a decision - stay with Leeds or challenge himself at City.",
      "Kalvin Phillips was on top of the world during Euro 2020(Image: Getty Images)",
      "He made the move, but taking on Rodri at the base of Guardiola's midfield was always going to be a daunting task. And so a player who looked so at ease in the final of a Euros is now in danger of becoming a forgotten man. Loan spells at West Ham and Ipswich have done little to reignite his career.",
      "Phillips has more than two years left on his contract in Manchester but is another man who must think that the Euro 2020 final feels like a lifetime ago.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho both appeared from the bench that night with their contributions in the penalty shootout well documented. The two men are showing that loan moves can have very differing outcomes with Manchester United needing to decide what to do with them.",
      "Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford are both likely to depart Old Trafford(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Sancho had signed for the Red Devils 10 days prior to that Euros final. He arrived off the back of several stunning years in Germany with Borussia Dortmund, where goals and assists were weekly occurrences. At Manchester they have eluded him and he's been sent back to the Bundesliga, out to Chelsea and now is playing a squad role at Aston Villa.",
      "England never saw the player Dortmund did - and neither did Old Trafford. At 25 he has a decade at the top if he can ever rediscover his top form, but that will certainly be away from United after a £70million move that failed to work out.",
      "Rashford's future equally lies away from Manchester. That was a decision taken by Ruben Amorim, but one the club look to have stuck by even after his exit. The danger for United is that their academy graduate goes on to be a huge hit elsewhere, possibly Barcelona. His form in Spain currently means that a spot in England's World Cup squad this summer is not out of the question.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer always spoke highly of Amad Diallo(Image: Photo by Kacper Pempel - Pool/Getty Images)",
      "When Manchester United spent £37million on 18-year-old Ivorian winger Amad Diallo from Atalanta, it's fair to say there were a few raised eyebrows around Old Trafford.",
      "\"It is not for me to pick them apart publicly. We wanted to play to our strengths. The two wide lads, Amad and Dorgu, were fantastic both ways.\"",
      "United legend Wayne Rooney, like Carrick, also praised the work rate of Dorgu and Amad over the weekend. He said: \"I thought Amad and Dorgu on the wings were excellent, the work rate they put in to help the full-backs out and they got into a compact shape, which I spoke about, and hit Man City on the break.\"",
      "Like Carrick and Rooney, former boss Solskjaer also thinks highly of Amad. During his time at United, Solskjaer had targeted Erling Haaland, Declan Rice and Moises Caicedo, all of whom would walk into the current United side, but one player he did get his hands on was Amad.",
      "Solskjaer tipped Amad for a bright future from the very beginning, shortly after signing him. \"As a club, we have followed Amad for a number of years, and having watched him myself, I believe he is one of the most exciting young prospects in the game,\" he said.",
      "\"Manchester United has such a proud history of developing young players and everything is in place to enable Amad to reach his potential here.",
      "\"It will take time for him to adapt but his speed, vision and fantastic dribbling ability will stand him in good stead to make the transition. He is a player with all of the raw attributes that are needed to be an important player for Manchester United in the years to come.\"",
      "Amad Diallo has been a solid player for Manchester United(Image: Photo by Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Amad is also a player that Carrick has previously praised at United. During his other spell as United caretaker in late 2021, the 44-year-old worked with the winger for the first time.",
      "Then, when Amad was on loan at Sunderland and Carrick in the hot seat for Middlesbrough, Amad scored the decisive second goal in the 2-0 win and earned praise from Carrick afterwards.",
      "\"He does what he does,\" said Carrick at the time. \"He's really talented, Amad. Good in tight spaces and does what he does with the ball.",
      "\"For the goal, that's what he brings and I think that's what he's maybe brought a bit more is his end product from when I knew him when he was a little bit younger a couple of years ago. He's doing really well.",
      "Further praise saw Carrick brand him a \"terrific footballer\" and observed that the winger had \"jumped a level again\"",
      "Amad also thinks highly of Carrick, too, noting the importance of donning the ex-England international's jersey. He said: \"When I was told that I was getting the No. 16 shirt, I was happy because I know that Michael Carrick had previously worn that shirt for a long time and so it is a number worn by a legend of the club. So I have to respect the number and the players who wore it before me.\"",

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford scored as his Barcelona side lost 2-1 on Sunday(Image: Getty)",
      "Marcus Rashford found the net as Barcelona succumbed to defeat against Real Sociedad on Sunday. The Manchester United loanee was introduced just past the hour mark in the 2-1 loss.",
      "The English ace joined the Catalan giants in the summer of 2025, having lost his place under then-United manager Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford. He made a blistering start, but in recent weeks his involvement in the team has diminished with key player Raphinha recovering from injury.",
      "Barcelona's Brazilian talisman was missing on Sunday when Rashford's side faced Real Sociedad away from home, but Fermin Lopez was chosen on the left wing from the start. The hosts took the lead after 32 minutes and Barcelona were struggling to break them down despite creating excellent chances.",
      "In the 62nd minute, Rashford was brought on by manager Hansi Flick and made an immediate impression. He nodded home a leveller less than 10 minutes later. Though Real Sociedad would exploit a defensive mistake and grab a decisive winner shortly afterwards, Rashford's contributions were praised by the Spanish press, with one outlet discussing the 28-year-old's future.",
      "Barcelona controlled Real Sociedad on Sunday, registering an impressive 23 attempts compared to their opponents' five. But despite crafting numerous opportunities, it was only Rashford who managed to breach the hosts' goal.",
      "Marca were fairly restrained in their post-match assessment of Rashford and noted: \"He came on in the 62nd minute. Seven minutes later, he opened the scoring with a pass from Lamine [Yamal]. He also hit the post.\"",
      "However, it was prior to kick-off that Marca opted to discuss the prospect of Rashford making his Barcelona stint permanent. They continued: \"There are two players the club are already counting on and wants to secure for the future. One of them is Marcus Rashford.",
      "Rashford bagged his side's only goal in the defeat(Image: Getty)",
      "\"The club are satisfied with his performance and the plan is to exercise the purchase option they have in place for £26million at the end of the season.\"",
      "Rashford delivered a statement with his strike in the 2-1 defeat, demonstrating he remains a crucial player for Flick's team and boosting the likelihood that Marca's assertion about a summer move will materialise.",
      "The Catalan giants struck the frame of the goal an incredible five times on Sunday night in a defeat that meant they lost ground in the race for the La Liga crown. Real Madrid now trail by just one point.",
      "Mundo Deportivo, nevertheless, highlighted Rashford for his impact from the substitutes' bench against Real Sociedad and stated: \"He was the only Barcelona player to put the ball in the back of the net and make it count.",
      "\"When Rashford and [Robert] Lewandowski entered the pitch, the onslaught intensified. Playing like this, Barcelona will score goals and string together more victories.\"",
      "Barcelona missed endless chances on Sunday(Image: Getty)",
      "The Barcelona dominance was also highlighted by AS, who like most other publications, were swift to focus on Rashford, who was the sole player capable of breaching the Real Sociedad defence amidst the bombardment.",
      "\"There's a raw beauty in winning when your opponent dominates you, at least in the first half and the beginning of the second,\" they penned. \"Barcelona controlled the football, while Real Sociedad provided the heart and the command.",
      "\"Flick made substitutions, bringing on [Joao] Cancelo, Rashford, and Lewandowski, more in an attempt to change the game than to improve the performance. Barca finally broke down the wall thanks to another gift from Lamine Yamal, which Rashford headed home.\"",
      "The Englishman sent a message with his header(Image: Getty)",
      "Sport were equally generous in their praise of Rashford's display and noted that he could have secured a double in second-half stoppage time had it not been for another strike of the woodwork. Such widespread acclaim also bodes well for Rashford's potential permanent transfer.",
      "\"He kept hopes of getting points at Anoeta alive with a winning header and sent a cross against the post,\" Sport reported. \"He created everything he could, but it wasn't enough.",
      "\"Misfortune left Barcelona's 25 attempts largely barren, whilst Real Sociedad made the most of their far more limited attacking chances. The final opportunity fell to England's Rashford, who almost sealed his double in the 93rd minute, but it failed to come to fruition.\"",

      "Michael Carrick got off to a flying start at the helm of Manchester United, defeating derby rivals Manchester City 2-0 at Old Trafford. While this was a superb weekend for the club, the situation in the north west has been tense and negative in recent months.",
      "The new year started with the departure of Ruben Amorim from his role as manager, shortly after he launched a verbal attack on the powers above him. Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer said he didn't believe the United players were giving enough on the field for Amorim, when you look at the way they played against City over the weekend.",
      "Another person not shy of dishing out criticism to United players is former player Paul Scholes..",
      "During the build-up to the derby, Scholes became involved in a verbal battle with United's Argentine centre-back Lisandro Martinez. Scholes and Nicky Butt branded the Erling Haaland v Martinez battle a mismatch.",
      "Scholes winced when the match-up was addressed by him on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast. Butt responded: \"Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him. You know when you see a dad at school running down the road with a little toddler?\" before Scholes added: \"He’d score, then throw him in the net.\"",
      "United would go on to secure a famous derby victory and Haaland was kept at bay. Martinez had a superb game at the back.",
      "Then, Martinez addressed these comments in the post-match interview. \"Honestly, he [Scholes] can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants,\" he said.",
      "\"To my house, wherever. I don't care. And I think, for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television. But when you sit here face-to-face, no one says anything in your face.",
      "\"So, for me, I don't really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day.\"",
      "This is not the first time Scholes has clashed with a current United player. There was a previous occasion where an unnamed member of the first team squad asked for a private meeting with Scholes.",
      "Martinez isn't happy with Paul Scholes(Image: Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)",
      "\"Players can be a little bit touchy these days,\" Scholes explained on The Overlap in early 2025. \"I had a player (a United player), this year, who contacted me and wasn’t happy with some of the things I’d said.",
      "\"He wanted to meet me at the training ground, and I said, 'Of course, no problem', and gave him my number but he never got back to me. I would have done it.",
      "\"If I’m saying things I believe and he wants me to explain why, it wouldn’t have been a nice conversation. But I said if they or anyone else has a problem, there’s my phone number.\"",
      "Carrick's next challenge will see him take on lead leaders Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on January 25. After the victory against City, United are in fifth place and one point adrift of Liverpool.",

      "Officials at the broadcaster asked if the new man at the helm would do a pre-match interview direct with the studio before the Manchester derby. That would've created a scenario where Keane and Carrick would've interacted before the contest.",
      "Sky would get their interview, but it was conducted by Gary Neville in the tunnel, rather than with the studio, after United officials intervened, reports the Daily Mail.",
      "Earlier in the week, Keane branded Mrs Carrick \"a big mouth\" whilst speaking on the Overlap. His comments likely motivated by a social media post she made, and later deleted, after the Irishman had accused her husband of delivering a dour interview following a Champions League loss to Olympiakos in 2014.",
      "Twelve years ago, Carrick's wife had responded to Keane's criticism of the interview and posted on social media: \"Roy Keane what a **** will say anything to provoke a reaction.\"",
      "She was quick to delete it, but Keane clearly remembered it and referenced it last week after Carrick's appointment, stating: \"His wife can always come in (if Carrick doesn't do well), cause she's got a bit of a big mouth sometimes. She's probably doing the team talk.\"",
      "Carrick would enjoy the perfect start to his tenure at Old Trafford, masterminding a 2-0 win over Manchester City, which could've been even more convincing. The former player has been given the role until the end of the season, but already there is talk of him getting the job permanently if he can provide them with some direction and guide them into the Champions League.",
      "Keane has been critical of his former club turning to ex-players once again, and equally about the make-up of the coaching team. United have been down this route before, giving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the job before he was sacked after nearly three years in the role.",
      "Jonny Evans is among those to join the coaching staff, despite his lack of experience, which struck a chord with Keane. He said: \"Jonny Evans left Man United about four, five, six weeks ago right? He left in the summer as a player and they gave him a job as a loans manager. Leaves a month or two ago, had enough of that - not 10 years doing it, a few months.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has impressed at Napoli(Image: Giuseppe Maffia/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Napoli boss Antoino Conte has slammed Ruben Amorim for his 'arrogant' decision to cast Rasmus Hojlund aside at Manchester United. Hojlund, 22, was loaned out to Napoli in September after United signed three new forwards in the summer transfer window.",
      "The striker had spent two difficult years at Old Trafford following his £72million move from Italian side Atalanta. Hojlund managed 26 goals in 95 appearances for the Red Devils, but he's been more prolific since he returned to Serie A.",
      "Under Conte, the Denmark international has bagged nine goals in 25 games, as Napoli bid to defend the Scudetto and go far in the Champions League. Speaking before his team's 1-0 win at home to Sassuolo on Saturday, Conte was asked about Hojlund, and he took aim at Amorim, who United sacked earlier this month.",
      "\"Some young coaches nowadays are arrogant and don't want to adapt,\" the ex-Chelsea and Tottenham manager claimed. \"They see a young striker struggling and instead of training him, they blame him. They always complain and blame everyone but themselves, because everything is handed to them on a silver platter.\"",
      "Last month, Conte fired a dig at United regarding both Hojlund and Scott McTominay, who was sold to Napoli by the Red Devils in August 2024. \"Everyone used to say Rasmus didn't play in Manchester, neither did McTominay, so why?\" Conte asked. \"Ask yourselves some questions there. The staff and I had work to do, there is a reason we are here, after all.\"",
      "Napoli paid United a €6million (£5.1m) loan fee for Hojlund and if the Scudetto holders qualify for next season's Champions League, they'll be obliged to cough up €44m (£38.1m) to sign him permanently. Napoli's sporting director, Giovanni Manna, recently described the deal as a 'formality'.",
      "Napoli are expected to make Rasmus Hojlund's move permanent(Image: Matteo Ciambelli/DeFodi Images/DeFodi via Getty Images)",
      "\"There's an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League,\" Manna added. \"The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.\"",
      "Hojlund hasn't been on the scoresheet in 2026 but he'll be hoping to get off the mark when Napoli travel to his native Denmark on Tuesday. Conte's men resume their Champions League campaign against Copenhagen at Parken.",
      "The Danish giants occupy the final play-off spot with just two games of the league phase remaining. Napoli are one place above them but only via goal difference, making it a crucial match for both teams.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Toby Collyer is set to leave Manchester United on his second loan of the season(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The Michael Carrick era is off to a bright start after a 2-0 win over rivals City in his first game as Manchester United interim manager. Although this is in fact Carrick's third stint at the helm of his old club, this deployment carries more significance than his previous spells as caretaker.",
      "It's also the first time Carrick will have overseen a real transfer window in charge at Old Trafford. And that means the former England international has genuine scope to make some improvements to the squad over the next fortnight or so.",
      "After a heavy summer of spending and title prospects looking thin, investment was always bound to be difficult this month. However, United can still improve the first-team squad significantly through player sales, with new business being completed this weekend.",
      "One name bound for the Old Trafford exit is Toby Collyer, though only on temporary terms as Hull City look to sign the midfielder. Collyer spent the first half of this season on loan with West Brom but has since returned to United following some injury setbacks.",
      "The 22-year-old came back to his parent club on New Year's Day, with United announcing at the time he did so to focus on recovering from his latest injury. A little more than a fortnight later, he's back on the move to a different Championship after Hull manager Sergej Jakirovic confirmed a medical is set to take place before the weekend is over.",
      "\"With Toby Collyer we are waiting but I think we have a green light from Man United and I think he will join us on Monday,\" said Jakirovic this weekend. \"This is what I know but we have agreed everything with Man United. He will have a medical this weekend. He is now ready for training.\"",
      "The midfielder made 12 appearances for West Brom during his loan spell but was largely restricted to playing off the bench. He'll hope to play a more prominent role at the MKM Stadium, with Hull currently in fifth place and gunning for Premier League promotion.",
      "It may not be long before he runs into his old team, too, with Hull set to visit West Brom on March 14. Collyer came through United's academy as a revered youth talent and has 13 senior appearances for the Red Devils to date.",
      "Another United youth product on the move this winter is Sam Mather, who has left the club after 14 years. He's completed a move to Turkish club Kayserispor after struggling to open a pathway into the first-team ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "Kayserispor announced the deal on Saturday, bringing an end to his time in United's system. It's reported United have allowed the player to leave on a free transfer and will not receive a fee for his signature.",
      "\"After 14 years my time at Man Utd has come to an end,\" he said in his farewell statement. \"I would like to thank all the staff and players who have helped me become the person and player I am today.",
      "\"I will always be grateful for my time here and wish the club all the best. On a personal note it’s time for me to move forward and I can’t wait to get started!\"",
      "Mather, 21, won the FA Youth Cup at United in 2022 and was previously farmed out to Rochdale and Tranmere on loan. The winger scored 29 goals and recorded 23 assists with United's under-18 and under-21 teams but will leave United without a senior appearance for the club.",

      "Hansi Flick has put the spotlight on Marcus Rashford's attitude(Image: Javier Borrego/Europa Press via Getty Images)",

      "Paris Saint-Germain are the favourites to sign him, with Manchester City, Chelsea and Borussia Dortmund also linked. The midfielder has made five appearances under Flick, who gave him his first-team debut earlier this season.",
      "But Fernandez wants to quit Barcelona, who've been left stunned by his decision. Flick was visibly unhappy when discussing the situation in his pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday's clash with Real Sociedad.",
      "The German made it clear that he only wants players who truly want to be at Barca - like Rashford. Indicating that he wants to sign the forward when his season-long loan from Manchester United ends, Flick used Rashford's attitude as a shining example.",
      "\"Marcus' performances have been really good until now, so we have to manage it, but it's [sporting director] Deco's job do things for next season,\" Flick explained. \"We have to wait.",
      "\"We have months to go. For me, of course with Marcus we have a player on the top level, but also with our situation, and what I appreciate a lot from him [is his desire to be here].",
      "\"This is what I want to say to young players from La Masia: We are Barca and we are one of the best teams in the world. We give them the opportunity to train with us, to grow, to train with the best players in the world, the support and the confidence.",
      "\"If you want to play with Barca, then it has to be 100 per cent with your whole heart. This is what I want to say to everyone: 100 per cent. These colours, you have to live for them. All the others, I don't want.\"",
      "Dro Fernandez has decided to leave Barcelona(Image: Bagu Blanco/PRESSIN)",
      "The ex-Bayern Munich manager was so agitated that he had to bite his tongue when discussing Fernandez's imminent departure. \"I said before with Dro, if it's not done I will not answer this question, but it's football,\" Flick bemoaned.",
      "\"Sometimes it's like that, that, yes, you do not agree with what they are doing, but they are 18, they are old enough to make decisions, they have people around them. Of course, when I see like ... no, no, I don't want to talk anymore, it's enough.\"",
      "Fernandez joined Barcelona as a 14-year-old in 2022, drawing comparisons to team-mate Pedri and former star Thiago Alcantara. He made his Champions League debut in October, providing an assist as Barca thrashed Olympiacos 6-1.",

      "Harry Maguire was outstanding in United's win in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford(Image: Zohaib Alam - MUFC, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "If Harry Maguire does not win another cap, he can still look proudly back at a fine international career. He was almost talismanic in England’s run to the semi-finals of World Cup 2018 and was a key figure in the progression to the final of the Euros in 2021, scoring in the quarter-final win over Ukraine.",
      "He started every match at World Cup 2022 and has made 64 England appearances, scoring seven times - not a bad ratio for a defender. But his last match in an England jersey was under caretaker boss Lee Carsley way back in early September, 2024.",
      "Injuries have not helped his cause but it is clear he is not high in Thomas Tuchel’s defensive pecking order. But while the England manager is unlikely to make decisions based on one performance, Maguire’s outstanding display in the Manchester derby should put the 32-year-old defender back on the international radar.",
      "And it could well alter United’s stance on Maguire’s future. His contract expires at the end of the season and it had been strongly suggested he would be allowed to leave on a free transfer.",
      "But Michael Carrick is a massive admirer of Maguire’s and his decision to start him against City proved to be inspiring. Maguire made the headed clearance that started the breakaway move that was finished by Bryan Mbeumo and - along with Lisandro Martinez - kept Erling Haaland so quiet that Pep Guardiola substituted the Norwegian striker.",
      "Thomas Tuchel has yet to include Harry Maguire in one of his England squads(Image: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)",
      "Carrick was full of praise for Maguire, saying: “I felt it was a game for experience and knowing what it feels like. It was a big ask for H (Maguire) and credit to him. I think we can take for granted sometimes what players do but for him to play today and come through it …",
      "“I’m not going to lie, it was a bit of a calculated gamble on how long he could play and on whether he could get through it because he’s literally trained for two or three days for probably eight or nine weeks. So that just shows you what it really means to him. I thought he was fantastic.”",
      "Manchester United manager Michael Carrick is a big fan of Harry Maguire(Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "He was indeed, complementing a flawless defensive display with a couple of trademark attacking surges. He also came close to scoring early in proceedings with a header that crashed off the crossbar.",
      "In his last squad, Tuchel named five defenders who can operate centrally. Amongst those was John Stones but the Manchester City man has only started four Premier League games this season and has not been seen since coming on as a substitute in the 5-4 win at Fulham on December 2.",
      "John Stones has started only four Premier League games for Manchester City this season(Image: (Photo by Rene Nijhuis/MB Media/Getty Images))",
      "At the moment, it would seem Marc Guehi and Ezra Konsa are probably in the prime positions to start at World Cup 2026 but there are surely back-up slots up for grabs in the central defensive area. The likes of Jarell Quansah and Dan Burn - named in Tuchel's last squad - have not had trouble-free seasons.",
      "And if Maguire stays fit, he will almost certainly be a permanent fixture in the United line-up for the rest of the season. That should give Tuchel AND the Old Trafford hierarchy a very welcome dilemma.",

      "Paul Scholes mocked Lisandro Martinez in the build-up to the derby(Image: YouTube / The Good, The Bad & The Football)",
      "Paul Scholes has accepted the offer to visit Lisandro Martinez's house and voice his criticism in person after a heightening in tensions between ex-stars and current Manchester United players.",
      "Martinez was one of the stand-out players as United deservedly beat Manchester City 2-0 in the derby in Michael Carrick's first game as interim manager on Saturday. The Argentina defender got the better of Erling Haaland in his duel, despite the obvious mismatch in their heights.",
      "That came after the 5ft 9in centre-back copped some stick from ex-United midfielders Scholes and Nicky Butt. Butt joked Haaland “would pick Martinez up and run with him” like a “dad after school running down the road with a little toddler”, while Scholes added “he’d score then throw him in the net”.",
      "Martinez was asked about the comments post-match and said: “Honestly, he (Scholes) can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care. Everyone can talk on the television but when you sit here face to face, no one says anything in your face.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!** Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page**",
      "“So for me, I don't really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day.”",
      "Responding to a post of the quotes, Scholes wrote on Instagram: \"Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you... Tea, no sugar pls @lisandromartinezzz.\"",
      "Tensions between pundits like Scholes, Butt and Gary Neville have been growing this season amid the struggles for United under Ruben Amorim. But the arrival of Carrick as interim head coach produced an immediate impact as goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu gave them three points against City.",
      "Lisandro Martinez won the battle with Erling Haaland(Image: Getty Images)",
      "That is what Martinez really wanted to focus on when speaking to reporters. Asked if Scholes' comments give him extra motivation, Martinez said: “No, no, nothing. It doesn’t give me anything. My motivation is my family. That’s it.”",
      "He was full of praise for Carrick and his staff. “So different, so different. Different mentality, different guy,\" he said of the impact in training this week.",
      "“He knows what it really means, this club. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything. He’s a big legend. He wants to help the club and I think we were in a tough situation and today was the best moment to change that.”",
      "Martinez added: “When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it’s so different.”",

      "Ruben Amorim's potential successor at Old Trafford received a glowing endorsement from Ralf Rangnick(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United may count on Ralf Rangnick's glowing endorsement of Oliver Glasner should they attempt to appoint the Austrian as their new permanent boss. Following the sacking of Ruben Amorim earlier this month, the Red Devils promoted Darren Fletcher from his role as the club's U18 head coach to caretaker manager.",
      "Fletcher has since been relieved of the role with former team-mate Michael Carrick accepting the job on an interim basis until the end of the season. Several managers have been linked with the United job, with the Crystal Palace manager among the potential contenders.",
      "Glasner, 51, has enjoyed an impressive run at Selhurst Park since joining the club in February 2024, as he led the Eagles to their first-ever major trophy in the FA Cup last year. The honour meant they clinched European football while also winning the Community Shield in August by beating Liverpool on penalties.",
      "A move to Old Trafford this summer could be on the cards given Glasner confirmed his intention to depart the south London club at the end of the season, meaning United could get him for free. However, his time at Palace was said to be in danger of being cut short before even then with the club considering sacking him after his shocking comments after their 2-1 defeat to Sunderland on Saturday.",
      "While the manager's time with Palace may end on a bad note, either now or in the summer, his managerial ability was lavished upon by Rangnick, who served as United's interim boss from 2021 to 2022.",
      "\"For me, Oliver Glasner is currently one of the most exciting coaches - not only in Germany, but in all of Europe. An absolute top coach,\" the Austria national team boss told LAOLA1 in March 2023.",
      "Ralf Rangnick is a huge admirer of Oliver Glasner(Image: Getty Images)",
      "During Rangnick's reign as Red Bull Salzburg’s director of football, he was responsible for Glasner's coaching ascent when appointing him as Roger Schmidt’s assistant. Explaining his protege's rise in football, Rangnick explained: \"He developed step by step to where he is now, also because he made the right decisions.",
      "\"From his perspective, it was right to go to Ried, from Ried to Linz, from Linz to Wolfsburg. When you see what's happening with him and Markus Krosche at Eintracht Frankfurt, you can only take your hat off to him. This is a prime example of how a coach's career should develop. It couldn't have been written down better beforehand.\"",
      "For United fans who are wary that Glasner, like Amorim, prefers a back-three system, the Austrian previously compared his team to Amorim’s side and explained how such a system can be successful in the Premier League.",
      "The Crystal Palace sensationally lashed out at his club after their 2-1 defeat at Sunderland(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"We're playing the same system,\" he said earlier this season. \"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a good defensive structure with it. It's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are.\"",
      "A historic figure already in Palace's history, Glasner's frustrations reached breaking point after the loss at the Stadium of Light as he targeted club executives for their decisions to sell Eberechi Eze and Guehi.",
      "Speaking to BBC Sport, Glasner raged: \"I feel we are being abandoned completely. Because I can't play many players. They did everything they could and this has been going on for weeks and months now. And we have 12, 13 players from the squad available and we feel no support.",
      "Crystal Palace have lost Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi in consecutive windows(Image: The FA via Getty Images)",
      "\"The worst thing is selling our captain one day before playing a Premier League game. We are preparing, it's the first week we are training since September, and then we are selling our captain one day before a game. So I have no understanding of this.",
      "\"I have always kept my mouth [closed], but I can't because I have to defend these players, because it was the 35th game today. Yes we get under pressure here and we are unlucky. But again, you can't react, we can't help them, it makes it really tough tonight.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "After being asked who he feels \"abandoned\" him, Glasner answered: \"It's pretty clear, yeah? It's pretty clear. Again, I didn't sell anyone. If you get your heart torn out twice this season, one day before a game, it was with [Eberechi] Eze in summer, it was with Guehi now, you know?\"",

And Scholes simply puffed out his cheeks in mock exasperation, implying the contest would be a one-sided affair - and not in the Manchester United man’s favour.",
      "Butt joined in the fun, saying: “Haaland would pick Martinez up and run with him.” Scholes laughed: “He’d score then throw him in the net.”",
      "Alas, it did not quite work out that way. And after Martinez - with the help of central defensive partner Harry Maguire - had dominated Haaland to such an extent that the Manchester City striker was substituted by Pep Guardiola, the Argentinian defender made his feelings clear on the criticism that so often comes from ex-United players.",

      "Carrick responded in the best possible way, picking a team that never looked in any trouble against City and threatened to score almost every time a counter-attack was launched. And, tellingly, Martinez explained how Carrick has already transformed the atmosphere at the training ground after 14 months of Ruben Amorim.",
      "Martinez said: “So different, so different. Different mentality, different guy. He knows what it really means, this club. He sent us that message that he played here for a long, long time. He won everything.",

      "Rooney has never before publicly addressed his deafness, and it's still unknown when or for how long he has experienced this hearing difficulty.",
      "The former England skipper requested that a BBC crew member backstage at Match of the Day fit an earpiece in his right ear rather than his left.",
      "Gesturing to his right ear, he said: \"Can I do it in this ear? I used to close the talkback. The problem is I'm deaf in my left ear. So when it's too loud I struggle to hear what Kelly Cates [MOTD presenter] or whoever is saying.\"",
      "Rooney secured a lucrative deal with the BBC, reportedly worth £800,000 annually, to serve as a regular pundit on the show and started his own podcast after taking a break from management. However, he hasn't ruled out a return to the touchline in future.",

      "It was *only* the League Cup but Manchester United's victory against Newcastle United at Wembley on the final weekend of February 2023 felt like so much more. It was a first trophy in six years and came just days after Barcelona had been vanquished at Old Trafford. There haven't been many better weeks for this club in recent history.",
      "It really did feel at the time like Erik ten Hag had got it sussed - which in itself is a reminder that nobody should be getting carried away now - and there are a few scenes from that final that still linger in the memory. A couple of them feature Casemiro.",
      "Given the highs and lows he has experienced at Old Trafford since a £70million move from Real Madrid, it is easy to forget now just how good the Brazil international was in his first season. But it wasn't just the quality of his football that stood out, it was the whole package.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "At one point at Wembley, with United 2-0 up and the clock ticking towards half-time, Casemiro forced Joelinton out of play to earn a goal kick and celebrated wildly in front of the fans behind that goal. He turned back to the pitch and exchanged high fives and chest bumps with Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Then, with the game in its dying stages and the United fans already celebrating, Casemiro let rip at Bruno Fernandes for not passing. It was still 2-0, the game was done, but in the eyes of a five-time Champions League winner, the decision of Fernandes not to pass to a teammate in a better position was still worthy of admonishment.",
      "A few days later Ten Hag was asked about Casemiro and his answers told us a lot about why United had spent so much money on a player entering his 30s, a decision that would later be questioned by Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he put together his investment into the club.",
      "Ten Hag explained he had wanted players with \"character\" and \"personality\" in his first transfer window and said Casemiro was already the man who set the standards at United. His argument with Fernandes at Wembley showed that \"good isn't good enough\".",
      "\"For me it’s always the same, you have players who win, and who win always, and players who lose and are always losing,\" said Ten Hag. \"You have to do your research and find the type who will win and who are cooperative in the dressing room, to be humble, but when on the pitch they take responsibility.\"",
      "That summed up Casemiro at the time and although his influence waned when it appeared his legs had gone, his performance against Manchester City on Saturday was a reminder that at his best, he is still a setter of standards and a winner at heart.",
      "In May 2024, Jamie Carragher famously said of Casemiro that \"football's left him at this top level\". Over the past 18 months he has managed to rediscover it and prove he still has a role to play, but it feels like the clock is ticking on his United career.",
      "His contract expires at the end of this season and a renewal isn't looking likely at the moment. There is a one-year option on that deal which will be triggered if he starts 35 games this season, a tally he will hit if he starts all of the remaining 16 games. That is considered extremely unlikely and given the option would mean Casemiro's deal extends for another year on his £350,000-a-week salary if United are in the Champions League, it is almost impossible to see happening.",
      "If there is any chance of the holding midfielder staying, it is only on reduced wages, but as it stands, a departure at the end of the season seems most likely, although the churn in midfield could have a part to play in any decision. Bruno Fernandes' future is uncertain, as is that of Manuel Ugarte, who has interest from Europe this month and is yet to establish himself at United.",
      "It does feel like this might be the time to say goodbye, however. Casemiro turns 34 next month and United's midfield needs a rebuild. His salary has dropped to closer to £300,000-a-week due to the lack of European football, but that is a big sum that could be reinvested in a younger midfielder. It's more than £14million a season.",
      "There is no doubt he would be missed. As good as he was on Saturday, the Casemiro scenes that made their way to social media were after he had been taken off. He celebrated Mason Mount's disallowed goal by jumping on Michael Carrick's back and then running on to the pitch for a big embrace with Martinez.",

      "The Dutchman watched from the directors' box at Old Trafford as his team-mates secured a dominant 2-0 victory, which handed Michael Carrick a dream start to his interim role.",
      "United limited City to one shot on target and had three goals disallowed due to offside to seal the most impressive Manchester derby victory since the stunning win in the 2024 FA Cup final at Wembley.",
      "When Patrick Dorgu scored with 14 minutes remaining, Zirkzee was pictured celebrating in the directors' box alongside Matthijs de Ligt, Tom Heaton, Tyler Fredricson and Shea Lacey.",
      "United sources have confirmed Zirkzee's absence was due to a knock he suffered against Brighton. The 24-year-old was captured telling a fan outside Old Trafford that he would be sidelined for \"two weeks\", and it remains to be seen whether the issue affects his future in the final two weeks of the January window.",

      "When asked about Roma's interest in Zirkzee, he responded: \"Man Utd said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago and they have not changed their minds.”",

      "This decision was made out of necessity but Zirkzee enjoyed his best spell for United in that position as they made it to the Europa League final. In the summer, the Reds swooped for Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, pushing Zirkzee down the pecking order.",

      "In the build-up to the Manchester derby there was of course a lot of focus on Michael Carrick and the style of play he would look to bring to Old Trafford. Having only managed Manchester United previously for three matches as an interim in 2021, looking to that period offered few clues.",
      "\"If you don't have more info of the opponent, you focus on yourself and the players,\" Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said in his pre-match press conference. \"You can have some ideas of what Middlesbrough has done or when Michael was in his part as a manager at Man United but tactics is about the players.",
      "\"The players tomorrow are different to the Middlesbrough ones.\" If Guardiola were to cast an eye over Carrick's time in the north east in search of clues, it would have been a red herring. While United set up in the same 4-2-3-1 system Carrick played at Boro, their style was entirely different.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "While the Middlesbrough team Carrick forged were looking to dominate possession, United were happy for City to have the ball, safe in the knowledge they would be able to defend when the Blues picked their moment. The Reds had just 32 per cent possession - unheard of for a Carrick team.",
      "But it was exactly what United needed to do. Bernardo Silva said it himself after the match, the Reds 'took the game to where they are good,' and doing that proved successful. But that does not mean it was expected.",
      "United are coming out of an era where adaptation from the manager was not on the agenda. Ruben Amorim was set in his ways and would have kept playing in the 3-4-2-1 system until it eventually clicked or he was fired.",
      "Under Carrick, United don't look set to be so predictable. Another example of his flexibility came with his use of Kobbie Mainoo. After his appointment on Tuesday, Carrick's comments about the midfielder were back into the spotlight.",
      "\"He's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder,\" Carrick told Rio Ferdinand on his podcast.",
      "\"He's that line above where he needs a little bit more freedom. He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing completely.",
      "\"I see him playing that little bit higher and creating. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",
      "Those comments seemed to point towards only one outcome. And yet, Mainoo played 90 minutes in central midfield alongside Casemiro and it worked perfectly.",
      "Having a head coach, even in the interim, willing to make slight alterations to their philosophy for the good of the team is a huge positive for the Reds. It should ensure opponents are left guessing when they come to face United.",

      "But there’s definitely levels of standards and expectations that we need to live up to from ourselves as much as anyone on the outside. I’m totally aware of that. Consistency is the key to any success and if you can find that, then you’re on to a winner, so that’s our challenge.",
      "You’ve got to find a way of doing that. Big one next week [against Arsenal], obviously another tough one. But on the back of today, we’ve got a good foundation to build on.”"

      "Some people believe Ruben Amorim didn't deserve to be sacked. But in the space of just one game, Kobbie Mainoo has proved that Manchester United made the right decision for once.",
      "Amorim's decision to neglect one of the best young midfielders in English football felt bizarre and criminal in equal measure. And in the end it became self defeating. Because he no longer has a job at Old Trafford, while Mainoo does.",
      "His treatment of Mainoo left him so disillusioned he wanted to leave United. His hometown club. The one he grew up supporting. The one which scouted him at the age of six, and signed him at the age of seven.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Mainoo had spent the last few weeks speaking to Napoli. He had seen how former team-mate Scott McTominay had taken his game to new levels with the Italian champions. And he was keen to do the same for himself, under the guidance of Antonio Conte.",
      "He knew Amorim was ruining his season - not to mention his chances of being named in Thomas Tuchel's England squad for this summer's World Cup. But Napoli can forget about signing Mainoo now because Mainoo has forgotten about making a move to the Amalfi coast. Home is where his heart is again.",
      "Mainoo reminded everyone what a top class player he is during United's thumping of Manchester City at Old Trafford. The one who held United together at times in his breakthrough season. The one who started for England in the final of Euro 2024.",
      "Mainoo was the epitome of composure and class in a high-octane game. He was the outstanding midfielder on the pitch, one which also included Ballon d'Or winner Rodri. To such an extent that Rodri was insignificant from start to finish. All of this was achieved in a game which was his first league start of the season.",
      "It's understood Michael Carrick spoke to Mainoo after being appointed interim manager. He told him he would be part of his plans between now and the end of the season. He told him to focus on re-establishing himself in the team. He told him to prove Amorim wrong. And Mainoo has done.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness cost Mainoo half a season of football. While it might be too late for him to impress Tuchel enough to take him to North America. But at a time when United are crying out for some genuine quality in midfield, but seem unwilling to send the money to get it, the fallen giants will feel like a new signing has arrived shown up again.",
      "Mainoo will not turn 21 until April, and has a long career ahead of him. And United should make sure the bulk of it is with them - whoever happens to be the manager.",

      "Guardiola shakes hands with Carrick.(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "\"Think forward, play forward, run forward\" has been the message drilled into Manchester United's academy players across decades. It's a mindset that has been the foundation for success at the football club. On Saturday, Michael Carrick went back to basics against Manchester City to help his team produce United's finest Manchester derby performance since the 2024 FA Cup final triumph.",
      "United looked like a proper United team, limiting City to just one shot on target and having three goals disallowed for offside in a dominant 2-0 victory. It was goalless at half-time, but the home players were applauded back into the dressing room. United's fans finally recognised what they were watching.",
      "\"So different, so different,\" Lisandro Martienz told reporters when asked about Carrick's impact in training. United were aggressive, they played on the front foot, their attitude and mentality were different.",
      "Just 54 days before the Manchester derby, United limped to a humiliating 1-0 defeat to a 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The difference between the two performances is chalk and cheese.",
      "Martinez's answer about Carrick's impact spoke volumes about what he and his backroom staff achieved in three days, but it also reflected badly on Ruben Amorim. United were unshackled against City, and the performance was total vindication of the decision to axe Amorim and appoint Carrick.",
      "Mbeumo celebrates after scoring in the derby.(Image: 2026 Copa)",
      "Amorim secured a few memorable victories during his season-and-a-half in charge at United, with wins against City at the Etihad and against Lyon at Old Trafford the pick of a limited bunch.",
      "However, those results were secured thanks to brilliance from individuals. Amad was responsible for single-handedly turning the derby on its head in December 2024, while Kobbie Mainoo and Harry Maguire miraculously scored late goals against Lyon. United could have easily lost both of those matches.",
      "On this occasion, United were collectively outstanding against City, and it was impossible to argue that it was a fluke. City suffered their biggest expected goals (xG) defeat in their history, which confirmed the visual impression: United were rampant and thoroughly deserved their 2-0 win.",
      "\"We have to look at ourselves and today the analysis is that Man United were better than Man City. You have to accept it,\" said a disappointed Guardiola during his post-match press conference.",
      "Carrick outfoxed the greatest manager in the Premier League after seven months out of the game. \"We've got season tickets and my family comes, so I've been to a lot of games over recent times and you get to know the players and your own eye,\" said Carrick after the game.",
      "\"Everyone has an opinion and your instincts, and then there was a few days to prepare, so the balance of how much information, what the lads could take on, being fair to them to not overdo it.\"",
      "The debate throughout Amorim's tenure was whether United would improve by playing a different formation. A big part of that was Amorim's system forced Bruno Fernandes to play in a deeper role.",
      "Fernandes was relocated to his strongest position by Carrick and, unsurprisingly, delivered a superb display. \"I've spoken to Bruno, I've known him a long time now, and I thought he was fantastic today,\" said Carrick. \"The way he played the position, he's so clever, and he takes up space.\"",
      "Fernandes is playing in his best position again. (Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Carrick's team selection was perfect. Harry Maguire was recalled and was superb alongside Martinez, while Kobbie Mainoo sparkled on his first start of the Premier League season.",
      "It was a big decision to name Benjamin Sesko on the bench given he'd scored three goals in his last two matches, but a striker-less attack of Patrick Dorgu, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad was the right choice. Carrick was spotted with his arm around Sesko during the post-match celebrations.",
      "The tactics were executed perfectly. United operated with a 4-4-2 shape at times, and they played narrow, giving City's wingers yards of space by the byline. However, when the ball was played to those wingers, Diogo Dalot or Luke Shaw would sprint out - and the forward ahead of them would drop back.",
      "Guardiola's side were unable to play inside from their wingers toward United's box, which is how they score plenty of goals in the Premier League, because of Carrick's tactical instructions.",
      "The defensive organisation made a significant difference. Carrick added Steve Holland to his backroom staff, and the result was also a huge tactical win for the 55-year-old, who oversaw the bulk of the coaching in training during Gareth Southgate's tenure as England manager.",
      "Holland arrived with bags of experience, having previously spent years advising successful managers at Chelsea. Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion were key in the victory as well.",
      "Woodgate was spotted wearing an earpiece on the touchline. Binnion was sitting behind the press box, passing down information to the bench from the advantage of a bird's eye view.",
      "Carrick hopes United can continue to soar during the remainder of the season.",

The former Reds midfielder replaced caretaker Darren Fletcher and guided the team to a 2-0 Manchester derby triumph against Manchester City in his opening match in charge over the weekend.",
      "Following that victory, his stance was clear and straightforward: \"It's really important we don't get carried away,\" Carrick stated. \"It's one game. That level of performance needs to be a version of normal.\"",
      "Intent on restoring the club to its glory days, Carrick has reportedly made it evident from his opening session that training would now be briefer yet more demanding, according to the Daily Mail. The reaction from players is understood to have been encouraging, with it being 'immediately clear' from the inaugural session that a different atmosphere had emerged on the training ground.",
      "The squad was introduced to the new coaching setup, comprising Steve Holland - who joined as Carrick's assistant - alongside Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans as first-team coaches. There is believed to be an excellent combination of expertise and characters within the staff, with a 'positive dynamic' already beginning to take shape.",

      "Nevertheless, senior squad members are understood to have intervened and encouraged the younger contingent not to allow it to impact them.",

      "Throughout Ruben Amorim's time at Old Trafford the same question was asked: Would Manchester United improve if they weren't playing with three at the back? That debate was put to bed in the Manchester derby.",
      "Darren Fletcher reverted to a back four during his brief caretaker stint in games against Burnley and Brighton, and there were green shoots of promise, and United's superb performance against Manchester City confirmed what most suspected - the squad is better suited to a different formation.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick has used a 4-2-3-1 throughout his short managerial career and it's a formation that suits the current squad down to the ground. The players looked unshackled and started well. The crowd responded, generating noise due to the front-footed approach on the pitch.",
      "United started games far too slowly with Amorim in charge and Carrick addressed that issue. Of course, intensity is expected in the Manchester derby, but the team's shape helped United to make an improved start.",
      "Carrick picked a striker-less front three, which felt like a risk given Benjamin Sesko's form, but City struggled to get to grips with a pacey and unpredictable attack of Patrick Dorgu, Bryan Mbeumo and Amad.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was relocated to his strongest position. Fernandes has been the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, having thrived around the opposition box, scoring plenty of goals and contributing assists, but Amorim's system saw him play in a deeper midfield position.",
      "Fernandes was still able to perform well in that deeper role, a testament to his quality, but you don't need coaching badges to conclude he is most effective playing closer to the opposition goal.",
      "Carrick's formation allows Fernandes to play behind the forwards - where he is most dangerous. And he almost scored against City, being flagged offside by a whisker after finding the net in the first half.",
      "The formation looked an upgrade in every aspect and United fans applauded their team off the pitch at the interval. Carrick would have sensed an opportunity, and he was jumping on the touchline just after the hour mark when Mbeumo fired United into the lead after a spell of pressure.",
      "It was a ruthless United counter-attack. Fernandes carried it forward, he had the pick of each forward ahead of him, and Mbeumo struck the ball first time to finish into the bottom right corner.",
      "It was the kind of goal that United would not have scored with Amorim in charge because his formation was rarely conducive to creating such opportunities. In truth, it rarely created any chances at all.",
      "United had recorded eight shots, six of which were on target, with 20 minutes remaining, which represented a huge tactical victory for Carrick and his newly-appointed backroom staff.",
      "Steve Holland is expected to be a brilliant appointment and he celebrated with Carrick when Mbeumo scored at the Sretford End. Amorim oversaw a 2-1 victory against City in December 2024, but he relied on an individual to secure the result, as Amad single-handedly turned the game on its head.",
      "Carrick's emphatic win in the Manchester derby was different. It was a tactical success, vindication for axing a manager and hiring a coach who plays with four at the back.",
      "Amorim's system ultimately held United back.",

      "After winning the FA Cup last campaign and the Community Shield at the beginning of the 2025/26 season, few would have foreseen how sour things have turned for Crystal Palace in the months since. Since that victory over Liverpool, Eberechi Eze has left, Marc Guehi is on his way out and Oliver Glasner has confirmed he is leaving at the end of the season.",
      "It has been a bleak January for Palace and seeing Glasner leave for a Premier League rival would sum things up for them. If the Austrian was to have his way, that's exactly the scenario that would play out. It is understood the Palace boss is being considered by Ineos for Manchester United's permanent managerial position.",
      "Despite him playing a 3-4-2-1 system at Palace, which ultimately cost Ruben Amorim his job, Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada and the rest of the United decision-makers are not looking to hold that against him. Plus, for a club looking to find ways of saving cash, appointing an out-of-work manager makes sense.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "It is almost as if the stars are aligning for Glasner and United, but it is never that straightforward - especially when the Austrian behaves as he does in the press. After his side's 2-1 defeat to Sunderland, Glasner went on the offensive and issued a blistering post-match interview.",
      "\"We feel like we're being abandoned completely,\" Glasner said when reflecting on Guehi's impending exit to Manchester City. \"Selling our captain one day before a game - there is no understanding for this.",
      "\"We are preparing and then yesterday [Friday], I get told that our captain will be sold, but why not next week? At least he can play this game and then next week, other players are coming back. It makes me really upset.",
      "\"If your heart gets ripped out twice a year, with Eze one day before a game in the summer and your captain one day before a game - I've just got no understanding. I've been in football for 30 years and never experienced this, not once.\"",
      "Palace chairman Steve Parish was reportedly left seething by Glasner's outburst and his position was being considered on Sunday before ultimately the Eagles decided they wanted to stick with their head coach for the remainder of the season. If Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co were watching all this unfold, they would have been seeing red flags galore.",
      "Even if Ineos feel Glasner has been hard done by at Palace, they would be concerned by the outbursts they have seen from him. When Amorim went against the board after the Leeds draw, he was gone before lunchtime the next day.",
      "Arguably, Amorim's comments were not as fiery as Glasner's, and yet they still cost him. Should United hire Glasner, they cannot rely on him to stay quiet and keep his feelings out of the media.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was in the crowd at Old Trafford on Saturday for Manchester United's 2-0 win over Manchester City(Image: )",
      "The 51-year-old has a history of making tough comments. This is not a one-off for him, just ask the fans of Wolfsburg. He clashed with their sporting director before leaving for Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Amorim gained a lot of respect from United fans for wearing his heart on his sleeve. He was honest, sometimes to a fault, about his feelings on players and the hierarchy.",
      "As such, the supporters warmed to him even when the results were not good enough. Glasner would likely have similar backing from the fans.",
      "But this is exactly what Ineos would hate and Glasner might be talking his way out of the running for the United job with each interview he attends.",
      "Ratcliffe supposedly welcomes a back-and-forth relationship with his manager - he doesn't want to be surrounded by 'yes men'. But he also expects it to be kept in-house and that's what cost Amorim.",
      "Moving for Glasner at the end of the season would be a gamble for Ineos. It is up to Ineos to decide if the gamble is worth it.",

The team today was different. It was different. When you have a coach like Michael Carrick, who really knows, who really can share with you the energy of the club and what it means, it's so different.\"",

      "\"I think there's plenty of room to improve on certain points. I want to see an intention in defence and attack to perform your duties well. I judge it based on that, and that's why I'm choosing others now.\"",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Timber reacted angrily to the remarks and responded after the final whistle. The Dutch midfielder is anticipated to leave the club and maintains a strained rapport with fans, but insisted he needed to speak up following Van Persie's comments.",
      "\"I think it's a shame what the coach said, that it happened this way. It's happened a few times now that the coach doesn't protect the player,\" he fumed. \"You can have an opinion, but say it to my face. This was the limit.\"",
      "Timber went on: \"Everyone at the club knows I give everything in the match, and I did that today. If I have to play at right back, I do it for my team. You can put any player in front of the camera and they'll say the same thing.",
      "\"It feels like a charade. It's like I'm doing nothing. There's a lot going on, a lot of emotion involved, including the fans who aren't happy with me. That's never fun.",
      "Quinten Timber is expected to leave Feyenoord(Image: Marcel van Dorst/EYE4images/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "\"It's always been my intention not to leave the club with nothing. I want to get out. But let's not pretend I'm not working or doing nothing. Everyone at the club knows it's different.",
      "\"I find it disappointing that it's being said like this. It's not the first time. I let it go once, let it go twice, but this time I'm standing up for myself.\"",
      "Van Persie remained firm in his position when questioned about Timber's remarks.",
      "\"If I see that you don't have the intention to carry out those duties, I assess that based on the training sessions and matches, then I make choices based on players who do have that intention,\" he said.",
      "\"I always want to see that you have the intention to defend back. Sometimes you give a bad pass, but I thought that was important. I'm not satisfied with that with Quinten, that's why I'm choosing others.\"",

      "Roy Keane has again ruthlessly dismantled the new Manchester United coaching group and branded his old club a 'circus'. Michael Carrick was chosen to replace the sacked Ruben Amorim and his coaching staff includes Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion.",
      "He said: “I'm more concerned with the appointment and the staff that have come in. But I think I would be like that with most people at this stage of the season.",
      "“Looking at the group of players they have, it is going to be a big ask. You look at Michael Carrick, his remit at Middlesbrough was to get promoted, he didn’t do that, so you could say he failed there.",
      "“But it doesn't mean to say he is a bad manager. That was a difficult job. It is great for him, but I look at the staff he has brought in and we sit here every week and talk about Man United being the best of the best and at this moment in time I don’t see that, even with the appointment and the staff, but that doesn't mean to say they can’t get results.",
      "\"It's a great opportunity for him and his staff, but of course I'm concerned, but I said that about the previous manager.”",
      "Before Keane continued: \"It just seems a bit of a circus act at the moment. But if they start well and get momentum, I still think there's a great chance for the team to get in the Champions League, which has got to be the aim!\"",
      "Moving on to Evans, Keane said: “I like Jonny Evans. He’s rock solid and I have signed him twice. It isn’t an issue with Jonny Evans; it is more an issue with the club and the decision-making of who they are bringing in.",

      "“Jonny Evans left United four or five weeks ago. He left in the summer as a player, but they gave him the job of loans manager. Leaves that a month ago, and he wasn’t there doing it for 10 years and a few months.",
      "“United are letting hundreds of people go, staff every week, but Jonny walks away from that job and gets a call a week later.",
      "Watch a preview of this weekend's Manchester Derby",
      "“My issue with Jonny is that he has got no coaching (experience). It is not like he has worked in the academy for a few years. You need people on the training pitch.”",

      "“Jonny gets a phone call from United, having left as loans manager, saying, 'Do you want to come back?' I bet Jonny Evans is thinking, 'As the kit manager, or to work with the U12s?' No, to work with the first team!",
      "“A great opportunity for him. You have two games, they don’t go too well. That is probably the end of that, but we have another manager coming in and he wants you to stay on as well.”",
      "Roy Keane has once again ripped into Manchester United over their new coaching set-up(Image: )",

      "“I wouldn’t want to work with people above me who are dictating who your staff are. Telling you what players you are bringing in.",
      "“There has been chaos going on in the background. I am not saying the previous manager hasn’t helped himself, but I guarantee he will come up one day and say there were decisions made he wasn’t happy with.",

      "Manchester United have been given an immediate verdict on Diogo Dalot's challenge on Jeremy Doku during Saturday afternoon's Manchester derby. Former Premier League referee Mike Dean believes United should have been reduced to 10 men in the first half against Manchester City.",
      "\"But when you see the replays, the replays aren't good; for me, that's a red card. I know they said don't go looking for things, but it's high, it's across the kneecap, it's a red card all day.\"",
      "At half‑time, Richards said: \"He's on top of his knee - that's the clearest red card you're going to see. I mean, what more do you want for a red card? Studs on the knee.\"",
      "Sturridge then added: \"That's not a glancing blow. That's like taking a knee in a boxing match - you've taken a good punch to the jaw. That to me there, looks like a red. If I'm Doku, I'm staying down. If he stays down longer... That's a red card.\"",
      "Keane then shared his own opinion, insisted: \"Well maybe, but obviously they've had a look at it, do you know what I mean? We always argue about 'does it matter what minute it is? Is it too early? Too early to score a goal?",

      "Good morning and welcome to our Manchester United transfer blog.",
      "It's been a busy week at Old Trafford with Michael Carrick appointed as their interim head coach on a deal until the end of the season and all eyes are now on the club's owners to see if they can bolster his squad before the January transfer window closes.",
      "United have not yet added to their squad this month, with Ruben Amorim's departure putting any transfer activity on the back burner.",
      "However, that hasn't stopped speculation from around the globe with United linked with a number of incoming and outgoing transfers.",
      "United are understood to be among a number of clubs that could sign Ruben Loftus-Cheek from AC Milan. According to TeamTalk, United have been 'offered' the ex-Chelsea midfielder by the Italian side.",
      "Milan are believed to be willing to sanction a loan deal with an obligation to purchase permanently in the summer. Additional clubs who are also interested reportedly include Newcastle, Sunderland, Fulham, Aston Villa, Everton and Brentford.",
      "The 29-year-old departed from the Blues in 2023 after an eight-year stint, making a permanent move to Italy following loan spells at Palace and Fulham. Throughout his career, the midfielder has scored 30 goals and provided 32 assists in 367 appearances.",
      "Marc Guehi and Oliver Glasner, who could join United in the summer, are already leaving the Eagles.",
      "Napoli boss Antonio Conte has digged at ex-Man United head coach Ruben Amorim after Rasmus Hojlund was shipped out of the club to join the Italian giants.",
      "\"Certain young arrogant head coaches these days don’t want to adapt , they see a young striker (Hojlund) struggling instead of coaching him they blame him , always moan and blame everyone but themselves because they are spoon fed.\"",
      "In case you missed it yesterday, Manchester United have decided to recall goalkeeper Elyh Harrison from his loan at Shrewsbury Town.",
      "Harrison started for the League Two outfit against Wolves in the FA Cup last Saturday, but his minutes in the league were limited after Will Brook took his place between the sticks.",
      "A club statement confirming the decision read: \"Manchester United have recalled young goalkeeper Elyh Harrison from his loan at League Two club Shrewsbury Town.",
      "\"The 19-year-old spent the first half of the season with the Shrews, managed by United Academy graduate Michael Appleton, after joining the club in July.",
      "\"He made his Football League debut against Colchester United and also gained senior minutes in the Carabao Cup, FA Cup and Vertu Trophy.\"",
      "Not sure I see any merit in this, to be honest. Dalot is 26, there is no point sending him on loan to develop and he is the first-choice right-back and a member of the leadership group.",
      "He's had a difficult season and the criticism of him from supporters has been noticeably louder this year. I'm not sure he's the long-term answer at right-back but there is no replacement ready to go either. Even if Noussair Mazraoui takes that place next week, Dalot would be needed as back-up.",
      "There is probably an argument to sign a right-back in the summer, although midfield has to be the priority. It feels inevitable that Dalot will face more competition at some point.",
      "Oliver Glasner's decision to leave Crystal Palace has led to a big move in the markets for him to become the Man United manager for the first game of the 2025/26 season. Glasner has been backed from 6/1 into 3/1 after he confirmed he will be leaving Palace at the end of the current season.",
      "William Hill's spokesperson Lee Phelps said: \"Following Oliver Glasner’s shock announcement that he will be leaving Crystal Palace at the end of the season, we make him one of the leading contenders to be the next permanent manager of Manchester United.",
      "“Glasner is now the 3/1 second-favourite to take over at Old Trafford on a permanent basis next season, only behind current interim boss Michael Carrick at 6/5.",
      "“The Austrian manager will see out the rest of the season at Selhurst Park, with his side 3/1 favourites to win the Europa Conference League and crown the most successful tenure in the club’s history.”",

      "Oliver Glasner has publicly confirmed his departure from Crystal Palace at the end of the season amid links to becoming Manchester United's new head coach.",
      "After confirming that Marc Guehi to Manchester City was in the final stages, he said: \"I already informed the club months ago that I wanted a new challenge.",
      "\"I had a meeting with Steve [Parish] in the October international break, a dinner, a very long talk and I told him I would not sign a new contract.",
      "\"We agreed at the time to keep it between us, I told the team today the same.\"",
      "Wayne Rooney has urged Michael Carrick and Manchester United to swoop in for any players they have on their radar should they become available this month, via the most-recent instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show.",
      "The problem United have got at the minute is if players become available now, I think we have to go for them.",
      "Because when it comes to the summer and you're in competition again with the teams who are more successful at the minute, it becomes more difficult to sign the players they want. If the players become available now who you think, 'Yeah,' we can go for him now.",
      "And maybe you're paying over the odds to get him a little bit. I think they have to take it now.",
      "Manchester City could have signed a new player in the January transfer window ahead of the Premier League clash against Manchester United.",
      "According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, City have advanced in a deal for Marc Guehi during the last 12 hours with an important proposal presented to the England international. He has added that Palace are prepared to proceed as well which means the deal getting closer.",
      "With the registration deadline having passed, Guehi will not be able to feature for City even if he signs before their clash.",
      "While Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are set to stay, Toby Collyer looks set for a loan move out of Manchester United.",
      "According to Manchester World, Championship side Hull City are expected to complete a temporary deal for the midfielder by early next week.",

      "“If he wins every game, look, we could be sat here in the season where he’s done unbelievably well, and we’re always thinking the fans are up and they’re in the Champions League places, fifth or whatever. It could happen if there’s a good run and we could all be getting swayed with it.",
      "“I honestly feel like (you have to look at others) at the end of the season when you’ve got (Mauricio) Pochettino, (Thomas) Tuchel and (Carlo) Ancelotti.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has come out in defence of Jonny Evans(Image: PA)",
      "Rio Ferdinand has defended Jonny Evans in response to Roy Keane's critique of Manchester United's decision to appoint the former defender as a first-team coach. Keane recently expressed doubts about Evans' qualifications for the role on Michael Carrick's coaching staff during a scathing tirade.",
      "\"Fletch goes and Carrick gives him the job. Great, isn't it?,\" Keane remarked on the Stick to Football podcast. \"We should all go to Barbados for a week... If you're on about getting coaching staff in, we're praising one of them and we just let the other two go - Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans.",
      "\"What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach at Man Utd's first team? He left a job four weeks ago as a loans manager and ironically comes back working with the first team. That's a big step up, isn't it?\"",
      "Keane's outburst came after Gary Neville voiced his approval of Steve Holland's appointment as Carrick's assistant coach. \"I wish we were sitting here and you said he brought three staff in and you reeled them off and said they're all brilliant,\" Keane continued.",
      "\"You said you don't know anything about Jonny Evans coaching because he's never coached! That's my point! But he's gone into Man Utd and you're going, 'oh that's okay because we've got Stevie Holland,' A new guru!\".",
      "Manchester United - FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "In response to Keane's remarks, Ferdinand has defended Evans, asserting that the former defender deserves his chance, given his familiarity with the squad from playing alongside nearly every member - a factor that could aid Carrick in maximising the potential of players like Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"The stuff with the coaches and stuff like that, and calling out the coaches, like, Jonny Evans is a young coach. Why shouldn't he get a chance?,\" Ferdinand questioned on BBC 5 Live.",
      "\"Why shouldn't he get a chance to come into the club? He knows every single player in that club better than any coach on the planet right now, other than the ones that have been there recently, because he's played there. He knows them all. Why wouldn't you bring him on your staff? I don't understand.",
      "Jonny Evans has been appointed as Michael Carrick's first team coach(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "\"If you want to get to know what Kobbie Mainoo is like, because you want to reboot him and put him in a team, I wouldn't mind having somebody that knows him, who's been in the changing room, who knows how he works, closer to me.",
      "\"How do we get a bit more out of Bruno? Because you know him. That's the kind of conversation I'm sure that Michael Carrick's gonna want to be having.",
      "\"Sit down and tell me about every single one of these players, because you, Jonny, have lived with them and breathed with them for a couple of years now. I actually understand why someone like Steve Holland's there.",
      "\"He's experienced. Michael Carrick wants an experienced coach alongside him. He's gone for someone like him. Like, what, should he have gone for what? Who else has got experience that he should have gone for?",
      "\"I just, I don't know. It was a... I didn't agree with it, with that, and that's where it starts, and that's fine. You can have that conversation and have that opinion, but I don't know, I just thought it was probably a bit... The gun was pointing at the wrong people.\"",

      "Carrick is back in charge until the end of the season, just over four years since he stepped in for three games after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked in November 2021. Although supporters are happy to see the former midfielder back, it only adds to the sense that the club is treading water and has lost direction.",
      "United have cycled through Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim as permanent managers since Carrick was last in the dugout, with just the FA Cup in 2024 to show for it, while they have no European football this season and face a battle to get back into continental competition next term.",
      "The arrival of Ineos as minority investors in December 2023 was supposed to herald a new dawn at United, but Ratcliffe has already lost the trust of supporters and key lieutenants Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are also facing scrutiny.",

      "Protests are planned ahead of the game against Fulham on February 1, but Ratcliffe and Joel and Avram Glazer could be at the Old Trafford derby on Saturday, having been at Carrington on Thursday for meetings, and their presence at the game could spark another fan revolt. Yet Carrick insists the mystique around United still remains in place and that he has felt positivity since returning to the club earlier this week.",

      "\"Part of my role and responsibility is shaping what we want to look like going forward as a group. What happens on the pitch and the tactical side and the performances is one thing but certainly the culture as well and how we think, how we act, how we behave, what it means to us to be here, that's something that is part of my responsibility to spread in the right way.\"",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Man Utd’s squad showed against Man City that they are capable of producing the necessary performances to fend off Liverpool and Chelsea for the Champions League, but this is reliant on Carrick getting more out of the playing staff than most managers since Ferguson, and history tells us that they will underdeliver more often than not.",

      "This really isn’t about DNA or a ‘throwback’; it’s just a very good performance.",
      "",
      "Manchester United beat Manchester City on Saturday. You might have heard. It was rather impressive. You can read 16 Conclusions here; we wrote hundreds upon hundreds of words on the game and yet somehow managed NOT to use the letters D, N and A. Because it’s a right load of old bollocks.",
      "Michael Carrick proves Manchester United DNA isn’t a myth",
      "We mean this in the nicest possibly way but…does it f***.",
      "Carrick did an excellent job of preparing this Manchester United team to play Manchester City, but let’s not pretend that one game – in which City had a makeshift defence – ‘proved’ anything at all. Otherwise, we would have to pretend that Manchester United beating Liverpool at Anfield in October was ‘proof’ that Ruben Amorim’s system was actually hunky-dory, thank you. And, well, f*** DNA.",
      "We also seem to be collectively pretending that the returns of Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are not absolutely key to United’s improvement; it’s a lot easier to play ‘the Manchester United way’ when you have all your best attacking players on the pitch.",
      "“United’s DNA” has been questioned this week. Is it real? Should United underpin their whole plan on what feels like folklore? Should United move away from Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? Sir Alex was in the director’s box smiling all afternoon long – why? Because Carrick made it all appear simple by taking it back to what United know best, in the best way, on the best possible occasion.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? That’s not a thing. He played attacking football when it suited; but that wasn’t always sensible away in Europe, for example. You’re not that successful over 20-odd years by having one good (let’s use wingers!) idea.",
      "Manchester United were excellent in dismantling City on Saturday but that’s not about DNA but about Carrick rather sensibly picking a formation and personnel that suited his players. It does him a disservice if we pin all this on some nebulous concept that belongs in the bin.",
      "Can the media please leave that sh*t to Neville and Wayne Rooney.",
      "Of course Rooney is quoted in the Daily Mail, who promise us a journey ‘Inside Michael Carrick’s derby masterclass’ (which includes the masterstroke of arriving at Old Trafford 15 minutes later than usual. Genius).",
      "Essentially Carrick has taken United back to the basics that were so important when he was a player under Ferguson.",
      "He knew that United had to stop City playing by working together to deny them space, close them down quickly in possession and then counter-attack to maximum effect.",
      "You might be forgiven for thinking that’s a description of how any team should play when facing one that dominates possession but no, that’s Ferguson-ball, it seems.",
      "No, we have to pretend that Manchester United were ever going to try and dominate the ball against Manchester City, because that’s what his Middlesbrough team used to do. And we have to pretend that it’s ‘unexpected’ that they didn’t.",
      "While the Middlesbrough team Carrick forged were looking to dominate possession, United were happy for City to have the ball, safe in the knowledge they would be able to defend when the Blues picked their moment. The Reds had just 32 per cent possession – unheard of for a Carrick team.",
      "But not ‘unheard’ of for a Manchester United team playing City. Especially in this new/old era of Sir Alex Ferguson-ball.",
      "It was exactly what United needed to do. Bernardo Silva said it himself after the match, the Reds ‘took the game to where they are good,’ and doing that proved successful. But that does not mean it was expected.",
      "Oh but it was.",
      "",
      "‘More games like this and why shouldn’t Michael Carrick get the job?’ is the headline on Martin Samuel’s column in The Times.",
      "We don’t think Carrick will get to play an injury-ravaged Manchester City defence again this season, nor play against a team who seek to dominate possession quite so religiously, but we agree that a whole raft of wins should probably earn him the job.",
      "But this is bollocks…",
      "So this was a throwback, an instant change for the better. An upgrade on the Ruben Amorim era, a reminder of a time when United stood for something more than institutional discord or commercial enterprise. United took the game to Manchester City as equals, not inferiors. They didn’t try to pass them off the pitch because there will be only one winner of that contest; but they were aggressive, ambitious, vigorous, they ran and ran.",
      "It feels like the bare minimum, really. As we said in Winners and Losers, ‘it is better to properly appraise Michael Carrick against the five teams placed 10th and below who Manchester United face next month, rather than his opening salvo of a home Manchester derby followed by Arsenal at the Emirates’.",
      "But no, that will not do for Samuel…",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson, who the cameras always seek out at moments of great elation or despair – and recently it’s often despair – would have recognised this Manchester United. He wouldn’t have known many of the others he has watched since retiring, but Carrick’s red men played with a foot in the past. They created the best chances, they did the most work.",
      "They played ‘with a foot in the past’?! While the reporting around Manchester United remains like this, they are f***ed.",
      "Manchester United have an ‘ambitious aim’ to seal Champions League qualification without making a winter signing, but this is only doable on one condition.",
      "The Spurs job would be bloody hard for the right man, whoever that might be. But Thomas Frank is still the wrong man, and must still be sacked.",
      "Arsenal are in both the Premier League winners and losers columns, with Manchester United and Everton’s DNA shining and Unai Emery apparently cursed.",

      "But this was proof that a great deal of their on-pitch issues were painfully avoidable and redeemable by the mere advent of appointing a coach who isn’t personally affronted by the idea of placing square pegs in similar-shaped holes.",
      "Carrick profiled the players properly and Manchester United benefited from it. The football only left Casemiro when he was asked to patrol the entire middle of the pitch alone, Kobbie Mainoo is disciplined enough to play in a midfield two and Bruno Fernandes might be better deployed higher up the pitch than in a deep-lying pivot.",
      "It was common sense as much as it was DNA, but it was impressive nonetheless.",
      "",
      "In four games in charge of Manchester United, Carrick has beaten the managers of the Premier League’s current top three, as well as the England head coach.",
      "Granted, on this particular weekend such a record against Mikel Arteta, Pep Guardiola and Unai Emery doesn’t actually sound all that impressive. Manchester United being the only team in the top five to win on a weekend can’t have happened all that often since the Podcasters of ’92 have been around.",
      "",
      "It is very West Ham to spend £46.1m on new forwards signed at the behest of a manager whose position has often seemed untenable recently, only for the free agent who might well be released as a direct consequence of that investment to score the winner against their bitter rivals.",
      "“Callum is a very experienced man,” Nuno said last week. “He’s been in the game for so much time and he knows that his position has changed. So we were honest to each other. Yes, your position has changed but he’s still a player from the club and we still maybe need him.”",
      "That “maybe” was doing an awful lot of heavy lifting even before the Spurs win. Their second top scorer this season might not have joined from Gil Vicente or Lazio as Nuno’s man but only a fool would ignore the part he clearly still had to play in West Ham’s campaign. He is not six goals away from joining the Premier League 100 Club by accident.",
      "It might be that the 33-year-old is granted his wish for more regular playing time with the termination of his contract this month – West Ham would be stupid to sanction that but they are West Ham – yet Wilson can hold his head high in any event at having given his all.",
      "",
      "It remains one of this Premier League season’s defining statistics, kept intact by a battling victory at home to Crystal Palace: the only team other than Arsenal to follow up every league defeat with a win in their very next game is Sunderland.",
      "And while the Gunners have had only two opportunities to bounce back from zero points with all three, Regis Le Bris’ scrappers have been beaten five times before immediately picking themselves up and dusting themselves on each occasion.",
      "It is a trait which goes remarkably well with sitting second in the table for most points won from losing positions to underline the brilliance of probably the most durable team in the country.",
      "",
      "For £17.3m, Sunderland have received five goal contributions from Brobbey, including:",
      "1) The assist to a 93rd-minute winner at Stamford Bridge.\n2) A 94th-minute equaliser at home to Arsenal.\n3) A 69th-minute winner against Bournemouth.\n4) An 80th-minute equaliser in a draw with Spurs.\n5) A 71st-minute winner against Crystal Palace.",
      "That is a ludicrous level of impact from someone who has started about one third of his club’s games.",

      "“It’s in the DNA at Everton; we can dig wins out,” said David Moyes of a club that has ransacked the City Ground, Old Trafford with 10 men for 80 minutes, and now the fortress of home dominance that was Villa Park this season.",
      "And who better to explain Everton’s “perfect plan” than the man who struck the post within 11 seconds? As Merlin Rohl said, the midfield “did a great job of keeping close to the players who want the ball all the time”. It helped the Toffees “frustrate” the home crowd and they benefited from not being “the team that needs to push and needs to play forward”.",
      "Since Moyes was appointed last January, no team has won more Premier League away games than Everton, and only Arsenal (37) have accrued more points (34). Those 10 Toffees wins on the road have come in 20 matches; Everton’s previous 10 away victories were stretched over 66 games all the way back to August 2021 and the days of Rafa Benitez.",
      "One of their managers in that time literally mocked Everton as an opponent for forgetting “how to win a game away from home”. Moyes has refreshed the memory.",
      "",
      "The kindest assessment was that Leeds had taken a calculated gamble. The harsher and certainly more preeminent judgement across the more vocal element of a fanbase predisposed to disappointment and retroactive finger-pointing was that a relegation-adjacent manager had not been supplied with the requisite firepower to keep the Championship in the rear view.",
      "Leeds did at one stage in the summer seem to have improved through recruitment in every position before realising late on they had slightly forgotten the attack.",
      "Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lukas Nmecha cost nothing in transfer fees between them, but plenty in wages and the presumed overtime the Leeds medical department was expected to work to keep them fit.",
      "It has paid off handsomely so far. Nmecha alone has scored in a pair of 1-0 wins, while Calvert-Lewin can lay direct claim to many of the points won since Daniel Farke woke up and smelled the coffee in December.",
      "Leeds are the only club with two new signings on five Premier League goals or more so far this season, and both were free agents. The risk has reaped fine reward.",
      "",
      "As far as Dyche quotes go, “it can’t all be the beautiful side, you’ve got the do the basics well” is an absolute belter. Although having said that, 0-0 continues to trail a 3-0 win and 2-0 defeat as the most common Nottingham Forest scorelines of this Entertainers tribute reign.",
      "But beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the City Ground became besotted with those players again after 90 minutes characterised by the same grit, determination and organisation which carried them into the Europa League.",
      "It was also the fourth goalless draw Dyche has coached against Mikel Arteta in 11 meetings with three different teams. The man knows his basic onions.",
      "",
      "Burnley have hedged their Chelsea-based bets slightly recently, with three permanent signings from the Blues last summer alone. But Humphreys will almost certainly be sent back for a fee thoroughly eclipsing the sort the Clarets received for James Trafford a few months ago, which remains a club record.",
      "Chelsea being Chelsea, they might chuck £80m in the general direction of Turf Moor next week.",
      "It may be that Burnley and Scott Parker are still slightly too limited to suggest that if Humphreys had been available all season the complexion of their campaign would have been far brighter. But he probably would have at least shattered the unknown record for most goalline clearances ever by the end of September.",
      "",
      "The contract extension handed out to Vitor Pereira after eight winless games, including four defeats to start the new season, will go down as one of the most damaging, defining decisions made by any Premier League club in 2025/26.",
      "Rob Edwards would not exactly have Wolves safely in mid-table – he cannot point to having to clear up the mess he inherited as the sole or even biggest reason for losing his first seven games – but they would not be as far adrift nor fretful about Derby’s results almost two decades ago either had he been in charge for longer.",
      "A four-match unbeaten streak has injected life and belief into a club that was hurtling towards not just relegation but implosion. Edwards has also coached as many clean sheets as Ruben Amorim this campaign in nine fewer games.",
      "He has stemmed the bleed, stabilised the patient and started their rehabilitation ahead of next season.",
      "",
      "In English, “jammy”, if you split the two words it’s “jam” and “my”: I’ll jam my fingers into my eyes if Rosenior lasts the year with Chelsea playing like that and being out-shot 15 to six at home to Brentford.",
      "The game might still be going if Rosenior was permitted to stop it each time he saw something he didn’t like, even just from Alejandro Garnacho. But a win and a clean sheet in his first game was a bar as low as it was necessary to clear.",
      "",
      "",
      "Doesn’t feel like there’s a particular need to expand on Pep Guardiola’s take that “the better team won”.",
      "It is telling that in the aftermath of a Manchester City defeat he didn’t performatively collar anyone on the pitch to furiously tell them how good they are, nor was there a single passive-aggressive “so good” in any of the post-match interviews.",
      "His side was soundly beaten and he knew it, with injuries only providing a slight caveat for a deeply concerning performance at either end.",
      "And Guardiola likely realised he was outcoached too. Perhaps he has also discerned his greatest weakness in the process, the one true, enduring Kryptonite to arguably the sport’s finest ever manager: the caretaker.",
      "In the Premier League alone Guardiola has now been beaten by Carrick while drawing with Calum McFarlane (Chelsea), Simon Rusk (Southampton) and Steve Agnew (Middlesbrough). Future quiz question compilers are welcome.",
      "",
      "A detrimental result followed by an eye-catching post-match interview which betrayed frustrations with issues behind the scenes and shifted the blame away from the coaching?",
      "Might not be the best time to consider the previous winners of the Premier League Manager of the Month award this season before Unai Emery was crowned in December. In reverse chronological order we have: Enzo Maresca, Ruben Amorim, Oliver Glasner and Arne Slot.",
      "Oh lord.",
      "Even before that it was Vitor Pereira in April and Nuno Espirito Santo in March. The curse is real, and the emphasis Emery put on describing Villa as “not contenders to be in the top five” suggested he knows as much.",
      "Losing out to Spurs in a transfer battle and feeling compelled to sell one of your better forward options – then him scoring on his debut for his new club – without a replacement would, to be fair, send most heads careering towards space.",
      "And Amorim is right there to replace Emery anyway. Sorted.",
      "",
      "Never go full Jose Mourinho 2016/17.",
      "",
      "With no ground lost and indeed some actually gained on Manchester City and Aston Villa over the last week and a half, it could have been worse. But Arsenal know it really might have been a whole lot better too, with opportunities squandered across a couple of frustrating goalless draws.",
      "In isolation, toiling to a point against Liverpool and being held on a trip to Dycheland is fine enough across the course of a league season. In consecutive games, it does start to vaguely resemble a stutter which Arsenal cannot afford to let develop into an actual problem.",
      "An upcoming fixture list of Manchester United, Leeds, Sunderland, Brentford, Spurs, Chelsea and Brighton, with Champions League games and a Carabao Cup semi-final second leg littered in between, means Arsenal must discover their attacking edge again soon. And drop Viktor Gyokeres obviously.",

      "Yet as Edwards said, “Newcastle have got very good players but overall the game went how we expected it to.”",
      "That is: Newcastle would dominate the ball while creating precious little of note as the unimaginative visitors who only ever change the personnel in a flawed system, rather than the system itself.",
      "It is damning that they can be so easily read by a team which, until recently, was being discussed as one of the Premier League’s worst ever.",
      "As a flourish, Wolves might well have predicted the triple substitution around the hour mark – the only time Eddie Howe called on his bench – the wait the 86th minute for Newcastle’s only two shots on target, or Nick Woltemade’s mere 13 touches.",
      "",
      "That’s three defeats in all his professional meetings with Liam Rosenior now: as a player in 2011, as a coach in 2026, and in the infamous mid-2010s Lego battle as mandated on the UEFA Pro Licence course.",
      "Fair play for devising a gameplan which really ought to have delivered victory at Stamford Bridge, but how foolish of Andrews to overlook the ultimate variable that is Kevin Schade’s ridiculousness.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may very well be about to follow that path. If/when that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "It is a wild ride and, at the top/bottom of this particularly vomit-inducing rollercoaster it now appears to be a straight fight between Nuno and the impossibly beleaguered Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there. But could someone else still beat Frank to the finish?",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. Both options now appear gloriously possible, but current forecasts clearly point more to the former.",

      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",

      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "They didn’t and haven’t. But let’s not pretend that ‘slipping out of likely title contention’ is some kind of catastrophe for Villa. However disappointing that second half collapse was, they ended 2025 in a stunning place.",
      "Five wins in six games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances, lifting Brentford all the way for now into what is very likely a Champions League-qualifying position.",

      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "If, as now seems likely, City are unable to muster a meaningful challenge to Arsenal at the summit, it’s not impossible to imagine a scenario where Champions League failure prompts Guardiola to sod it all for a game of soldiers. Crucially, though, there is still almost no chance of any of that coming to pass before at least one of the genuine misery-guts clubs pressing the panic button.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Six wins and two draws in 11 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now but they still – for now, just about – remain outside the real relegation scrap and that’s impressive enough on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "But after an 11-game run without a win, he and Bournemouth desperately needed something to kickstart another of those runs of Champions League form. And sure enough, along came Dr Tottenham with the prescription, and Antoine Semenyo with a wonderful parting gift.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, it’s now six points from their last four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you’ve only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "Also does need stating, for the record, that Palace are currently quite sh*t. They are without a win in ten games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley in what is fast becoming the world’s least convincing unbeaten run ever.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "Especially as we still await truly compelling evidence that this football won’t, in fact get them relegated. They are in the bottom three and a long, long way adrift of safety after a rotten defeat to Nottingham Forest, who sit just the other side of the trapdoor but now a chasm-like five points away, that deficit cut down after the Hammers visited Dr. Tottenham.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It really might take further signs of life from across the capital and genuine, mortal danger of relegation to rouse the Spurs suits from their current slumbers. Although Cristian Romero has had a go there too.",

      "Tottenham Hotspur reportedly have a ‘top’ interim candidate to replace Thomas Frank until the summer, while there is an update on Mauricio Pochettino.",
      "The Spurs job would be bloody hard for the right man, whoever that might be. But Thomas Frank is still the wrong man, and must still be sacked.",
      "“Many players” at Tottenham think Thomas Frank is “not the right fit” as the Spurs head coach nears the sack, according to The Athletic’s David Ornstein.",

      "They go by a variety of titles but these are the men who carry the clout in the Premier League, the hirers and the firers…",
      "Sporting director, director of football, president of football operations, technical director… the real powerbrokers in the Premier League operate largely in the shadows, leaving the coaches and managers to face all the scrutiny.",
      "To that extent, there will be names on this list you won’t recognise, much less likely are you to be able to pick some out of an identity parade.",
      "But these are the individuals or groups making the big decisions that will dictate the long-term future of every Premier League club…",
      "Berta, 54, became sporting director at Arsenal in 2025, taking over from Edu. The Italian’s background was in banking prior to executive roles at Carpenedolo, Parma and Genoa. He then spent 12 years at Atletico Madrid, first as technical director before becoming sporting director in 2017. Berta helped shape Atletico’s squad and is credited with an influence in the signings of the likes of Antoine Griezmann, Rodri and Jan Oblak. The Rojiblancos won two La Liga titles, the Europa League, and reached two Champions League finals under Diego Simeone on Berta’s watch.",
      "",
      "Villa operate a little differently these days in the wake of Monchi’s exit. Owners Wes Edens, Nassef Sawiris and Michael Angelakis have put their faith in the manager, Unai Emery, to build the team around him, rather than place one of their men between themselves and a head coach. Olabe, the former Real Sociedad sporting director, was appointed as president of football operations in late 2025. The 58-year-old played with Emery at La Real, and had a very brief spell as coach before taking executive roles. Olabe is credited with a leading role in establishing Real Sociedad as a force, signing the likes of Alexander Isak and Martin Zubimendi along the way.",
      "Olabe also works in tandem with Damian Vidagany, who Emery brought with him to Villa Park to serve as director of football operations. Vidagany, a former journalist, first encountered Emery at Valencia when the former Vidagany was working in Los Che’s media and marketing sections. According to The Athletic, ‘Vidagany is Emery’s eyes and ears, a bridge between the football and non-football departments and between the dressing room and management.’ Emery, though, is one of few Premier League bosses above whom are only the owners.",
      "",
      "Pinto, 41, served as director of football at Benfica and general manager at Roma before becoming the Cherries’ president of football operations in 2024. He works in tandem with technical director Simon Francis, the ex-Bournemouth defender who stepped into Richard Hughes’ shoes when the now-Liverpool chief departed for Anfield in 2024.",
      "",
      "Giles has been director of football at Brentford for more than a decade, overseeing their ascent to the Premier League. A former Newcastle season-ticket holder with a PhD in statistics, Giles worked with Matthew Benham in the gambling industry before Benham became the Bees’ majority shareholder, steering the club towards a date-driven approach. Giles works with technical director Lee Dykes who oversees the club’s recruitment. Between them all, they’ve worked bloomin’ miracles.",
      "",
      "Ayto was appointed as sporting director in September 2025, overseeing ‘all footballing areas of the club including player recruitment, performance and medical for the club’s senior men’s and women’s teams and academies’. The 40-year-old moved to the AmEx following more than a decade at Arsenal, working his way up from analyst to chief scout to assistant sporting director under Edu before filling in as interim sporting director between the Brazilian and Berta.",
      "",
      "The Clarets don’t have an all-powerful sporting director, instead a ‘technical committee’, with Jenkins’ title as director of football development offering a wider scope across the club from first-team through to academy. Much of Jenkins’ career before Burnley was spent at Middlesbrough where he worked throughout the academy before landing at Turf Moor as academy director in 2021.",
      "",
      "Chelsea’s approach is certainly… unique. Winstanley and Stewart are the co-sporting directors, heading up Chelsea’s five-man sporting leadership team. The others: Joe Shields is sporting director for scouting and talent; Sam Jewell is sporting director for global recruiting; and Dave Fallows arrived from Liverpool last year to lead football development, focusing on scouting and data, loans and player pathways, and overall football staff development. Too many cooks?",
      "",
      "Hobbs moved to become Palace’s sporting director in 2025 after three years in the same role at Wolves. At Molineux, Hobbs started in the academy recruitment team, before being promoted to the position of chief scout and head of player recruitment.

      "We hear a lot about “the DNA of the club”; Gary Neville was waffling about Manchester United’s recently. And people rarely question what is actually a complete fallacy.",
      "There’s talk of Spurs’ DNA being in opposition to Thomas Frank’s style of play and it will soon get him the sack. West Ham’s DNA is forever being let down or ignored by managers and owners and Liverpool seem to believe it is a unique characteristic that the club embodies. In fact, is there any club that doesn’t have DNA? Does Exeter City have a footballing double helix? Is former Celtic defender Gary Caldwell carrying on the traditions of the Third Division South Cup winners in 1933/34? Is he boll*cks.",
      "But people believe in it. What does it mean? Or perhaps more specifically, what do people think it means? It’s a bit nebulous and doesn’t surrender to serious thought and a bit like the EU laws that people claimed as reasons for their Brexit vote but could never name, I don’t believe anyone could tell you what DNA means in football and for it to make an ounce of sense.",
      "Take Manchester United. What was Neville referring to? When does this DNA thing come into being? When was it birthed? As far as it is possible to tell, he seems to think that basically it coincided with his playing career. It certainly didn’t seem to reach further back when United were a bit rubbish. Apparently DNA, the stuff of life, is only established when successful. So very much Andrei Kanchelskis and not Mike Duxbury. But can you select when your DNA begins and ends.",
      "DNA suggests something intrinsic and permanent, not just a few years in the mid 90s or indeed anything so subjective. In other words, talk of DNA is 100% rubbish. Your DNA cannot be defined as anything other than a ‘period when we were good’ or ‘the period when we played attractive football.’ You cannot choose your DNA; if your parents and grandparents are all ginger-haired, you can’t choose not to be ginger.",
      "Have you noticed that no club’s DNA is referred to as tedious, boring and defensive. “Yeah we’ve always played five at the back and tried to nick a goal.” Yet surely there have been many clubs that would describe well.",
      "There are things that define every club, of course. Positive or negative. For example, when I hear of Bolton, I always think of Kevin Davies’ buttocks and Kevin Nolan standing on a vibrating plate. But that’s just memories, not DNA. I’m sure Bolton fans don’t say “he doesn’t understand the club’s DNA” just because of the diminutive size of the centre forward’s arse, or whether the midfielder vibrates enough.",
      "Referring to this concept as a reason for sacking a manager is unfair and ridiculous and more often than not just really refers to losing a lot. Frank won’t be sacked for any other reason. If they were top playing boring and tedious football, their fans wouldn’t mind, just like Arsenal fans don’t. In fact, Tottenham’s habit of being rubbish but occasionally really good means they are carrying on the club’s greatest traditions. So if anything, Frank does know the club and its DNA. It’s surely better that Spurs get a manager who doesn’t understand the club DNA because inconsistency has been its hallmark for 60 years.",
      "There is no West Ham, Spurs, Chelsea or Arsenal ‘way’. The nearest thing to it is Manchester United always having a youth team player in the match-day squad. At least that is consistent, lasting 88 years since Saturday, October 30, 1937, over 4,300 consecutive games and more than 15 different managers.",
      "Endlessly talking about ‘someone who understands the DNA of the club’ is to aggrandise the club into a timeless entity that is objectively different to any other. It doesn’t happen outside of the biggest clubs, who do tend to have the most pretentious self-aggrandising fans. The nearest we get at Middlesbrough is the concept of ‘typical Boro’ which more describes the ability to mess things up at the last minute. People were saying it 55 years ago if we lost to a late goal. If you’d mentioned it being in the club’s DNA, you’d have been laughed out of the Holgate.",
      "If you’ve invented a standard to measure the current failing team against, then just say so, instead of claiming not playing with two wingers, is going against the club’s DNA. You don’t know how, why or what it means and you’ve just made it up. And that includes you, Gary.",
      "Manchester United have an ‘ambitious aim’ to seal Champions League qualification without making a winter signing, but this is only doable on one condition.",

      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season, with a positive performance at Manchester City where he conceded one – a penalty – in the face of 1.7 PSxG.",
      "",
      "Only Martin Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster, with another clean sheet at Brighton followed by an astonishing seventh of the season against Manchester City. What a phenomenal signing he has been.",
      "",
      "Henderson fell from the top of this ranking after conceding seven goals to Manchester City and Leeds from a PSxG of 4.9. Which won’t help his slim England prospects. Little he could do to keep out Archie Gray’s header for Spurs from 427 millimetres and then he under-conceded against both Fulham and Newcastle. A clean sheet against Villa was Palace’s first in seven games. Could do little to stop either of Sunderland’s goals.",
      "",
      "The England no.1 was a big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence. David Moyes’ back four was more on it against Arsenal, restricting the leaders to just one shot on target before another clean sheet at Burnley in which he had precisely nothing to do. He was far busier against Nottingham Forest, Brentford and, weirdly, Wolves before a very creditable clean sheet at Villa.",
      "",
      "Burnley are in the mire but things would be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. No goalkeeper has made more saves than Dubravka having faced 22 more shots on his goal than anyone else.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, before finding his form again. But he was rotten against Arsenal, with narrative out of the wazoo. And dropped a bollock against Everton.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma eased himself in to the Premier League and has been making some important saves, like the double against West Ham to stop the Hammers getting back into the game at the Etihad. Little he could do in the face of Carrick-ball.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first doubts were raised over the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable. At Villa, Lammens was beaten twice by Morgan Rogers, who United defenders appeared to know nothing of. A clean sheet against Newcastle while finishing behind the weirdest defence United have fielded in years was really quite remarkable.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth and though he conceded two at Newcastle, Sanchez could do little about either before helping himself to an assist for Joao Pedro’s leveller. Much the busier keeper against Villa, with eight shots on his goal. A first clean sheet in five against Brentford.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest. Vicario copped it from Spurs supporters again against Liverpool when he conceded two from 1.3 PSxG but you would have to look very hard for reasons to be critical for either of the Reds’ goals. Bournemouth scored three from a PSxG of 1.4. And flapping at the corner that led to West Ham’s winner was a dreadful look.",
      "",
      "Kelleher has been keeping the wrong company towards the foot of this list for most of his first season with the Bees but a couple of penalty saves has helped the Irishman reach a positive number.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season. Ramsdale hardly made the place his own so Pope returned and had very little to do against Palace and Wolves either side of a madness against Leeds.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before settling against Leeds then Liverpool. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton, making the clean sheet at Wolves a very welcome thing indeed. The battering by Everton, a groin twang, and benching rather less so but Big John fluffed his big chance.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way and performed pretty much as expected at Spurs. Didn’t make a single save at Fulham and only one against Burnley from his own defender.",
      "",
      "Not a number that screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1′. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider and beaten all ends up by Reece James’ free-kick from long range. Roy Keane suggested ‘a top goalkeeper’ would save Patrick Dorgu’s winner for Manchester United, which seemed typically harsh.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regained shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone hardly disgraced himself when he came in for Jose Sa but anyone keeping goal for Wolves is basically shifting deckchairs on the Titanic.",

      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri was back in. Briefly, as it turned out. Darlow took the gloves again for a serene outing against Fulham.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season – no keeper has faced fewer shots per 90 – and we questioned whether he had done enough on the rare occasion Arsenal have needed him. Against Brighton and Yankuba Minteh, he certainly did.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time. Little he could do to stop City scoring three. Giving Morgan Gibbs-White a clip late on to concede a penalty against Forest isn’t accounted for here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley before consecutive clean sheets against Forest and West Ham. Made not a single save against Liverpool.",
      "",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian has struggled to convince many Leeds fans and Daniel Farke hasn’t been impressed since the New Year, questioning Perri’s contribution against Manchester United and Newcastle. Unsurprisingly dropped when Fulham came to Elland Road.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa last summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning. Back now in place of Johnstone and kept a first clean sheet against West Ham in which he literally had zero shots to save. Newcastle gave him little more to do.",

      "Like the 2024/25 campaign, this season’s Premier League run-in risks being another damp squib.",
      "Arsenal look increasingly likely to finally win the Premier League title and do so at a canter; they have the most complete squad in the division, and Man City lack the necessary consistency and quality to hang onto their coattails until the final games of this season.",
      "The relegation picture also looks pretty set. Wolves and Burnley already feel like certainties to go down, while West Ham need a miraculous turnaround – which they appear incapable of producing – to bridge the gap to Nottingham Forest or Leeds United to get out of trouble.",
      "So all our hopes for the run-in rest on the race for European qualification, which is the least interesting of the three potential battles in the Premier League due to the minor stakes, with very little between a host of uninspiring sides below third-placed Aston Villa.",
      "Thankfully, the Premier League managerial scene is providing most of the drama, and it looks set to carry on giving in the coming months.",
      "READ: Premier League sack race: Slot not far behind Nuno and Frank in a grim race to the bottom",
      "There have been two huge departures from the dugout in recent weeks as Enzo Maresca and Ruben Amorim have exited Chelsea and Manchester United, owing to poor results and a challenge of the board, which rarely end well.",
      "And we suspect these two exits will only prove the tip of the iceberg, because we (or rather I) think 10 more managers will leave their respective clubs before next season…",
      "Starting with an obvious one, Oliver Glasner is being given a stay of execution after copying Amorim and Maresca in trying to be sacked for his “completely abandoned” outburst, but he has already confirmed that he will move on when his contract expires in the summer.",
      "AFC Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola and Fulham’s Marco Silva, too, are due to become free agents at the end of this campaign and will not have too much trouble landing a Champions League job, either at a Premier League or European club.",

Glasner favourite after Palace announcement\n* Who will be the next manager of Liverpool after Arne Slot sack? Alonso is available…",
      "Dr Tottenham gave West Ham a much-needed boost, but it is hard to see this amounting to anything; they clearly are one of the three poorest sides in the division. This means they should be punished for years of sleepwalking towards relegation, and this will leave Nuno Espirito Santo out of work again.",
      "The woes suffered by West Ham and Co. should let Nottingham Forest off the hook for their self-inflicted mess of a season, but this does not mean that Sean Dyche will remain in charge beyond this season.",
      "Dyche is Forest’s interim manager in all but name and Evangelos Marinakis will inevitably appoint a replacement before potentially reverting to the ex-Everton boss if/when his side finds themselves in the same position next year.",
      "Further up the league, Newcastle United’s Eddie Howe has benefited from the struggles of others as there has not been enough attention on his difficult season at St James’ Park.",
      "Newcastle, like most sides in the Premier League, have been marred by inconsistency and after drawing Aston Villa in the FA Cup and Man City putting them on the brink of Carabao Cup elimination, Howe’s job ‘could be under threat’ ahead of a ‘full review’ in the summer.",
      "A fresh start for both could be the best course of action as a result of constant tension behind the scenes, but Howe would land on his feet elsewhere and could even join Manchester United.",
      "Red Devils supporters are on cloud nine after Saturday’s thumping of arch-rivals Manchester City and are feeling newfound optimism with Michael Carrick at the wheel.",
      "If Man Utd’s win against Man City is not a false dawn, as it has been on many previous occasions, and they come on strong to seal a Champions League return under Carrick, there’s no escaping the fact that INEOS will be in a difficult position with fans backing a permanent appointment.",
      "This sets up a delicious repeat of the Erik ten Hag and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer situations for the neutrals, but Man Utd chiefs will probably think better of going down that road again and appoint a more established permanent boss instead.",
      "READ: Slot sack a ‘matter of time’ with Alonso available as ‘jealous’ Keane needs to ‘shut up’ about Man Utd",

      "There will be some substance to reports linking them with Maresca, but they may also provide an alternative for Liverpool-linked Xabi Alonso.",
      "Alonso’s exit from Real Madrid gifts FSG another opportunity to land their first-choice replacement for Jurgen Klopp, with Arne Slot potentially nearing an exit due to their dramatic decline this season and his dull football leading to boos from home supporters against Burnley.",

      "Morocco fought off Nigeria on penalties to set up a showcase final with Senegal, who beat Mohamed Salah’s Egypt 2-0 in their semi-final.",
      "There have been some standout performers at the 2026 AFCON. The big names like Salah and Victor Osimhen have been excellent, but here we’re focusing on players you might not have seen much of before.",
      "Here are seven AFCON stars we think deserve a shot in the Premier League after a strong tournament. Liverpool might want to get on the phone after missing out on Antoine Semenyo…",
      "",
      "Look, man – everyone has known about Nigeria and Atalanta forward Lookman for a while, but an elite Africa Cup of Nations campaign could be what finally earns him a long-awaited Premier League return.",
      "Only three players (Salah, Osimhen and Brahim Diaz) have scored more than Lookman at the tournament, and the former Fulham and Leicester City man is the top assister with four. That’s seven goal involvements in total, and he still has the final to play. Those numbers had Lookman as the highest-rated player on WhoScored at 8.08, with second-placed Salah on 7.73 before Nigeria beat Egypt on penalties in the third-place match.",
      "At 28 years old, Premier League clubs might be reluctant to spend big on Lookman, but the quality is clear to see. Another reservation clubs might have is how little impact he made during spells at Leicester and Fulham. If he doesn’t get another crack at the Premier League, he will forever be remembered for that awful Panenka penalty at the London Stadium.",
      "Penalties are a touchy subject for any Nigerian right now, and Lookman didn’t even step up in Wednesday’s shootout defeat to Morocco. As Osimhen wasn’t on the pitch, he was probably doing a Cristiano Ronaldo and saving himself for the glory as fifth taker.",
      "He won’t be the designated penalty taker if he goes to Liverpool – that will always be Salah – but if the Reds were to sign him, Lookman would provide much-needed cover behind the Egyptian legend. They could do a lot worse, and he’d be an ideal signing if Arne Slot wants someone capable of making an instant impact.",
      "Or maybe Lookman is not welcome at Anfield after his winner against Liverpool in 2021/22…",
      "READ: Is Bundesliga tax real? Lookman ranks low after Fulham, Leicester spells…",

      "Another player well known to the Premier League’s elite, Diomande looks certain to be the next big RB Leipzig sale, and a stellar AFCON with Ivory Coast has done his stock no harm.",
      "The former Rangers trialist is probably good enough to make an instant impact at Anfield, but at 19 years of age he is still raw and would likely need time to adapt to the Premier League.",
      "The teenager has caught the eye from the wing for Leipzig this season, notably scoring a hat-trick against a decent Eintracht Frankfurt side and previously going on a run of three goals and three assists in three Bundesliga games.",
      "Leipzig only missed their young star for one game – a home defeat to Bayer Leverkusen – and he was back in action following the German winter break, coming off the bench in Wednesday’s 2-0 win over Freiburg, no doubt wishing he was playing in an AFCON semi-final with Ivory Coast.",

      "Maza was linked with a move to the Premier League back in November 2024, with Newcastle United reportedly ahead of Southampton, Nottingham Forest, Leicester City, West Ham and Brentford in the race for his signature. The Magpies would have been a superb move, but he’ll be pretty glad he held out for Leverkusen.",

      "The 24-year-old was excellent for Real Betis before departing for the tournament, registering six goals and five assists in 18 matches across all competitions. At AFCON, he has just one assist across six appearances (four starts), but he’s impressed and should start in Sunday’s final.",
      "He feels more West Ham than anyone else, which is probably quite a damning indictment of a player.",
      "",
      "A move to Turkey looks more likely for AS Monaco winger Diatta, but he could certainly do a job in England. Naturally, it’s all of Besiktas, Galatasaray and Fenerbahce who have been linked with a player who seems very Super Lig.",
      "Diatta plays right-back for Senegal but is naturally an attacking player, which hints at a potential wing-back role if he does come to the Premier League. Leeds United or Crystal Palace, maybe? Certainly not Manchester United now Ruben Amorim is gone.",
      "Now would be the time to pick up a decent player on the cheap, with Diatta’s contract expiring in the summer.",
      "",
      "A strong AFCON could be what’s needed to get Ounahi out of Girona, where he has been the standout performer in a difficult 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Ounahi has experience earning a big move off the back of an international tournament, leaving Angers for Marseille in January 2023 after helping Morocco become the first African nation to reach a World Cup semi-final.",
      "The 25-year-old impressed then, though there were understandable reservations about his physical attributes. It would be fair to say Ounahi hasn’t bulked up much since 2022, but he remains a very technically gifted player, capable of producing a moment to turn a game around.

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Manchester City and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 1 with four more games each.",
      "Burnley were only selected once more – on the February midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (24 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £20.2m in 2024/25",
      "2nd) Aston Villa (23 games) – worth around £19.3m",

      "Michael Carrick, Manchester United and Arsene Wenger just made Ruben Amorim, Pep Guardiola and Nicky Butt among many others look really rather silly indeed.",
      "But there was justice at Old Trafford for one former Arsenal manager…",
      "",
      "1) It will presumably and obviously be after his post-game debrief with Sir Alex Ferguson, but Michael Carrick must be looking forward to a congratulatory phone call from the delirious Arsene Wenger on his 5-0 thrashing of Manchester City.",
      "",
      "2) The phrase that kept cropping up to explain how Manchester United landed on Carrick as their five-month safety blanket over closest contender Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was “more hands-on”.",
      "It would be foolish to draw conclusions on that assessment after Carrick’s first 90 minutes in charge, even before taking into account how Solskjaer inflicted this exact result and scoreline on Pep Guardiola at Old Trafford six years ago, down to the 11-7 shot count.",
      "These are not really the games on which Carrick ought to be judged. Ruben Amorim beat Liverpool, Chelsea and Newcastle this season but paid in part for mediocre displays, draws and defeats against teams in the bottom half. Those are the fixtures upon which this Champions League qualification charge must be built.",
      "But what a result and what a performance, indelibly engineered by a coach determined and talented enough to make this work. The game plan and patterns of play were clear, the tactics were exquisite, the team selection was exemplary and the substitutions were superb. Carrick does indeed appear to be at the wheel.",
      "",
      "3) The biggest yet most predictable call was the reinstatement of Kobbie Mainoo to the starting line-up for the first time this season in a game not against Grimsby.",
      "Carrick referred to the 20-year-old’s experience in games of such magnitude as part of the reason for his inclusion and Mainoo did “thrive” as the Manchester United manager predicted, excelling in a midfield two alongside the brilliant Casemiro in front of a back four.",
      "That was the template for the club’s best defensive display of the entire campaign. Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox were right all along.",
      "Patrick Dorgu didn’t look particularly anxious either when scoring the nerve-settling second. The whole experience felt like a proper cleansing of the Amorim era, the latest in a long line of turned corners in this infernal Manchester United maze.",
      "",
      "4) With that said, it was funny to see something return alongside Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire, Casemiro, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo to the Manchester United starting line-up: the team leaks.",
      "It did Manchester City no good, of course. But they’ll probably want to clamp down on that again soon.",
      "",
      "5) There is a flipside to that coin; Manchester City were atrocious.",
      "Three narrow offside calls and the excellence of Gianluigi Donnarumma spared them a more humiliating shot of the Old Trafford scoreboard as a makeshift defence eventually combusted, the midfield was bypassed and an imposing attack collapsed in on itself.",
      "Manchester City were the better team for 20, maybe 25 minutes either side of half time and even then were held at arm’s length by a vulnerable opponent who not only comfortably contained them, but posed a far greater and more consistent threat.",
      "A four-game winless run at the stage of the season when they generally reach their most imposing form would be damning even if they weren’t about to pluck a second of the league’s best players to make themselves the world’s biggest spenders in this January transfer window.",
      "Much like Antoine Semenyo can’t be a one-man solution to their problems going forward, Marc Guehi alone is no panacea to those defensive issues.",
      "",
      "6) There are injuries in that backline, but the Manchester United opener highlighted systemic and structural issues too.",
      "Within seconds of Rayan Cherki lofting in Manchester City’s latest imprecise, actively damaging set piece, the hosts had launched a three-on-two attack from which Mbeumo would score.",
      "It was his flick which created it after Maguire headed Cherki’s delivery back at him, isolating the Frenchman who was guarding a good 20 yards of space – and with it any prospect of the sort of quick counter Manchester United had leaned on all game.",
      "For Cherki to be deployed as that screen was amateurish and whether Manchester United’s jumble of coaches highlighted it as a potential point of interest before the game or the players sensed an impromptu opportunity to target it, that failure is on Guardiola and his staff.",
      "",
      "7) The visitors did not look much more stable in open play. Even beyond their two permissible United goals and three others that were disallowed, Manchester United had the game’s better chances.",
      "Maguire clattered the bar with a header from a corner. Casemiro should have scored from the rebound of Amad’s saved shot. Dorgu and Mbeumo tested Donnarumma from crosses, both of which were aimed at Manchester City’s right-hand side.",
      "Matheus Nunes cannot possibly be so important to this team that his absence reduces them to such a quivering wreck.",
      "The starkest sight was of Rodri drowning in midfield, passing the ball to opponents on the edge of his own area and being booked for pulling back Dorgu in the centre circle for his only foul of the entire game. Perhaps he needs a refresher course.",
      "",
      "8) It was probably a game too far for the encouraging Alleyne-Khusanov partnership, especially flanked with unfamiliar full-backs.",
      "Nico O’Reilly was booked within a couple of minutes of his half-time introduction for the former – which meant he was restricted against Matheus Cunha for the second goal – while Rico Lewis really struggled on the right and picked up a yellow himself soon after.",
      "Putting Rodri in front of that defence, with Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva as nominal runners tracking back, certainly felt like a choice. Nico Gonzalez might have usurped this current version of his midfield compatriot in terms of importance to Manchester City.",
      "",
      "9) The best part of a really quite uneventful and tiresome first half was Anthony Taylor shaking his head like an exasperated parent after watching Maguire shepherd the ball out for a goal kick before gently placing Bernardo into that dip between the pitch and the advertising hoardings.",
      "",
      "10) It is difficult to quantify but Maguire instinctively feels like the world’s best New Manager’s First Game player. The man oozes back-to-basics, keep-it-compact, fresh-start energy.",
      "He even treated the supporters to a trademark marauding run past the halfway line on the hour mark, just after Casemiro dispossessed Erling Haaland with a stunning wraparound sliding tackle. Imagine even contemplating that sentence under Amorim. It is mad what a little shot of confidence and clarity can do for a player.",
      "",
      "11) It was a particularly chastening experience for Haaland, who taken off in a triple substitution at 2-0 down with ten minutes remaining. Guardiola entrusted Divine Mukasa with closing that deficit in the second Premier League appearance of his career.",
      "Those 14 Haaland touches can be compartmentalised if they are accompanied by a goal but Manchester United stymied and stifled him exceptionally well. That absurd start to the season has now bled into one goal in seven games.",
      "That, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt might be interested to learn, is also four wins in five meetings against Haaland for Lisandro Martinez, and a second clean sheet. The speed with which he nipped ahead of the static Norwegian to intercept one pass suggested that even if Haaland could “pick Martinez up and run with him”, he’d never get close enough.",
      "",
      "12) Gary Neville calling Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes “problematic” on commentary felt a bit harsh.",
      "",
      "13) Mbeumo’s flicks were particularly potent. That combination of clever movement to pull a defender out of position, followed by a deft touch to a team-mate, wreaked havoc with Manchester City.",
      "It formed the basis of how the first offside goal and his own opener were constructed.",
      "And there is little point commending the range, weight and choice of Fernandes’ passing. For a player who bears almost the entire creative burden of the team at times, to so consistently make the right decision under pressure is ludicrous. Manchester United will not replace him easily.",
      "",
      "14) Carrick’s pre-match message to the omitted Cunha and Benjamin Sesko that “finishing the game is even more important these days” was realised in stunning fashion.",
      "Sesko never made it off the bench but Cunha’s impact was immediate and obvious. His first touch was a flying block on the edge of his own box from a Bernardo shot, then the Brazilian generated an assist out of nothing with his push to the byline and glorious delivery for Dorgu, who caught Lewis napping.",
      "As Carrick said, and as rarely seemed the case under Amorim, “we’ve got a good squad of players”. Manchester United might just have a manager capable of using it properly on a game-by-game basis.",
      "",
      "15) The contrast with Manchester City was evident. Cherki was a slight improvement on Foden in the minutes after his introduction but soon settled into the general rule of his team’s mediocrity, by which point the only attacking option Guardiola could call upon from his bench was either Mukasa or, at a push, Tijanji Reijnders.",
      "While Manchester United had a £74m unused substitute, Manchester City had basically no Plan B to an already flawed Plan A.",
      "That chequebook might not be closed even when Guehi shuffles through the door. Arsenal are firmly in their heads.",
      "",
      "16) Six offsides is the most Manchester United have had in a game since mid-February, and they scored from three of those attacks. It will be interesting to see if Carrick and his lambasted coaching team come up with something as effective against those low blocks.",
      "Manchester United have an ‘ambitious aim’ to seal Champions League qualification without making a winter signing, but this is only doable on one condition.",
      "Man City striker Erling Haaland will only leave the Etihad Stadium for Real Madrid or another club if they receive over €200m, according to reports.",
      "The Spurs job would be bloody hard for the right man, whoever that might be. But Thomas Frank is still the wrong man, and must still be sacked.",
      "While the reporting around Manchester United remains like this, they are f***ed. Why can’t we just celebrate a very good win?",
      "Arsenal are in both the Premier League winners and losers columns, with Manchester United and Everton’s DNA shining and Unai Emery apparently cursed.",
      "Liverpool are on the second longest unbeaten run of all clubs this Premier League season, behind Arsenal. But Arne Slot knows it is a flimsy invincibility."

      "Many former players have claimed that Man Utd are yet to play with ‘United DNA’ since Sir Alex Ferguson left the club as manager in 2013.",
      "But Rooney was impressed by Carrick reverting to that type of football in an impressive victory over Man City, in which Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu scored the goals in a result which could have been even more comfortable.",
      "Rooney told BBC Sport: “Obviously I’m absolutely delighted. I think the team spirit, the work rate, the energy, everything about that team was fantastic today. I’m absolutely buzzing for the players, for the fans – the fans have been starved of that over the last few years. I know it’s only one performance but I think everyone could see how exciting that team can be.",

      "“You hear everyone, especially us as ex-players, talk about the United DNA and that has just shown what it is. Work rate off the ball, wingers getting back filling in and helping out the full-backs.",
      "“And the goals; crosses in the box and desire to get on the end of it. The first goal, counter-attack, sitting in and breaking fast – that is the United DNA and that was what we’ve been missing. And hopefully this continues.",
      "“The work rate, the shape, the organisation of Manchester United today, the desire to get back and double up and help your teammates out and tackle and run without the ball, as quickly backwards and you do forwards. I think that was really evident today.”",
      "Goalscorer Mbeumo thought the atmosphere at Old Trafford was “unbelievable” against Man City and claims Man Utd “used the energy of the fans” to win.",
      "When asked if it was the most special day he’s had at Man Utd so far, Mbeumo replied: “I think it’s one of them. Scoring in front of this stand is unbelievable. Derby is even more and like Licha [Martinez] said, we used the energy of the fans today. This place was unbelievable today.”",

      "“It is a bit of everything. It is not easy because we only had three days. Because we are all together, we all want to win the same way with the same aim.”",
      "Mbeumo’s team-mate Lisandro Martinez, added: “Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Being here with the fans, with the team we really know how we suffer during the season. But the only way is putting the face here and showing here who we are. Today is the best moment to do it. Not just the players on the pitch, the staff, everyone was part of that.",

      "Sunday 18 January 2026 14:38, UK",
      "Lisandro Martinez has hit back at Paul Scholes and invited him to his house for talks after the former Man Utd midfielder criticised the defender ahead of the Manchester derby.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast ahead of Saturday's game, which United went on to win 2-0, Scholes and his former United team-mate Nicky Butt made fun of Martinez's 5ft 7in size.",
      "Butt joked Man City striker Erling Haaland, who stands at 6ft 4in, \"would pick Martinez up and run with him\" like a \"dad after school running down the road with a little toddler\" before Scholes laughed and said that \"he'd score then throw him in the net\".",
      "After shutting out Haaland as United kept a clean sheet against their rivals, Martinez was asked about Scholes' comments and said: \"Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to me wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.",

      "With Bruno Fernandes the first man to create so many big chances against Pep Guardiola's Man City, Adam Bate looks at why Man Utd's playmaker needs to be in his best position. Also in The Debrief: Florentino's tackling and Newcastle's predictability",
      "Monday 19 January 2026 09:25, UK",
      "",
      "Manchester United's thrilling performance in their derby win over Manchester City on Saturday has naturally sparked talk of them being back, a restoration of sorts after Ruben Amorim's exit. That remains to be seen but for Bruno Fernandes it seems clearer.",
      "Back in his best position, restored to that No 10 role, he produced some performance at Old Trafford. Having been denied a goal and an assist by the offside flag in the first half, he eventually set up the opener - and made history against Pep Guardiola's City.",
      "In his decade in charge, no player had ever created four big chances in a Premier League game against them. In fact, Fernandes is the only player to do it against any team this season. And he has done it twice, having also achieved it in beating Wolves last month.",
      "Fernandes is responsible for three of the four occasions that a player has created four big chances in a Premier League game in the past three seasons, a reminder that while sometimes cast as part of the problem, he is surely among the victims of United's malaise.",
      "His efforts against City saw him bring up 600 chances created in his Premier League career, which is 168 more than Kevin De Bruyne, who is the next person on the list, since Fernandes' debut in the competition. Astonishing in what has often been an underwhelming side.",
      "Those numbers also indicate that he has not exactly been stifled under Amorim. In fact, he tops the charts for chances created this season too. Even so, it must make sense to get Fernandes closer to the opposition goal where he can do more damage from open play.",
      "The heatmaps from his Premier League career at United show that he was doing more of his work in his own half under Amorim, whose preferred formation does not have a natural role for a true No 10. Michael Carrick must be tempted to unleash him from there now.",
      "Because he can still make the difference. United's owners will look to Fernandes' age and the potential money that is on offer from Saudi Arabia and make their calculations. But there is also Champions League money to consider. And this Fernandes can deliver that.",
      "Florentino's performance in Burnley's surprise 1-1 draw at Liverpool did not showcase the same levels of creativity but he deserves huge credit for his attempts to shut down the reigning Premier League champions at Anfield. The midfielder made nine tackles.",
      "It is only the fifth time that a player has made nine tackles in a Premier League game this season - and Florentino has been responsible for two of them, having also done so against West Ham in November. This was perhaps his best game in a Burnley shirt.",
      "It was not perfect. He gave away a penalty that Dominik Szoboszlai missed. And some fans have been a little frustrated by his lack of care in possession. But his combative qualities were ideally suited to this particular challenge against Arne Slot's side.",
      "Perhaps Newcastle's goalless draw at Wolves should not have come as a surprise given that they started the season with three stalemates in their first three Premier League matches on the road. But it is just another example of their lack of cutting edge.",
      "Eddie Howe's side have now failed to score in three of their last four away from home. In fact, their only two Premier League victories on their travels have come after taking the lead inside two minutes. When charged with breaking teams down, they often struggle.",
      "Nick Woltemade has become something of a scapegoat for that, having not scored in his last seven appearances. But Newcastle's creativity problems run deeper. They are too passive in attack for a team that is at his best when showing real intensity in their play.",
      "Indeed, at Molineux they became the team to have registered the highest passing accuracy without a shot on target in the first half of a Premier League game since Opta began collecting such records. Wolves dropped deep. All Newcastle could do was cross the ball.",
      "Where was the movement inside, the movement around Woltemade? Wolves were happy to let Newcastle have the ball wide. Better chances might have come with some cute play in the half spaces. Without it, Howe's team can look a little one-dimensional.",

      "\"It has always been about the same thing, the love of it, just that feeling of being a football player, on the pitch, running after a ball. Obviously, you want to win and play in the best possible teams you can. But I think that love of football never leaves you.\"",
      "His new team Wolfsburg are not exactly flying in the Bundesliga. Earlier this month, they lost 8-1 to Bayern Munich. \"Not nice at all.\" But Eriksen scored as they bounced back with a win over St Pauli. \"We had a lot of stuff we had to prove to ourselves,\" he says.",
      "He also provided the cross for the late equaliser against Heidenheim at the weekend. Watching him up close on a bitterly cold day at the Volkswagen Arena, fans of the midfield maestro can rest assured that, even at the age of 33, the old Eriksen magic remains.",
      "His five chances created in the game were as many as his team-mates managed between them and included one lovely ball over the top that should have brought the opening goal. Playing off the right, he drops deep, floats around, has freedom to roam.",
      "In his pomp at Tottenham, Eriksen did all that and more and was arguably the Premier League's outstanding creative force. A big claim but the numbers support that. During his Spurs career nobody provided more assists or created more chances than the Dane.",
      "He also scored more goals from outside the box than any other Premier League player in that time. Wolfsburg fans have not seen one yet but this Rolls-Royce of a player feels at home in Volkswagen country. \"I just had a gut feeling it would suit me,\" he explains.",
      "\"I could see myself playing for Wolfsburg, trying the Bundesliga. It is a very open league. One team can be 3-0 up in the last 10 minutes and it can still end up 3-3. There is a lot going on and every team wants to play a little bit. It is an exciting league to watch and to play in.\"",
      "Remarkably, the Heidenheim game came 16 years to the day since Eriksen made his professional debut for Ajax. \"Has it been 16 years since my debut? I have had a fun 16 years,\" he says. \"It is still fun.\" But the hair is thinning and those team-mates are getting younger.",
      "\"All the new players coming up, they are born in the 2000s, even the late 2000s. That is weird,\" he says, smiling a little, amusing himself at the thought. \"I am around such young kids. At the same time, although in football terms I am obviously very old, I do not feel old.\"",
      "So, how exactly has football changed over these past 16 years, then? Where to begin. \"It has gone through different stages in terms of possession, then a bit of tactical work, then about possession again, then a lot of pressing, then a lot of athleticism,\" he explains.",
      "\"Now, there are a lot of stats going around, a lot of numbers you have got to hit, so there is a lot more time spent looking at the computer. You have to hit a certain amount of kilometres in training just to make sure you are in the right place for the next game.",
      "\"Years ago, that was not there. It was just on a hunch. Do you feel good? Okay, you are ready to go. Now, everything else is taken into consideration. What is your load? How many high-speed runs do you need to do? How many extra sprints do you need to do?\"",
      "He sounds a little bemused. \"Even strikers now are the first guys to press. Double runs, triple runs.\" But he has been able to adapt. And he has done so having come through that moment nobody will ever be able to forget at the European Championship in 2021.",
      "He almost lost more than his career that day in Copenhagen but recovered to add more chapters to his football story. Brentford offered a route back before he spent three seasons at Manchester United. But there was no role for him under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"As a player, I did not feel he was going to look my way, in every sense. Of course, then you struggle a bit football-wise. But person-wise, we had a decent relationship, nothing wrong there. He has one idea. Maybe I was a style of player not really suited for him.\"",
      "He insists that he wants the best for the club and believes \"a new manager brings new ideas\" and sees it as a \"chance for everyone\" again. Kobbie Mainoo, especially? \"I hope for anyone, it does not matter if it is Kobbie or someone else. I hope the club has success.\"",
      "Eriksen is well placed to assess the issues at Spurs too, having played under Thomas Frank at Brentford. Is he surprised to see Frank's struggles? \"Yes and no,\" he says. \"I mean, the pressure is bigger. Of course, Brentford for a long time was a safe place.\"",
      "He adds: \"Now, he is in a new place with new eyes and people want something else. I hope he gets the time to change it and see what he can do. But I know football moves quickly and there are a lot of new ideas this week and then next week it will be another idea.\"",
      "If Eriksen sounds like he has seen it all in football, one wonders what is left for him. The World Cup playoffs in March are on his mind. \"The chance to play at the World Cup would be special. That is the first aim and to hopefully have a big tournament after,\" he says.",
      "His contract at Wolfsburg has another season to run after this and he is determined to see an improvement. \"We have lost way too many games this season. But we are on a better run now than we were before.\" As for the personal goals, well, they never change.",
      "\"Just to keep improving and just to have fun on a football pitch. I mean, that is what I have been doing for so many years,\" But does he cherish all this a bit more after what he has been through? \"I think I am just enjoying the moment, as I was before,\" he adds.",
      "\"But at the same time, I know what you can lose. So, I am happy with what I have. Maybe I am not cherishing it more but I am just enjoying what is ahead.\" What is certain is that we should cherish every opportunity we get to see Christian Eriksen playing football.",

      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Dalot (6), Maguire (7), Martinez (7), Shaw (7), Casemiro (7), Mainoo (7), Bruno Fernandes (8), Dorgu (7), Mbeumo (8), Amad (7)\n\n\nSubs: Cunha (7), Ugarte (6), Heaven (n/a) Mount (7)\n\n\nMan City:  Donnarumma (7), Lewis (5), Khusanov (6), Alleyne (5), Ake (4), Rodri (6), Semenyo, (6), Foden (4), Bernado Siva (6), Doku (5), Haaland (3)\n\n\nSubs: O’Reilly (6), Cherki (5), Mukasa (n/a), Ait-Nouri (n/a), Reijnders (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mbeumo",

      "It wasn't the last occasion, though, as Mason Mount came close to making it a derby day demolition when he thought he had added a third off the bench only for that to be struck off too.",
      "United's record number of offsides this season summed up a front-foot display that began when Harry Maguire's third-minute header crashed off the bar. Amad also saw a chance hit the goal frame late on with no side hitting the woodwork more than United in the Premier League this season.",

      "Mbeumo down the middle, the player with the most runs in behind this season in the league per 90 down the middle proved a masterstroke. Fernandes, the league's chief creator, back in an advanced No 10 role was equally fitting as he made his ninth goal of the season.",
      "\"United's DNA\" has been questioned this week. Is it real? Should United underpin their whole plan on what feels like folklore? Should United move away from Sir Alex Ferguson-ball? Sir Alex was in the director's box smiling all afternoon long - why? Because Carrick made it all appear simple by taking it back to what United know best, in the best way, on the best possible occasion.William Bitibiri",
      "Tottenham are drifting towards a conversation they should never be part of.",
      "The 2-1 defeat to West Ham wasn't just another London derby loss to shrug off. It was a warning flare. Spurs are now priced at 50/1 for relegation, odds that still scream long shot, but it still tells an uncomfortable story. They are now just 10 points above the Hammers in the drop zone.",
      "And that, in itself, is the most damning indictment of all for Thomas Frank.",
      "Tottenham, a club in the Champions League and a holder of a European trophy, are better than this.",
      "Form is the driver of this narrative and it is ugly. Just four wins from the last 18 matches gives Frank a win percentage of 22 per cent. That is relegation-form. Spurs are leaking goals, losing control of games they should dominate and looking short on belief when momentum turns against them.",
      "There was a time when Tottenham pulled the trigger quickly in moments like this. Nuno Espirito Santo found that out the hard way. The irony will not be lost on Spurs supporters that the man now sitting in the West Ham dugout - having just beaten them - was dismissed with a 53 per cent win rate, more than double what Frank has delivered across the last 18 games.",
      "Frank was appointed to stabilise and progress the club. The opposite is happening.Lewis Jones",
      "Erling Haaland is Manchester City's greatest derby goalscorer of the Premier League era, but you would not have known it watching the 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford. This was a pale imitation of the machine-like striker that has devastated United on so many occasions.",
      "Pep Guardiola pulled him off once it was clear the game was over, soon after Patrick Dorgu crashed in United's second. The striker finished with 14 touches, three successful passes and not a single shot on target. City were lost without his goal threat.",
      "The fact Haaland was brought off for an 18-year-old midfielder, Divine Mukasa, with 15 minutes of prior Premier League experience shows how sparse the current attacking options are for Guardiola. Omar Marmoush's return from AFCON can't come soon enough.",
      "The City manager warned of Haaland being exhausted before the derby and his deteriorating output highlights the problem. The striker has not scored a non-penalty goal for seven games, his longest run without one since he signed for Borussia Dortmund in 2020.",
      "City have already signed winger Antoine Semenyo and are set to bring in centre-back Marc Guehi, but they could do with a striker to ease the burden on Haaland. Strength in depth has been a crucial factor behind Arsenal pulling away in the title race.",
      "There is still time to catch the Premier League leaders, although City's run of four games without a win does not instil confidence. No surprise that has coincided with Haaland's struggles in front of goal.",
      "The only world in which a title twist is imaginable is one in which Haaland is fit and firing on all cylinders. He looks in need of a rest and thankfully for City they have a rare off week before a home game against Wolves.",
      "Until Haaland rediscovers some form, City have a big problem.Zinny Boswell",
      "Mikel Arteta has talked up the importance of rotation as Arsenal compete in four different competitions. They are on a gruelling run of four consecutive away games. But it still seemed strange that his most influential attacker was named on the bench against Nottingham Forest.",
      "There seemed no obvious need for it given Bukayo Saka had started only two of Arsenal's last four fixtures. Especially given the size of the opportunity presented by Manchester City's slip-up. What followed at the City Ground put the decision under even greater scrutiny.",
      "Arsenal laboured until Arteta's triple change early in the second half, after which Saka, on for Noni Madueke, looked by far the most likely player to make the breakthrough. He very nearly did, denied by Matz Sels at full-stretch when his header was bound for the corner.",
      "The draw is far from disastrous. Arsenal have added to their lead at the top of the table. But Arsenal supporters are entitled to wonder whether the outcome would have been different had Saka started the game rather than come into it late.Nick Wright",
      "Full-backs at Liverpool are going to be judged harshly. The shadow of those before you is long. But Milos Kerkez has stopped looking like a player learning his surroundings and started performing like one shaping them. Liverpool didn't get the result they wanted against Burnley but there were more positive signs that Kerkez is starting to look like the player they signed from Bournemouth.",
      "His game is built on intensity, but what has impressed most over recent weeks is control.",
      "After being likened to a youth player earlier this season by Gary Neville, there is a calmness to his positioning now, a better understanding of when to go and when to stay. Early-season exuberance has been refined into efficiency. He provided a real thrust down the left against Burnley and more assurance in his decision-making. No player created more chances (6) than him as he continually penetrated with conviction down the left flank.",
      "He looks stronger, sharper, and more attuned to the demands Slot wants. It bodes well for the future.Lewis Jones",
      "Chelsea won a game in which the spotlight once again shone firmly on Robert Sanchez - but this time, he stood up to it.",
      "The Chelsea goalkeeper has spent much of the last few seasons under constant scrutiny, with questions raised about his decision-making and reliability. On another afternoon, that pressure could easily have told. Brentford created enough chances to punish Chelsea, particularly in transition, and Sanchez was tested early and often.",
      "This was not a flawless Chelsea performance, but two things stood out.",
      "First, Sanchez’s response to pressure. The Spaniard produced several crucial saves, most notably racing off his line to deny Kevin Schade when the Brentford forward was clean through, moments that could easily have shifted the momentum of the game. For a player whose confidence has been questioned, those interventions mattered.",
      "Secondly, Chelsea’s growing ability to manage moments of danger. Even when Brentford threatened to force their way back into the contest, Chelsea remained composed enough to see the game out, with Sanchez providing a calm presence behind a defence that has not always looked settled.",
      "There will still be debate around Chelsea’s long-term solution in goal, but on this occasion, Robert Sanchez delivered when it mattered, and Chelsea took full advantage at the other end.",
      "Sometimes survival is just as important as style.Sam Cohen",
      "All is not well at Crystal Palace. The signs have perhaps been there for some times, certainly in terms of performances and results, but the last 36 hours have blown the roof off.",
      "First, there were the revelations that both Oliver Glasner and Marc Guehi were heading for the exit. Rumours had circulated for some time on both and were perhaps not a surprise, but the manner in which the Austrian manager delivered them was.",
      "Usually a calm character, Friday's news conference and Glasner's bombshells pointed towards a shift at the club - one that just nine months ago, were basking in FA Cup glory.",
      "And after a 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, in which Glasner says he was unable to bring on any substitutes to help the team, the manager took aim at the club's hierarchy over the timing of Guehi's departure.",
      "It's a direct challenge to the chairman - back me or sack me. So far, by Glasner's calculations, Parish hasn't done the former and managers who have challenged the club this season have often found themselves ousted not long after.",
      "On the pitch, it's now ten games and over a month without a win for Crystal Palace in all competitions. They are missing the likes of Ismaila Sarr and Daniel Munoz, although they should return soon.",
      "That will give the Eagles a much needed boost, but will likely do little to repair the relationship between manager and chairman. How that plays out for the remainder of the season will be an intriguing prospect.Charlotte Marsh",
      "The Stadium of Light has always been one of football's great grounds, and this season, Sunderland have made it their fortress.",
      "The Black Cats remain unbeaten there in the Premier League this season, which might come as somewhat of a surprise considering they lost their last three regular season games at the ground last term.",
      "Perhaps what is most impressive is the ability to come from behind to take points. They did so again against Crystal Palace on Saturday, and never looked harangued when going behind.",
      "Rege Le Bris praised the maturity and confidence of his team, and they certainly showed it. Especially in the second half, they remained patient before finally getting their deserved winner.",
      "Along with Leeds, the two promoted sides are harnessing the magic of their home support to help keep them in the league. In fact, Sunderland are just three points from the top four - a European push is more likely to happen than a relegation battle.",
      "It's been a sensational return to the Premier League for Sunderland and it will take some performance to end their unbeaten home league run.Charlotte Marsh",
      "It was one of those points that felt like considerably more than a point.",
      "Scott Parker's masterplan to take something from Anfield didn't involve conceding 32 shots, or Dominic Szoboszlai crashing a penalty off the bar, but it did without doubt revolve around the notion of staying in the fight.",
      "Burnley didn't flinch when Liverpool knocked on the door in the opening half hour. They didn't flinch when Florian Wirtz forced it open, either.",
      "Despite their lead it was Liverpool playing with urgency after the break. Without a second it was inevitable that Burnley would break out of their low block, if momentarily, and push for an equaliser.",
      "That part of the plan was executed to perfection. Ibrahima Konate nearly turned his ball into his own net moments before Marcus Edwards brought Burnley level.",
      "\"You never say die\" said Kyle Walker of his side's showing on Saturday. On a day when Leeds and West Ham won, Burnley's rope-a-dope point at Anfield could yet be pivotal in the battle to stay alive in the Premier League.Michael Morrow",
      "The screams of delight from Elland Road after Lukas Nmecha's last-gasp winner were so loud that you probably could have heard them from Barnsley.",
      "That's been the story at home for Leeds recently. They're now unbeaten across their last five Premier League home matches - gaining points from Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd, and now an in-form Fulham side - and that run doesn't look like ending any time soon.",
      "Farke's revamped side have embodied a powerful, gritty style of play that the home fans are finding it easy to get behind.",
      "Their win today was earmarked by two 10-minute periods in which the powerful Leeds attack terrorised the frail Fulham defence. Leeds' two best chances - Calvert-Lewin's inexplicable miss from six yards out, and Brendan Aaronson's scuffed half-volley one-on-one with Bernd Leno - came when the home crowd was spurring them on the most, and should've resulted in goals.",
      "Just when the game looked gone, and Fulham's defence grew in confidence, the Elland Road roar got Leeds back in the game, just in time to rattle Fulham into three mistimed tackles, in turn creating the winning opportunity.",
      "\"To play at Elland Road, we all know what it means. The home support is unbelievable and they make it hard for the opposition,\" said opposition manager Marco Silva before the game. \"It is never easy to play there.\"",
      "And so it proved, as it has for almost every opposition side of late.",
      "With Farke's side continuing to grind out results with the help of their home crowd, it's hard to see any team remaining unfazed with a trip to Elland Road on the calendar.Noah Langford",
      "Fulham's recent unbeaten run has been so impressive that recent clamour for reinforcements seemed to have taken a back seat.",
      "Today's loss at Leeds is a harsh reality check for Marco Silva and his men, and demonstrates what Fulham fans know all too well - that the club will stagnate without new signings imminently.",
      "New injuries to Sasa Lukic and Emile Smith Rowe may take the headlines, but they are the least of Fulham's problems. The whites had just seven touches in the Leeds United box, their fewest in a Premier League game since December 2024.",
      "With Rodrigo Muniz out until February and Raul Jimenez having a poor game, Silva's only option up top from the bench was Jonah Kusi-Asare, the 18-year old Bayern loanee who is yet to score a professional goal outside the German fourth division.",
      "There are two weeks left in the January window - despite being heavily linked with attacking reinforcements, Fulham are yet to make a signing.",
      "\"Everything we try and do this January, we are relying on it. We are completely aligned,\" Silva said at a recent press conference.",
      "\"For me, it's tougher than the summer. If you sign players, they have to make an impact. Not just short term, for the long term.\"",
      "Should they fail to bring new faces, Fulham will be left not just short of players to make a push for Europe, but also possibly short of a manager to match their ambition come the end of the season.Noah Langford",
      "Nottingham Forest had one of the best defences in the Premier League last season but clean sheets have been hard to come by this term. Saturday's stalemate with Arsenal was just their fifth of the campaign - all of them have come under Sean Dyche.",
      "Holding the Premier League leaders felt very much like a Nuno Espirito Santo display from last season and there was a reason for it.",
      "This was the first game since August when Forest could start Matz Sels, Ola Aina, Murillo, Nikola Milenkovic and Neco Williams in a match. That was the back five that gave opposition attacks so little joy last term and it was the same for Arsenal on Saturday.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo made 15 clearances between them. Williams won seven duels when he was up against Noni Madueke and Bukayo Saka. Out of the back four, Aina won most possessions in the defensive and middle thirds.",
      "But in front of them was the star of the show in Elliot Anderson, winning 12 out of his 15 duels. Only William Saliba made more ball recoveries than the England international, who won the battle with Declan Rice in midfield.",
      "Forest may have been dragged closer to the drop zone by West Ham winning but if they keep defending like this, they will be fine in terms of survival.Sam Blitz",

      "Gary Neville believes Michael Carrick's derby win at Old Trafford showed the Manchester United way can work in modern football.",
      "With only three days of preparation, United's new head coach successfully brought back 4-4-2 and delivered a statement performance that reminded Neville of the club he used to play for.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville added.",
      "\"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"I'm sorry, you can play that way in modern football, you've just watched 90 minutes of it, 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "Neville added: \"It's not a time to say that Manchester United will sustain this and carry up the league, this has got to be a bridge towards potentially getting a European place, top five would be amazing.",
      "\"But this is not the return of Manchester United, it's the return of at least something that looks like the club. It's been a pale imitation this last many years really. It's been awful. Some of the performances here, you have to see a good one to remind you about how bad it has been.\"",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's opener came from a devastating counter-attack and wonderful combination play with captain Bruno Fernandes, no longer restricted to playing as a holding midfielder.",
      "\"I got quite emotional when that goal went in, because I thought, 'that's what I have been asking for, it's what everyone in this ground's been asking for'.",
      "\"Those players have set themselves a standard today, I have to say, they've set themselves a standard in attitude, in aggression, in positivity when they're playing with intent and playing through the lines, everything. You cannot drop below that.\"",
      "Neville felt Fernandes was Eric \"Cantona-esque\" back playing in the No 10 role after Ruben Amorim had so stubbornly stuck with him as a deep midfielder.",
      "\"That's where he's got to play, be near to goal, be where you can hurt them, because he's a great player. We don't want to see him back in a midfield two in front of a back three.",
      "\"Is that where we want to see him? No, it's definitely not right. I just saw so many things that reminded me of what this club plays like, what their DNA is, what they should be.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always said Manchester United's system is such, you have a forward and then you have a No 10, it can be [Dwight] Yorke, it can be Cantona, it can be [Wayne] Rooney, it can be [Carlos] Tevez, it can be [Dimitar] Berbatov. Those players that just drop in off a striker, Scholes did it for a number of years.",
      "\"We've always had that most talented player close to our striker and feeding them, and that's what made me a little bit emotional on that goal.\"",
      "Before the game, Neville said Carrick's spell in charge should be limited to the rest of the season as he called on INEOS to bring in an experienced head coach.",

      "Friday 16 January 2026 18:08, UK",
      "I've had the pleasure of spending a bit of time with Michael Carrick in the last few months at two different charity events, the last being his own foundation's boot collection at Macclesfield FC recently.",
      "As I spoke to him off camera, I was left in awe.",
      "We were in a room with former Rochdale player Luke Matheson, who scored against Manchester United at the age of 16 in the Carabao Cup in 2019.",
      "Carrick, who was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's backroom staff at the time, remembered every moment of the game while talking to Matheson - whether it was details of the match or Rochdale's coaching staff and where they are now.",
      "One observation I have through my limited interactions with Carrick over these last few months is that he absolutely understands the significance of not just Manchester United, but how important football is as a tool to impact the community in various positive ways.",
      "As he repeatedly said in his first interview with the club, 'I am one of them,' he said when referring to the fan base at Old Trafford.",
      "You may ask, why is this important?",
      "Carrick takes over a club that seems to be at an all-time low. Not just in terms of results and missed opportunities this season, but in terms of morale and confidence - whether that is the players or the Old Trafford attendees.",
      "Being at Old Trafford after the 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Brighton, it was not about the performance or even about the result - it was more about what the loss meant in the grand context of where Manchester United are at.",
      "Call it a climax of sustained mismanagement or a rude-awakening of years of decline, facts are facts: this United team have reached record-low numbers - whether it is the first time they've been knocked out of both cups in the first round since 1982 or having their lowest games in a season in over 110 years.",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford was telling as well.",
      "A crowd who have remained as patient as possible, who have repeatedly been praised for that same trait, are losing faith with the team that is in front of them.",
      "It was telling after 14 months of Ruben Amorim (mostly) defending his players to the media and trying to protect them from the noise, Darren Fletcher had a different message to send after their FA Cup exit.",
      "In his last news conference as interim, Fletcher repeated that the responsibility has to be on the players in the squad to step up and change the fortunes at the club. He even sounded emotional towards the end. A man who has seen the highest of the highs at the club gave the impression he was left more than unimpressed by what he had seen.",
      "And that makes you wonder what Carrick's new backroom staff, which includes the likes of Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, will find as they take training for the first time this week.",
      "Will it be a team still reeling from Amorim's sacking, which happened just a couple of weeks ago?",
      "Amorim made it clear he had to essentially babysit the players at Carrington and they were not capable of carrying on through training sessions without him. I am not sure that was truly the case but it is easy to forget some, if not much of this squad, has now had five different voices coach and lead them since the start of last season.",
      "The team need consistency, time and more importantly - someone who can lead them.",
      "Whether we will see a repeat of the sad period that former caretaker Ralf Rangnick led or a resurgence which Carrick's competition for the role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, led during his interim stint... well, that is what will make United an intriguing story for the rest of the season.",
      "The good news for Carrick and United fans alike is he'll have much needed fire-power back in his squad for when they take on Manchester City this weekend, with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo having returned from AFCON.",
      "As they have shown in recent years, once again this season, this team have seemingly performed better against 'bigger' opposition this season and have notched impressive wins against Liverpool and Newcastle United for example.",
      "And who knows, maybe City will be the right type of opposition at the right time for this team.",
      "They have shown in draws against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month just how much they struggle to break down teams, especially when they sit in a low-to-mid block and that is the last thing you would expect to see from a City team who feel like the entertainers of the league at this present time.",
      "We know United entertained two former players in Carrick and Solskjaer in this process, but it is important to point out the hierarchy - including director of football Jason Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada - would argue they were not looking to capitalise on nostalgia.",
      "Instead they wanted an appointment who understood the club and could immediately hit the ground running, while also working in the current and relatively new leadership structure implemented at the club.",
      "Carrick certainly does have the above. He spent 12 years at the club as a player while also working under Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer during his last stint at the club as a coach.",
      "A balanced and determined individual who has grown from his last time at Old Trafford, it will be especially intriguing to see how Carrick develops the playing style he implemented at Middlesbrough. His 4-2-3-1 out of possession would morph into something more similar to a 3-2-5 when his side attacked, but his team perhaps lacked the firepower and flair required to maximise that type of system.",
      "Whether this United are capable of showing the fight and passion to rescue their season remains to be seen, but Carrick's calm and collected approach feels the right type of character required at a time this team could not be lower on confidence and form.",
      "But it almost feels pointless looking too closely at his stint at Middlesbrough. He would himself admit how much he learned from his first permanent managerial position in football and has wisely stayed out of other positions to digest the two and a half years he had at his previous club.",
      "Solskjaer felt like the right person to manage the club when he rejoined at the end of 2019. He gave United the lift they needed after the end of the Jose Mourinho era.",
      "Although he was sacked in November 2021 after a turbulent run of performances and results, he had an incredibly moving exit interview that was published by the club where he was practically in tears saying goodbye.",
      "There were undeniable highs from Solskjaer's reign and perhaps if history had been tweaked - the Europa League final springs to mind - maybe we would frame his managerial pedigree in a different way with a European trophy to his name.",
      "But do sequels often work, even if it is a temporary one?",
      "Solskjaer's return would have been a popular one. There is no doubting his connection and relationship to the club and its supporters but there would have been fair questions targeted at the hierarchy.",
      "Since INEOS' investment, they have attempted to modernise the club as much as they have felt is possible.",
      "A revamped and improved training ground; a more data-led approach for recruitment and analysis; a drive to become best in class in several departments.",
      "Going back to an appointment who worked under the previous regime led by Ed Woodward does not quite feel connected to the previous points mentioned.",
      "Unfortunately for the Norwegian, we cannot forget history. We have to remember how Solskjaer's reign ended in a chaotic, sad fashion.",
      "His final five matches at the club included a crushing 5-0 defeat at home to Liverpool, an incredibly one-sided 2-0 loss to Manchester City and a 4-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road.",
      "Context is required too. Perhaps what pulls at United fans' heartstrings is that, after finishing second in his second full season in charge, there is an argument the carpet was pulled under him rather than letting him develop his system and style of play.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when United should have reinforced in midfield and a youthful long-term striker, the club re-signed a 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo and added Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Ronaldo compromised the counter-attacking style of football Solskjaer had tried to implement, while Sancho never found a home in the team.",
      "So maybe Solskjaer does deserve a reprieve for how his managerial era at the club ended, but perhaps he needs to rebuild his career elsewhere before a return to Old Trafford in the future.",
