      "Manchester United have accepted that they will have 'no choice' but to accept a fee of less than £25million from Juventus to facilitate a move this summer. The Italian giants have refused to meet the Red Devils' asking price and the Premier League side are now set to negotiate a new fee.",
      "Sancho is not part of United's plans under Ruben Amorim and is in search of pastures new during the transfer window. United had hoped to sell the winger for £25m after signing him for £73m in 2021.",
      "But the former Borussia Dortmund winger is in the final year of his contract and spent last season on loan at Chelsea. The Blues opted to pay a £5m penalty to avoid signing the England international permanently this summer.",
      "As a result, Sancho has returned to Old Trafford but is training away from United's first team. The 25-year-old joins Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia in being told to report for training but only from 5pm — after Amorim's side have completed their work of the day.",
      "And with little more than six weeks of the transfer window remaining, the club appear to have accepted they will need to alter their demands to move Sancho on. Football Italia report that Old Trafford chiefs have ultimately recognised they will not receive the fee they have been holding out for and must negotiate a lower figure.",
      "Sancho is said to be keen on a move to Juve and prepared to wait for Igor Tudor's side to do a deal. The Turin team have stepped up negotiations as a result as they look to agree a deal with United.",
      "The wantaway star has seen his salary pose problems this summer with Chelsea unable to come to terms. But Sancho is said to be willing to take a pay-cut to to accept an €8m-a-year (£7m) deal — less than half his reported current wages of £300,000-a-week.",
      "Juve meanwhile are said to be willing offer players to United in order to come to an agreement with United. Dusan Vlahovic is among those available, with the Serbian striker also in the final year of his deal.",
      "United have previously been interested in the forward who was heavily linked with Arsenal before moving to Turin. Now, the 25-year-old looks set to leave.",
      "Douglas Luiz is also said to be on offer. The former Aston Villa midfielder, 27, spent five years at Aston Villa before making the switch to Serie A but has failed to cement his place.",
      "Timothy Weah is reported to be another option available. The winger recently turned down a move to Nottingham Forest, it is said.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "But while Cunha has plenty of new team-mates to meet, only one is in the same position as him. The only other player to be added to the first team fold is Diego Leon.",
      "United have seen two bids rejected for Bryan Mbeumo and deals have become hard to come by. The Red Devils have not been able to supplement their funds either, with Antony, Marcus Rashford, Tyrell Malacia, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho all still at the club rather than sold.",

It's understood that United's offer of a £55m fixed fee plus £7.5m in add-ons falls short of the £65m Brentford are demanding, with the Bees wanting most, if not all, of the money paid up front.",

      "Sporting CP's players were reportedly unsurprised by Viktor Gyokeres' absence from their pre-season training camp in the Algarve. It now seems only a matter of time before the Swedish striker completes a transfer to long-time admirers Arsenal.",
      "The race to sign Gyokeres, who has scored a staggering 97 goals in only 102 games for his Portuguese employers, has been the talk of the summer transfer window, with both the Gunners and Premier League rivals Manchester United keen to bolster their forward lines.",
      "Gyokeres supposedly turned his nose up at the idea of reuniting with Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford, and now, after he failed to return for Sporting's pre-season preparations this week and remains missing from their Algarve training camp, reports suggest his representatives are in London to seal a £69million move.",
      "Arsenal ambitiously hope a transfer can be completed by the end of this week, so the 27-year-old may join Mikel Arteta's side on their pre-season tour of Singapore.",
      "The Swede's training snub landed him in hot water, and he has since been slapped with a hefty fine and forced to apologise to his team-mates. However, it seems as though his peers saw this absence coming.",
      "Portuguese outlet A Bola reports that Gyokeres' potential exit has not been discussed openly within Sporting's cohort. However, many of the club's players anticipated the striker missing their pre-season in light of his potential Premier League switch.",
      "Sporting's coach, Rui Borges, is also thought to have expected Gyokeres to be absent from his plans for the upcoming season, and he has been preparing accordingly.",
      "Even the club's president, Frederico Varandas, admitted that it is incredibly likely Gyokeres will depart this summer, with the Emirates now looking like his new home.",
      "\"If you ask me today, there is a strong possibility that Viktor will leave,\" Varandas admitted last month. \"In the last few weeks, we have been keeping an eye on the market. I saw a player like Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go to Arsenal for £56m.",
      "\"I saw two players being sold in the Premier League, Matheus Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo, forwards who do not have the quality of Viktor, in my opinion. [They] were sold for around £65m. We are talking about players who are 26 years old.",
      "\"So, given the demands we make in relation to Viktor's value, I believe he could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world. Which I find hard to believe, because he is one of the best footballers in the world.\"",
      "While Gyokeres seems likely to wear an Arsenal shirt next season, further reports from Portugal suggest that a dispute over add-ons has halted negotiations. Sporting want the add-ons to be 'easily achieved', but the Gunners are supposedly resisting, and both clubs are currently at odds over this stipulation.",

      "Manchester United may be left ruing what might have been after two of their former players were sold for fees totalling almost £100million. The Red Devils are desperately looking to revamp their squad following a torturous 2024/25 campaign.",
      "In recent seasons, United have been blighted by numerous missteps in the transfer market, with a string of expensive signings failing to live up to their price tags. The club is trying to move on some of those misfits to fund fresh arrivals and maintain headroom when it comes to PSR restrictions.",
      "Only Matheus Cunha has arrived from Wolves this summer, while exhaustive talks with Brentford over another striker, Bryan Mbeumo, continue after at least two rejected bids. To add insult to injury, United have seen two players they let go relatively cheaply flourish and go on to secure big-money transfers elsewhere.",
      "Anthony Elanga, 23, who United sold to Nottingham Forest for £15million two years ago, has just joined Newcastle United in a £55m deal. Elanga made 55 appearances for United but was deemed surplus to requirements by then-head coach Erik ten Hag.",
      "United did retain an interest in the Swedish winger in the form of a sell-on fee related to profit, which means they will reportedly net £6million. While that is a useful sum, United may have been the club reaping the benefits of his potential instead of a direct rival.",
      "Another ex-United player is on the move, Alvaro Carreras, who has left Benfica for Real Madrid in a deal worth £43m. The left-back, 22, was previously part of Real's youth set-up before joining United in 2020.",
      "However, again under Ten Hag's watch, he was allowed to leave for Benfica, initially on loan, before sealing a permanent move for just £5m. United's interest was retained in two ways: a sell-on fee related to profit and a buy-back option, reports Fabrizio Romano.",
      "United opted not to trigger the buy-back clause, although they are said to have received around £7.6m as part of Real’s purchase. Again, United’s decision not to keep or trigger their buy-back option now looks questionable, given that he now resides with the 15-time European champions.",
      "Meanwhile, with just a month to go before the start of the Premier League season, Mbeumo remains a Brentford player, with the two clubs seemingly no closer to striking a deal. United are believed to have offered in excess of £60m - £55m plus £7.5m in add-ons.",
      "However, the Bees are said to be demanding a fixed fee that surpasses the £62.5m that United paid Wolves for Cunha. The inpass adds to the frustration of Amorim, who is eager to get as much business done as soon as possible so he can integrate new players into his squad during an intense pre-season campaign. The Red Devils begin their Premier League campaign against last season's runner-up, Arsenal, on Sunday, August 17.",

Ratcliffe has gone to extreme lengths to save money since taking full control of football operations after buying a share in the club.",
      "That includes scrapping staff lunchboxes, cancelling a staff Christmas party and axing Sir Alex Ferguson's ambassadorial deal. United have also had several rounds of redundancies and some of the staff who were cut have now joined Tottenham.",

      "Edge spent 29 years at United and was largely tasked with retaining commercial deals, while Liston-Jones was the club's head of data and strategy. Timpson spent 16 years at Old Trafford and was chief executive of global alliances and partnerships before her departure earlier this year.",
      "The report states that Florence Lafaye, who briefly succeeded Timpson after she left the club, is also involved with Altius8. And Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is said to be hopeful that they can 'have the same transformative effect on the club's revenues as the team did at United.'",
      "The report also claims that those within the industry believe Altius8's involvement at Tottenham could cause embarrassment for Ratcliffe after 'dismantling what was one of the few unqualified successes of the Glazer era'.",
      "However, Ratcliffe has repeatedly defended the cost-cutting and claimed that United would have gone bust by the end of the year if they had not made cuts. \"I don't enjoy reading the newspaper very much these days I have to say,\" Ratcliffe told BBC Sport in March.",
      "\"I know it's unpopular, and this period of change is uncomfortable for people, and some of the decisions we have to make are unpleasant. But they are necessary to put Manchester United back on to a stable footing.",
      "\"If people want to see Manchester United winning trophies again then we have do all this stuff. Manchester United would have run out of cash by the end of this year - by the end of 2025 - after having me put $300m (£232.72m) in and if we buy no new players in the summer.",
      "\"We are in the process of change and it's an uncomfortable period and disruptive and I do feel sympathy with the fans. The simple answer is the club runs out of money at Christmas if we don't do those things.\"",

      "Manchester United have made just one major signing so far this summer as they look to bounce back from their worst ever Premier League campaign. United finished 15th last season and missed out on a spot in the Champions League after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Ruben Amorim is keen to revamp his squad and has already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million, while teenage prospects Diego Leon and Enzo Kana-Biyik have also made the move to Old Trafford.",
      "Plenty more incomings and outgoings are expected before the transfer window slams shut, with the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia all likely to leave this summer.",
      "Marcus Rashford has turned down a highly lucrative offer from Saudi Arabia, according to a report from Mundo Deportivo.",
      "The report claims that Rashford is holding out for a move to Barcelona instead, with the Spanish giants interested in signing him on loan with an option to buy worth between £30m and £40m. It comes after Barcelona failed in their attempts to sign Nico Williams.",
      "Barcelona were ready to trigger the forward's release clause, but Williams ended up signing a new 10-year contract to remain with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Manchester United have been linked with a move for Moise Kean and the Fiorentina striker has a release clause in his contract that expires today.",
      "The 25-year-old enjoyed an impressive campaign for Fiorentina last season, netting 25 goals in 44 appearances across all competitions, and he is available for €52m (£45m) due to the clause that must be triggered by July 15.",
      "Kean has previously played in the Premier League with Everton, but struggled to make much of an impact at Goodison Park as he managed just four goals in 39 games for the Toffees.",
      "The 17-year-old defender is highly-rated at Old Trafford and was included in the first-team squad on several occasions last season, with Ruben Amorim insisting he is \"ready\" for Premier League football.",
      "\"He impressed me a lot, so it's also a sign to the youth players that they can be here,\" Amorim told MUTV back in December. \"If something happened with the first-team squad, they have to step up and I think he's ready, he's very adult to handle the demands of the Premier League.\"",

      "Manchester United are set to bank a handy fee of around £7million after their former player Alvaro Carreras completed his move to Real Madrid. Carreras spent four years on the books at United and never made a first-team appearance – yet he has proven useful now.",
      "Carreras joined United as a 16-year-old from Real in 2020, but left after growing frustrated by the lack of first-team opportunities. After loans at Preston and Granada, he impressed on loan at Benfica, who paid around £5m to make his move permanent last summer.",
      "United wisely decided to insert buy-back and sell-on clauses in that deal with Benfica, and while they opted not to re-sign the 22-year-old left-back, they have benefited from the other clause.",
      "That’s because Real have now confirmed the signing of Carreras on a six-year contract for a fee of around €50m (£43m). United are due 20 per cent of that – around £7.2m.",
      "Real have paid that amount after Carreras contributed four goals and five assists in 52 matches for Benfica last season. He spent time in Real’s academy in the past and will now play on the opposite side of defence to Trent Alexander-Arnold in Xabi Alonso’s side, competing with Ferland Mendy for a place in the starting XI.",
      "The money will come in handy for United, who are about to shell out over £60m to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, having also paid £62.5m for Matheus Cunha. United have also banked £6m from Anthony Elanga’s £55m move from Nottingham Forest to Newcastle from a similar clause.",
      "United could have decided to bring Carreras back for just £16m last year, but decided against it, with Tyrell Malacia and Luke Shaw on the books. They later signed Patrick Dorgu in January to add options on the left side of defence.",
      "Speaking at the time, former United boss Erik ten Hag said: “I think the process is perfect. We loan him to Preston, he got back, then we loan him to Granada, he didn't play so much there, and of course we, all the time, observed him and now we had the opportunity to sell him.",
      "\"But we have a buy-back [clause] so we have control of the situation, I think that's what he needed.",
      "“From Preston, then go to La Liga, go to Portugal [with Benfica], every time stepping up to a higher club and a better league. Now we have to see and assess the situation if he can be an option for us. But playing at Man United is not so easy, playing in the Premier League for Manchester United is not so easy. You need experience, also development. You get development from playing for better clubs and in better leagues.”"

      "Brentford have dropped a major hint that Bryan Mbeumo’s protracted transfer to Manchester United could finally be about to go through.",
      "United have been chasing Mbeumo for weeks, but have come up against a determined resistance from Brentford, who have refused to budge over their asking price. The Bees have rejected two offers from United for the Cameroon international, who they believe is worth at least £63million.",
      "Brentford have seen United pay £62.5m for Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Anthony Elanga go from Nottingham Forest to Newcastle for £55m and are playing hard ball over their most prized asset. Nevertheless, the club are not blind to the fact that Mbeumo wants to leave and they have begun making contingency plans.",
      "The Evening Standard reports that they have identified Ipswich Town star Omari Hutchinson as a replacement for Mbeumo, although they have yet to make contact. Hutchinson only joined Ipswich from Chelsea last summer in a club-record deal worth £22.5m, but could be set to leave a year later.",
      "He got three goals and two assists in 31 appearances last season as Ipswich were relegated and reportedly prefers the idea of moving back to London. Chelsea have a buy-back clause, but are unlikely to stand in Brentford’s way, given they have already signed wingers Jamie Gittens and Estevao Willian from Borussia Dortmund and Palmeiras respectively this summer.",
      "Brentford have already lost manager Thomas Frank to Tottenham – replacing him with Keith Andrews – and captain Christian Norgaard, who joined Arsenal, and are now facing the possible departures of Mbeumo and striker Yoane Wissa. But the west London side have developed a reputation for shrewd work in the transfer market.",
      "Hutchinson is still only 21 years old and scored in the final as England under-21s beat Germany 3-2 in the under-21 Euros in the summer. He wants to play Premier League football next season and would relish the chance to replace Mbeumo, who got 20 league goals on the right wing in 2024/25.",
      "“Let’s see on that. I think our position is that he had an unbelievable season last season, we expected interest in him. If that deal’s right, there’s a deal to do, if not then he stays. We’ve spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It’s not a given that he’s going to depart this summer. There is interest.",
      "“He had a great season last season so it’s inevitable there’s going to be interest in him. If we get the right offer, there’s potentially a deal to be done but there’s only so much we can say on that.”",

United are already a week into their work and new signing Matheus Cunha has participated in his first session at at Carrington.",

      "The teenager went on to make the squad against Arsenal in December and made squads in the Europa League when United defeated Lyon. Kukonki also made the end of season tour of Asia and started in the 3-1 win over Hong Kong and came off the bench in defeat to ASEAN All-Stars.",
      "The England under-17 international can play in the centre of defence or at left-back. Kukonki played 14 times for United's under-18 side and in the Premier League 2 play-offs as United defeated Everton and West Ham before losing in the semi-final against rivals Manchester City.",
      "Amorim was quickly impressed with Kukonki's physicality upon his arrival and commended the defender's maturity. \"He's 16,\" said the boss to MUTV.",
      "\"But he impressed me a lot, so it's also a sign to the youth players that they can be here.",
      "\"If something happened with the first-team squad, they have to step up and I think he's ready, he's very adult to handle the demands of the Premier League.\"",
      "After making the bench for the first time against Arsenal, Kukonki said on social media: \"Valuable experience with the squad. Thanks to the manager and the staff for this opportunity. Thank God.\"",
      "Kukonki's early opportunities came amid a major injury crisis in defence for United after Amorim's arrival. Lisandro Martinez, Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw all picked up issues to put them on the sidelines.",
      "It is said Kukonki's ambition is to push for his United debut despite his tender age after making his way through the age groups at the club. The Stoke-on-Trent born prospect has already drawn early comparisons with Manchester City defender Josko Gvardiol.",
      "Kukonki could still become the youngest defender to ever represent United at a senior level in the league. No United defender has ever played in the Premier League before turning 18.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Ruben Amorim has been told he will have \"no more excuses\" come next season at Manchester United after enjoying a transfer window and a pre-season.",
      "The Portuguese boss arrived in November last year to replace Erik ten Hag, but failed to enjoy any new manager bounce and, if anything, took the team backwards as they tabled their worst ever Premier League finish, ending up in 15th.",
      "It means there's no European football at Old Trafford but, throughout the dismal run of results, there was always those highlighted that Amorim had not enjoyed prolonged time with his players on the training pitch and was working with a squad he'd inherited.",
      "Those frustrations were magnified by the fact Amorim played a unique 3-4-3 system, which he didn't have the players to do, yet stuck to his beliefs anyway. Ashley Young insists now is the time for the manager to lay down an early marker to prove he is the man to take the club forward.",
      "All the excuses that were used last term are no longer applicable and the ex-United man wants to see marked improvement on last year.",
      "\"I think it has been said you'll have to give him time, how many transfer window? Who knows. You've got to set your marker as soon as you start this season. I don't think anyone can give him anymore excuses, it is now or never. He's got to have a good pre-season, workout what his best team is, what players fit into the system. Unless he's going to change, but you can't see him change the formation.\"",
      "The frustration for Amorim will be the lack of players he's got through the door thus far. Only Matheus Cunha has been signed with the impressive Brazilian joining from Wolves. The club have since turned their attention to Bryan Mbeumo but have seen a number of bids turned down by Brentford.",
      "They begin their Premier League campaign with a heavyweight clash against Arsenal on August 17 and Amorim will hope to have more new arrivals to pick from with the deficiencies in his squad continually exposed throughout the last campaign.",

      "There are a whopping 33 players on that page. We can omit the aforementioned quartet and Tyrell Malacia from the actual senior squad. Dan Gore and Ethan Wheatley cannot be considered first-teamers and it is premature to assign Tyler Fredricson that status, despite his recent squad number upgrade.",
      "Diego Leon's profile has been uploaded to the first team page but the 18-year-old's first year is expected to be akin to Sekou Kone's. One of acclimatisation with scant opportunities at senior level.",
      "So the number is whittled down to a lean 24 players, an ideal size for a season without European nights on the calendar. Yet sellable assets cannot just be written off.",
      "Rashford, Antony, Sancho and Garnacho collectively rake in £825,000-a-week. They are all still on United's books and the chances are they all still will be going into August.",
      "It is improbable that United will sell all four. Garnacho has takers and Sancho cannot command that high a fee after four feckless years and with a year remaining on his contract. Antony has created a market but his profitability and sustainability-calculated value (£32.58m) is unlikely to be coughed up by a buying club.",
      "Antony may have to embark on a season-long loan with a fixed fee to be paid at the end of it, minus a Sancho-style loophole. Rashford's salary, the three years left on his contract and pickiness over a change of scenery make a loan inevitable.",
      "Rashford did a four-hour gym session on Monday morning. His Instagram posts over the summer have consisted almost entirely of fitness videos. He has also conducted individual sessions at Carrington. He is trying to catch the eye.",
      "The chances are United will still be footing some of the bill for two prominent forwards heading into next season. Then they have two strikers they have invested £108.5million in, a high-profile teenage striker promoted to the first team nearly six months ago and five players who can operate as a No.10. They are more stockpiled than an Ikea warehouse.",
      "Any speculation that United are about to promptly recruit a striker is unrealistic when their attacking department is so bloated and expensive. Liam Delap was a convenient option as he had a low release clause and played for a relegated club more enthusiastic about promoting Ed Sheeran concerts than remaining in the Premier League.",
      "Sources say United's new director of football, Jason Wilcox, is well liked by staff members and widely respected. Sir Jim Ratcliffe said Wilcox possesses the \"best eyes in football\". He did not look far for Delap, a player he watched in the Manchester City academy when he was director there.",
      "United are still burnt from the £72m package they agreed with Atalanta for Rasmus Hojlund, bought for an up-front fee of £64m two years ago. Whilst United were in negotiations with Atalanta, one of the coaching staff members admitted they would not be able to spend £60m on another striker the following summer.",
      "When United needed another striker last year, they had to compromise and paid a release clause for Joshua Zirkzee, who cost roughly half the price that Hojlund did at £36.5m. It then turned out Zirkzee is not a specialist striker.",
      "United have been linked with Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike but there was nothing concrete. Both players are now seemingly bound for Arsenal and Newcastle United, Premier League clubs that qualified for the Champions League. United informed Christopher Nkunku's representatives they are nowhere near as keen as his parent club, Chelsea, claimed.",
      "Expect the Google search interest for Benjamin Sesko to spike this week now he is the last high-profile and attainable striker waiting in the wings. Sesko rejected United in 2022 to sign for RB Leipzig but his agent has since paid multiple visits to Old Trafford and Carrington.",
      "Sesko, under contract until 2029, would command at least double the fee United were prepared to pay for Delap. United have eight senior out-and-out forwards and the majority are on six-figure weekly salaries. The numbers, for a club that confessed their struggles to comply with PSR to a supporters' group, do not add up.",
      "Guaranteed sales are all the more pressing now the price of a No.9 has gone up. Reinventing Matheus Cunha or Bryan Mbeumo (if he ever arrives) as an out-and-out striker would be a complete cop-out.",
      "Persevering with Hojlund would be blind faith. Senior figures at United spoke critically of Hojlund last season, anticipating a possible departure this summer. Inter Milan enquired about the Dane in June.",
      "The wait for a striker will likely stretch towards the transfer deadline of September 1. United's priority purchase is often one of the last through the door (Manuel Ugarte in 2024, Hojlund in 2023, Casemiro in 2022 and Harry Maguire in 2019).",
      "United finished the last two seasons with a minus goal difference. It was literally ten times worse in 2024-25 than the previous campaign. The nock of the arrow has to be sharpened.",
      "But there are problems at the bottom of the pile to address first."

      "It was actually two journalists. Mark Ogden and Paul Hetherington were deemed personas non grata for having the temerity to report that Rio Ferdinand would miss Manchester United's first game of the season at Everton.",
      "A defensive injury crisis forced Ferguson to relocate Michael Carrick to centre back alongside Nemanja Vidic on his first appearance in eight months. United lost to a Marouane Fellaini header from a corner at Goodison Park.",
      "It was peculiar that Ferguson, in his seventies and into his 27th year managing United, operated as though journalists were on the club payroll. As recently as December, there was dismay among some of the United online fanbase that this correspondent had obtained the starting XI for the Manchester derby at the Etihad the day before kick-off.",
      "On that occasion, the United manager and staff were nonplussed as team news leaks have gone on for years at the club. Jose Mourinho marvelled at journalists' sourcing but was appalled that someone privy to such information was loose-lipped.",
      "David Moyes vainly attempted to counter team news leaks when he correctly identified the leaker - a senior member of the first team squad. Louis van Gaal's goalkeeping coach, Frans Hoek, followed specific journalists on Twitter after they reported on acrimony in the squad. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag were blasé about early team news entering the public domain.",
      "The appetite for team news has become more insatiable amid the growing popularity of fantasy football. Participants want to be certain of who's in and who's out before the Saturday 11am deadline to pick their teams.",
      "Ruben Amorim has named an unchanged team only once as United coach, away at Lyon in the Europa League quarter-finals after the goalless draw with Manchester City at Old Trafford. Rotation was rife as United progressed in that tournament and their league form was sacrificed.",
      "Innumerable injuries meant Ten Hag selected his clear and obvious starting XI only once, at Wolves in February 2024. United were so impressive in the first hour of the exhausting 4-3 win that Ten Hag was visibly unhappy they had not won by a wider margin.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot are two of the most durable players in Europe, never mind England. Noussair Mazraoui, likely to be reduced to squad-player status next term, started in 34 Premier League matches in his first season in the competition.",
      "Injury will prevent Andre Onana from appearing during United's pre-season tour of the United States but he has not missed a league match through injury. United's five specialist centre backs all admittedly endured lengthy injury lay-offs in 2024-25.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is still not a United player but lined up in all 38 of Brentford's matches last term. Brentford played 43 games overall. United are a new striker and Mbeumo short of an obvious first XI.",
      "The United fitness staff has been freshened up. Richard Hawkins has left after 17 years mainly overseeing the team's physical performance and Paolo Gaudino has gone after 14 years as fitness coach. Amorim's compatriot, Paulo Barreira, is leading the club's sports science. Alistair McBurnie and Michael Eglon, relatively recent additions to the sports science department, both remain.",
      "With a lighter workload and greater recovery time between games, United's injury toll should be lower than previous campaigns. That said, the last time they had a year devoid of European football they had such regular injury issues that Van Gaal made light of the fact they had \"only one player injured\" on the eve of the visit of Southampton in January 2015.",
      "There are eerie parallels 11 years on: a United manager's first full season, the team operating in a back three and without a UEFA competition to fill the calendar. Ed Woodward confidently briefed that the injury-prone trio Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans would have their \"most available seasons\" in 2014-15. All three were sidelined six games into the campaign and Paddy McNair had to come into the fold.",
      "A United manager seldom picks the same players in successive weeks. The outlier was when the Premier League season restarted amid the Covid-19 pandemic in June 2020. Solskjaer maximised the three-month suspension by settling on a winning formula that was unchanged in five consecutive league games.",
      "That had not happened since February 1993. Back then, United were galvanised by Eric Cantona and fixated on ending their 26-year title drought. Their European campaign ended in September and they exited the FA Cup at Sheffield United in the midst of the league run.",
      "The closest Ferguson ever got to a sequence of unchanged sides again was in October and November 2006 when he entrusted the same XI in three consecutive league fixtures. The common denominator is the 1992-93 and 2006-07 titles were his greatest domestic triumphs.",
      "Solskjaer's strategy eventually backfired. He would gain a reputation for running players into the ground and, after the 2-2 draw with Southampton, was without a recognisable left back as Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams became two flies to drop. Right back Timothy Fosu-Mensah returned like Lazarus for his first United appearance in more than three years at Crystal Palace.",
      "In Van Gaal's first season, he did not opt for the same XI until Tottenham Hotspur away on December 28 2014, two days after the Boxing Day stroll against Newcastle United. It made little sense with that unforgivingly tight turnaround and Van Gaal admitted after the goalless draw the second half was \"a struggle for life\".",
      "He happened upon a winning formula three months later. With Shaw injured again and the meek Angel di Maria suspended, Van Gaal moved Daley Blind to left back, recalled Jones and Juan Mata and United blitzed Spurs 3-0 in the first half of the reverse fixture. In their next game, United produced what remains their best performance at Anfield in the past 30 years to win 2-1.",
      "Bar an enforced change for the resumption of the season at home to Aston Villa, Van Gaal kept the same side for four games running. The sequence only ended with Vincent Kompany's malicious tackle on Blind and a season-ending calf injury to the pivotal Carrick in the 4-2 defeat of City.",
      "After much trial-and-error with other systems, Van Gaal had switched to a 4-3-3 formation. That was reported by the MEN before it was introduced.",
      "Nobody was banned."

      "Ten Hag named Fernandez in the matchday squad only once - against Nottingham Forest in August 2023. When asked about the decision to sell Fernandez last year amid the club's ongoing issues at left back, Ten Hag said: “I think the process is perfect.",

But I think that's what he needed from Preston, then go to La Liga, then the next step Portugal, every time stepping up to a higher club and a better league, so we have to see and assess the situation if he can maybe be an option for us in the future.",

      "Two former Manchester United youth-teamers have transferred in the past week for a combined £98million.",
      "Thanks to sell-on clauses, United have raked in £13m from Anthony Elanga's £55m move to Newcastle United and Alvaro Carreras's return to Real Madrid.",
      "Elanga will be playing in the Champions League next season and Carreras figured in that competition last term with Benfica. The latter never made his debut for United while Elanga failed to score in his final 18 months at the club.",
      "It has become easy to deride United whenever a former player thrives. Elanga scored the winner against his former club for Nottingham Forest in April. Typically, it was his last goal of the season and Forest lost their nerve with a Champions League place up for grabs and ended up in the Europa Conference League.",
      "In 2023, United decided to strengthen their approach to selling academy graduates at the opportune moment. A year before, the only fees they banked from departures were for academy graduates Andreas Pereira and James Garner.",
      "Every case with a United academy sale is nuanced. Contrary to popular belief, the club have got more right than wrong.",
      "Pereira is a Premier League regular and plays for Brazil but nobody seriously suggests United miss him. He had plenty of chances under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, perhaps too many, and became an irrelevance in his last two-and-a-half years at the club after Bruno Fernandes arrived in January 2020.",
      "Following loan stints with Lazio and Flamengo, Fulham took the plunge with a £10m offer in 2022, a year before Pereira's United deal expired. They did United a favour.",
      "Verdict: right to sell and for a good price",
      "United belatedly decided to sell Garner in the 2022 summer transfer window, informing intermediaries before the player himself. Garner was injured for the majority of Erik ten Hag's first pre-season and then failed his audition in the final friendly at home to Rayo Vallecano.",
      "It was still a jolt that United planned to offload one of their most polished players to emerge from the academy in recent years. Given Garner's cachet as a United youth-teamer, England Under 21 representative and role in Nottingham Forest's 2022 promotion, he went on the cheap at £15m.",
      "Garner has been a quality addition for Everton and operated at such a low level he has not been bracketed among the ones to get away from United.",
      "Verdict: too low a price and wrong to sell but understandable as the manager was not going to use him",
      "Newcastle's hit rate in the transfer market has been so good in recent years that the £55m they have coughed up for Elanga has barely been scrutinised when they have overpaid for an overrated winger.",
      "United received £15m rising to £20m from Nottingham Forest for Elanga in July 2023. The only other club that was interested were Everton. Forest and Everton finished in the two places above the relegation zone in 2022-23.",
      "Elanga did not score in his only full season in the United first team and, at the time he left United, they had Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho ahead of him in the pecking order on the left wing. It has gone awry for all three, all available for transfer this summer, but United had to cash in on Elanga, Premier League-quality but not United quality.",
      "Verdict: right to sell but could have negotiated a better price",
      "Ten Hag was briefly reunited with a familiar face at Bayer Leverkusen. Kovar never debuted for United but his impressive skill set was obvious and he seemed poised to become the new No.1 at the 2024 Bundesliga champions. Yet he has just joined PSV Eindhoven on loan.",
      "Kovar left United in the same summer that Andre Onana arrived. If United had not stockpiled goalies, he would have been a worthy competitor for Onana but Bayer paid £7.7m for a goalie that United had developed for six years.",
      "Verdict: right to sell for a good price",
      "Chelsea were prepared to part with £40million for Henderson in 2021. He ended up leaving United for an up-front fee of £15m, rising to £20m, two years later.",
      "After Solskjaer reneged on his pledge to install Henderson as No.1 for the 2021-22 season, the England international made only three more appearances for the club and spent his final year on loan at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Come the summer of 2023, United released David de Gea and brought in Onana. Henderson, demonstrably a No.1 Premier League goalkeeper, had to go but the fee United banked was derisory, chiefly due to the mismanagement by Solskjaer of a 'keeper they had developed for a decade.",
      "Verdict: right to sell but poor price",
      "Leverkusen fans should keep an eye out at left back as that is where Ten Hag has a blind spot. While Fernandez was at United, the club bought Tyrell Malacia, handed Luke Shaw a four-year contract, loaned in Sergio Reguilon and played three right-footers at left back.",
      "Malacia wants to leave, Shaw has played 27 times in two seasons and Reguilon's loan was terminated early. As long as Ten Hag was at United, Fernandez would not get a kick and he was sold to Benfica last summer.",
      "This week, he re-joined Real Madrid for £43m.",
      "Verdict: wrong not to ever play him",
      "After being dogged by injuries in his first few years at United, Kambwala overachieved to play ten times for the club and receive an FA Cup winner's medal. He would have started in the FA Cup semi-final epic with Coventry City but for another ill-timed injury.",
      "A €4m recruit from Sochaux in 2020, Kambwala was sold to Villarreal for £4.63m rising to £9.68m, an impressive outlay for a raw defender who did not have a realistic pathway to the first team at United.",
      "Verdict: right to sell",
      "The United chief executive, football director and manager were all gone within a little over a year after the club abandoned plans to reintegrate Greenwood into the first team squad. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped criminal proceedings over attempted rape against Greenwood in February 2023 and the United hierarchy had planned for him to come back into the team until a fan backlash prompted them to back down.",
      "After a year on loan with Getafe in Spain, Greenwood was sold to Marseille for £26.6m last year.",
      "Verdict: right to sell",
      "Mejbri and Kambwala arrived in the United academy from French sides in successive years and left for similar fees. Burnley agreed an overall £9.4m to sign Mejbri.",
      "Mejbri had a brief stint as a starter under Ten Hag but his productivity off the ball was not matched by his effectiveness on it. After five years with United, he moved down the road to Burnley and helped them to promotion back to the top flight.",
      "Verdict: right to sell",
      "United refused to sell McTominay for £30m in 2023. A year later - and after his career-best season - he was sold for around £30m.",
      "McTominay's goal-getting was crucial in 2023-24 and he was the glue in the team that punched above their weight in the FA Cup final triumph against Manchester City. Yet United needed a younger defensive midfielder and the sellable asset to make way was the attack-minded McTominay.",
      "Fulham were the only interested Premier League club before Napoli came in. McTominay topped his final season with United by winning the Scudetto in Italy, where he was named Serie A's MVP.",
      "McTominay's profound impact in Naples, and the struggles of Manuel Ugarte (hardly a like-for-like replacement) undermine United's decision to cash in on the Scot but their logic was understandable. McTominay might have been sold a year earlier had Kobbie Mainoo not sustained an ankle injury during pre-season.",
      "Verdict: right to sell but replaced with the wrong man"

      "Erik ten Hag overlooked Amad for Omari Forson at the beginning of 2024. Amad was forced to consider his future away from Old Trafford and his departure would have been a huge loss to Manchester United.",
      "Forson made a single start and eight substitute appearances as Monza were relegated from Serie A after finishing rock bottom last season, which proves Ten Hag got his pecking order wrong.",
      "Ten Hag made a handful of inexplicable decisions during his two-and-a-half years in Manchester, but perhaps his decision to overlook Alvaro Fernandez was worse than his preference for Forson over Amad.",
      "Although Ten Hag had various qualities as United boss, his assessment of talent could be iffy and there must be regrets about the circumstances of Fernandez's departure from the club.",
      "Fernandez joined Benfica on loan in January 2024 with a view to a permanent transfer in the summer window and the Portuguese subsequently club triggered their option to buy him.",
      "Benfica paid €6million (£5.2m) plus €3m (£2.6m) in potential add-ons to sign Fernandez and United inserted a 15 per cent sell-on clause, along with a buy-back option, into the sale.",
      "Just a year later, Fernandez has signed for Real Madrid in a €50m (£43m) deal and supporters have pulled their hair out, wondering why the defender was allowed to slip through United's net.",
      "The truth is the blame lies with Ten Hag, who did not deem Fernandez worthy of a senior debut, despite his first-team potential being obvious after his arrival at the club as a teenager in 2020.",
      "Fernandez won the Denzil Haroun Reserve-Team Player of the Year award in 2021/22 for his brilliant academy performances. However, Ralf Rangnick also denied him a debut.",
      "The Spaniard made the first-team squad for the last four Premier League games of Rangnick's tenure, but Alex Telles was strangely picked ahead of him on the final day of the season.",
      "Fernandez was loaned to Preston for 2022/2023 and looked determined to prove his quality. His spell at the Deepdale Stadium was considered a resounding success and he subsequently travelled on the pre-season tour of the USA after an injury to Tyrell Malacia, but opportunities were limited.",
      "Fernandez's only appearance in the States in the summer of 2023 was against Wrexham in San Diego when an academy side was fielded. Even Brandon Williams was handed more minutes.",
      "There was also a sliding door moment in August 2023 when Luke Shaw picked up an injury against Tottenham. Malacia remained on the sidelines, recovering from knee surgery, but Diogo Dalot started at left back in the following game and Fernandez was named on the bench.",
      "To make matters worse, Sergio Reguilon was signed on loan from Tottenham on deadline day.",
      "Fernandez's loan to Granada was confirmed on the same day and he later criticised Ten Hag.",
      "“What message did United give me? That I should go out on loan, that Ten Hag didn’t count on me, that I should continue to gain experience, rhythm, and we’ll see what happens in the future,\" he told The Athletic in December 2023.",
      "\"But it’s clear that football doesn’t end at any club and that you have to keep working. My main objective is to return to United and make a place for myself there.”",
      "Eyebrows were raised when Fernandez signed for Benfica on loan in January last year because it was a move with a view to a permanent transfer. United fans understood he was about to leave the club for good.",
      "Fernandez was never given a fair crack of the whip by Ten Hag, despite the evidence in front of him and injuries to Shaw and Malacia, meaning there were no senior left-backs available.",
      "It always felt possible Fernandez would use Benfica as a springboard to further success and his departure from United looks much worse after his multi-million pound move to the world's biggest club.",
      "Ten Hag made an assessment of Fernandez and was ultimately responsible for his exit. It really does not reflect well on Ten Hag that Real Madrid have swooped to sign the youngster.",
      "It could be suggested that Fernandez wouldn't have been in that position to sign for Madrid unless he'd left United, but he spent just a year and a half with Benfica, which clearly weakens the argument.",
      "There is no denying Fernandez took strides forward with Benfica and benefited from regular game time, but it's not as if he spent four years in Portugal and became a completely new player.",
      "Anyone who watched Fernandez in the academy and observed his loan at Preston could tell he was destined for bigger things. That's not to say anyone predicted he would sign for Madrid at 20 years old, but it was a mistake from Ten Hag not to give him a chance, especially when senior left-backs were injured."

      "Manchester United signing Bryan Mbeumo has become the saga of this summer transfer window.",
      "Brentford turned down two bids for the Cameroon international during June, the most recent being worth up to £62.5million, which matches what they paid Wolverhampton Wanderers for Matheus Cunha. A release clause in the latter's contract made that a more straightforward negotiation, only necessitating the clubs agree on a structure for that payment.",
      "The Bees could have benefitted from a similar clause in the contract of a player they are said to see as a possible replacement for Mbeumo. However, it now appears as though that ship has sailed.",
      "Omari Hutchinson reportedly had a relegation release clause in his contract with Ipswich Town worth £35million. His former club, Chelsea, exercised a £30million one earlier this summer to sign Liam Delap, who United also wanted.",
      "However, the clause is said to have expired at 5pm on Tuesday, July 15. The Athletic reports Brentford approached Ipswich for Hutchinson on Monday, but the bid fell short of the £35m figure and was rejected.",
      "It is said the Bees see the attacking midfielder as among a limited number of possible replacements for Mbeumo. The East Anglian Daily Times reports that Ipswich could even now increase their price for Hutchinson, which would deal a blow to Brentford's hopes of signing him.",
      "Ipswich paid Chelsea a club-record fee of around £20million to sign Hutchinson barely 12 months ago. Therefore, they would presumably want to register a healthy profit from that investment.",
      "United, meanwhile, may well have been watching in the hope Brentford's move for Hutchinson was successful in order to pave the way for Mbeumo's transfer to Old Trafford to be given the green light. As the wait for any news on Mbeumo's move to United continues, it feels as thought the transfer domino effect of Brentford missing out on Hutchinson, for now at least, could be key in ensuring it goes on a little longer."

      "The Reds have been working on a transfer to bring Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford, but that has proven to be difficult. Brentford don't want to lose the 25-year-old and are playing hardball. In fact, Keith Andrews' side believe Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals last season, is worth around £63m.",

      "The 22-year-old has got everything a modern centre forward needs. He is quick, strong, can run in behind but also has a unique dribbling ability for a 6\"3 man, similar to that of Alexander Isak.",
      "AC Milan are working behind-the-scenes to get a deal done for Manchester United forward Rasmus Hojlund, according to Italian media outlet SportMediaset. Ruben Amorim's side are closing in on a deal for Mbeumo and that could open up the departure for one of their strikers, including the Denmark international.",
      "With Santiago Gimenez starting pre-season as Milan's only senior recognised front-man, they need at least another centre forward and Hojlund is right at the top of their shopping list.",
      "MEN says: To enable a move for Ekitike, one of Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee has got to go. Because Zirkzee has the ability to play in the two No.10 roles and improved as last season wore on, I think Hojlund has to be the man that is sold. Having had previous experience in Serie A at Atalanta, Milan wouldn't be a bad club for him. He has the potential and ability to be their main man next season ahead of Gimenez, that's for sure."

      "The Norwegian guided United to successive top three finishes in the Premier League. However, they took just four points from their final 21 available under him.",
      "Despite enduring an unhappy ending to his most recent stint at M16, Solskjaer still holds positive feelings for the club - a sentiment now echoed with his current employers in Turkey.",
      "\"I’ve always had feelings for Beşiktaş. Manchester United is a similar club,\" he told Hürriyet. \"Beşiktaş is also the first team to represent Turkey in European Cups.",
      "\"I accepted to be a part of the successes in Beşiktaş history.",
      "\"I came to Beşiktaş for our third meeting. In the first one, I agreed, but it didn’t happen, Fernando Santos came.",
      "\"Then we met again, this time Giovanni van Bronckhorst came. Then the president and I had a vision, and we agreed immediately.\"",
      "Besiktas finished last season fourth in the Turkish Super Lig and will therefore be playing a two-legged Europa League qualifier later this month. To qualify for the League Phase, they will need to navigate two further rounds in July and August."

      "United currently have Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee as their striker options, although both have been tentatively linked with potential moves away from the club this summer, while attackers Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all available for transfer."

The winger has still not officially signed from Brentford though there is still time before the club fly from the UK to fulfil their pre-season schedule.",

It has been widely reported how Galatasaray, the club he spent last season on loan with, are pushing for a permanent reunion.",

      "Osimhen has apparently informed Napoli that he will not report for pre-season training under Antonio Conte, has refused to undergo medical testing with the club and has refused to ever wear their badge again.",
      "It is a situation that mirrors the current saga over another United-linked striker, Viktor Gyokeres. Having rejected anyone's interest but Arsenal's, he has refused to meet up with Sporting CP for pre-season and as a result has been threatened with disciplinary action.",
      "It remains to be seen how Napoli will react to their man's alleged insubordination.",
      "The Naples and Istanbul clubs seem to be locked in intense negotiations at this stage. The fee demanded is €75m (£67m) and whilst Galatasaray are willing to pay this, it comes down to the structure of the deal.",

      "Meanwhile, United are onlookers to these reports that Osimhen has his mind set on Galatasaray alone.",

      "We wondered how Liverpool would react to Newcastle’s bid for Hugo Ekitike. The Reds have responded with force…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "",
      "19) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nBayern have made their move for Diaz, who wants to make a move of his own. But Liverpool won’t entertain the bid of £58.6million, with the Reds insisting they want to keep the Colombian, but £87million might twist their arm. There seems to be an openness from all sides to a deal, but it feels very unlikely the two clubs will compromise while they stand £30million apart in their current valuations. Diaz may have to force the issue.",
      "",
      "18) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThere has been speculation that Juve preferred a permanent move for Francisco Conceicao but the Porto winger’s release clause is about to go up by 50%, so we ought to see some clarity soon if Juve are serious about Sancho. And, perhaps more importantly, how serious Sancho is about Juve and kickstarting his tail-spinning career.",
      "",
      "17) Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nJuve’s problem here is similar to United’s with Sancho: they owe the player another year of a huge salary. But Vlahovic may be prepared to forego it if Juve simply cut him loose and allow him to find a contract elsewhere as a free-agent. Which would certainly suit United. But reports suggest Milan might be a problem for the Red Devils.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "16) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Leandro Trossard – Arsenal to Bayern Munich\nWith Arsenal looking to sign players in the positions Trossard plays, it makes sense that they cash in on the attacker. Who just so happened to change his representatives this summer to a fella well connected with the German big-hitters. Trossard has two years remaining on his contract and would be around half the price of Diaz.",
      "",
      "14) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nChelsea are selling one winger for £52million and reports suggest they could sign a replacement (do they really need one?) for £40million in the shape of Garnacho. The Blues were keen in January and, unbelievably, nothing between then and now has put them off the Argentinian, perhaps due to the discount on the hefty price they were quoted at the start of the year. Garnacho’s gotta go somewhere…",
      "",
      "13) Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to West Ham\nThe Hammers seem keen to put some of their Kudus cash into luring Elliott away from Liverpool but it is so far unclear what the Reds would accept. The Guardian says ‘preparations for a move are being conducted’ which have to start with a simple question: how much?",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates and some reports suggest a deal is now down to the finer details of how the fee to activate his release clause is paid. Arsenal are a little tied up this week with Madueke and Gyokeres, but once those deals are done, we can expect some progress over Eze.",
      "",
      "11) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "10) 🔽 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli were ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who could yet be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. But reports over the weekend suggest the Serie A champions have backed away somewhat, preferring instead a £30million deal for Udinese’s Lorenzo Lucca. It could all be part of the transfer dance if Napoli are looking for a sweeter deal from Liverpool, but this certainly doesn;t appear as advanced as it did last week.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nTalks are continuing, apparently, but they haven’t achieved much so far. Ornstein says the clubs remain ‘several million apart’ in their valuation. Brentford don’t seem minded to come down so United will probably have to go up. Surely they won’t just walk away now, leaving the player hanging, wasting weeks of the market? With United, who knows…",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool are treading very lightly here. Ornstein, Romano and co. are all reporting that the Reds have approached Newcastle about a record bid for Isak. They acknowledge Newcastle’s ‘not for sale’ stance – but it is certainly not being taken literally. Someone wants it known that Liverpool want Isak. It serves Liverpool, obviously, but if Newcastle are open to making big money on the Swede while buying a replacement for £40-50million less, it does them no harm either. Ideally for the Toon, Isak goes public with what desire he may have to insulate the club more from whatever backlash they may face. Regardless, this now smells like a ‘probable’ rather than a ‘possible’.",
      "",
      "7) 🆕 Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Newcastle\nSome reports suggested Ekitike’s agents were in Newcastle, others say a Toon delegation was in Germany. Whatever. Talks are certainly taking place, which apparently involved Eintracht saying ‘nein’ to Newcastle’s opening bid of £70million. It has always been reported that the Germans they want more for the forward, perhaps as much as £85million. And they will feel more emboldened if they think Newcastle could be banking £120million for Isak. Inside 24 hours, since the first reports of Newcastle’s firm interest in Ekitike emerged, Liverpool have given the Magpies plenty to ponder. Liverpool’s take seems to be: ‘Sell us Isak, or we’ll move for Ekitike.‘ Whatever the score, the prospect of Isak and Ekitike pairing up for Newcastle next season seems a lot more remote than it did even on Monday evening.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which didn’t appear to be going well, but Ornstein suggests the Gunners are getting there. And Mosquera’s farewell message suggests it is heading in the right direction.",
      "",
      "5) Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now close to joining Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career, assuming the two clubs can find an agreement over a fee should the loan become a permanent arrangement.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nBournemouth have agreed to take another Chelsea keeper, this time permanently, with the 25-year-old moving for £25million. Petrovic will have a medical once Chelsea fly back from the United States.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we had almost given up trying to keep up. But this seems to be reaching what felt like the inevitable conclusion amid reports a deal has finally been agreed between the two clubs. Indeed, Gyokeres’ representatives are in London now though a five-year contract was agreed weeks ago.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nThe Chelsea winger is at Arsenal today to wrap up a medical and the final details of a £52million move. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect."

      "Both clubs are eyeing the same solution. According to Gazet van Antwerpen, the rivals from across the Pennines have shown interest in Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens, who enjoyed a breakthrough campaign in Belgium last season.",
      "The 23-year-old made 44 appearances in all competitions and emerged as one of the most effective shot-stoppers in Europe. DataMB claim Lammens made 177 saves in 2024–25 and prevented 16.47 expected goals, more than any other goalkeeper in world football.",
      "At 6ft 4in, he is a commanding figure and has already been capped at every youth level for Belgium. He earned a first senior call-up earlier this year and is widely seen as one of the country’s most promising keepers.",
      "Antwerp are open to a sale and have already signed a replacement. Director Marc Overmars confirmed as much, calling Lammens “our most sought-after player”. The Belgian club are hoping to bring in around £17 million.",
      "Leeds know the player well. Jesse Marsch tried to bring him in during the final months of his reign, but the deal never progressed. Lammens moved to Antwerp on a free instead, where he quickly established himself as a starter.",
      "Sunderland are also credited with interest and have already picked off two Leeds targets so far this summer, though reliable sources confirm the Whites never pursued neither to the best of their ability, walking away from a deal for Habib Diarra and opting not to bid for Noah Sadiki.",
      "The player is open to a transfer and is part of what Belgian media are calling the “English goalkeeping carousel”, with a number of clubs monitoring changes elsewhere.",
      "A talented new name has emerged in Man Utd’s hunt for a goalkeeper, with two departures between the sticks expected this summer, according to reports."

      "The midsummer Premier League Mood Rankings can always present a challenge, but never more so than this year. We’ve bottled one decision altogether, for which we hope you can forgive us.",
      "We neither ask nor expect you to be so forgiving about the inevitably wrong (in whichever direction) assessment we’ve delivered of your club.",
      "Here’s the current state of play, with June’s post-season rankings in brackets and the full nonsense here.",
      "",
      "N/A: Liverpool (4)\nFair to say we’ve never wrestled with where exactly anyone should sit on this ultimately trivial and meaningless list quite like we have with this one. We hope you’ll understand and forgive the cop-out of just not even trying to decide whether Liverpool and their fans are happier or more miserable than Newcastle or Burnley or whatever.",
      "In time we’ll all learn precisely how the genuine tragedy that has hit this club this summer comes to influence and define the football that will ultimately in the end return to the front of everyone’s thoughts. Our suspicion is that the ‘For Diogo’ inspiration and bonding will prove a powerful unifying force for what is undeniably if at this time so triflingly unimportantly an imposing squad that will set out to defend the Premier League title won so impressively last season.",
      "But even this sort of talk feels in bad taste, as if anything that Diogo Jota’s tragic untimely death could do to Liverpool’s football for better or worse is even a subject worthy of discussion.",
      "RIP, Diogo and Andre.",
      "",
      "19) West Ham (20)\nHmm. For a team that loves a transfer and who very obviously needed to do quite significant squad surgery to deliver a playing staff better suited to Graham Potter’s ways they… have not done a lot. Has to be a worry given how poor they were for vast swathes of last season as they head into a season where they surely cannot rely either on a) Spurs and/or Manchester United remaining historically bad or b) the promoted clubs all being historically bad.",
      "Getting £55m for a player who isn’t quite what Potter wants is useful, but also in multiple ways revealing of where exactly West Ham stand right now. They’ve had to cash in an extremely valuable asset just to be able to start the work required on their squad and worse still had to sell him to Tottenham.",
      "West Ham would, as a general rule, sooner sh*t in their hands and clap than do anything ever that might in any way benefit Tottenham. To have reached a point where they would even consider selling them one of their best players is itself extremely disconcerting.",
      "We always said Potter could only be judged at West Ham after he’d had a proper pre-season to really drill his ideas into his players. If West Ham don’t get a wriggle on, he won’t actually get that proper pre-season. And he will end up judged regardless.",

      "A common refrain – from us as much as anyone else – was that Ruben Amorim was a fool to take over United mid-season when he could and should have waited to take charge in the off-season and be able to properly build and prepare his squad.",
      "We are now coming to realise that in fact it makes no odds when or under what circumstances you take over at English football’s largest basket case.",
      "Precious little of the very obviously necessary squad-building has taken place as we reach mid-July with the start of the season only a month away. Matheus Cunha came in right at the start of the summer, and that is an exciting signing. But Cunha is a mercurial maverick and other assorted cliches. He could definitely thrive at United, but he could also lose the plot entirely under the harsh spotlight that comes with the territory here.",
      "And since then, with United still scraping together coppers from down the back of Sir Jim’s sofa and none of the decks cleared of the various highly-paid members of the unwanted bomb squad, their transfer window is at an impasse.",
      "United face the very real prospect now of starting the new season riddled with every bit as much chaos and uncertainty as they ended the last. Which is a lot of chaos and far too much uncertainty.",
      "With no European distraction they surely won’t be quite as catastrophically bad in the league as they were in 24/25, but the very fact we live on a timeline where that is the kind of glass-half-full, every-cloud sentence you can right about This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About is painfully revealing in itself.",

      "Losing Thomas Frank is an enormous blow. We simply don’t know just how vital he was to Brentford’s success at establishing themselves in the top flight because he’s just always been there quietly doing an excellent job in surroundings where he felt enormously comfortable.",
      "We’re about to find out both whether he can flourish at an objectively sillier club, but also whether the estimable Brentford project can work without him.",
      "We’d suggest that would be an easier task had they not also lost Christian Norgaard to Arsenal, with Bryan Mbeumo soon and then very possibly Yoane Wissa and very possibly more besides also following Frank out of the exit door.",
      "It’s a summer of such alarming churn and uncertainty that even the one stab at stability and familiarity – promoting from within by giving Keith Andrews his first managerial role – looks forced.",
      "The desire for some kind of continuity was understandable, but with Frank taking so many of his coaching staff with him to Tottenham we do wonder whether Brentford have got this right and it’s very easy to get The Fear about how their season might pan out.",
      "Handing the reins to a set-piece coach who has never managed at first-team level just feels like a gamble of startling proportions in the circumstances. It’s the sort of person you hand the interim role when you are left with no choice midway through the season, which begs the question who exactly Brentford will hand the interim role when they are left with no choice midway through the season.",

      "The #NoToMadueke behaviour was not that of a well football club at peace with itself. For all the absence of self-awareness that so frequently defines the most terminally and noisily online of the club’s fans, Arsenal know, don’t they? They very clearly know that they can’t have another year of moral victories or winning on xG or watching other clubs gleefully celebrate winning assorted pots and pans while they sit gloomily in the corner explaining why that trophy they themselves never won is beneath their attention, actually.",
      "This has to be the season where all the undoubted progress and growth and development of the last three years arrives at something tangible. And that’s obviously going to be very difficult.",
      "One of our very earliest predictions for next season was that Arsenal would win the league if they got the striker situation sorted, and we are going to stubbornly stick to that. We don’t know whether Arsenal actually do have it in them to deliver that title after all this time, but we are very confident that somewhere along the way they will be top of the mood rankings and somewhere along the way they will be bottom. And that’s the real quiz, isn’t it? Well, no.",
      "The problem for Arsenal’s threepeat runners-up is that a glance around suggests a league that is only getting harder to win, not easier. From having only City to worry about – and that was enough, frankly – Arsenal now very obviously have Liverpool to think about and on current evidence very possibly Chelsea as well. And these are all clubs for whom winning trophies remains a far more straightforward habit to maintain than it is for the Gunners.",
      "",
      "15) Bournemouth (12)\nIt’s the nature of life for the Premier League’s overachievers and strivers, but Bournemouth already appear to be among the worst hit this year and there’s still time for it to get worse.",
      "Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez were exceptional members of a high-class back four for Bournemouth last year, and while the hundred million-odd quid the Cherries have banked for the pair is welcome it’s still a desperately hard task to fill two gaps of that size in one summer. Even for a club that’s pretty good at rolling with these punches. And there’s still lingering talk of Illia Zabarnyi heading to Paris as well, talk that their humbling at the hands of Chelsea is unlikely to silence.",
      "But they’ve kept their manager which didn’t feel certain at the start of the summer, and Antoine Semenyo’s new contract amid interest from plenty of big fish is another significant boon. Feels like a big finish to the transfer window might well be needed, though.",
      "",
      "14) Burnley (15)\nDespite finishing miles ahead of eventual play-off winners Sunderland and right alongside Leeds at the top of last season’s Championship, it does feel slightly like Burnley are the forgotten member of the promoted trio right now.",
      "Leeds are Leeds and Sunderland are doing all sorts of wildly eye-catching transfer business, while Burnley appear to just be going about things more quietly. That might well be entirely prudent, of course, and by September their less flashy antics might well look by far the most sensible of the promoted clubs.",
      "But fundamentally we do not trust Scott Parker to be manager of a Premier League team. We are going to need to see some pretty clear evidence he’s going to be better at it this time around, and until such time as we see that evidence we will have to keep Burnley’s mood down.",
      "That said, they do have the boost that all three promoted teams have this summer: so many seemingly settled established teams being picked to the bone.",
      "",
      "13) Sunderland (14)\nThe loss of Jobe Bellingham is a shame and robs the Premier League of an interesting and unexpected storyline, while offering instead the ‘Will a Bellingham ever actually play in the Premier League?’ quandary, but Sunderland’s summer activity certainly hints at a club that if they are going to go back down are going to do kicking and screaming. No quietly accepting their fate for a club who’ve brought in six players from around Europe.",
      "At the very, very least they should avoid Southampton’s season-long struggle to avoid Derby-based ignominy and that’s a start, isn’t it?",
      "Doesn’t hurt to see a division that suddenly contains a lot more plausible relegation rivals than appeared the case at the time of Sunderland’s shock play-off success.",
      "",
      "12) Wolves (8)\nIt is the time of year when we instinctively and reflexively start to worry about Wolves because they start every season like absolute muck.",
      "And that’s true even in summers where they haven’t sold a couple of their best players as well.",
      "We might have felt a bit different had they carried that winning run they had last spring all the way to the finish line, but once they no longer actually needed any further points they simply stopped getting them in the final four games and while that didn’t matter for 24/25, Wolves are the one team we would particularly worry about carrying that drearier form all the way through the summer with them before depositing it with big trumpy dump in a one-win-in-nine games start to the season.",
      "It is the history of the Wolves.",
      "",
      "11) Nottingham Forest (9)\nInteresting club, are Forest. By the end of last season there was a distinct whiff of entitlement around the place. Sure, you’ve got a couple of European Cups in the trophy cabinet and that’s undeniably something that can inflate the ol’ ego a bit but while the rest of us were going “Cor look at Forest having a brilliant season” there was definitely a sense of some (by no means all) their fans not quite enjoying it as much as they really should have done because to them this was nothing more than the restoring of the club to its rightful status.",
      "That’s fine, but it does also mean that as well as not fully enjoying the good times you can end up getting more miffed than is healthy about the less good, and while the harrumphing at the sale of Anthony Elanga and still-likely departure of Morgan Gibbs-White is understandable, the general air of “How can this thing that happens to all clubs outside the cosseted elite be happening to us, Nottingham Forest?” doesn’t seem like it’s the sort of thing that can end with anyone feeling good about anything really.",
      "There’s something similar about the extent of apparent behind-the-scenes lobbying Forest have done to get themselves Crystal Palace’s place in the Europa League. Sure, it makes sense to want to be in the Europa League, but the Conference felt like a tournament Forest would have a genuine shot at winning in a way that even the current even-Spurs-can-win-it watered-down Europa League doesn’t.",
      "We do also very much enjoy the idea of contracts having secret release clauses the very activation of which constitutes a breach of said secrecy, but not really sure how well that’s going to actually stand up in practice.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester City (19)\nWe’re as excited as you to find out whether City’s embarrassing early exit from the Club World Cup constitutes the latest stage in the decline of the Guardiola Empire or will, come May, have been fully reimagined as the blessing in disguise that allows them to reclaim their Premier League title as Chelsea wilt on the run-in.",
      "The important thing, of course, is that in and of itself not doing much at the Club World Cup doesn’t really matter. Had that happened on the back of a more customary City season in which the Premier League and probably a cheeky domestic cup had been safely trousered nobody would bat an eyelid.",
      "But another failed shot at silverware on the back of the first genuinely worrying season since Guardiola really got going at City means it does catch the eye slightly more.",
      "Feels like City are a side who could do with making a statement start to the season, and the worry for them is that fast starts are not their great strength. Very good starts and then unimprovably relentlessly opposition-spirit-crushing finishes have been the modus operandi for Pep’s teams.",
      "But last year was one to puncture the idea that City will always come decisively good down the home straight, and once that kind of aura is lost its powerfully hard to restore.",
      "What City have done is continue with the rebuild that began in January and it’s certainly going to be exciting to watch a new-look post-De Bruyne City in action. But we’ve not been this uncertain about them before a ball’s been kicked for several years.",
      "Which is all the evidence we need to know they will be 12 points clear by November and win the league by 20 points in the end while spinning effortlessly upon the very tips of their cocks.",
      "",
      "9) Everton (11)\nGenuine question: has anyone seen or heard anything at all to do with or about Everton over the last couple of months? We’re genuinely struggling. They just seem to be there in the background, like the whole club is just on the backburner in this empty space between leaving Goodison and arriving at their new stadium, at which point everyone once again notices them.",
      "That’s fine, but it does leave us with not a huge amount to say here really. They’ll probably be fine, won’t they? Yeah, they’ll probably be fine. New stadium looks nice and that. Always exciting until you realise you’ve accidentally set yourselves back 10 years on the pitch to pay for it, but still always exciting.",
      "",
      "8) Aston Villa (7)\nThe entirely unrelated and coincidentally timed sale of their women’s team to themselves appears to have kept PSR wolves from doors for now and allows Villa to continue for now looking to a positive future without having to do anything as unpleasant as sell some players like Newcastle did last year, the damn fools.",
      "That said, they’ve not really actually done anything particularly proactive in the transfer market either. Not even a mutually beneficial signing of a toddler from Everton or anything. Very disappointing, and on a vaguely serious note potentially slightly problematic for a team still right on the limit when it comes to the financial rules and who have waved goodbye to a few loan players who really did become quite important during the second half of last season.",
      "These feel like nervous times for Villa, a club that teeters on the divide between two possible futures. Missing out on the Champions League as agonisingly as they did really might turn out to have been far more significant for Villa than it would have been for anyone else in that situation.",
      "",
      "7) Fulham (13)\nFeels like it’s been a very, very quiet summer at Fulham thus far. And a quick look around at the teams sharing Premier League mid-table real estate with the Cottagers last season suggests that quiet and boring might be just the ticket this summer.",
      "Sure, we all like seeing lots of new signings come through the door and at some point it would seem like a very good idea for Fulham to join in with that particular endeavour but for the upwardly-mobile middle-class this appears to be a summer where standing still might not actually be the worst net result.",
      "",
      "6) Brighton (10)\nWe’ve all been here before and we’ve all said it before but is Joao Pedro finally the point at which Chelsea sign a player from Brighton and Brighton don’t instantly by some alchemic magic still manage to get better as a result?",
      "Feels like he’s the first player to tread that well-worn path over recent years who feels both a massive gain for Chelsea and a huge hard-to-replace loss for Brighton.",
      "And that’s a bit of a buzzkill, we fear, for a club who already have a little bit of rueing to do about the way last season ended up with them just outside Europe and paying a heavy price for an on-brand mid-season slump.",
      "There’s nothing hugely bollard-grabbing about the business Brighton have done on the incoming side this summer, but that’s fine because that’s always the way with Brighton. They do transfers that only turn out to have always looked brilliant in hindsight, which is very much the right way to go about these things.",
      "",
      "5) Crystal Palace (2)\nMight eventually be able to channel the current sense of anger and injustice at being booted from the Europa League into another fine season, but for now it is just anger and injustice.",
      "Hard right now to escape the sense that Palace are paying an enormously heavy price for an administrative cock-up while actual multi-club empires are able to circumvent the rules with ease and disdain.",
      "And really how much of a cock-up even was it? Forest were able to take steps to dodge the multi-club bullet before the March deadline because by then it was pretty clear that Europe was a near certainty. Palace had no such certainty.",
      "Nothing can take away from Palace’s joy at finally landing that first piece of major silverware with a famous FA Cup win over Manchester City, but there is a bitter taste now. They’ll just have to go and win the Conference, we guess, while sticking pins in their Evangelos Marinakis dolls.",
      "To which end (the winning the Conference part, not the doll part) they could also really do with not selling all their best players this summer if they can possibly avoid it.",
      "",
      "4) Leeds (5)\nIt’s not so much what Leeds themselves are doing this summer as what’s happening to an awful lot of the teams that they might consider among their potential rivals that creates such cause for optimism.",
      "There is clearly further work needed on the squad before it can be truly said to be one that has a genuine crack at survival, but the potential bottom half of the Premier League in 25/26 looks decidedly weaker now than it did in May.",
      "Leeds also have lovely, lovely kits for their return to the top flight and while some may consider it irrelevant because at the end of the day it is, it can still provide a welcome midsummer boost in those long barren football-less wastelands.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle United (3)\nWe thought all was broadly well on Tyneside, but then the early Sack Race odds that have Eddie Howe nowhere near as safe as we expected have slightly thrown us for a loop.",
      "What are we missing here? Champions League football. No apparent need to or significant risk of selling any of their many very excellent players – most notably of course Alexander Isak.",
      "Is it just the continued inability to just buy their way to absolutely anything and everything? Feels like that shouldn’t be so surprising now.",
      "We can only really see two reasons for any real lack of cheer at Newcastle right now. One, the fact that the four teams who finished above them last season all look like being stronger next year. And two, adidas have made a complete bollocks of their kit for next season.",
      "But overall, we’d still be feeling pretty chipper if we were Newcastle. All things considered.",
      "READ: Ekitike among record signings which will be made this summer after beautiful five-word Ornstein message",
      "",
      "2) Tottenham (1)\nTo those outside Spurs the sheer sense of cathartic relief that still flows around this club after ending that trophy drought may be hard to fathom.",
      "It’s exhausting being the butt of every joke, and that was Spurs’ lot for years and years and years. They are now free of it, at least for a little bit and there is a clear sense of revelling in it.",
      "The club’s official shop is now selling hoodies and t-shirts with ‘Spursy’ and ‘Lads it’s Tottenham’ on. They are one unconvincing 2-1 Champions League win over Juventus away from adding a range of ‘It is the history of the Tottenham’ merch to the burgeoning collection. Their social media content in the aftermath of victory over Manchester United in Bilbao was the 2025 version of Father Ted’s acceptance speech.",
      "It matters. It matters because it strikes to the very heart of being a fan and how you experience it. Spurs’ renewed status as trophy winners has meant that even the initial noise and anger over the brutal sacking of Ange Postecoglou on charges of delivering a succulent 17th-placed finish while ending that trophy drought has now died down.",
      "Sure, that noise will return soon enough if Thomas Frank finds life harder outside of Brentford’s very specific and very different environment, but there are also plenty of encouraging signs around Spurs’ transfer business this summer as they seek to avoid a repeat of last season’s league fiasco in a season where, for the first time in so, so long, they enter into it without the banter monkey upon their back.",
      "And to make things even better for Spurs, the banter monkey has travelled only a few miles down the road to find his latest host.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea (6)\nThey do keep getting cross with us for pointing out that the Club World Cup wasn’t real, but they are absolutely right to revel in it. Revel they must and revel they will in being able to call themselves the first halfway legitimately crowned world champions club football has ever had.",
      "The myriad and often nauseating flaws of the tournament itself, on-field and off, that culminated in Donald Trump apparently believing he’d won the title because he’s just so brilliant at everything can vex and agitate the rest of us, but Chelsea can just enjoy it while the rest of us chew it raw.",
      "And, crucially, the thinly veiled criticisms about how they Southgated their way to the final from the markedly easier side of the draw all melt away in the face of the manner in which they swept away PSG, pretty much everyone’s current idea of the actual best team in the world, in the final.",
      "That was a performance and result that would make any fan giddy. It doesn’t matter whether you think that particular tournament matters or not. The possibilities that have suddenly appeared for a Chelsea side that has underperformed for several years now are intoxicating.",
      "They have had an excellent summer in which their transfer business has, dare we say it, even looked like it might have a plan beyond just stockpiling wingers on eight-year contracts. They’ve bought well and are even looking like they might be selling well.",
      "For the first time in a while, they look like a proper team to be taken entirely seriously. One that can and should compete for all the undoubtedly meaningful trophies available to them next season.",
      "It’s worth remembering that Enzo Maresca had them in a title fight for far longer than anyone really expected last season, and there is now the very real prospect that this could be the latest team given the all-important task that is now so vital to English football’s banter drive: beating Arsenal into second place."

      "Marcus Rashford and Man Utd may agree it’s time to part ways, but their fractious relationship looks set to continue as a clash of priorities has further complicated the England international’s exit from Old Trafford.",
      "The England forward remains determined to leave this summer, and Barcelona is the move he wants. Rashford is said to be “very keen” to joining the La Liga side, with Fabrizio Romano suggesting he’s effectively waiting for them to make it happen.",
      "But the Spanish giants are only in a position to offer a loan deal, and that’s not something Utd are prepared to entertain. Barcelona’s financial situation has already prevented them from registering top target Nico Williams, and although Rashford remains of interest, he is no longer viewed as a priority.",
      "Reports in Spain claim the only deal under consideration is a loan, preferably with no obligation to buy. Man Utd, for their part, are holding out for a sale and have no interest in temporary solutions.",
      "INEOS and Ruben Amorim see Rashford as a valuable asset in their attempt to raise funds and balance PSR obligations. With new signings already arriving, and more expected, Utd want to offload players permanently, and Rashford’s long-term contract gives them little incentive to compromise.",
      "That approach, however, directly clashes with the player’s hopes of a swift move to Spain. But while Rashford waits on his dream move, other offers have emerged recently.",
      "Turkish side Fenerbahce have stepped up their interest, with previous reports claiming Jose Mourinho contacted the player directly and received the “green light” for a reunion. Mourinho, now in charge at Fenerbahce, is said to be keen on a high-profile addition and has instructed club officials to open talks.",
      "But the Metro paint a very different picture. Their latest report suggests Rashford is “not thought to be keen” on the move to Turkey, and remains focused on keeping the Barcelona option alive.",
      "Fenerbahce are reportedly willing to pay around £35 million, a fee that could satisfy Utd, but convincing the player appears to be the bigger obstacle.  They write:",
      "Marcus Rashford is set to be offered the chance to reunite with his former manager Jose Mourinho at Fenerbahce, but he is not thought to be keen on the idea.",
      "BeINSports report that Fenerbahce are ready to make a £35m bid for Rashford, which would be enough to do a deal with Manchester United for the forward.",
      "However, the report also states that Mourinho is likely to be disappointed as Rashford continues to prioritise a potential move to Barcelona for as long as it remains a possibility.",
      "Rashford is currently training away from the main group at Carrington alongside other transfer-listed players, including Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The club have made facilities available but have kept the first-team environment separate while the futures of those players remain unresolved.",
      "Marcus Rashford has ‘made his feelings clear’ by going to the gym, while a deal has been agreed that may or may not involve him.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are set to be ‘exploited’ as they face ‘paying millions’ to ‘offload’ three players this summer.",
      "Man Utd will be unable to offload Marcus Rashford to La Liga champions Barcelona this summer for their asking price, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Barcelona are under threat of being hijacked by another European giant in the race to sign Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford.",

      "Away and third kits to follow in due course but there are still just far too many unknowns and uncertainties there for any kind of solid ranking, and as you know we wouldn’t want to just put our name to any ranking that was half-baked. Ahem. On we go.",
      "",

      "",
      "19) Burnley\nUtter woke nonsense, we’re afraid to report. Burnley and Castore were so busy coming up with a shirt that meets the apparent current requirements to ‘taking inspiration from the local area’ that they completely forgot to take inspiration from an actual Burnley shirt.",
      "Update your phone wallpaper to celebrate our 2025/26 Home kit 🥳 pic.twitter.com/g6w7rcNGOE",

      "The marketing bullsh*t manifests in a vaguely topographical pattern designed to represent the fact that East Lancashire, famously and uniquely, has some hills in it.",
      "But they’ve completely failed to put anywhere close to enough blue on here. Yes, Burnley have in the past dispensed with their traditional blue sleeves, but we don’t care for it and it will never look right.",
      "And even when blue sleeves have been missing, there has usually at least been something blue to compensate. In 2017/18 there was a very wide blue cuff to the sleeves, for instance. In 2006/07 there was blue on one sleeve and down one side of the shirt. In 2005/06 there was a blue central band to balance out the claret sleeves.",
      "This is overwhelmingly claret, and that doesn’t sit right with us at all. Even something we normally welcome damns Burnley here: sponsors 96.com have allowed the 9 to change from yellow to blue, and it looks far better for it. But it now becomes the standout blue feature of the shirt.",
      "",
      "18) Newcastle United\nAnnoying. Very, very annoying. Everything about this shirt is first class, apart from the single most important thing which single-handedly ruins it. The laser-blue accents and trim are absolutely lovely and exactly the right tertiary colour for a Newcastle home shirt. The stripes continuing right into the collar is bold but works but also brings us to the problem.",
      "Adidas have – unbelievably and unforgivably – f*cked up this most un-f*ck-up-able of football shirt elements. Newcastle’s black-and-white stripes are a strong contender for being the easiest of all football shirt details to get right. All you have to do is just make sure they’re not too thin, not too thick, all the same width, and with proper clean edges. Iconic. Done. Beautiful.",
      "It is our sorry duty to report they’ve f*cked around with the edges of the stripes. There’s a load of noise about this being ‘dynamic’ and other meaningless shite but it just makes them look hazy and removes all the crispness of a shirt otherwise dripping in it. Fools.",
      "One other damaging  detail to note here is that while the trend for selling ‘replica’ tops at a ridiculously high price and then also ‘authentic’ ones for an even higher one is something none of us can now stop, we can’t ever recall the differences between the very expensive replica and the remortgage-your-house authentic being quite so obviously first-glance visible as they are here, with the ‘replica’ version appearing to feature a plain black front half of the collar rather than the stripe continuation of the ‘authentic’.",
      "Feels like a massive swizz for an 85 quid t-shirt not to have something as basic yet central to a shirt as the right collar and dare we say it a deliberate attempt to nudge people towards the £120 version. We hope it doesn’t catch on, but fully expect it will.",

We’re not saying this is bad, we’re saying we’re not sure whether it’s bad or brilliant, and it’s that total lack of conviction that has rattled us into the shadow realm. If we can no longer be sure about sashes on football kits, than what certainties do we have left to cling to?",
      "We don’t think we’re being dramatic when we say this feels like it might be a harbinger of absolute doom for all mankind. Especially in a year that has already featured Spurs winning a trophy and the MCC allowing members not to wear jackets in the Lord’s pavilion just because it was a bit warm.",
      "We expect confirmation that the ravens are leaving the Tower any moment.",

      "Let’s start with the good. The red and white cuffs and collar are good, as are the pinstripes at the edge of the main stripes. Well done there.",

      "Our big problem, though, is the ‘lace-up’ collar detail. Officially, it’s ‘inspired by our original 1925 kit lace design’ but… it’s a bit wanky isn’t it? There is absolutely nothing on this earth stopping you from being inspired by a lace-up collar by having…a lace-up collar. There was a whole fad for them in the 1990s.",
      "Just sort of drawing a fake one on sadly reduces a shirt that could have been really good to something approaching a novelty. It’s just a little bit too close to ‘humorous T-shirt with a bow-tie drawn on it’ which is a shame.",
      "",
      "15) Tottenham\nA significant departure this for Tottenham with plenty of non-white areas here. That’s not unusual in itself; what’s unusual is that just as Spurs managers generally alternate in style and tone, so too their home kits operate on a rota switching between all-white (or nearly all-white) and more colourful.",

      "— Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) June 18, 2025",
      "Yet after last year’s Kappa-coded full navy blue sleeves comes this effort. Now there’s less navy on this sleeve for sure, but it still constitutes a navy-heavy season, and with plenty of that silvery-blue-gray thrown in for good measure. That colourway brings to mind the Serhiy Rebrov-era late 90s adidas home shirt and we don’t mind that at all, in theory.",
      "We’re also comfortable enough with the central badge. We’re in general very much team crest-on-the-breast, but it just about works here because it is at least correctly accompanied by a central Nike swoosh (unlike last year’s duly unbalanced away kit) and Spurs have enough history of central-badge deployment to just about make it a legitimate option.",
      "What we can’t get away from – and no, we can’t fully explain this – is that the specific placement of the navy areas means this shirt is giving Bolton to a distracting degree.",
      "",
      "14) Liverpool\nA return to adidas for Liverpool after many years with Nike and based on the plentiful leaks out there it’s a safety-first start to the rekindled relationship, with a low-risk entirely inoffensive shirt that leans heavily on the 2006/07 classic minus the big ol’ flappy collar.",
      "It is absolutely fine but beyond the general feeling of correctness that comes from Liverpool having adidas kits, this isn’t one that on its own is going to grab anyone by the bollards, something we expect the away and third kits to do rather more based on the leaked pics we’ve seen so far.",

      "It’s absolutely adequate based on the leaks we’ve seen. While we’re always slightly reluctant to rank on leaks, we’re confident nothing new we could learn about this kit will propel it up or down this list in any significant way.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth\nWe will always prefer even stripes which puts this latest Bournemouth effort on the back foot from the start. The sand-effect red stripes are already thicker than the black ones here even before further red bordering is added in. A shame, because it’s actually rather good apart from that.",

      "— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) July 15, 2025",
      "We’re not even going to bother looking up the PR spiel as it will only annoy us and instead we’ll just go right ahead and assume the sand motif is once again drawing inspiration from the local area and okay, fine, whatever. The gold trim is nicely understated and swerves all accusations of gaudiness. If the thickness of the stripes were sorted out we’d be very happy with this. Not that they asked or care. Honestly, some people.",
      "",
      "11) Brighton\nNot too sure about the asymmetric collar – something Nike are keen on and seen last year on Spurs’ light blue away kit – but generally speaking it’s a bold and bright Brighton kit that we can all enjoy.",
      "One interesting quirk is that it’s almost entirely inverted from last year’s. That had white sleeves and blue cuffs, while this year it’s blue sleeves and white cuffs. Even the American Express logo has been flipped; it’s now white on a blue background instead of last year’s blue on white. Either way, it remains one of the less visually distracting sponsor logos around – and that’s especially tough to pull off on striped kits.",
      "The most exciting thing about Brighton’s kit, though, is that it takes the prestigious award for this season’s most overexcited and unnecessary made-up colour name. Football kit manufacturers rank second only to paint companies in this field, and we are beyond excited to tell you that the little turquoise flashes on the sides of this kit are not in fact just your common or garden turquoise but are in fact Hyper Turq.",

      "— Brighton & Hove Albion (@OfficialBHAFC) July 1, 2025",
      "",
      "10) Everton\nVery hard to rank until we actually get to see it for real. Because this might end up being our favourite kit of the lot, but based purely on the online pictures we’ve seen we’re not quite sure that carrying on the wave motif – an obvious nod to the new stadium and its dockside location – into the sleeves has quite paid off.",
      "What we do know for sure is that it’s a beautifully clean-looking Everton shirt for the start of their new era, and while this is no more than a personal preference, a crossover two-tone v-neck collar is absolutely S-tier football kit design in our view, so this scores perfect marks there.",
      "It’s powerfully reminiscent of classic Umbro-NEC era late-80s Everton. And one thing we’d note about that shirt is that the diamond pattern of the main body in that kit wasn’t continued into the sleeves. Not saying that proves anything, but it does show that there was the option to make that another nod to that classic kit.",
      "pic.twitter.com/JbimZktGYA",
      "— Everton (@Everton) June 27, 2025",
      "",
      "9) Arsenal\nThe key challenge for any home kit – away kits where almost anything goes have no such rules – is getting the right answer to one inevitably woolly and hard-to-define yet absolutely crucial question: Does it feel like a Team X kit? You’d be surprised how often this seemingly straightforward test is failed.",
      "For those of us whose football senses were hardwired in the late 80s and early 90s, Arsenal in an adidas kit means it’s almost impossible for them to get it wrong. And the new Arsenal home kit, with the purity of its red and white, could not be more Arsenal.",
      "It’s also a kit that merits viewing close-up in person, because the club’s classic gothic script A woven through it is a first-rate detail.",
      "Our quibbles are minor, but slightly too numerous for this to land right near the top of the list despite so much to recommend it. One is a very personal thing: we really like the old-school simplicity of the Arsenal cannon logo on last year’s kit, and if anything this is a kit for which it would appear even better suited, so it’s a shame in our irrelevant opinion to see the full shield badge restored.",
      "And having said last year’s shirt contained too much blue and praised the simplicity of this year’s, you’ll have to allow us a slight amount of hypocrisy in wondering whether it isn’t in fact, if anything Clive, almost too plain? Especially on that all-white round collar? A tiny amount of navy could have done wonders here.",
      "But we’re nitpicking. Arsenal’s red and white is suitably iconic that they are always better served erring on the side of simplicity – especially when they’ve got the adidas stripes which just look more correct here than anywhere else in the game. Certainly better this than going too heavy on the tertiary colour or, worse still, gilding the lily with unnecessarily gaudy gold as they have in the recent past.",
      "",
      "8) Aston Villa\nWe’re normally quick to dismiss ‘draws inspiration from…’ stuff in kit launches as so much nauseating PR bumwash – especially with this year’s cohort offering a surely record-breaking quantity of said bumwash – but Villa have done it well here if the widespread leaks are anything to go by, with a little bit of sleeve detail that makes obvious yet understated reference to the Holte End. It works in a similar way to Everton’s little Goodison architecture tribute a couple of years back.",
      "We’d have liked to see that detailing from the cuffs extended to the collar, because we really aren’t at all sold on the chunky plain T-shirt collars that so many kits seem to have next season.",
      "A source has leaked the 2025/26 Aston Villa Home Kit, It should officially release inside the next month if this is the actual design. pic.twitter.com/wtRVNHSwQe",
      "— Official AVFC News (@OffAVFCNews) June 11, 2025",
      "Other than that, it’s fine. The gold piping is handled with care and, by working in tandem with that Holte End pattern avoids taking a trip to gaudy-town and it absolutely manages to pass the ‘Feels like a Villa kit’ which is among the harder to pull off in a league with multiple claret-and-blue merchants, albeit perhaps easier this year with both Burnley and West Ham opting – with contrasting results – to lean into the claret.",
      "",
      "7) Chelsea\nThe metallic badges and swirling design of last year have been replaced by a more classic look for a club that has, in general, been among the most consistent deliverers of decent home kits over the years and decades.",
      "Chelsea does always feel like a home kit you have to actually try and f*ck up, and last year it did feel a little bit like that’s precisely what Nike were doing. It’s one that rewards a ‘isn’t broken, don’t fix it’ mentality. And that means lots and lots of blue, a tiny bit of white, and an even smaller flash of red.",
      "In other words, this year’s Chelsea kit has nailed that brief. The fact it is once again, for now, also sponsorless because Chelsea are such unlike-the-rest disruptors also works far better in combination with the traditional-look-with-modern-styling nature of this year’s shirt in contrast to last year’s more try-hard effort.",
      "Very, very good indeed.",

      "6) Crystal Palace\nWorth the wait, this one. We didn’t even know for the longest time whether Palace were sticking with Macron or moving on, but it’s Macron once again and it’s another hit. We very much enjoyed what we dubbed the firework kit last season, but what has been sensibly decided here is that it’s wise to follow up that properly bonkers interpretation of Palace’s red and blue stripes with something a bit more traditional this time around.",
      "But what they’ve not done is go all the way down that road to Boringville. The red and blue are both bright and vibrant, and given some real extra pop by the standout detail which is those white pinstripes between each main stripe.",
      "The collar is first-rate, too, and our only real quibble is with the white panel on the sleeves. On the long-sleeve version especially, it starts to look more like an extra stripe, and blue and white stripes are very much not the order of the day on Palace kits please and thank you. Solid blue here on the shoulders to go with the red underarm – or even just replacing thee white stripe with a red one – and you’d have a top-three contender.",

You do need a clear point of difference between those iconic red shirts, and it’s United’s history of black as an accent colour that makes it possible. Its use in the collar, cuffs and piping that hits just the right balance between subtle and striking, is on point here.",

      "The design on the sleeves is, of course, a nod to their stadium because that seems to be what everyone is doing this season. Presumably that means after one wash it will have all holes in it.",

      "Arsenal are on the verge of finally signing a Proper Striker in Viktor Gyokeres and sorting a priority position. Liverpool and Manchester United are next.",
      "",
      "10) Crystal Palace and a centre-half\nWhile most executives at Selhurst Park are busy scouring their emails for old messages from UEFA and preparing for trips to Lausanne in the coming days, Crystal Palace must soon put down their Evangelos Marinakis voodoo dolls and instead focus on squad-building.",
      "There is admittedly less work than might have been expected by mid-July, whichever European competition the Eagles land in.",
      "For all the frenzied speculation surrounding their most prized assets, Eberechi Eze, Marc Guehi, Adam Wharton, Jean-Philippe Mateta and Will Hughes remain.",
      "But there is a need for reinforcements and to push on from a position of strength. The central-defensive cupboards are particularly bare and Guehi’s departure feels inevitably whether this summer or next. Sporting must be too busy counting the Viktor Gyokeres pennies to start negotiating over Ousmane Diomande just yet.",
      "",
      "9) Manchester City and a right-back\nPep Guardiola perhaps didn’t realise he had identified his right-back solution for the best part of the next decade when Manchester City spent £50m to sign Kyle Walker in 2017.",
      "The only other players the Spaniard has signed specifically for that position at the Etihad have largely been lapped by that recovery pace: Danilo was only ever a back-up; Yan Couto never played for the club and Issa Kabore might well follow suit; Joao Cancelo was exceptional for a brief time before being ostracised.",
      "Walker described his exit chat with Guardiola as “not very comfortable” but in outlining a desire for new challenges in January, he spared the manager an even less pleasant conversation this summer.",
      "His decline has been pronounced and with the deposed champions embarking on their most ambitious squad revamp since Guardiola’s first, a shiny new right-back feels like The Final Piece of the Puzzle.",
      "",
      "8) Brentford and a forward\nAmong the many ludicrous numbers supporting Spurs’ choice of Thomas Frank as their new manager is this: in summer 2024 Brentford made Ivan Toney their record sale, spent most of the proceeds on Igor Thiago, saw him play 169 minutes last season due to injury and still enjoyed their best goal return in a single top-flight campaign post-Second World War.",
      "Keith Andrews was responsible for many of those as set-piece coach and it could be that his acumen transfers seamlessly to the role of Frank’s replacement as his first senior managerial post.",
      "But the likelihood remains that Brentford will lose either the fourth or sixth highest scorer in the entire 2024/25 Premier League; it would be a surprise if both Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa remained.",
      "Even in the event that attack is kept intact, Brentford need far more up front. Kevin Schade is the only other vaguely proven option in a department which needs Thiago to hit the ground running without knacking his knee.",
      "",
      "7) Leeds and a keeper\nWhen Leeds chairman Paraag Marathe took the unprecedented step of issuing a vote of confidence in a manager who had just earned Premier League promotion, adding that “we are going to build the best squad that we can with every penny that we’re allowed to spend,” supporters might reasonably have expected more than a freebie and £30m worth of defenders.",
      "Unless the plan was for Sean Longstaff to play in net, as a No. 10 and up front, Leeds need considerably more to compete instead of going into the season with a worse squad than that which Sam Allardyce took down two years ago, which is still really weird.",
      "That new keeper is especially pressing after the mistakes of Illan Meslier mounted to the point Karl Darlow had to drag Leeds over the line in the sodding Championship. Just sign Aaron Ramsdale and perpetuate the curse.",
      "",
      "6) Liverpool and a striker\nWith the ludicrous greed of Newcastle extending beyond selfishly keeping Alexander Isak to signing an option on the next rung down of desirable centre-forwards, Liverpool are a handful of steps away from declaring this the season Darwin Nunez finally comes good.",
      "A record of 40 goals and 26 assists in 143 appearances is far from shameful but a team pursuing trophies on four fronts requires far more consistency and reliability than the Uruguayan can offer.",
      "Liverpool could also do with a centre-half or two but ultimately the modern Premier League title race demands for one contender to Need A Proper Striker, and Arsenal are soon to pass on a baton they picked up from Manchester City years ago.",
      "",
      "5) Bournemouth and a centre-half\nAt least Andoni Iraola is aware that Bournemouth “will not find the same player” as Dean Huijsen, although it would be no disaster to identify another defender they are able to sell on for ludicrous profit within a single season.",
      "The sale of the Spain international and Milos Kerkez – and Paris Saint-Germain’s reluctance to meet the asking price – should preclude the exit of Illia Zabarnyi and subsequent extensive rebuild of Bournemouth’s entire central defence.",
      "But Huijsen alone leaves a substantial enough gap for the Cherries to plug, with more capable cover needed too.",
      "",
      "4) Aston Villa and a right-winger\nThe January transfer window gamble did not pay off. It made Champions League qualification a minimum requirement which proved beyond the competence levels of Emi Martinez and Matty Cash to deliver, and only increased the financial strain.",
      "That has been underlined in a deeply uninspiring start to the summer transfer window. Villa probably need to sell before they sign and the £3.5m generated for Kaine Kesler-Hayden doesn’t even cover Yasin Ozcan’s arrival.",
      "They need a right-back. They need at least one centre-half. They need a significant injection of attacking depth, including more options on either side and competition for Ollie Watkins. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were shiny distractions but only ever for so long.",
      "",
      "3) West Ham and a striker\nThe Prophecy dictates that West Ham always need a new striker. From Mido and Benni McCarthy in the first Sullivan and Gold transfer window to Evan Ferguson in the most recent, the East London graveyard of centre-forward hope has been littered with names over the last decade and a half.",
      "It is uncomfortably revealing that their best striker signing in that time was a left-winger plucked from the Championship and eventually repurposed into an unshiftable channel-running nuisance.",
      "Talks are ongoing with Michail Antonio over a contract renewal but Graham Potter needs far more backing, even if Niclas Fullkrug takes a break from his stint as irascible pundit to nod in a few goals.",
      "",
      "2) Everton and a right-winger\nThe signing of Thierno Barry has addressed one problem position but with a first-team squad currently comprising of about 18 players, Dave can afford to dither no more.",
      "Everton are especially light on numbers in defence, midfield and attack, while Jordan Pickford could probably do with some company too.",
      "But the most shocking aspect of Everton’s squad composition is that Jack Harrison was on loan from Leeds all this sodding time. Can Seamus Coleman play a bit further forward?",
      "",
      "1) Manchester United and a striker\nRuben Amorim has already been failed yet again by Manchester United, who by mid-July have only been able to generate money in the summer transfer window through sell-on clauses on players they offloaded long ago.",
      "Some might prefer to ask questions of how Anthony Elanga and Alvaro Fernandez have found themselves at Champions League sides after being deemed surplus to requirements at Old Trafford, but Manchester United having the foresight to ensure they were covered in that event is a necessary sign of growth and sensibility.",
      "Yet it will barely touch the sides of where that budget needs to go, especially if Brentford continue to inconsiderately want their money’s worth for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Even beyond another addition of a high-performing forward operating in the bottom half, Amorim needs someone capable of leading the line. It feels like a role painfully beyond the current capabilities of Rasmus Hojlund and while Joshua Zirkzee has handled the weight of the shirt far better, the Dutchman’s goal return isn’t close to what the position demands.",
      "The dream scenario is still on: Gyokeres struggles for Arsenal while Benjamin Sesko excels at Manchester United."

But Champions League qualification, two major-ish trophies and £30m-odd off the asking price later and they probably think he’s worth the punt.",

      "We’re far from convinced he’s what Liverpool need or whether he could make the step up, but Gordon’s got a knack of smearing egg all over our faces for doubting him and with the added danger of Arne Slot apparently wanting him, we wouldn’t dare to suggest it’s anything other than the perfect transfer.",

      "The Manchester United chiefs will pitch that a move to Old Trafford is a more attractive prospect to the Belgian than the inevitable Saudi offer, and even a switch to Fenerbahce to play under Jose Mourinho. And although they would be fighting a losing battle with Bayern Munich should the Bundesliga giants push ahead with a move, it’s a transfer that makes a lot of sense for the Red Devils, if a bit of a disheartening one for Trossard.",
      "He feels like a near-perfect player to operate in one of the inverted winger roles in Ruben Amorim’s infamous 3-4-3, and even assuming they finally secure Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, the Portuguese boss will need players to rotate in those positions with Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount.",
      "And signing Trossard would also grant Amorim the attractive prospect of playing three summer signings in a front trio rather than Rasmus Hojlund or one of the other deplorable options already tarred by the Old Trafford brush.",

He could sign both and still have change to spare.",
      "Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Liverpool all retain a belief that there’s A Footballer In There despite Nkunku offering remarkably little evidence in his two-year stint at Chelsea, and the Frenchman may well look at Newcastle, with Champions League football and Howe’s standout record of improving players, as an excellent landing spot this summer.",

      "6) Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOne Irish newspaper at the time of a transformative summer for Manchester United wrote that ‘along with Karel Poborsky and Jordi Cruyff, Scandinavian duo Ronny Johnsen and Ole Gunnar Sloksjar signed for a combined fee of £2.7 million’ to ‘make up Fergie’s team of flash continentals’.",
      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",

      "They’ve tried twice before to sign the 23-year-old, who got 22 goals and 12 assists in all competitions last season, but failed to land him in January 2022 when he opted for PSG, and again last summer when he joined Frankfurt for just £14.3m.",
      "The report claimed the Bundesliga side will likely hold out for the striker’s €100m [£86m] release clause, but that Newcastle had nevertheless ‘made the player’s representatives aware of their desire to sign the France Under-21 international and hope to agree a fee’, perhaps having been prompted into action by Frankfurt signing striker Jonathan Burkardt from Mainz for £18m.",

      "When asked if there’s a limit to what Amorim can do without major reinforcements, Brown said: “Last season, Man United struggled with concentration and doing the basics at times, which led to individual mistakes, which led to conceding preventable goals and losing winnable games.",
      "“There’s not a lot the manager can do about that, he can only set the team up for success, and then the players must go out and perform to get positive results.",
      "“At times last season, I think the pressure got to the players. They were playing a new formation and losing games, so the pressure was mounting on them all the time.",
      "“The expectation of playing for Man United can weigh heavily at times, and the players found that out last season. It is up to the manager in those moments to recognise it and pump the players full of confidence, but if they are losing games, that is hard to do.",
      "“However, they have all that experience now. They can use last season’s tough times to get them through next season’s tough times, so I do expect them to improve next year as a team. However, if the mistakes are still happening regularly, teams will punish you in the Premier League and results will be hard to come by.”",
      "According to reports, four reasons are behind Arsenal’s decision to sign Sporting Lisbon’s Viktor Gyokeres over RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Arsenal gave up on Benjamin Sesko to opt for Viktor Gyokeres over the lack of reasonable negotiation from RB Leipzig, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal need a striker. Viktor Gyokeres is the standout, but who else is there? From fantasy picks like Isak to the realistic Watkins, we rank 10 options.",
      "According to reports, Leipzig are ‘desperate to sell’ Benjamin Sesko to Arsenal, while another Gunners striker target ‘likes the idea of living in London’.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have ‘set a key deadline’ as they want to quickly reach an ‘agreement’ for a new striker in the coming days.",

      "Man Utd are hoping to do lots more transfer business but outgoings are crucial to how many they can bring in with the Red Devils looking to offload Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and more.",
      "The Premier League giants have been bidding for Brentford forward Mbeumo with two offers rejected so far and talks are continuing to get a deal over the line.",
      "Football Insider‘s senior correspondent Pete O’Rourke gave an update at the end of last week, he said: “I don’t think there’s any real panic from Manchester United over the pursuit of Brian Mbeumo – the key here is that the player wants the move.",

      "“Brentford will look to get more [money] up front because they’ll need it to try and replace him – it’s not going to be cheap to find a replacement for Mbeumo because we know how key he is for them.",
      "“Talks are ongoing between the two clubs and I fully expect this move to go through, and that Bryan Mbeumo will be a Manchester United player for the start of next season.”",
      "While transfer expert Fabrizio Romano also struck a similar tone to O’Rourke, he said: “The contacts are still ongoing between United, Brentford, people involved in the deal. Mbeumo still wants to go to Manchester United, and the club maintains their confidence, their optimism, to get the green light and sign Bryan Mbeumo in the next days.",
      "“So still no breakthrough in this story as of tonight but Manchester United keep advancing to find the right structure for the deal. They are working on easy and difficult add-ons, trying to make Brentford happy with their final proposal. So Man United are still on it. The Bryan Mbeumo deal is absolutely alive at this moment.”",
      "And now in a boost to the hopes of Man Utd to do a deal, Romano has revealed that Ipswich Town forward Hutchinson is the Bees’ target to replace Mbeumo.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘EXCL: Brentford are showing initial interest in Omari Hutchinson as possible replacement for Bryan Mbeumo in case of exit with Man Utd on it. Brentford appreciate Hutchinson but no club to club talks yet with Ipswich Town.’",

      "With the Premier League only a month away, we take a first look at the odds of the first top-flight manager to be sacked.",
      "You will not be surprised to see the names at the top of this list.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "19=) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is still a tiny part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it next season. It is based on essentially nothing, but it sits there nagging at us and just won’t go away.",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been put out of his misery somewhere.",
      "",
      "19=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "18) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season.",
      "",
      "17) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading. Doesn’t matter how they leave, just that they do. And Pep absolutely might.",
      "",
      "16) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "10=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "A big overseas move can’t be entirely ruled out, but we’re still very much in rank outsider territory here.",
      "",
      "10=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nWon’t be sacked, but could be poached with bigger beasts definitely paying attention. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Silva the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "10=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nSee Marco Silva.",
      "",
      "10=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "10=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "10=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-) competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin.",
      "",
      "7=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and there’s little chance now with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "But worry not; we’ll be back on the case in November, with the same total lack of impact, after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies six points outside the top five. And for some reason the bookies agree that he is nowhere near safe.",
      "",
      "7=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "7=) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nReally interesting one, is Potter. Feels like one of those with the widest possible spectrum of possible outcomes.",
      "If a time traveller from next May inexplicably used those physics-destroying, existence-endangering powers to come back and tell you about West Ham’s 25/26 season, you would not bat an eye at discovering they had finished seventh after flirting with a Champions League spot for several months, or that Potter had been sacked in October after a 1-0 defeat at Leeds left them 19th in the table and four adrift of safety.",
      "Now that’s in part because you’d mainly be trying to get your head around the sheer reckless pointlessness of that idiotic time traveller, but still. There are definitely a lot of managers we think are much less likely than Potter to last the whole season, but also not that many who are more likely to be the first to get the tin tack.",
      "You really do never quite know what you’re going to get from West Ham, a club who are far Spursier than they or indeed Spurs would care to concede.",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nAs we said, Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts nag away.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which is possible after the exits of Anthony Elanga and Morgan Gibbs-White – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "4) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nWe’ve said what we’ve said about the futility of fixture-list doom-mongery, about how second-guessing teams this far out is a fool’s errand. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level.",
      "Sure, we can’t possibly know with any great confidence whether Spurs and Man United are going to be better than last year or whether Nottingham Forest will be worse, but Burnley’s early home clash with Sunderland already looks an absolutely vital source of potential early-season respite.",
      "Because that game aside, Burnley have to deal with Spurs, United, Liverpool, Forest, City and Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "We’re also very unconvinced Parker’s new pragmatic approach that got Burnley up will be any more effective at this elevated level than those who attempt to run before they can walk, like your Vincent Kompanys or Russell Martins.",
      "",
      "3) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nRarely if ever has a manager looked more utterly doomed to ‘victim of his own success’ status than Le Bris, having foolishly got Sunderland promoted by mistake at least a year early.",
      "They finished 24 points behind the top two in last season’s Championship and won fewer than half their matches before pulling Sheffield United’s pants down in the play-off final.",
      "Sunderland appear to be the next – and by no means last – team who will begin a Premier League season with their first main target being just to get past Derby.",
      "They’ll probably do that, but it probably won’t be with Le Bris in charge. The near total lack of expectation on Sunderland to do anything much at all and a not-too-terrifying set of August fixtures is really all that saves him from top spot here.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford if they sell Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "",
      "1) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League.",
      "He lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "",
      "Arsenal supporters have lost it over the £50m+ signing of Noni Madueke, but here are six times Mikel Arteta has made angry fans look foolish.",
      "Arsenal have been handed a huge transfer boost in their pursuit of Real Madrid winger Rodrygo despite interest from PSG, according to reports.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has provided a strict deadline for when he wants a deal for Viktor Gyokeres wrapped up, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal are closing in on the signing of centre-back Cristhian Mosquera from Valencia, according to reports.",
      "A pair of Premier League rivals are moving closer to a transfer deal for an England international, according to reports."

      "Head coach Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘frustrated’ at how this summer transfer window is going for Manchester United after making two ‘priority demands’.",
      "This is Amorim‘s first summer transfer window as Man Utd boss and it is not going to plan for the head coach.",
      "The Red Devils require a massive squad overhaul as their dire 2024/25 campaign proved that most of their players are not good enough and need to be replaced.",
      "Amorim may regret his decision to join Man Utd mid-season as his unsuited squad struggled to adapt to his preferred 3-4-3 formation as they plummeted to 15th in the Premier League and lost in the Europa League final.",
      "A win over Spurs in the Europa League final would have been a huge boost as it would have secured Champions League football and a huge injection of cash, but the defeat leaves them with a limited budget and sales are required to raise funds.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘agree terms’ for ‘very close major’ third signing as ‘approval granted’ amid ‘compromise’",
      "But with United yet to offload any of their pricey outcasts, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon are their only summer signings.",
      "Man Utd really ought to get a wriggle on as they still have loads of business to do, but a fresh report has claimed that club chiefs face paying ‘millions’ to get three players off their books.",
      "It is clearly a mess and a report from Flashscore claims Amorim is ‘frustrated’ amid United’s ‘struggle in the transfer market’.",
      "It is also noted that he was ‘clear about two transfer priorities for Manchester United at the end of last season’, as he ‘demanded a proven goalscorer to address the lack of firepower in attack and also wanted a reliable goalkeeper who could be trusted in key moments’.",
      "It is claimed that ‘Amorim still does not have the profile of striker he asked for’ after he ‘pushed for Victor Osimhen or Viktor Gyokeres as he wanted a No. 9 with presence, pedigree, and consistency’.",
      "And while it is also pointed out that there is ‘internal frustration that no attackers have been moved on’, the goalkeeper situation has ‘taken a fresh hit’.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘While there is no personal issue between Amorim and Onana, it is understood that the boss had grown frustrated with the goalkeeper’s inability to consistently execute the basics. He wants to build from the back with confidence and that has not been possible.",
      "‘United were open to offers for Onana in the window, and although there were conversations with intermediaries, no concrete bids have arrived. Onana’s camp made it known that he was not actively seeking a move, and that has complicated matters further. Ideally, Amorim would have replaced him, but if not, the plan was always to bring in a goalkeeper to compete with Onana. That remains the case.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made the ‘fastest move’ as they look to fend off competition from rivals to sign a £45m Premier League star.",
      "According to reports, head coach Ruben Amorim has set a clear ‘deadline’ for Manchester United to complete their third summer signing.",
      "Man Utd could have a chance of signing Emiliano Martinez this summer as Aston Villa prepare to announce a new goalkeeper signing, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘weighing up’ a ‘reunion’ for one of Ruben Amorim’s former Sporting CP stars, as it’s felt they will ‘listen to offers’.",
      "That an access-all-areas documentary about Man Utd next season was given the consideration it was shows again the size of the job before Ruben Amorim…",
      "Andre Onana only joined Untied two years ago but already looks to be heading out the door if the club get their way."
