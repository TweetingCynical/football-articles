      "Chelsea have been offered the chance to strike a £45million deal for Aston Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez. Villa are resigned to being forced to cash in on the World Cup-winning Argentine in a bid to ease fears over failing the Premier League ’s PSR test and are aware that the Blues are in the market for a new No 1.",
      "Manchester United have been linked to a summer move for the 32-year-old former Arsenal shot-stopper and the belief in South America is that he would prefer a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "But United boss Ruben Amorim has other priorities to address this summer and will be unable to buy a new No 1 unless the Reds find a club willing to pay £35million for Andre Onana.",
      "And that has opened the door for Chelsea to step up their bid after Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen both failed to impress under boss Enzo Maresca.",
      "Martinez has a huge admirer at Stamford Bridge in the shape of assistant manager Willy Caballero. He has been exceptional during his six years at Villa Park and was hailed as the world ’s best goalkeeper after excelling for Argentina as they prevailed in Qatar in 2022.",
      "Villa admire Royal Antwerp’s highly-rated Senne Lammens, but there are a number of other clubs tracking the 22-year-old - including United.",
      "Villa need to sell to balance the books and are reluctant to lose rising England star Morgan Rogers. It is set to be a summer of big-money goalkeeper transfers.",
      "Newcastle are closing in on Burnley ’s James Trafford despite seeing the Clarets put a £40million valuation on the England Under-21 international’s head.",
      "Toon saw an £17 million bid for Trafford rejected a year ago - and their refusal to come up with the additional £5 million it would have taken to make the deal happen is now going to cost them.",
      "The Toon were hoping to pay closer to £30 million this summer, but the newly-promoted Clarets will have to pay Manchester City 20 percent of any profit they make on Trafford as part of the £15 million deal that took him to Turf Moor two years ago.",
      "Leeds are monitoring Newcastle’s interest in Trafford because they have set their sights on taking England international Nick Pope from the Tyneside club to boost their own chances of surviving in the Premier League.",
      "Pope has now posted a message on Trafford’s Instagram story saying ‘see you soon’. Burnley have signed 21-year-old Max Weiss from German club Karlsruher, but manager Scott Parker will want a more experienced keeper if he loses Trafford to ambitious Newcastle.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly given up in their pursuit of Antoine Semenyo - who was once dubbed a “younger version” of Mohamed Salah - after refusing to meet Bournemouth’s asking price.",
      "Having already wrapped up the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha to kickstart their summer transfer activity, United are in the market for a more multi-functional forward. Fitting that description is Semenyo, though the move now appears to have crumbled.",
      "The Ghanaian winger’s impressive 13 goals and seven assists this season sparked United’s interest, with talkSPORT claiming the player held talks with the club over a potential Old Trafford move. But the same performances that caught United’s attention have prompted Bournemouth to set the 25-year-old’s transfer value at a whopping £70m.",
      "That figure is part of a wider trend seen this summer, where Premier League clubs are charging more for their players as the traditional big clubs shift their attention to signing players with experience in England’s top flight.",
      "The i Paper reports that, in addition to United, Spurs showed the most interest in Semenyo, having stayed in contact with the Cherries after making an initial enquiry last week. But there’s an increasing belief he will stay at Bournemouth, with the Red Devils, Spurs and Newcastle all unwilling to meet their hefty asking price after he agreed a five-year contract extension with the club last year.",
      "United’s reluctance to pay so much is a clear indication of their approach to the summer transfer window, where they are under financial constraints and will not splurge as recklessly as they have done in the past.",
      "For example, Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo has emerged as Ruben Amorim’s top target over Semenyo, but the Red Devils only want him for a reasonable fee. Despite the Cameroonian's desire to join the Red Devils, United are yet to agree a deal with Brentford, who rejected a second bid of £55 million plus £7.5 million in bonuses for the 25-year-old.",
      "The Bees want at least the same fee United paid Wolves for Cunha up-front and it is still unclear whether the Red Devils will pay it. After missing out on European football next season, Amorim’s transfer budget this summer is not as big as it might have been if he had won the Europa League final in May.",
      "However, United’s latest financial results for the first three months of 2025 revealed a more encouraging picture despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe earlier this year suggesting the club was on course to run out of money by Christmas.",
      "It’s understood that United will therefore look to complete the signing of Mbeumo to go alongside Cunha with their current finances. But they will need to sell the likes of Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony before making any further additions beyond Mbeumo.",
      "If United bank the fees they are looking for for the aforementioned players, they will secure somewhere in the region of £170m. It is not expected that Amorim will sign a third forward, with those funds set to be invested in other areas of the pitch.",
      "That will mean missing out on Semenyo, who, former United striker Michael Owen, encouraged Liverpool to buy back in March as a replacement for Salah, whose future at the time was still unclear.",
      "Owen claimed the versatile winger could be a suitable heir to the Egyptian at Anfield, saying: “I like Antoine Semenyo at Bournemouth, who plays in the same position as Salah. I like him, a younger version, but definitely got energy, scoring capabilities and a good player.”",
      "He added: “That being said, you can’t replace Mo Salah. I mean if you said Mo Salah and Darwin Nunez went and Alexander Isak and Antoine Semenyo came then I don’t think it’s the worst swap in the world if we’re playing fantasy football here, but realistically Liverpool want to keep hold of their best players and Mo Salah is their best player so hopefully he doesn’t leave.\" Semenyo now looks set to stay at Bournemouth unless the club drop their valuation or the player tries to force a move through.",

      "Manchester United may have to start thinking outside of the box when it comes to their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo. The Red Devils were determined to make the Brentford star their second major acquisition of the summer.",
      "Following the signing of Matheus Cunha, they saw the Cameroonian as the perfect signing for their right-flank. The only issue is that Brentford have so far refused to play ball.",
      "The Bees have rejected two bids from United already, the latest being worth around £55m plus £7.5m. That was an increase on the £45m plus up to £10m in add-ons offer that they had already lodged.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim was determined to have Mbeumo signed and sealed before pre-season but as it stands, that looks unlikely. Should he want to have a winger under his belt before that deadline, he could be forced to look elsewhere.",
      "While Mbeumo caught the eye for Brentford last season, the same could certainly be said of his teammate Wissa. The Congolese forward netted 20 goals for the Bees in all competitions last season.",
      "And while he played more regularly as an out-and-out striker, Wissa has shown his versatility throughout his career. He has been stationed on either flank, as well as centrally.",
      "Given their stance on Mbeumo, United might find Brentford to be tricky customers once more when it comes to their other star forward, but he should certainly be in their thinking.",
      "Another standout performer in the Premier League last term, Semenyo netted 11 goals for an eye-catching Bournemouth side, as well as notching six assists. And that understandably saw a number of clubs sit up and take notice, with United, Spurs and Newcastle all thought to be admirers.",
      "Like Wissa, Semenyo’s versatility could see him rocket to the top of the list for United, with the Ghanaian equally adept on either flank. But Bournemouth’s stance might make a move slightly difficult.",
      "Semenyo is under contract until 2029, while the Cherries want to bank around £70m should they cash in this summer.",
      "While Wissa and Semenyo enjoyed stunning seasons, it could be argued that Crystal Palace star Eze had the best of the bunch. He scored 14 in all competitions - one of those strikes winning the Eagles the FA Cup - and notched a further 11 assists.",
      "Of course, he is more of an attacking midfielder but he has the skillset to make a very effective winger for United. And Palace might have a decision to make very soon.",
      "Eze has two years left on his contract at Selhurst Park, meaning they’re running out of time to potentially cash in on him. United look set to face competition from Arsenal should they pursue Eze.",
      "A somewhat more realistic option now, Chelsea appear happy to sell Nkunku this summer following a difficult couple of campaigns at Stamford Bridge. He has scored just 17 goals over the past two seasons as a Chelsea player since a big-money move from RB Leipzig.",
      "Again, his versatility might see him emerge as a sensible option given he can play across the frontline. United are long-term admirers of the forward so could renew their interest should the option arise.",
      "Okay, we’re kind of cheating here but desperate times call for desperate measures. There’s no getting around it, Sancho has endured a rotten spell at Old Trafford.",
      "And the Red Devils are desperate to move him on. But should they want to save their money for a out-and-out centre forward, it might not be the worst idea in the world reintegrating Sancho into the side.",
      "There is talent there, as evidenced by his time with Borussia Dortmund - it’s just about getting it out of him.",

      "The fate of Manchester United's 2025/26 season hinges on the transfers they are able to pull off in the next two months. The 2024/25 campaign was the club’s worst in recent memory, with Ruben Amorim's men repeatedly setting unwanted records.",
      "They finished 15th in the Premier League and missed out on Champions League football after a defeat in the Europa League final in May. However, a glimmer of hope emerged from their misery. It was clearly evident that a rebuild - built in Amorim's vision - was needed for their Portuguese boss to stand a chance at success next season.",
      "United kicked off the transfer window by announcing the signing of Wolves striker Matheus Cunha in a £62.5million deal earlier this month. The club's hierarchy continues to operate behind the scenes to orchestrate more signings and sales, with several high-profile names linked with an Old Trafford move this summer.",
      "It's clear that Garnacho's days at Old Trafford are numbered. The 20-year-old voiced his dissatisfaction towards Amorim following United's Europa League loss to Spurs in Bilbao, having only been brought on from the 71st minute during the final.",
      "It was just the latest in a series of behavioural issues involving the Argentine winger, with Chelsea and Napoli’s interest providing the perfect chance to sell him this summer. Garnacho's own preference is to remain in the Premier League, which initially made Chelsea the front-runners for his signature.",
      "However, it seems that the Blues have now swapped their Garnacho interest in favour of another winger, Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens, who they are reportedly nearing a deal for a fee of £55.5m. Gittens' move to Stamford Bridge would likely put an end to their pursuit of Garnacho.",
      "That leaves United searching for another buyer for a player whose sale would generate substantial funds for new players. Chelsea could send £35m-rated Josh Acheampong to Dortmund in return in a separate deal, with The Independent claiming the Bundesliga side are interested in signing him.",
      "Amorim is clearly a fan of Gyokeres, having played a crucial role in the striker's evolution into a world-class player during their time together at Sporting CP. However, until now, the Swede has insisted that he only wants a move to Premier League rivals Arsenal this summer, as the Gunners weigh up whether to purchase him or RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Sesko is thought to be Mikel Arteta's preferred signing, but Gyokeres was still very much in contention due to his lower price tag. Yet, according to Bild, Leipzig have now reduced their initial asking price of £68-£85m to around £59.7m, which could see Arsenal proceed with their deal for Sesko.",
      "This could put Gyokeres in an unwanted position as his agent has already fallen out with Sporting's bosses by trying to orchestrate a move away. The development, however, provides the perfect opportunity for United to swoop in, should Gyokeres prefer a Premier League move to other options in Europe, with Juventus and other teams also lurking.",
      "On Friday, The Athletic reported that United target Mbeumo has told Brentford he would prefer to sign for the Red Devils if he moves on this summer. Mbeumo's current contract runs until June 2026, though the Bees have the option to extend it by another 12 months.",
      "Despite this, United have made two offers, the second being £55m plus £7.5m in bonuses, both of which were turned down. Negotiations have been ongoing between the two clubs, but a potential deal was being threatened by Tottenham, who recently appointed Mbeumo’s former Brentford boss, Thomas Frank, as head coach.",
      "However, it is understood that the Cameroon international only has eyes for United, with Spurs' interest now thought to be waning. With the player's position clear, it's up to United and Brentford to agree on a transfer that would significantly bolster Amorim's squad next season.",

      "He very publicly fell out with Ruben Amorim last season and while he returned to the side, it did not appear as though he ever fully regained the trust of his manager. Garnacho, 20, was left out of the side for the Europa League final and hinted that he could look elsewhere.",
      "Things have grown even more messy since then, with Chelsea and Napoli expressing interest in signing him. Garnacho was then spotted in an Aston Villa shirt during his post-season break.",
      "In giving his assessment of United’s potential move for Chelsea’s Christopher Nkunku, Littler claimed that the writing is already on the wall for Garnacho. Speaking to Covers, he said: \"I'm pretty sure we were looking into him last season or the season before, before he joined Chelsea.",
      "“Obviously that's what they're looking into, a swap deal with Garnacho moving to Chelsea and Nkunku to us. But I think either way, Garnacho doesn't have a United future anymore. I think Nkunku can either play as a 10 or play as a 9.\"",
      "Garnacho has been with United since a 2020 move from Spanish side Atletico Madrid and has gone on to make 144 appearances, scoring 26 goals. His current deal is set to run until the summer of 2028.",
      "Regardless of if he stays with the club, Garnacho appears likely to fall down the pecking order. United have already moved for Matheus Cunha and continue to pursue Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo despite the Bees having rejected their second bid.",
      "But Littler is sure that deal will be done and has now urged club chiefs to look at bolstering other parts of the squad next. He added: \"Yeah, obviously we wouldn't be offering more money if we didn't think he's going to fit in well. I think we're up to £60million, £65m as of today. But I'm sure we'll get him over the line.",
      "\"Obviously Matheus Cunha is a done deal from Wolves. But then even if we do get (Mbuemo) we'll need to start looking at the midfield and then obviously the back line.\"",

      "Mbeumo has his heart set on moving to Old Trafford and has told Brentford and his former manager, Thomas Frank, that he won’t be joining him at Tottenham. Yet Ruben Amorim is still waiting to land the 25-year-old right winger, with the Bees playing hard ball.",
      "United’s improved bid of £55m and £7.5m of bonuses, which was submitted on Monday, has been rejected by Brentford.",
      "It followed an opening offer of £45m plus £10m. Brentford, naturally, want the bulk of the fee paid up front, while United would prefer to spread out the cost. The Bees are holding out for a fee close to £65m and it remains to be seen if United return with an improved third bid for the Cameroon international or decide to look at alternative targets.",
      "While Tottenham made their interest known, they never submitted an official offer for Mbeumo. And the north London club are understood to have moved on after Mbeumo informed Frank personally of his preference to join United.",
      "United will continue negotiations with Brentford over Mbeumo and are still confident of getting a deal done. That confidence is based on the player’s wishes and the fact that they don’t need to sell their unwanted players to fund the move.",
      "They are understood to be willing to offer Mbeumo between £150,000-£175,000-a-week, with bonuses taking that expected package to £200,000-a-week. He is under contract with the Bees until June 2026, but the club also have the option to extend it by a further 12 months.",
      "Mbeumo has been with Brentford since 2019, when he joined for £5.8m from French side Troyes. He has contributed 70 goals and 51 assists in 242 appearances for the club altogether and looks set to follow in the footsteps of Ivan Toney is leaving west London.",
      "Brentford have already banked £10m from Spurs in compensation for Frank and are braced for a summer of upheaval. They announced the appointment of Keith Andrews as Frank’s replacement on Friday, but look set to lose Mbeumo and captain Christian Norgaard, who is the subject of a £9.3m bid from Arsenal.",
      "United are rebuilding their squad under Amorim and are attempting to sell Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho, among others. Rashford has his heart set on Barcelona, Garnacho has been linked with Chelsea and Napoli and Sancho has reportedly agreed to join Fenerbahce.",

      "Brentford are said to want the total deal to potentially reach as much as £63m, more than the £62.5m United paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha. Mbeumo wants to make the move to United, despite his former Brentford boss Thomas Frank being keen on reuniting with him at his new club Tottenham.",
      "Personal terms between United and Mbeumo are understood to have been agreed, with the 25-year-old set to earn around £200,000-a-week. United return for pre-season training on July 7 and boss Ruben Amorim wants Mbeumo on board to start then, along with Cunha, to give them sufficient time to integrate into their new squad.",
      "Mbeumo, who joined Brentford for £5.8m from French side Troyes in 2019, scored 20 goals and provided eight assists last season to help the Bees finish 10th in the Premier League - five places above United.",
      "Having signed Cunha, United identified winger Mbeumo as their next summer signing, with Amorim and the club looking to offload current wide men Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony.",
      "United are also looking to sign a striker to lead their attack, but failed in their pursuit of Liam Delap, who joined Chelsea from Ipswich, while Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres prefers a move to Arsenal, where he can continue to play in the Champions League.",
      "For only the second time in 35 years, United will not play European football next season, after losing the Europa League final to Spurs, who will compete in the Champions League under Frank. It was Frank who urged Brentford to demand a sizeable fee for the French-born Cameroon international after his stellar season for the Bees.",
      "As quoted by Tipsbladet before joining Tottenham, the former Brentford manager said: \"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",
      "\"There is a reason why he costs X number of million pounds, and we do not have X number of million pounds to buy for. I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer.",
      "\"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\""

      "Paul Ince believes that Manchester United should look to sign Ollie Watkins this summer. The Red Devils have been working hard to improve Ruben Amorim's squad since the opening of the transfer window, securing Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a £62.5million move earlier this month.",
      "Recruiting proven firepower is thought to be a priority at Old Trafford in the coming months, given that Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee failed to have much of an impact in the Premier League in 2024/25 - scoring a combined seven goals.",
      "And as a result, United have been endless in their pursuit of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, while also showing an interest in the likes of Sporting CP's Viktor Gyokeres. An initial bid of £55m for Mbeumo was rejected, but it is thought that their improved figure exceeding £60m may get a deal over the line for the 25-year-old winger.",
      "Gyokeres, meanwhile, has also proved to be a tough acquisition for Amorim and the United board. While Arsenal are thought to have held pole position for the 27-year-old striker, who found the back of the net 39 times in the Primeira Liga this season, it appears as though the Red Devils are now back in the running - although a move could cost another £60m.",
      "Newcastle United talisman Alexander Isak is another of the summer transfer window's most talked-about names having impressed at St. James' Park since arriving from Real Sociedad back in 2022. However, the £150m price tag set on the 25-year-old - given that he is considered one of the best goal-scorers in Europe at present and is under contract with the Magpies until 2028 - may prove off-putting to a cost-cutting United side.",
      "With those players totalling as much as £270m, Ince, who played at Old Trafford between 1989 and 1995, believes that his old club could find a far cheaper solution in Aston Villa's Watkins this summer.",
      "\"He can run it behind, he's quick, he can hold the ball up. He's got all the attributes of a striker that you want. And if you look at the way he was kind of pushed out towards the back end of the season when [Marcus] Rashford came, there might be something.",
      "\"He won't be happy about not playing towards the back end of the season. So, there might be something doing. Maybe not, that's down to Ollie and his agent and getting it sorted out. But if I was trying to bring a striker in, I'd bring in Ollie Watkins.",
      "\"And I think it would take a lot of weight off Hojlund. Rasmus Hojlund is a young striker and he's been asked all last season to play at the biggest club under the biggest expectations, under the biggest pressure and the biggest spotlight to score goals.",
      "\"And, you know, it's not happened for him and he's been criticised for it - and I think sometimes a bit unfairly. I think he's one of those young players who maybe needs to maybe go on loan somewhere for a year, score goals or just be a support act for whoever they bring in so he's not under pressure every time when he starts a game.",
      "\"And that coincides with United being poor, United not playing well, players not adjusting to the system. It's been a tough, tough year for him but he’ll learn. It's character-building.",
      "\"But he needs that striker where he can just say, ‘Right, well, the pressure’s not on me to go and score a week in and a week out, and when the game opens up, maybe I can get 15, 20 minutes on the pitch where I can - hit the back of the net.'",
      "\"But it wasn't just the goals and people just talk about the goals. I think, you know, he's got to work on his hold-up play. For me, he needs to be a lot, lot better at his retention of the ball. But these are all things you expect from a young player, but things that he needs to be working on every day.\"",
      "It comes after Arsenal made a bid for Watkins in the January transfer window to the tune of around £60m, which left Villa officials fuming given it was made public just two hours before their Champions League clash with Celtic. Watkins impressed in the Premier League this season, finding the back of the net on 16 occasions in 38 appearances while providing eight goals overall - and should United be serious in bolstering their lead line ahead of 2025/26, the 29-year-old would undoubtedly fit the bill.",
      "Paul Ince spoke ahead of the final #RifeDontMiss Challenge, celebrating the launch of the new RIFE Black Edition putters. To register for the final qualifier and be in with a chance of winning £50,000, sign up here.",

      "And while club chiefs are keen on a move for Rooney, he has recently spoken out on his future and hinted that he wasn’t looking for a return to management any time soon.

      "“Some of the stuff that was said when I took on the job was unpleasant to say the least. It was a horrible summer.",
      "“But this team will get in the play-offs, and I believe we will go up, but if we don’t win promotion I will walk away from the dugout, take a back seat as a part-owner and watch from afar. There will be people who hope I fall flat on my face, but if that happens it won’t be for a lack of effort.”",

      "Manchester United have lost the opportunity to sign former wonderkid target Youssoufa Moukoko at a bargain price, years after Erling Haaland praised the Borussia Dortmund striker's skills on the pitch. The 20-year-old has been the subject of much transfer speculation over the years following his history-making Bundesliga debut.",
      "However, it now appears that the young talent will be leaving Germany and joining FC Copenhagen in an unexpected move for the former prodigy. The forward made history in 2020 by becoming the youngest player to debut in the German league at 16 years old during Dortmund's 5-2 victory over Hertha Berlin.",
      "Following the match, Manchester City forward Haaland, who was also with Der BVB at the time, hailed Moukoko as the best young player he'd ever seen. He said: \"He's the biggest talent in the world right now. I am over 20, I am getting old now!\"",
      "This wasn't the first time Haaland had lavished praise on Moukoko. He told the Bundesliga's official website that the young striker was superior to him at that age, adding: \"Moukoko is much better than I was at his age.",
      "\"The advantage for him is that he's already playing for Dortmund at the age of 15. At his age, I was still playing for my home town of Bryne.\"",
      "Now, five years later, Moukoko is securing his transfer from the German club, but not to the major European giant that many would anticipate.",
      "In 2022, United were quoted a hefty £26.2million for the promising young striker, who was garnering attention from rivals such as Liverpool, as well as European giants Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "At the time, Moukoko's representative, Patrick Williams, was frank when he spoke to BILD about his client's need for more game time to blossom. He made the point to warn Dortmund over the looming end of the player's contract.",
      "Williams said: \"It is not a matter of course that Youssoufa is extending BVB. Of course, many clubs are interested in Youssoufa, that's no secret. The end of his contract in the summer of 2023 is getting closer, the top clubs have that on the slip.",
      "\"Yes, injuries have thrown him back a bit this season. Yes, the competition at BVB is of course great. But he hardly gets the playing time that he needs in the current phase of his career in Dortmund. So of course we think about what is best for the future.\"",
      "Unfortunately, a transfer to United never came to fruition, and Moukoko is reportedly now heading off to Copenhagen for a much more modest £4.3million. Fabrizio Romano has reported that the star will undergo a medical on Friday, paving the way for a new journey in the Superliga.",
      "Even though Moukoko has slipped through their fingers, the Red Devils aren’t avoiding making any transfer moves this summer. United have already secured Brazilian star Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5million on a five-year deal, signalling their intent for the future.",
      "It's also been reported that they're set to beat Tottenham Hotspur to the post in signing Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo, with the 25-year-old on the verge of sealing a £60m deal with the Red Devils.",
      "However, boss Ruben Amorim will be keen for more arrivals at Old Trafford - and departures too - in what is sure to be a hectic few weeks ahead of the Premier League season kick-off.",

      "But despite holding all the cards: a bigger bid, a familiar face in Frank, and being able to offer Champions League football, it seems the club will have to turn elsewhere. Ruben Amorim's side look set to agree a deal worth £65m, with Mbeumo anticipated to complete a deal next week.",
      "Football doesn't always make sense, although Manchester United did finish two places above their rivals in the league despite falling to them in the Europa League final. Perhaps money talks or perhaps the Red Devils' stature remains worth more than more tangible qualities.",
      "What may be more frustrating is that Tottenham could once again find themselves as the odd one out, unable to capture the attention of the figure commanding everyone's eyes on the dancefloor that is the transfer window.",
      "With the competition of an even fiercer rival, Spurs may be forced to jink and jive to standout. Arsenal could be the team to scupper Tottenham's back-up plan after 'holding talks' with Eberechi Eze's representatives.",
      "Spurs have long-tracked the Crystal Palace and England star but may struggle to hold a candle to Arsenal's Premier League ambitions after a difficult time in 2024/25. Eze made it on to Spurs' shortlist but it appears the Gunners could jump the queue with Andrea Berta already on the case and in conversations.",
      "The Europa League champions cannot even repeat their ploy to land Mbeumo as Eze has a release clause in his contract. The former QPR starlet can be taken from Selhurst Park for £68m, ensuring the 26-year-old has almost the only say in his future.",
      "But a scenario where Spurs are left chasing another target is not out of the realms of possibility. The will once again attempt to please, persuade and impress that they are a more suitable option to settle down with over their north London neighbours.",
      "It is the Gunners who can offer a stable environment and will strive for the greatest gold in 2025/26 however. Spurs meanwhile are onto the seventh new face in their dugout since Eze became a Premier League player in 2020 - they will have their work cut out once again.",
      "Someone will be left unhappy come the end of the summer. For the moment, Spurs are most at risk.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has admitted he was \"devastated\" when Carlos Tevez left the club to join local rivals Manchester City. Rooney and Tevez spent two seasons together at Old Trafford between 2007 and 2009.",
      "Along with Cristiano Ronaldo, the pair were part of a formidable attacking trio that fired United to two Premier League titles and a Champions League. However, Tevez was only at United on loan and he ended up joining rivals City in 2009 after the Red Devils failed to agree a permanent deal.",
      "Tevez went on to spend four years at City and notably helped them win their first league title since 1968 in 2012, with United finishing runners-up that season on goal difference. Reflecting on Tevez's move, Rooney told the BBC : \"I was gutted to be honest.",
      "\"I'm pretty sure Carlos wanted to stay at Manchester United. Man City at the time were trying to build and become competitive and I knew that he'd be a massive part of that because obviously the ability he has.",
      "\"I think we've seen when he went there, he had some great times there as well. I was devastated, I would've really like him to stay longer and continue to play with him.\"",
      "Rooney also named Tevez as his \"favourite strike partner to play alongside\", claiming that most defenders \"hated playing against the two of us\". Rooney added: \"When Carlos joined Manchester United, there was a lot of talk about whether Carlos and I could play up front together.",
      "\"I was really excited when we signed him. We were similar in ways how we played - both worked hard and could both play as a nine, both play off the forward as well. We had a really good understanding and chemistry on the pitch, off the pitch.",
      "\"I used to pick him up to take him to the airport before Champions League games. It was interesting actually because we couldn't really have a conversation. I think his English was better than he let on.",
      "\"He's a player you'd always want on your team and he scored some great goals for us, at big moments for us as well. Two years at Manchester United - two league titles, the Champions League... he was a massive part of that.",
      "\"I think Carlos was my favourite strike partner to play alongside. Most defenders we played actually hated playing against the two of us and we could feel that. We knew we were nasty as well. Very instinctive, intense, off the cuff. Anything could happen at any moment.\"",

      "Originally founded in Sheffield in 2020, creator Matty Cassell began hosting friendly, casual football games with the idea of donating the excess from playing fees to local foodbanks. The initiative took Sheffield by storm and was brought to Manchester the following year.",
      "It was also five years ago that Rashford became an ambassador for FareShare, helping fight hunger in the nation’s most vulnerable communities at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "\"He’s a great example of how football can make a huge difference off the pitch. It will be a real milestone moment for us when we get to the point where massive clubs are interested in supporting and working with us.”",
      "Football for Foodbanks was formed in response to the need for inclusive football games that welcome players of all abilities and backgrounds.",
      "Adam explained: \"There was a huge gap for casual games of football that can accommodate all abilities and anyone who wants to play. We do not mind that you have a dodgy knee, have never kicked a ball before, or are feeling a bit old these days.",
      "\"We are proud to provide the space where you are welcome to play. We won’t charge more than £4 per player as we want to make sure that our games are always accessible and affordable for all. This does mean that many of the pitches in Manchester are out of our price range, and we’d risk running at a loss if we didn’t fill the pitch every week.",
      "\"As a result, we are reliant on the generosity of our current venues offering special rates for community-focused organisations, allowing us to make the money that goes on to make the difference for those who need it. Not every pitch offers such rates, so it’s a real sign that a particular venue cares about being part of the community, and it’s something we’d like to see more of, as our organisation is an example of bringing that to life.\"",
      "In Manchester, the organisation hosts three men's games each week, along with one game specifically for women and gender minorities. \"The games are at different times on different days to try and accommodate as many different lifestyles as possible,\" Adam stated.",
      "\"Mens currently play Mondays at 8:00pm at the Manchester Academy High School and on Tuesdays, the game is played at Burnage Rugby & Football Club at 9pm. On Wednesdays, men's, women & gender minorities play two games at The Energy Box at 7pm.\"",
      "If you're based in Manchester and want to take part, it's simple to get started. \"We have two Facebook groups – one for our Men’s Division, and one for our Women and Gender Minorities Division,\" he detailed.",
      "\"We love giving everyone a chance to get involved, so our players can join whichever group they feel comfortable playing with. Sign-up posts go live at 6pm two days before each game, and spaces are allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis depending on pitch size.",
      "\"On the day, turn up and pay your £4 fee, and we’ll take care of the rest. Once a month, we do a big shop where around 70% of the money left over after paying for the pitch gets used to buy food, toiletries and hygiene products which we then donate to foodbanks in the area.\"",
      "The organisation has seen great success, with Adam and his team running games non-stop since launching the initiative in Manchester in May 2021.",
      "\"We have put on games every week - other than a well-earned break over Christmas - since we started in Manchester, and there is no sign of slowing down,\" he revealed.",
      "The past few years have been incredibly rewarding for the organisation, and it has been difficult to choose just one standout moment among so many meaningful experiences.",
      "\"We have so many wonderful moments to choose from,\" Adam recalled. \"We have organised multiple 11-a-side friendlies against other like-minded teams in the Greater Manchester area, and when we do this we ask players to bring a bag of food rather than pay money to play.",
      "\"On one such occasion we combined the physical donations and the cash raised by one month of games, to donate over £600 to Humans MCR - their biggest donation ever, all through passive income from kicking a ball about and having a laugh.\"",
      "However, if football’s not your cup of tea, you can still support Football for Foodbanks with a donation. The organisation’s own merchandise helps raise donations which are then exchanged for food.",
      "A total of 15 foodbanks are supported by the organisation. They are proud to support Clay Cross Foodbank, Chesterfield Foodbank, Derbyshire Community Hub, MK Foodbank, Emmeline’s Pantry, Perry’s Pantry Foodbank, Little Bundles, Humans MCR, Manchester South Central Foodbank, The S2 Foodbank Network, Grace Foodbank, Burngreave Foodbank, Baby Basics, Stannington Foodbank and Sheffield S6 Foodbank.",
      "In addition to Manchester, the organisation operates in Chesterfield, Rotherham, Milton Keynes, and Northampton. If there isn’t a location near you, you can still choose to donate directly to your local foodbank.",
      "\"If you want to support your local foodbank, contact them directly - many of them have direct donation options and are able to claim Gift Aid to boost your donation even further,\" Adam encouraged.",
      "While community support remains strong week in and week out, Football for Foodbanks is still in need of sponsorship. “We have been successful in some small funding applications over the years to enable us to build a website.",
      "\"We have had some very generous players over the years that have helped fund trophies, kits, or donated their time to referee our organised games, but we have not had formal sponsorship up to now.”",

      "The youngster had made just one senior appearance for Arsenal before his move to Old Trafford, coming on as a late substitute in a Carabao Cup win over Preston in October.",
      "United's hefty summer spend meant the mid-season window was always going to be a quiet one, and so it proved. Heaven arrived in a deal worth just over £1million and little was expected of the youngster early in his Old Trafford career due to his age and lack of experience at the top level.",
      "Heaven made his United debut off the bench against Fulham in the FA Cup in March, with his Premier League debut coming the following week against former club Arsenal. A full debut soon followed against Real Sociedad in the Europa League, with the youngster slotting seamlessly into United's backline.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been full of praise for Heaven since his arrival from Arsenal, saying after the final day win over Aston Villa: \"Bringing Ayden... it is these kind of players that we need because he show a lot of character and quality after a big injury. We want this kind of player.\"",
      "Heaven has already shown himself to be more than capable of holding his own in the first team, and his addition could prove to be crucial as United look to build a squad able to challenge for a European spot next term.",
      "Should they complete a deal for Bryan Mbeumo, United will still have plenty of work to do in the market. A striker, midfielder, goalkeeper and maybe even a full-back are wanted at Old Trafford. It's a hefty to-do list for one summer, and so not having to add a centre-back to that list is a huge boost.",
      "Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans have both left the club, while Lisandro Martinez's injury means it is unclear when he will be available again. That leaves Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro as United's natural centre-back options, though Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui can fill in if needed.",
      "Tyler Fredricson performed admirably when given a chance last season but it is perhaps still too soon to judge whether he could cut it in the Premier League week in, week out. Had Heaven not arrived in the mid-season window, with only three senior, natural centre-backs available to Ruben Amorim to fill the three spots in the back line, there's every chance United would have needed to add a new centre-back to their summer wishlist.",

      "It was hoped that Van Nistelrooy's arrival at the King Power Stadium would lead to a top-flight survival after his reasonably impressive spell at United for a brief period. But results continued to nosedive, and the Foxes were relegated to the Championship, finishing the 2024/25 season in 18th place, 13 points from safety.",

      "The Swede has been heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford ever since his former head coach, Ruben Amorim, arrived in November. A reunion made sense, with United needing a proven goalscorer and Gyokeres looking for a new challenge in his career.",
      "But the Reds' failure to qualify for next season's Champions League seriously dented those hopes, and it was thought that Premier League rivals Arsenal would now be his preferred destination. The Gunners are also more realistic title challengers next season, and at 27, Gyokeres will be looking to join a team capable of winning major trophies.",
      "Arsenal do not just have Gyokeres on their list of potential attacking targets this summer, though. Benjamin Sesko, previously linked with United himself, is also on Mikel Arteta's shortlist.",
      "And now, German publication Bild has provided some welcome news for United. It is said that RB Leipzig have dropped the asking price of Sesko, which could in turn hand Amorim a welcome boost in his pursuit of Gyokeres.",
      "It was previously thought that the Bundesliga side were demanding a fee of between €80million and €100m (£68m and £85m) for Sesko. That had put off the north London club, who reacted by exploring alternative options.",
      "However, it is now being suggested that a fee of €70m (£59.7m) might be enough for the 22-year-old. Sesko is under contract with Leipzig until June 2029 and scored 21 goals in 45 games across all competitions last season.",
      "The Slovenian is seen as Arsenal's preferred option up front this summer, and with him now potentially being available for a cheaper fee, his move to the Emirates Stadium is much more likely. That will only be good news for United if they look to sign Gyokeres.",
      "It comes after the forward rejected a financially lucrative move to Saudi Arabia in May. Al-Hilal made a £55m offer, which Sporting rejected, but Gyokeres made clear he had no intention of moving to the Gulf state - and he wants to continue to compete in Europe.",

      "United have already forked out £62.5million for Matheus Cunha, while a bid in excess of £60m has been tabled for Bryan Mbeumo. With a striker, midfielder, goalkeeper and maybe even a full-back still on the club's summer wishlist, players need to go before players can arrive.",
      "It's been no surprise to see business slow down in recent weeks, with the Premier League's financial year ending on June 30.",
      "A lot of clubs will be waiting until after that date passes to complete deals that have been in the works for a number of weeks, and so next week should provide a clearer picture of what is going to be possible for United in this summer's transfer window.",
      "United are looking to offload a whole host of players this summer, with Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho on the list of priority sales. The club are prepared to sell any player in transfer window if the right offer is tabled, but the aforementioned quartet simply must be moved on.",
      "United want £40m for Rashford and they must sell Antony for £32.5m to avoid making a loss on the Brazilian under the league's profitability and sustainability rules. £15m would see United avoid making a loss under PSR rules on Sancho, and it's difficult to see them getting any more than that given his form in recent years and the fact that Chelsea paid £5m to avoid committing to a £25m deal for the former Borussia Dortmund man.",
      "Napoli tabled a bid of £40m for Garnacho in January, and United are said to want north of that figure this summer. £50m might be enough to sign the Argentina international.",
      "If United can move all four players on, they'll hope to add roughly £137m to their kitty.",
      "Whether that is possible will become clear next week as the June 30 'deadline' passes and clubs look to kick into gear in the transfer market.",
      "If news of parties interested in Rashford, Antony, Sancho and Garnacho doesn't ramp up next week, United could be in for a long summer."

      "The Sweden international was one of the most prolific performers in Europe last term as he scored 54 goals in 52 appearances across all competitions for Sporting CP. The forward seems set to leave the Portuguese capital this summer, with the Primeira Liga champions reportedly demanding a fee of close to £85 million for the former Coventry City and Swansea City.",

The report from Portuguese outlet Record claims that the 27-year-old's agent has been in touch with the Gunners' sporting director Andrea Berta.",
      "United have also been linked with a move for the forward, who was signed by Ruben Amorim in 2023. But despite the reports in the national press about Gyokeres' eagerness to leave Sporting CP, it appears he still has the backing of his team-mates.",
      "Publicly, Gyokeres has said very little but did take to Instagram earlier this month. \"There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it false,\" he said.",

The Brentford ace is set to come in after United submitted an offer in excess of £60million this week and will slot perfectly in the vacant role alongside Cunha behind the striker. Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last season; that's more goals than Alejandro Garnacho, Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Marcus Rashford combined.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Amad were United's top-scorers in the Premier League with eight. The pair are two crucial profiles to Amorim's system and are expected to play big parts. However, there's a question lurking over the head of Carrington on Amad.",
      "The 22-year-old enjoyed a breakthrough season for United with 43 matches, 11 goals and 10 assists. Amad missed two months of action at the start of 2025 due to an ankle injury, came back and he was immediately in Amorim's starting XI.",
      "Yet the double signing of Cunha and Mbeumo challenge his place in one of those two positions in United's attack. Fortunately, Amorim is one step ahead and has revealed the Ivory Coast international's secondary position.",
      "Back in November when Amorim took charge of United, Amad started at right wing-back with Noussair Mazraoui starting at right centre-back - his strongest position - and Diogo Dalot on the left. Fernandes and Garnacho played behind Rashford in attack.",
      "In that match, it took Amad less than two minutes to make an impact, too. A neat interchange with Fernandes in United's half, he beat two Ipswich players before delivering an inch-perfect cross for Rashford to open the scoring.",
      "Amad also started at right wing-back in the 4-0 thrashing of Everton a week later. Further appearances at wing-back against Nottingham Forest, Southampton - where he even went on to score a 12-minute hat-trick late on - and Rangers followed before he was used further forward.",
      "Upon his return from injury, the 22-year-old was utilised as a makeshift wing-back in two more games, but he was predominately one of Amorim's two attacking midfielders. In the Europa League heartbreak in Bilbao, he partnered Mason Mount.",
      "Amad isn't going to be shunned out of the United squad. The signings of Mbeumo and Cunha provides healthy competition for the versatile attacker, something certain players have avoided and kept their place in the team.",
      "Reports this week have claimed that United will target four more signings after Mbeumo is finalised - and players are sold. A new striker, a midfielder, a wing-back and a goalkeeper are all positions on their radar.",
      "A quick glance at the wing-backs across world football and you'll have a difficult job at finding an offensive, smart and athletic one who will cost a decent price. Denzel Dumfries and Theo Hernandez have been mentioned in the past, with players like Maximilian Mittelstadt, Miguel Gutierrez, Vanderson, Maxim De Cuyper and Sergino Dest all available, but are they better than what United currently have?",
      "Amad has already proved his reliance and ability to play at right wing-back. His availability to do so allows Dalot to play at left wing-back, thus taking the pressure off having Luke Shaw fit. Don't forget Patrick Dorgu. United are well stocked."

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Arsenal\nIf this happens, Mikel Arteta needs locked up. Surely Jackson is not the answer to Arsenal’s striker crisis?",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nWe’re keeping this in the top 20 for now because, based on absolutely nothing whatsoever, we get the sense that something could happen here. Even if it’s just that Liverpool make a move upon which they are told to f*** all the way off. But selling Isak doesn’t have to be the end of the world for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "18) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nOf course Rashford wants to join Barca, and the forward must have received some encouragement from the Catalans that they will take him. But only on their terms. Which involve a loan, not a purchase. Which United must have seen coming.",

      "17) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nArsenal’s ‘dream signing’, apparently. And it could be a go-er since the Brazilian has had his nose put out of joint by Real, and he’s asked to leave. Real have even lowered their asking price from £85million since it became clear absolutely no one was prepared to pay that much. But Arsenal could find themselves chucking a small fortune at Rodrygo.",
      "",
      "16) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain, who could be the subject of a ‘significant offer’ from the champions when they receive the Jarell Quansah money. The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",
      "",
      "15) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nSpurs are reported to have piqued Mbeumo’s interest and the prospect of staying in London to play for a manager he trusts would certainly appeal. But now United have returned to Brentford with a second offer, how serious are Spurs about reuniting Mbeumo and Thomas Frank?",
      "",
      "14) Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle failed with an opening £45m offer for Elanga, with Forest apparently looking for £60million. Which seems… excessive? Newcastle have sought to compromise at £50million. Forest are thinking it over…",
      "",
      "13) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nSpurs and Arsenal are reportedly set to battle it out for the FA Cup-winning England star, who is unlikely to leave Palace for less than his £68m release clause. He’s not exactly an out-and-out left-winger but that’s probably where he’ll play for either team, and that’s a position of priority for the Gunners, while Spurs recently signed Mathys Tel permanently.",

      "12) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites… just.",
      "",
      "11) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal have already had one bid rejected for the Spain Under-21 centre-back but they aren’t done. A second round of talks is scheduled but given the speed at which Arsenal are working this summer, we hold little hope of a swift resolution.",
      "",
      "10) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nEven if Sesko is the man most wanted at Arsenal, the Gunners see an opportunity to get more bang for their buck with Gyokeres. The Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training next week. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres but Arsenal are working to their own timetable even if Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19.",
      "",
      "9) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nChelsea were linked with the Brighton striker but Newcastle always seemed most keen, which has led to a £50million offer. Brighton reportedly wanted £60million initially, but the forward has made it clear he wants to move on. We would expect the Magpies and Seagulls to find common ground soon. Pedro won’t be going to from the south coast to the North-East to play second fiddle. So what could that mean for Alexander Isak?",
      "",
      "8) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more here.",
      "",
      "7) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nOnly the fact that United have made a second bid puts them ahead of Tottenham. We’re still waiting to see Spurs’ reaction and whether they counter – Brentford will pray they do something to prolong any bidding war. Apparently, United have been having conversations with the Bees so we have to assume they are confident this offer will suffice, but only if Daniel Levy and Thomas Frank don’t show similar intent.",
      "",
      "5) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nCity have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder and a medical was scheduled for almost a fortnight ago, but we’ve heard nothing since while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "4) Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nA £34million deal has been agreed – that’s decent money for a back-up centre-back – but Quansah won’t be heading to Germany until after he’s faced them in the European Under-21 Championship final.",
      "",
      "3) Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nNice and easy, this, because of the £5million clause in his Chelsea contract. A reminder: he joined them for £72million and remains the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper. Apparently, Kepa has done his medical and put pen to paper on a deal that should give David Raya the heebie-jeebies.",
      "",
      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. A medical is in the offing.",
      "",
      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment six weeks ago but, finally, the midfielder is in London to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we expected an unveiling by now, but we may have to wait for next week."

      "What does Liverpool know about PSR…?\nTo funstar andy:\nNo, Liverpool wasnt always top 5 or top 8 since the 1950s. Why, there’s a gigantic statue of Bill Shankly becos he won LFC the championship in 1962… the 2nd division championship (back when the top division was division one). We spent at least a couple years looking up from a lower division.",
      "And big 6? Maybe. For some periods of time.",
      "But after we were sold to Dumb and Dumber Hicks and Gillette, who proceeded to shave us bald (ok, cold joke), we almost went bankrupt in 2010. If FSG (then known as NESV) hadnt convinced RBS to sell us for £300mil, we’d have been in administration, booted to Champo division, with no guarantee that we’d be back. We most definitely werent big 6 back then, as recently as 2010, barely 15 years ago.",
      "We had Roy Hodgson for manager (whom Stevie G thot the world of, lol, whilst he was critical of Rafa for playing him in his most devastating position of 10 or RW or LW just not 8 or 6), who bought Mark Konchesky for LB. We were in relegation positions when Roy was finally sacked after half a season. We had Joe Cole, whom Stevie G compared to Messi in training, and whom we spent years part paying his salary to get him off our books. We had Milan Jovanovic as our big ticket free agent, porn star lookalike Andriy Voronin as 10, no kidding. And we cheered for david ngog who was an improvement. Torres couldnt wait to jump off the boat the moment he got healthy and better.",
      "2010. FSG brought us back. However tightwad fans think they are, i’d always be grateful to them. They literally brought us back from our darkest time in recent memory.",
      "I know u guys had mike ashley for 14 years from 2007 till 2021. That’s a terrible decade and half, bouncing between divisions. But trust me, u dont want to get anywhere near bankruptcy, the way we did. It was a time lfc could really have disappeared for good.",
      "So no, we werent always top 6 since the 1950s. We almost disappeared in 2010, not too long ago.",
      "As tightwad as fsg are, and as frustrated as i am with them sometimes, they’ve proven their financially prudent management works. The club is profitable and the asset value has risen from £300 mil in 2010 to £3-4bil today. All without investing the kinds of crazy sums that sugar daddies do. (Read: forest, everton).

      "While it’s true that the ostensible reason for PSR was to prevent clubs from unsustainable and destructive spending, that hasn’t particularly worked. Everton is only one EPL club that’s been in financial hot water (and I’m not just talking points deductions) since the rules were introduced. Heck, Ruben Amorim was insisting that ManU was about to go bankrupt at the start of their current spending spree.",
      "Additionally, because I gather that the rules only apply in the EPL, they do nothing to protect the clubs below them, where we’ve seen a number of clubs in dire straits recently. Those are the clubs that need PSR.",
      "Anyway, given that PIF is the richest club owner in the world, what exactly are these rules protecting us from?",
      "I’ve always suspected that PSR rules were also intended to rein in the growth of player costs; if so, it has failed utterly, to the sorrow of us relative minnows.",
      "Whatever the “reasons” for PSR, their effect has been confusion and frustration for clubs and their supporters, as the rules have militated against long- term planning, particularly for clubs bouncing in and out of the UCL. Nobody, but nobody, wanted to sell Elliott Anderson; PSR made that happen. On the other hand, that ridiculous deal last summer might have been (for us) the result of counting unhatched chickens with the Tonali and Gordon buys, given the 2023-24 league table.",
      "And every Liverpool supporter should understand that they were already among the richest clubs in the world in 2013, no matter how long it had been since they’d won the league: 10th in the world, according to a 2014 Forbes article using 2013 data. This was also the year that Real Madrid replaced ManU as the world’s wealthiest club.",
      "Whether Liverpool’s earlier long domination of English football was a result of doing things “the right way” is an open question, as far as I’m concerned. How often were they able to throw their financial weight around with smaller clubs? A lot, I’m guessing.",
      "But still, I’m hugely ambivalent about PSR. It frustrates me on behalf of clubs like Newcastle and Forest. But by not allowing a club like Newcastle to buy a billion dollars worth of players this summer, they do prevent all clubs (except evidently Chelsea) from just buying success. That’s a good thing. And yet again, they have contributed to a concentration of wealth at the top. That’s bad.",
      "I think there are versions of PSR that really would work and be fair, but this version ain’t one.",

      "Early 30’s: As above, but ‘experienced’ if they’re average, ‘unfulfilled potential’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has flashes of incredible, ‘stealing a wage’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has periods of rubbish and ‘a wise head’ if they’re consistently performing.",

Probably the Germans have a word for it: that mixture of pride, satisfaction, excitement, smugness, but also an indefinable sense of loss, as the special thing which was known only to yourself and a few other obsessive nerds goes mainstream. Now national journalists are writing in-depth columns about this exciting new thing, and the most basic of armchair fans is telling you, ‘Oh I really like so-and-so, have you heard of them?’",

Where to turn, for the humiliated ABU, as Utd win the league with 79 points? How do you maintain your dignity, when Utd have just won three league titles in a row and another UCL on top, and we’ve stopped even bothering to count the FA and league cups?",
      "In those days, us ABUs had to nurture the flame of our passion quietly, even secretively. I grew up in suburban south London, where Man Utd ‘supporters’ were ten-a-dozen. Being an ABU in those circumstances was not easy, but for some of us, it was never a conscious choice. My dad was an ABU; his dad was an ABU. Cut me open and I bleed ABU. To this day, my old man proudly recounts the tale to anyone who’ll listen of how my mum tried to put a red dummy in my mouth and I spat it on the floor. ‘Fuck United!’ I babbled, and these were my very first words.",
      "Back when Utd were so good they were inevitable, being an ABU meant something. For many Utd supporters, That Night in Barcelona stands as the greatest moment in their sporting lives; and in a way it was for me, too, but for entirely opposite reasons. As I sat in the bosom of three generations of my ABU family, and together we watched that Norwegian goblin prod the ball home for the most undeserving winning goal in the history of sport, and wept as those scarlet-bibbed idiots celebrated in a sweaty Manc pile, I knew I belonged: the passionate, white-hot hatred I felt was meaning, purpose, identity, community. The very next morning, my old man and I got matching tattoos: a camp little devil being sodomised by a Kaiser Wilhelm-style old dude. The devil screams his safe word: ABU! ABU! But Kaiser Wilhelm is just laughing and sodomising, laughing and sodomising. My girlfriend has begged me to get this tattoo lasered off (it’s in a very particular, usually-covered place). I’ve told her repeatedly: I love you, you’re my soulmate, we’ll grow old together. But I would sooner die than erase this part of myself.",
      "It was a tough, brutal time, and sometimes you had to defend your ABU beliefs with your life. But it inculcated a defiance, a determination to persist. We were hacking through the tough times towards those longed-for sunlit uplands. And now – here we are. The sunlit uplands are everything we hoped for: bountiful, nourishing and, most importantly, hilarious. Every year, Utd find new depths of ineptitude to plumb. Every year their rhetoric grows more and more detached from reality. Every year they circle closer to the holy grail, the utopia of relegation. And yet, something feels slightly off, for me at least. I look around at the happy faces of the new, young breed of ABUs, those who’ve never known anything but success, never known first-hand quite how terrifyingly omnipotent Utd can be. I meet the eyes of my fellow lifelong ABUs, those of us past 35ish years old, and I see old scars lurking beneath the merriment. Are there enough of us still standing? Some, it is true, have started to abandon the battlefield, wearied by the fight. They say they feel sorry for Utd, that the Prem needs a strong Utd to make it competitive. Let them go: we don’t need them. But those of us who remain are constantly totting up the numbers, evaluating the condition of our fellow warriors. The young’uns are untested in the theatre of war, so how trustworthy are they really? What if, against all reason, sense and logic, Amorim’s plan starts to bear fruit? What if Mbuemo and Cunha turn Utd into the most potent attack in the league? What if they raise north of £200m selling Onana, Maguire, Mainoo, Antony, Sancho, Rashford and Hoijlund, and reinvest it efficiently and effectively? What if, revitalised, they start chasing down Liverpool, Arsenal and City? If Utd rise again, will the new generation of ABUs have the grit to see it through? Or will they, like so many previous generations of Surrey-based milksops, fold under the pressure and start claiming, ‘Well I’ve supported them since my dad drove past the Trafford Centre once in 1976’?",
      "I didn’t mean for this to develop into an ‘aging-man-gets-angry-at-the-modern-world-as-it-races-away-from-him’ diatribe. I don’t want to denigrate the young’uns out there, taking their first steps into the world of ABUism. But I just want them to know – if any of them have put down their Tiktoks long enough to read this far – that it wasn’t always this easy to laugh at Man Utd. For two decades, it was really bloody difficult, actually. And despite the absolute calamity of the last few years, the club remains rich enough and prestigious enough to mount a comeback. So it might happen. If that day comes, me and the other OGs are gonna be out here, standing tall, the old defiance rekindled, ready to ride again. Can we rely on you youngers to stand alongside us, even as Utd drop £250m on a 28-year-old Lamine Yamal and go on to win their second treble in two seasons?",
      "I certainly hope so.",

His new five-year contract is almost certainly worth somewhere between £25,000 and £100,000 per week. If we were to guess (and it’s nothing more than a guess), we’d say he’s taking home £50,000 a week. That’s more than £2.5m annually.",

But if Ruben Amorim and Rashford don’t put their differences behind them and promise to be better in their relationship, the latter is going to be leaving on loan every single summer until his contract expires. That might be more useful than ripping up his contract now, but it’s still wildly impractical for everyone involved.",
      "Rashford just needs to enjoy his football and be shown a bit of love from his manager to thrive.

      "Teddy Sheringham has praised Bruno Fernandes for staying at “big club” Manchester United while they “aren’t at the top of their game.”",
      "Fernandes has been United’s best player for essentially his entire spell there. He’s deservedly the captain, being the club’s talisman, with 98 goals and 86 assists in 290 games there.",
      "Last season, Fernandes was quite obviously the best player at United by some way, as he was directly involved in 19 Premier League goals during a 15th-placed season, and helped push them to the Europa League final with seven goals and four assists.",
      "This summer, he had the opportunity to head to Saudi Arabia, with Al-Hilal reportedly offering £100million for his services, but he turned it down.",
      "At the time, he said he still wanted to play “at the highest level possible,” which is in Europe.",
      "Sheringham has praised the United captain for not ditching the club despite them being in hard times.",
      "He told Racing Tipster: “I think it’s great that Fernandes wants to stay. He realises what a big club United are. United probably had that same thought, where they could have sold him to Saudi Arabia for 100 million or something like that, for a 30-year-old.",
      "“They could have landed big money to really start recharging the batteries at United with new players.",
      "“But good on Fernandes. He realises that United obviously aren’t at the top of their game at the moment, but they’re still one of the biggest football clubs around. You want to stay there for as long as you can.",
      "“I really like Bruno. He’s head and shoulders the best player. You would much rather have a Manchester United team with him in it than without him.”",
      "It is clear that United are a better side with Fernandes in, and they are fortunate that he was strong enough to turn down what was reported as a three-year contract worth around £200million.",
      "That sort of money is not likely to be offered within Europe, but if a big sum did come in from a club in the continent who are of a comfortably higher standing that United, there’s a chance the Red Devils would not have been so lucky.",
      "But whether anyone in Europe will come in with a big offer for him after he showed loyalty to United is a question in itself now, with the fact Fernandes is soon to be 31 also a potential barrier to a big move.",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.7bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "England fans were so unimpressed by the drab win over Andorra that only two people wrote in about it – more were interested in defending Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been eviscerated in the Mailbox but there is plenty of time and space to thank Ange Postecoglou for making Spurs interesting again.",

      "United have already given up on Hojlund. The £72million striker looked positive in his first season at Old Trafford, with 16 goals in all competitions.",
      "Last term, though, his 10-goal return included just four strikes in 32 Premier League games, against higher level opposition than in the Europa League, where he scored six times.",
      "United are looking to get at least some of their original outlay back for Hojlund, and are welcoming offers.",
      "It’s been heavily reported that Inter Milan are making attempts to land the Dane, taking him back to Italy – where he played prior to signing for the Red Devils, with Atalanta.",
      "The latest report suggested that Inter had made a cheeky attempt to land Hojlund by offering up a faltering striker.",
      "Indeed, United In Focus reports the Manchester outfit ‘rejected’ a loan-to-buy offer from Inter, which brought about ‘another possibility’ of Mehdi Taremi heading to Old Trafford.",
      "After being offered the chance to sign the Iranian striker, it’s reported United ‘politely declined’ as they have ‘no intention’ of signing him. It is not hard to see why they would do that.",
      "Taremi scored just three goals in 43 games last season – his first one with Inter – and seems in no way a fair asset to swap places with a player who cost £72million.",
      "Hoping to remove the chances of other such offers, it’s said United ‘want a full sale’ and are ‘uninterested in swap proposals’.",
      "Whether Inter come back to the table with a transfer fee attached remains to be seen. In any case, it seems that although he had a very tough time last season and is on the chopping block now, Hojlund wants to fight for his place at United.",
      "He said recently: “I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United. I’m looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I’m fully dedicated to the project that’s underway.”",
      "It’s not clear yet whether United will receive the sort of offer they’d accept for Hojlund, so there’s a chance he remains if nobody comes to the table with enough money.",
      "Ruben Amorim has chosen between Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee if Man Utd must sell one. He is also targeting a midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have been informed that they can sign Liverpool and Chelsea target Hugo Ekitike in a ‘flexible deal’ as they look to reduce his fee.",
      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund could be on the move in the transfer window and another Serie A club has ’emerged’ as an potential destination, according to reports in Italy.",
      "United paid £64m for Hojlund only two years ago but already look like they are willing to let the misfiring striker go.",
      "Former England manager Fabio Capello has suggested that a struggling Manchester United forward is a safer signing for Inter Milan than another option.",
      "Man Utd have turned down an approach from Inter Milan for Netherlands international Joshua Zirkzee, according to reports."

      "Gyokeres is one of two strikers along with Benjamin Sesko that Arsenal are said to be choosing between to lead their line next season.",
      "One report on Friday claimed Sesko is ‘ready to join’ while another a few hours later insisted Gyokeres ‘will sign’ for the Gunners. We don’t know what to believe and at this point would quite like Andrea Berta to sh*t or get off the pot.",
      "Transfer expert Ben Jacobs claimed earlier this week that United may well be feeding on Arsenal’s scraps in their bid to land a new striker – essentially, they can have whichever striker Arsenal don’t want.",
      "“It could be a scenario where whoever Arsenal go for it opens the door for Manchester United for the other,” Jacobs said.",
      "“The natural expectation is that if Gyokeres doesn’t join Arsenal he hasn’t rejected Manchester United, so he could be a possibility, but I’m told also not to discount a scenario where Gyokeres goes to Arsenal and Sesko comes back into Manchester United’s thinking as well because 12 months ago they made a strong pitch and Sesko decided to stay at Leipzig.”",
      "That scenario is at odds with reports earlier this month which claimed Gyokeres had ‘rejected’ United, but Romano backed up Jacobs’ claim, insisting that what is currently a ‘closed door’ could reopen for the Sporting striker’s move to Old Trafford should Arsenal decide to plump for Sesko.",
      "“The question for many United fans is has Viktor Gyokeres rejected Manchester United to go to Arsenal? Guys let me explain the Gyokeres situation – Gyokeres has not told ‘Man United no I’m not coming goodbye’,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“His agent, speaking to Man United almost ten days ago told Manchester United that his priority is Arsenal. So the priority of Viktor Gyokeres is to go to Arsenal – he would love to go to Arsenal for several reasons, including obviously Champions League football, but Viktor Gyokeres didn’t say no to Manchester United.",
      "“So, the priority of the player is Arsenal, the player is waiting for Arsenal. Arsenal are waiting to understand how much Viktor Gyokeres will cost.",
      "“I told you there is this battle between the agents of the players to respect the pact for €60-65 exit fee this summer.”",
      "Arsenal are ‘in agreement’ with Viktor Gyokeres’ agent regarding his potential move to the Emirates, while the fee for Benjamin Sesko has been reduced.",
      "A report claiming Sesko is ‘ready to sign’ has been followed a few hours later by a different outlet claiming Gyokeres ‘will sign’. We’re very, very bored of this.",
      "According to reports, one Arsenal striker target is ‘ready to sign’ for the Premier League giants and two key factors are in his favour.",
      "Put yourself in Andrea Berta’s shiny, handcrafted brogues and tell us which striker you would sign for Arsenal this summer…",
      "Berta has ‘other strikers in mind’ as a major Gyokeres doubt has been revealed while RB Leipzig ‘drive a hard bargain’ over Sesko.",

      "But that’s now changed according to Alfedo Pedulla, who claims United are ‘ready to submit an offer of €40m’ for Carnesecchi, though Atalant have told them they want between €45m and €50m for the 24-year-old.",

      "The Club World Cup has been a breeze for Manchester City so far, and Juventus were the latest to be brushed aside — on a particularly enjoyable day for one summer signing.",
      "Man City have played an absolute blinder here. Rayan Ait-Nouri for £31 million is one hell of a bargain — one that should make Wolves supporters sick to their stomach and Manchester United fans wonder why they signed Patrick Dorgu and not this guy.",
      "We were quick to write off Rayan Cherki after one game, and we’re just as ready to declare Ait-Nouri the best left-back in the world after only his second game for the club.",
      "On a comfortable Orlando afternoon (rainstorm aside) for Pep Guardiola’s men, the Algerian left-back was absolutely fantastic. His decisive through ball to assist Jeremy Doku for City’s opener was sublime, leaving Juventus defender Alberto Costa for dead and Pierre Kalulu, for some reason, unaware that the Belgian would cut in onto his right foot.",
      "There was plenty of transfer narrative, with Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders thriving — and a couple of Premier League targets doing absolutely nothing of note on the other side. Dusan Vlahovic got his goal in the end, and it was very well taken, but didn’t do enough to convince potential suitors he’s their man, while City-linked stars Kenan Yildiz and Andrea Cambiaso both started on the bench.",
      "MORE: Wirtz, Delap, Cunha: Top 10 Premier League signings of the 2025 summer transfer window",
      "It’s City’s new boys who started on Thursday that really stole the show. Reijnders and Ait-Nouri have added youth, energy and a much-needed injection of self-belief to a team that spent most of last season feeling sorry for themselves. Guardiola is treating this tournament as the start of 2025/26 — and who can blame him after the empty-handed mess that was 2024/25?",
      "It’s the right call — and with Ait-Nouri leading the charge, City purred in possession. But for all the early signs of a slick new core forming, there were also some pretty loud reminders that the old core is, well…getting older.",
      "They’re still comfortable trying to break down teams, but transitions look like a weakness. Ederson choosing this moment to gift Juventus an equaliser — right after telling the world he wants to stay at City — was not ideal. That might not be your decision, fella.",
      "Luckily for him, Kalulu had an absolute shocker to outdo it, scoring one of the most avoidable own goals you’ll ever see, handing City the lead back.",
      "It was tight going into the second half, with the first somehow played to a finish despite monsoon conditions. But one simple like-for-like change blew it wide open.",
      "There were acres of space all game between Juventus’ deepest midfielder and their backline, with Omar Marmoush camped on the defender’s shoulder with his back to goal. Bringing on Erling Haaland was the easiest tactical decision Guardiola’s ever made. Igor Tudor had to react, but no adjustment could stop City slicing through with the same defence-splitting passes every five minutes.",
      "Reijnders — who’s already looking like a monstrous signing — was the one to deliver a gorgeous through ball to Matheus Nunes, who, as it turns out, might actually be a bloody decent right-back. Haaland was left completely free to tap in his 300th career goal with one of the scruffiest finishes you’ll ever see.",
      "Juve chucked on some positive subs in desperation, but City were rampant. Soon it was 4-1 — Phil Foden tapping in after Haaland produced a silky first touch and perfectly weighted through ball to set up Savinho. His calm touch around Michele Di Gregorio left Foden with a walk-in.",
      "Then came the pick of the bunch: a thunderous long-range belter from Savinho that left Di Gregorio rooted as embarrassment for the Old Lady turned to outright humiliation.",
      "There was still time for Rayan Cherki to miss an absolute sitter, but overall it was a very productive afternoon in Florida for City. They’re the only team to win all three of their group games at the Club World Cup and should be the clear favourites to lift the trophy.",
      "While this tournament could yet take a toll on their domestic campaign through sheer physical and mental fatigue, winning it might also provide the boost they need. The pre-CWC signings already look like inspired additions, injecting fresh energy and belief into a squad that looked flat and on the way out last season.",
      "Reijnders and Ait-Nouri, in particular, are settling in brilliantly. And it’s a refreshing change of pace for City to have a natural full-back playing in, well, full-back. Ait-Nouri already looks like a serious weapon going forward, and his pace should go some way to easing those nagging concerns in transition. Doku, meanwhile, will only benefit from having someone alongside him who occupies defenders and offers an end product.",
      "We haven’t even mentioned Rodri yet. He’s very much in Like A New Signing territory, starting his first City game since last September in the 5-2 win.",
      "So far, City look like they’re absolutely nailing a crucial transfer window. We still can’t quite believe it. £31 million? FFS.",
      "The opening fixtures of the 2025/26 Premier League season will feature a number of early and potentially awkward reunions, including Arsenal at Old Trafford.",

Of course he didn’t know at the time he could be as far as he is now, but his mindset – it separated him from the others.”",
      "Asked if Mbeumo can handle the pressure of playing for Manchester United, Almeida replied: “I think so. I saw him jump from us at Troyes to Brentford in the Championship and then to the Premier League. He handled it really well.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo was a big part of that small improvement. He barely played in a group stage that was worryingly tame but started all four matches of a more controlled, more effective knock-out phase.",
      "Mainoo turned 20 in April. He’s proven his worth in an England shirt. He’s a Stockport-born United academy graduate with 50 Premier League appearances under his belt. That his future isn’t completely certain this summer is an indictment not only of the club, but of football’s financial governance.",
      "Specifically, it highlights the flaws in football’s financial governance frameworks. In the Premier League, profit and sustainability rules (PSR) allow clubs to make a £105m loss in any given three-year period.",
      "Because teams are on an endless quest for improvement on the pitch, players need to be bought and sold. In the PSR era, those sales are increasingly coming from the ‘Do Not Sell’ pile.",
      "Profit from sales is booked immediately and transfer fees are amortised over the lengths of the players’ contracts. Clubs sell players with value to pay down their losses and replace them with expensive successors, whose futures will be subject to the same calculations down the line.",
      "United themselves are pertinent to the PSR debate – if debts aren’t part of the calculation and clubs have to sell players against their wishes on June 30 only to buy someone more expensive on July 1 to comply with allowable losses, is it really doing its job? – but the basic fact of the matter is this: Manchester United shouldn’t be considering the sale of Mainoo in a million months of Super Sundays.",
      "And yet they might. It’s the same with Alejandro Garnacho, albeit the winger’s departure would be welcomed more positively given his penchant for bridge-burning.",
      "Mainoo and Garnacho did not command transfer fees on the way in but would on the way out, and that helps United equip Ruben Amorim with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Mainoo has been forced out of the spotlight through a lot of injury and a little under-use since shining in the latter stages of the European Championship. He started exactly half of United’s Premier League matches in 2024/25, five fewer than the previous season which he began injured.",
      "He might even have been slightly forgotten by the most casual football supporters beyond the ranks of Red Devils but he’s still an exciting prospect who will be looking ahead to 2025/26 with hopes of getting his fitness back on track.",

      "Amorim has been anointed as the rescuer of a club that needs to become Manchester United again. The Red Devils must bounce back and they haven’t got the time or margin of error they might think.",
      "Cunha is the embodiment of one strand of that rejuvenation but they need players like Mainoo too. United’s empire was built upon them.",
      "Mainoo can control and affect the game. He travels nicely with the ball and can influence the play by doing the simple things well in the middle of the pitch with the easy confidence of a player ten years older.",
      "David Beckham won’t look enviously into his passing toolkit but Mainoo is more than just a relaxed character in midfield. What he does there is technical.",
      "“It is how he prepares before he receives the ball,” former United academy coach Paul McGuinness told Adam Bate before the European Championships.",
      "“What he does off the ball makes it seem like he has time on it. To receive it, he has to look before it comes. Amateur players look up after they have received the ball and then decide what they are going to do. The top professionals, and that is a good phrase for Kobbie, they are efficient and everything they do has a flow to it.”",
      "One of the reasons Amorim will even make it as far as the start of the new season is that he adheres to a specific system and didn’t have the players to apply it mid-season with any degree of success – it’s almost like somebody should have said something.",
      "The outrageously talented tactical analyst and tea-maker Adam Clery recently filmed a video explaining why Cunha is the perfect signing for United’s system.",
      "In his illustration of Amorim’s 3-4-3, Clery defined the four players midfield players as follows: Flying Machine on the left behind(ish) an inverted winger, Inverting Enthusiast on the right behind(ish) a creative number 10, and a Ball Winner and Plays Everywhere in the centre.",
      "His energy and tenacity contribute to a midfield’s ball-winning ability too but that Plays Anywhere role is made for Mainoo.",
      "United’s recruitment should be defined entirely by the system if they’re to climb back up the table in any meaningful way and, in Mainoo, they have a player ready to develop into one of the most important spots.",
      "One year in every four, the decisions made by players take on a different hue. 2025 is a World Cup year minus one, the year in every World Cup cycle in which players either don’t move or seek a safe bet with the attention of their international managers in mind.",
      "There’s no obvious buyer for Mainoo but PSR can do funny things and Bruno Fernandes not going to the Saudi Pro League means that the chances of the midfielder leaving are higher than zero.",
      "One of the major problems with the way football finance is governed by the Premier League and other bodies in Europe is its dehumanising impact on players. In the very worst cases, they’re shuffled around like pawns on a chessboard. They are their book value and nothing more.",
      "But if Mainoo has a say, he should stay. He needs regular football in a familiar setting and that means both staying fit and staying put.",
      "If Mainoo were to leave it would be a big deal. As a United youth made good he’s part of a rich heritage and his premature departure would shine a light on PSR’s negative impacts. He is, culturally and tactically, where he should be.",
      "Yet there’s another pattern emerging. As United falter, exiled players and discarded pieces are demonstrating an ability to perform elsewhere.",
      "Marcus Rashford was loaned to Villa and took a big step back towards his best. Jadon Sancho at least did enough at Chelsea to get a move away from Old Trafford this summer. Antony might even have played himself back into Amorim’s thinking.",
      "Scott McTominay joined Napoli last summer and a year later he’s a Serie A champion, the league’s official MVP, one of the most successful Brits in Italian football history and a beloved adopted son of Naples.",
      "That’s not bad, but it’s not for Mainoo. Not yet. United is the right spot for the 20-year-old despite last season because he’s at a club that needs him, a club he loves, and a club where he will be able to continue his development – development he still needs – without the upheaval of a transfer.",
      "This article was originally published on High Protein Beef Paste, an entirely free weekly football newsletter to which you should subscribe immediately.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United transfer is off after Fenerbahce boss Jose Mourinho decided to pull the plug on the deal.",
      "As wind-up tactics go, wearing the shirt of another club next to a yellow Ferrari is a guaranteed way to annoy fans and burn bridges with one’s employer.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "Ruben Amorim might finally have lost it at Manchester United; four players he is trying to sell won’t come on tour and he wants new signings fairly soon.",
      "Ruben Amorim has told four “bad apples” at Man Utd that they won’t be coming on their tour of the United States in July if they haven’t already found a ...",

      "Christian Norgaard to Arsenal appears very much like it might well be A Thing.",
      "Now we like Norgaard rather a lot. In our view, his has been an under-rated contribution to Brentford’s post-Toney attacking success, with his lower-key creative input significantly and understandably overshadowed by the more eye-catching Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.",
      "Point is, he’s a very good player available at a very good price and he might be just the thing. But…bit underwhelming, isn’t it? One thing Norgaard is not and never can be is the big-name striker Arsenal fans crave so desperately.",
      "But sometimes this precise kind of initially underwhelming transfer can obtain enormous significance come the final reckoning, like these five lads whose eventual contribution to title glory in their first season was far greater than the excitement that greeted their arrival.",
      "We’re talking specifically players who actually helped win their teams the title, not Ralph Wiggum-style helping. So no Federico Chiesa here, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "Manuel Akanji (Man City, 2022)\nOne of the problems with a feature like this is the fact that a vast number of Premier League titles have been won by Manchester United ages ago and Manchester City more recently, meaning any new signings – underwhelming, overwhelming or those that merely adequately whelm – are coming into teams already well used to winning titles by the sh*tload and thus making it harder to make decisive contributions.",
      "But if we try to do this feature without any contribution from Manchester we’re in very deep trouble, so we will have to make the best of it.",
      "And thus, Manuel Akanji is our man. There was little fanfare when he arrived right at the end of the 2022 summer transfer window to join two-time defending champions for whom Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias had formed an estimable first-choice defensive pairing with top-tier reinforcements in the shape of John Stones and Nathan Ake.",
      "At the very least it would be fair to say that of City’s two signings from Borussia Dortmund that summer, Akanji’s (for less than a third of the fee City threw Leeds’ way for Kalvin Phillips) was the lower profile.",
      "And while, yes, the very much not underwhelming signing of Erling Haaland certainly played its part in City’s continued success, so too did Akanji. He would end the season with more Premier League appearances than any of Ake, Dias, Stones or Laporte despite not making his debut in the competition until mid-September, as well as playing every minute of the Champions League knockouts and in every round of the FA Cup for the treble winners.",
      "Now Manchester City need an upgrade, but then he was an underrated revelation.",
      "",
      "Marcos Alonso (Chelsea, 2016)\nChelsea’s rollercoaster journey from 2014 to 2017 will always be one of the Premier League’s very best bits, with a pair of hugely impressive title wins under Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte sandwiching a comically disastrous season that ended Mourinho’s second spell and resulted in a 10th-place finish.",
      "As well as appointing Conte, something else Chelsea did in the summer of 2016 was sign Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina.",
      "Now he had proved himself a very capable player for La Viola in Serie A, but here in England we have very correctly never really placed much stock in what a player might achieve in daft little foreign leagues like that one. It only matters what you’ve done here. And in Alonso’s case, that was ‘be a bit-part player in a relegated Bolton team and half-a-season of relegation-battling with Gus Poyet’s Sunderland’. In other words, nothing very interesting at all.",
      "Yet he was absolutely crucial to Chelsea’s success under Conte. We’ve all enjoyed the banters about the sorcery of Conte’s ability to win the league with Victor Actual Moses as his RWB – a magic trick matched only by Conte’s ability to regrow his own hair – but it’s easily overlooked now just how brilliant and integral Alonso was on the other side, and how that really was not something everyone knew would be the case at the time.",
      "As well as his defensive work, Alonso became a key progressive component of Chelsea’s dominant title-winners, more than doubling his career tally of top-flight goals in that one season.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante (Leicester, 2015)\nFeels like it’s a bit of a cheat to include anything at all from Leicester’s 2015/16 miracle, because for very, very understandable reasons not one soul on earth was talking about any Leicester signing of any xW (expected whelm) as being the one that might just propel them to the title after their escape from relegation in 2015.",
      "But equally it feels like you just can’t have this list without Kante given the sheer gulf between the lack of fanfare that greeted the arrival of a player on the back of one mid-table season in Ligue 1 with Caen and the mammoth significance of his contribution to Leicester pulling off the Premier League’s greatest ever madness.",
      "Such was his impact that he moved on to Chelsea after just one season – duly winning the season again as a signing that was in no way underwhelming – and his name remains to this day an instantly understood shorthand for a very specific and very special type of player.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick (Man United, 2006)\nIt’s one of those things that’s been largely memory-holed now by all involved, but at the time of Carrick’s move from Tottenham to Manchester United there were plenty of United fans who felt they’d been sold an overpriced pup by those wily southern chancers.",
      "The mood was febrile enough around Old Trafford back in the summer of 2006 on the back of a truly unthinkable three-year Premier League title drought. It seems hilarious to think of that now – largely because it is hilarious – but at the time United had never previously gone even two seasons of Barclays without winning the thing.",
      "Jose Mourinho had come along and ruined everything, the great Special prick that he was, and there was widely held suspicion about the idea a pretty-passing midfielder of such conspicuous pretty loser stock as West Ham and Tottenham could significantly change matters.",
      "Five Premier League titles and 316 Premier League appearances later, opinions had altered a bit.",
      "",
      "Jens Lehmann (Arsenal, 2003)\nGot to have a bit of Arsenal in here, haven’t we? And there really is only one contender when you look through the names.",
      "Now it’s not like Arsenal fans thought they’d signed a dud when Lehmann arrived, but he was a goalkeeper with a reputation for being something of a loon.",
      "As the man to replace the very safest of English goalkeeping hands in David Seaman, it was undoubtedly a bit of a punt. Yet a punt that led to Lehmann being an ever-present member of the first and still very much only unbeaten English league champions since the Victorian era.",
      "Look, fair play.",
      "According to reports, there was one key reason behind Mikel Arteta’s decision to favour Arsenal-bound Christian Norgaard over an alternative.",
      "Arsenal have reached an ‘agreement’ for their third summer signing as a replacement for a midfielder who looks to be Barcelona bound."

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."

      "Manchester United have made an improved bid of more than £60m for Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United have, as expected, gone back in with another offer for Mbeumo after having their initial bid worth up to £55m rejected.",
      "Brentford value Mbeumo, who effectively has two years left on his deal, at more than £60m and are willing to listen to offers.",
      "Mbeumo is a player United have admired for a while and he is seen as a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally."
