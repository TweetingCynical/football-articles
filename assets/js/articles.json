      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has put the block on a shock move to sign Robert Lewandowski. The Poland superstar is in the final year of his contract at Barcelona and has not been offered a new one.",
      "Now the veteran ex-Bayern Munich hitman is expected to leave the Spanish giants on a free transfer next summer.",
      "His departure would spark a mad scramble for his signature. United boss Ruben Amorim is a long-time admirer of the veteran striker. And he reckons luring Lewandowski to Old Trafford would have a positive impact on his side and help some of his other players develop.",
      "But Ratcliffe had made it clear United will not repeat mistakes of the past, when it comes to indulging in signing players coming towards the end of their careers.",
      "United have done this with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Raphael Varane, Edinson Cavani and Bastian Schweinsteiger. But all of them proved to be big mistakes, costing United tens of millions in the transfer market and almost as much again in wages.",
      "Despite being 37, Lewandowski is earning a staggering £540,000-a-week at Barca. And the expectation is that, amid their much-publicised financial issues, which has seen the Blaugrana leveraged to the hilt, he will be allowed to depart for a new challenge next summer.",
      "But Ratcliffe has been desperate to reduce United's own crippling wage bill - and does not consider signing Lewandowski to be a viable option.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes' release clause could scupper the Portugal star's dreams of playing in Brazil. At the very least, any club from the South American country looking to meet the asking price would need to more than double their transfer record.",
      "Fernandes opted to stay at Old Trafford despite summer interest from Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal, but he will reportedly be allowed to leave for a team outside the Premier League if they are prepared to pay a little under £57million. The current record for Brazil's Serie A is the £22.3m Palmeiras paid Barcelona for Vitor Roque earlier this year.",
      "The Portugal international indicated to journalists this week that he is happy at Old Trafford for now, while hinting he could assess his options once more after the 2026 World Cup. \"I had the conversations with Al-Hilal. Everyone is aware of that. Everyone knows that. There were also other clubs that tried after Al-Hilal, but obviously my answer wouldn't change,\" he said.",
      "He also pointed to Ruben Amorim's desire for him to stay, adding: \"I always said that if the club was like 'Bruno, we want to cash in, you are 30 years old. We want to make some money. We don't think you can be part of the future project', or whatever, I would be like, OK, I have to find a solution for myself, whatever is best for me and my family. And I will leave.",
      "\"But obviously that wasn't the case. I felt that I was still part of the plan, that I could still help the club to achieve whatever was our aims. And that's what made me stay. Obviously, I have a big connection with the fans, with the club, also the country. My family feels very well here.\"",
      "It was back in May that Fernandes spoke about a desire to potentially play in Brazil. \"Whenever I can, I follow it, because I find Brazilian football attractive, electric football, with a lot of quality, joy, very one-on-one,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s pure football. And I think that now, with the coaches that are there, not only the Portuguese, but also Brazilians, are increasingly developing in the tactical part. I don’t really like talking about the distant future, but it’s like I said. It’s attractive football, very interesting.",
      "\"The only thing is that the trips are very long there in Brazil! There are many competitions, many clubs that play Libertadores and Sudamericana, very good competitions. I’m not saying no, because Brazilian football is very attractive, and we never know the future.\"",
      "Even if a team meets Fernandes' clause next summer, there's no guarantee it will lead to a move. He has continued to play a big part under Amorim, albeit often in a deeper role than the one he often occupied last season.",
      "Much can change between now and May, with United chasing a return to European football after last season's lowly finish. They entered this weekend just two points off the Champions League places, but a congested top half means there's still plenty to play for.",

      "Manchester United's new-look attack clicked into gear to blitz their Brighton hoodoo as Ruben Amorim's men survived a late scare to triumph 4-2 over the Seagulls.",
      "Fresh off a memorable win over Liverpool last week it was the hosts who broke the deadlock in style mid-way through the first half courtesy of Matheus Cunha, who notched his first United goal with a perfectly measured finish from the edge of the box after being teed up by Casemiro.",
      "The Red Devils didn't have to wait too long for a second as Casemiro got in on the act, albeit his strike ended up past Bart Verbruggen via a significant deflection off the unfortunate Yasin Ayari.",
      "United continued to threaten after the break and the excellent Bryan Mbeumo seemed to have killed the game off as a contest after being slipped in by Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Brighton have become a bit of a bogey team for Manchester United in recent years. But Ruben Amorim's men banished that hoodoo in some style at Old Trafford before Brighton's late flurry.",
      "The visitors made a bright start and got their just rewards when Cunha arrowed his maiden Red Devils goal beyond Verbruggen. And though Brighton rallied late, that shouldn't take the gloss off of another big result for United and Amorim, who finally won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time last weekend.",
      "Much has been made of Manchester United's transfer activity in recent years amid claims they've overpaid on some deals, so the decision to drop £200million-plus on a new attack this summer was always likely to be scrutinised pending results.",
      "Thankfully for the Red Devils, their decision to spend big-money on Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo looks better by the week. Mbeumo has been electric and showed flashes of brilliance again here before his two goals. Both he and Benjamin Sesko were already off the mark and Cunha joined them with a fine finish to set United on their way.",
      "As Gary Neville said on commentary, it's too early to pass judgement on Sesko given he's adapting to a new league, although there are encouraging signs and the three of them did look good together after the Slovenia star was benched against Liverpool.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha, however, arrived at Old Trafford with Premier League pedigree - and right now they are living up to their top billing.",
      "After months of speculation linking him with a move to Old Trafford, Carlos Baleba did step out at the Theatre of Dreams on Saturday evening, albeit in a Brighton shirt.",
      "Unfortunately for the Seagulls midfielder, he was on the losing side and once again looked a shell of the player who dazzled last season, with the much maligned Casemiro helped United win the midfield battle.",
      "It remains to be seen if United will rekindle their interest in Baleba, who was taken off just before the hour mark.",
      "Manchester United have looked so much better with Senne Lammens in goal but we was unable to prevent Danny Welbeck from bagging a superb consolation for Brighton.",
      "The United academy graduate is now 34 but continues to shine at the top level - so much so that he was even considered as an unlikely transfer target for his former club back in the summer.",
      "Unfortunately for he and Brighton, his super strike counted for nothing in the end.",
      "The nerves were palpable around Old Trafford when seven minutes of second half stoppage were added, which indicates here's still a long way to go before we can say for certain that United have turned a corner. But recent performances, which have matched the upturn in results, show things are moving in the right direction.",
      "Amorim deserves tremendous credit for shifting the momentum at United with the huge levels of scrutiny on him. There may still be some question marks hanging over the United boss, but with more results like this, they will soon become a thing of the past.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",

      "The 24-year-old has starred for Les Phoceens since his £26.6million move from Old Trafford and has scored seven goals and made four assists in 11 outings this term. As per The Sun, Greenwood's performances have left Barcelona weighing up a future transfer - and that could be huge news for Manchester United, who are understood to be entitled to 50 per cent of any sell-on fee.",
      "Like Greenwood, Rashford has found success away from Old Trafford. The England international could see his Barcelona loan made permanent at the end of the season and certainly hopes that will be the case.",

      "The pair played together 85 times at United and combined for eight goals in that spell. They would hope to be more prolific at Camp Nou.",
      "While Greenwood has impressed in France following a stint on loan with Getafe, Roberto De Zerbi still expects more from his forward. He reiterated that after watching Greenwood's remarkable scoring feats, though he did also send some praise the forward's way. De Zerbi said: \"It's true that Mason can do more. Not just in terms of goals scored because in that area he doesn't need to do better.",
      "\"He's already a top player in front of goal, but he can become one of the best players in the world, because he has the ability.",
      "\"He can improve in helping the team when it needs it, when it's necessary. But I want to protect Mason from criticism, he's always scored a lot of goals and never missed a training session. But he still has room for improvement.\"",
      "Greenwood has regularly been linked with Barcelona, even when he was still with United. The La Liga giants monitored the forward after he showed promise in Spain as he scored 10 goals and made six assists for Getafe.",

Big-money Benjamin Sesko is going to be United's first-choice long-term, but Matheus Cunha can also play as the attacking focal point and is ahead of Zirzkee in the pecking order - a move which allows Mason Mount, a player Amorim really likes, to get into the starting lineup.",

      "Former Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho scored his first goal for Chelsea against Sunderland on Saturday - and replicated a United celebration which reminded his former club just how much has changed in the last 20 months.",
      "The Argentina star left for Stamford Bridge in a £40million summer move and he isn't the only former starter forced out under Ruben Amorim. After finding the net against the Black Cats, Garnacho celebrated by sitting on the advertising hoarding, with team-mate Pedro Neto joining him. It brought to mind a near-identical celebration during United's victory over West Ham in February 2024, with Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund also involved, in a move which some read as mocking former Hammers star Mohammed Kudus.",
      "At the time, the trio were hailed as the future of United, with Hojlund scoring once and Garnacho twice in the 3-0 win. A defeat at West Ham nearly nine months later saw manager Erik ten Hag sacked, though, and his successor Amorim hasn't viewed the trio in the same way.",
      "Garnacho has completed a permanent exit, while Hojlund is expected to do the same after an initial loan switch to Napoli. Mainoo is still a United player, but has yet to start a league game this season.",
      "It shows just how quickly things can change in football. Not only have the three United players all found themselves in different cities, but Ten Hag has lost not one but two jobs, with his Bayer Leverkusen tenure lasting just 60 days.",
      "Garnacho's United exit was all but sealed by his reaction to being dropped for the Europa League final. The winger publicly criticised Amorim for the selection decision, despite coming off the bench as the Red Devils chased an equaliser in vain.",
      "“Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today - I don’t know,\" he said. \"I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.”",
      "Garnacho was left in United's 'bomb squad' over the summer, missing out on pre-season action as Amorim prepared to offload him and several team-mates.

Manchester United are on a two-match winning streak ahead of Saturday’s match against Brighton, but former United coach Rene Meulensteen thinks they are threading on thin ice.",
      "United have beaten Sunderland and Liverpool to spark some renewed optimism around the club following a poor start to the campaign. Amorim has stuck by his tried and tested 3-4-3 formation, despite much criticism from pundits and fans alike.",
      "Club captain Fernandes has been fielded in a midfield two alongside Casemiro in the 2-0 win over Sunderland the 2-1 victory at Anfield. He has shown plenty of desire to get around the pitch, but the Portuguese is an attack-minded player and Meulensteen is concerned that his lack of defensive discipline will cause problems.",
      "“The system isn't the problem. It's the execution of the system because every system has its pros and cons. If you opt for a 3-4-3 formation, you expect certain qualities. You need to create chances and score goals,” Sir Alex Ferguson’s former assistant told CasinoHawks.",
      "“To do that, you need possession, penetration, movement, and all the elements that come with it. You need crosses in the box and numbers in the box. Bruno has been dropped a little deeper, but he lacks defensive discipline, and that will still be exposed. That will still be exposed by other teams, maybe by a different system.",
      "“So, we can discuss it, but we'll come back to the same conclusion. Only when United go on a run of seven to eight wins in a row can you probably start to see that the players have clicked into the system.",
      "“Plenty of other teams play the same system and do it really, really well. No problem at all. But it would be a bit premature for me to say that just because they beat Liverpool.",
      "“Again, Liverpool missed so many chances to basically get a draw. If it were a draw, everyone would have said, ‘Okay, fair result. United defended well, but they didn't create much in the second half, or what they did create, they didn't put it in the back of the net.’ So, I would be a little bit reserved on that one.”",
      "Fernandes has been happy to do what is being asked of him by his manager, with summer signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha up front, supported by Mason Mount. The 31-year-old will make his 300th appearance for United on Saturday and Amorim has summed him up in the build-up to the game.",

      "\"He suffers a lot with the losses. Every time we don't win a game, you can feel it. He takes it personally, as he should as a captain. He is a great leader, a great footballer, so let's see if he's going to reach that mark tomorrow.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba has deleted a social media post acknowledging transfer speculation around himself and Manchester United ahead of Brighton’s trip to Old Trafford. The Seagulls play United in the Premier League on Saturday evening and all eyes will be on Baleba.",
      "United host Fabian Hurzeler’s side on the back of two wins, with Ruben Amorim hoping to continue the new-found momentum. The home team will also have one eye on Brighton midfielder Baleba, having failed in an effort to sign him over the summer.",
      "Brighton received interest from United in the Cameroon international, but the move didn’t gather pace, with their sky-high asking price successfully deterring rivals from pursuing him. They quoted a price north of £100million, with the £115m they landed from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo setting the bar high.",
      "But Baleba reportedly remains keen to swap Brighton for United in the future and the opportunity to impress Amorim isn’t lost on him. Hurzeler had to answer questions about his midfielder in the pre-match press conference and likely won’t have been amused to see his Instagram post.",
      "The 21-year-old shared a graphic showing himself and advertising to his followers the match on Saturday at 5.30pm with the caption “Coming to Old Trafford” with a crying laughing emoji. Aware that his words could land him in hot water, he quickly deleted it and re-posted without the sarcastic caption – but not before it was spotted by fans.",
      "Baleba hasn’t been in the best of form this season but he was better in Brighton's 2-1 victory over Newcastle United last weekend to earn praise from his manager.",
      "“For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players. I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.”",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Brighton are no strangers to bigger clubs trying to poach their players and know that Baleba will likely be on the agenda at the end of the season. “I don’t think Baleba was a saga,” Brighton chairman Tony Bloom told The Argus earlier this month.",
      "“There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn’t available this summer and they went away. So we’ve had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he’s with us for this season.”",

      "Zinedine Zidane has been out of work for four years but continues to be linked with high-profile manager jobs, including at Manchester United. The French coach won two La Liga titles and oversaw a record three consecutive Champions League triumphs across his two reigns as Real Madrid boss.",
      "The 53-year-old decided to leave Los Blancos in 2021 after ending the season trophyless, but his managerial achievements have not been forgotten. Zidane was linked with the United job ahead of the Red Devils appointing Ruben Amorim last year, and he has once again been the subject of speculation this season.",
      "United have continued to falter under Amorim, but the Portuguese coach will hope that last weekend’s win over Liverpool can prove to be a turning point. Meanwhile, Zidane remains available and has previously addressed the idea of becoming United boss in the past.",
      "In 2022, when asked if he would consider taking a Premier League job, Zidane told L'Equipe: \"Never say never. Especially when you are a coach today. If I go back to a club, it is to win. I say this with all modesty.",
      "\"That's why I can't just go anywhere. For other reasons, too. Certain conditions make things more difficult. When someone says to me, 'Do you want to go to Manchester [United]?' I understand English but I don't fully master it.",
      "\"I know there are coaches who go to clubs without speaking the language, but I work differently. To win, many elements come into play. It's a global context. I know what I need to win.",
      "\"Of course, I might not always win, but I know that you need to have this, this and this. And I want to do everything on my side to optimise my chances of victory.\"",
      "Whether Zidane now feels his understanding of English is strong enough to succeed in the Premier League remains to be seen. However, he drew attention by attending a Real Betis training session last year.",
      "Zidane was reportedly in attendance to watch his son Elyaz in first-team training, but there were suggestions that the former Real Madrid boss was preparing for a return to work. Despite the continual links to United, Zidane could soon be in line to land his dream job.",
      "The World Cup winner recently reiterated his desire to manage France in the future. The opportunity may soon come his way as Zidane’s former teammate Didier Deschamps has confirmed that he intends to step down as manager after the 2026 World Cup, ending what will be 14 years in charge of Les Bleus.",
      "\"I will definitely return,\" Zidane said during an appearance at Festival dello Sport in Trento earlier this month. “In terms of the future, I don’t know. My feeling is that I want to be able to coach the national team in the future, even though I don’t mean right now. I would like to one day, but we’ll see.”",
      "However, Zidane is less certain about the possibility of managing Juventus, where he spent five years of his playing career. “I don't know. It hasn't happened before, I've made other choices,\" he said. \"Juve will always remain in my heart, it gave me a lot from the beginning when I went there. As for the future, I don't know.\"",

      "David Beckham has admitted to breaking an unwritten football rule before sacking ex-Manchester United team-mate Phil Neville. Beckham, a co-owner of Inter Miami, appointed the younger Neville brother as head coach of the MLS side in January 2021.",
      "He led the Herons to the MLS playoffs in 2022, before the team’s fortunes nosedived, leading to his sacking by Beckham in 2023 after 10 defeats in 15 games. Beckham has now revealed that he and fellow club owners had concerns about Neville’s tactics before pulling the trigger.",
      "While owners getting involved in team affairs is a big no-no in English football, Beckham had no qualms about telling the head coach his approach wasn’t working. Speaking to Gary Neville as part of a Salford City documentary series, Beckham addressed Phil’s time in Florida. He said ruefully: “Phil played five at the back in Miami, for six months.”",
      "A laughing Neville asked: “Did he play one up or two up? Beckham replied, rubbing his forehead: “One up! Five at the back and one up.”",
      "Neville then probed: “Did you tell him?” Beckham said: “Yeah, every day. We didn’t really have the philosophy of not telling the coach.”",
      "Beckham has said sacking Phil was one of the hardest things he’s had to do. Speaking to another former United colleague, Rio Ferdinand, he confessed: “Phil has been in management for a long time, and he knows what happens in management.",
      "“When I first bought in Phil to manage the team in Miami, I knew what he was going to do. I knew he was going to steady the ship. I knew that he was going to bring the work ethic that I’d seen over the years.",
      "“Everything had to be perfect with Phil. He brought everyone together and he changed that club overnight. The work that Phil did, it was incredible.",
      "“But Phil knew and he said, ‘If I’m not getting the results, I know what’s going to happen.’ And we’re close enough to have that conversation.",
      "“When he first came in, I said, ‘Phil, I don’t want this to affect our friendship.’ He said, ‘I get it, it won’t, when the time’s right, if it’s right, we’ll both know.’ And we had a very sensible conversation but I will never underestimate what he did for the club.",
      "“I think it was one of the most difficult things I’d had to do, even though me and Phil had spoke about it when he first came. I knew that if it came to this moment, it was going to be difficult, no matter what time it happened and when it happened.”",
      "Beckham remains involved with Inter Miami as a co-owner. Along with Gary Neville, he is also part of the main ownership group at League Two Salford.",

      "Former Liverpool defender Glen Johnson reckons Arne Slot has dropped a clanger by moaning about how rival teams approach matches against the Reds, essentially exposing their own vulnerabilities. Following the win over Man United, the Dutch boss took a swipe at Ruben Amorim's tactics in the 2-1 reverse against United, criticising their defensive setup and reliance on long balls in the air.",
      "Slot clarified his comments this week, insisting his remarks were intended as praise for the opposition's clever approach against the defending champions. He would revisit that tactical element following the Champions League victory over Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "Slot acknowledged his squad had improved when handling crosses into the penalty area. He said: \"That is a big, big, big difference and you go in at half-time at 1-1 with still the same amount of chances, but people will judge us differently if you don't score them.\"",
      "\"The biggest exception for me compared to the other games we've played was the playing style of our opponent. We got some energy out of the moments we could press them, which in the last four or five games we played we were not able to press the opponent because the ball wasn't on the ground, it was in the air.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Johnson reckons Slot's observations about tactical approaches should have remained behind closed doors.",
      "Speaking to aceodds.com, Johnson said: \"Every team has their own style and you play with what you've got. Everyone wants to play football, in terms of what we call tiki-taka, which is great.",
      "\"But if you're susceptible against long balls, people are going to see that and try to exploit it. These days, everyone's got their own styles, the game's changing really quick.",
      "\"People need to do whatever they can to get an advantage on their opponents and if they think going long and attacking certain players and certain areas helps, teams are going to do that.",
      "\"Usually the managers take the bullet and protect their players, but at the same time, managers will also do what they think will get the best reaction out of their players. So if that means pointing the finger at them every now and then, if he's right, then it's okay.",
      "\"Of course you still need to make sure it's a happy camp and make sure it's constructive what you're actually trying to do rather than dissecting yourself from the team.",
      "\"I'm sure he's doing what he thinks is right, but in my experience it's always better to have those battles inside the camp and keep it in the dressing room.\"",

      "David Beckham has revealed a surprise financial boost amid suggestions he could front a Manchester United takeover. Since Saudi sports kingpin Turki Al-Sheikh stirred the pot by suggesting new investment was imminent at Old Trafford, other reports have suggested an unnamed consortium from the UAE is gearing up to make an offer for the Glazers’ shareholding in the club.",
      "It is claimed the group wants Beckham, who boasts a net worth of around £300million, to be involved in the bid, although as an ambassador rather than a benefactor. Beckham's earnings have soared since he retired from playing, thanks to various commercial deals and savvy investments.",
      "He is also a part-owner of MLS side Inter Miami and League Two club Salford City, whose primary ownership group includes his best mate, Gary Neville. During a recent visit to Salford, Beckham revealed to Neville a financial boost he had recently uncovered.",
      "Speaking to Neville as they toured the city as part of a club documentary series, Beckham said: “Do you remember our pensions? I forgot I had a pension.\"",
      "Neville then quipped: \"That’s when you know you’ve got a lot of money, when you forget you’ve got a pension!\" Beckham went on: \"I found my pension, it’s gone up quite a lot.\"",
      "Neville, now a successful businessman, then recalled a pension-related blow he once suffered. He said: \"My PFA pension, there was a maximum cap you could put in. Do you remember that? I got to the cap and moved my pension money into another pension so I could buy commercial property. Lost everything.\"",
      "As Beckham chuckled, Neville laughed: \"It’s not funny!\" When Neville was asked if he had always been a good businessman, Beckham interjected: \"Obviously not!\"",
      "Neville added: \"That’s probably the one big mistake that I’ve made. But your pension should be the safest thing in the world.\"",
      "Beckham’s pension pot discovery is unlikely to make a dent in any United takeover bid, with the Glazers believed to want in the region of £5billion for the club. The unpopular American owners have taken a backseat since Sir Radcliffe’s Ineos Group bought a 27.7 per cent stake and assumed control of football operations.",
      "But the team hasn’t moved forward under Ratcliffe’s watch, while controversial mass cuts have been made off the pitch, leading to frustrated United fans demanding a change of direction.",
      "But despite Al-Sheikh’s eyebrow-raising declaration, club insiders have been left surprised by the recent takeover talk, while Radcliffe made no reference to fresh investment during a wide-ranging interview earlier this month.",

      "Manchester United's unsuccessful pursuit of Carlos Baleba continues to loom large as they prepare to face Brighton on Saturday. Despite their best efforts, the Red Devils were unable to secure a central midfielder during the transfer window, with Baleba being a key target throughout the summer.",
      "Brighton stood firm in their stance that the 21-year-old star was not for sale, even going so far as to slap a whopping £115million price tag on the Cameroon international - a fee they had previously received from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo in 2023.",
      "While United may have other targets in mind, their interest in Baleba has not completely waned. The player is contracted until 2028, but there is speculation that a move to Old Trafford could be on the cards in the near future with Baleba believed to be open to joining United, while Bryan Mbeumo is also rumoured to be helping out.",
      "The midfielder remains on United's radar heading into 2026. Club officials were also reportedly delighted to discover that the Brighton star was open to a move last summer, despite the absence of European football this season.",
      "Brighton supremo Tony Bloom brutally dismissed suggestions that United's pursuit of Carlos Baleba constituted a \"saga\" whatsoever.",
      "The Seagulls chief provided a glimpse into the discussions and insisted that United swiftly abandoned their interest once told that the midfielder was not for sale.",
      "In conversation with The Argus, he said: \"I don't think Baleba was a saga. There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away.",
      "\"So we've had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.\"",

      "Both players were representing Cameroon during the most recent international fixtures. According to the Sun, Mbeumo seized the chance to discuss Baleba's prospects with the youngster.",
      "The publication suggests that the United attacker has even adopted a 'big brother' role with the 21-year-old. Nevertheless, it is understood that any potential move is more probable next summer rather than during the forthcoming January transfer window.",
      "It could be argued that the collapse of his proposed transfer has impacted Baleba's form during the opening months of the campaign. Yet the young midfielder insists he has rediscovered his peak performance levels ahead of Brighton's showdown with United.",
      "Following the Seagulls' victory over Newcastle on Saturday, Baleba celebrated with a social media post. Alongside several images from the match, he wrote: \"Good team win and I'm feeling like myself again. #areyouabaleba.\"",
      "In a fascinating twist, United star Leny Yoro showed his approval by liking the post. Baleba endured a difficult beginning to the campaign, with Seagulls manager Fabian Hurzeler openly demanding better displays from the player.",
      "Speaking before the Magpies fixture, the Brighton manager insisted Baleba must focus on his duties whilst he remains at the club. \"He can't change the noise around him, he's a player for Brighton,\" he said.",
      "\"No matter what the rumours are, he will be a player for Brighton until [at least] the end of the season. But now he has to take responsibility.\"",
      "While United monitor the situation, they have received a stark warning that Chelsea might make their move for Baleba. Ex-Aston Villa forward Gabby Agbonlahor even posted on social media, fuelling speculation.",

      "United have tasted three consecutive Old Trafford defeats against sides led by Potter, Roberto De Zerbi and Fabian Hurzeler. Amorim will hope he can change that and record a third win on the bounce for the first time in charge of the Red Devils.",
      "Significant cash has been splashed since United last beat Brighton at home. The club have handed out more than £800million for new signings over that period and seen the likes of Antony, Antony, Casemiro, Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount and Joshua Zirkzee arrive at the club before landing Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "Brighton have also made some big deals, most notably in their sales. Paul Barber has raked in around £450m, with Chelsea offering around £300m of that, with figures such as Marc Cucurella, Moises Caicedo, Joao Pedro, Billy Gilmour, and Alexis Mac Allister all departing.",
      "Where does that leave the team currently? After eight matches, they are side by side in the table with a single point between them. The Segulls have recorded one win and one defeat fewer than their opponents this weekend.",
      "Perhaps that means a draw is the most likely outcome. Alan Shearer believes so with both teams coming into the clash off of a win.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has admitted he's been \"a bit surprised\" by the impact goalkeeper Senne Lammens has had since his debut.",
      "Lammens first showed his mettle against Sunderland before the October international break, and then followed up with another sterling performance against Liverpool.",
      "The 23-year-old's long goal kicks proved to be a game-changer in both of those United victories. He also made a crucial save to deny Alexander Isak during the first half at Anfield, earning him praise post-match.",
      "When quizzed at Carrington on Friday about whether Lammens' impact had taken him aback, Amorim confessed: \"I think a little bit because it's hard in the moment of our club, all the speculation around the goalkeepers, he's not a young kid but he's still young,\".",
      "Amorim further discussed the team's direct approach, adding: \"I think you can see [progress] if you watch all the games. That game was different. If you have to point at a team who can control games with the ball, it is City or against Arsenal at the end of the game. Every team has to adapt and we adapt.",
      "\"We struggled to have long possessions against Liverpool, but if you go to the Arsenal game, it was completely different. Sometimes it is the environment, which is the first part we miss.",
      "\"Some players who are in different positions, who can give us more direct play than playing with the ball. We want to play a different style. Our style is a different style but I'm really pleased for the adaptation of winning games. Sometimes we are struggling but we can manage some things to win games and that is really important. If you judge our eight games, you know clearly what game we want to play.\"",
      "Arne Slot moaned about United's tactics, but Amorim declined to bite back at the Liverpool boss's remarks. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don't want to comment,\" he said.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen (against Brighton). I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don't care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don't need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "Amorim stated: \"We are always talking about that [a turning point], but that connects with the other question about how we face competition. If you just think about that - that we are going to try to perform and put everything on the field - that is the most important thing.",
      "\"Sometimes when you talk too much about turning points, it is worse. Let's take it naturally. We have won two games, it is no big deal, it should have come sooner. Let's go for the next game and it is going to be really, really hard to play against Brighton. Let's try to perform better than we did against Liverpool.",
      "\"Let's wait for the game. If you look at our wins, especially this year, it has to be a lot with attitude. I'm not saying that players don't want to win or to run, sometimes it's getting harder but sometimes we need to force ourselves to do the basics.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"If we do that, we are near to winning more football games but if you look at Brighton and you see the way they play, every team that presses a little bit higher struggles with them and they won those games.",
      "\"So all those things we need to be prepared for - not just against the top teams like you call it: Chelsea, Liverpool, but against these opponents that are really good, and we need to be really focused and really smart to play this kind of game.\"",

      "Manchester United have spent all week preparing for their Premier League clash against Brighton and Hove Albion at Old Trafford on Saturday (5.30pm kick-off). The Red Devils are riding high on confidence after last weekend's thrilling 2-1 victory over arch-rivals Liverpool.",
      "In beating the champions, they managed back-to-back Premier League wins under the helm of Ruben Amorim for the first time since his appointment last year. United will be aiming to secure a hat-trick of victories this weekend.",
      "That could propel them further up the table from their current ninth position, just one point ahead of Brighton. However, Amorim faces a few fitness concerns ahead of the match.",
      "Hero of the Anfield showdown, centre-back Harry Maguire, who netted the winning goal with just six minutes left on the clock, is a doubt for the Brighton game due to an injury. Mason Mount, who has been in the starting line-up for the last two games, is also nursing a knock.",
      "\"The squad is fine,\" Amorim said during his pre-match press conference. \"We have some doubts, we had some issues in the week with Harry Maguire and Mason Mount. Knocks, nothing serious, and we will see tomorrow.\"",
      "Lisandro Martinez, however, is definitely ruled out. The Argentine is making progress in his recovery from an ACL injury and has returned to training, but is not yet ready for match action.",
      "\"Licha is out,\" confirmed Amorim. \"He trained really well, he was on the next pitch, and I was watching. He's training really well, the knee is looking well, but I don't want to say a specific week [for his return] and then it depends on Licha, whether he wins the spot.\"",
      "It's not just United facing fitness concerns ahead of the fixture. Brighton could be without as many as six players for the clash.",
      "Long-term casualties Adam Webster and Jack Hinshelwood remain unavailable. Both are still recovering from ligament injuries.",
      "Solly March is also due to be sidelined, with a comeback set for later this year. However, there is more encouraging news for Brighton regarding other squad members.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler has confirmed that Brajan Gruda, Joel Veltman and Kaoru Mitoma are all nearing comebacks. \"They're all close to the team, so maybe one or two of them might be available for tomorrow,\" he said in his pre-match press conference on Friday.",
      "\"They don't have big issues; they don't have anything serious. I can't say that they will all be available; I also can't say that they won't be available. We have to see how it goes today, and then we have to make a decision.\"",
      "The Brighton manager also delivered encouraging updates on midfielder Diego Gomez, who came off during Brighton's 2-1 victory over Newcastle United last weekend. He was seen in training before Saturday's match, to which Hurzeler responded: \"I think he will also be spotted tomorrow at Old Trafford! He will be available to start.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim smashed up a TV screen the last time Manchester United faced Brighton. Back in January, the Red Devils suffered a 3-1 defeat to the Seagulls, a result that infamously prompted Amorim to label his team \"maybe the worst in the history\" of the club.",
      "After the game, an apoplectic Amorim unleashed his fury on the players in the dressing room, slamming them for a dismal overall performance. Amid the chaos, he reportedly broke a TV screen used to share tactical information.",
      "It was a career first for the 40-year-old, who typically keeps his post-match talks short and sweet, no matter the outcome of the game. Typically, Amorim prefers to wait until the following day to review matches with his squad, once emotions have cooled.",
      "The outburst appeared to have an immediate effect, as United went on to win four of their next five games in all competitions. However, the season ultimately ended in disappointment.",
      "Amorim's team finished 15th in the Premier League - a record low for the club - and suffered defeat in the Europa League final against Tottenham, missing out on Champions League qualification in the process.",
      "Heading into Saturday's clash with Brighton, the first against the Seagulls since Amorim's TV-smashing incident, the dressing room atmosphere couldn't be more different. Last weekend's 2-1 victory over Liverpool, sealed by a late Harry Maguire goal, has, at least temporarily, lifted spirits around Old Trafford.",
      "It was United's second consecutive league win and the first time Amorim has achieved back-to-back Premier League victories. A win over Brighton would see the team secure three straight league wins for the first time since February 2024.",
      "That, however, will be easier said than done given United's recent struggles against the south coast club. They have lost six of their last eight meetings with Brighton, with Fabian Hurzeler's side completing a league double over United last season.",
      "Amorim will be desperate to flip the script - not just for a measure of revenge, but also to sustain a rare run of momentum at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite a recent upturn in form and improving performances, Amorim's position as United manager remains far from secure amid reports club chiefs are considering their options. The former Sporting CP head coach will need to get his side firing consistently if he hopes to avoid the axe and that momentum must not be squandered.",
      "Getting a result against Brighton is therefore paramount and could prove the difference between building genuine confidence or plunging United back into another period of uncertainty and scrutiny.",

      "Carlos Baleba is set to play at Old Trafford for the first time since Manchester United considered signing the Brighton midfielder in the summer transfer window.",
      "Baleba was on United's radar, with the club even reaching out to Brighton regarding a potential deal. However, Brighton's hefty price tag of around £100million complicated matters, especially after United had already splashed out during the window.",
      "United insiders later suggested that bolstering the midfield wasn't a priority due to the squad's existing depth and versatility. Nevertheless, the 21-year-old remains on United's watchlist and could be considered as a transfer target next year.",
      "Saturday's Premier League showdown presents an opportunity for what could be a £100m audition. Seagulls boss Fabian Hurzeler has offered some advice to the youngster ahead of the match, urging him to 'overcome the noise'.",
      "Baleba's season hasn't been smooth sailing, with rumours suggesting that United's interest may have caused a distraction. However, he showed signs of returning to form during Brighton's 2-1 victory over Newcastle United last weekend.",
      "\"'For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players. I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.\"",
      "The German boss continued: \"It's important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it's important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "\"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That's where we try to support him and make him better.\"",
      "Earlier this month, The Sun claimed that Bryan Mbeumo is 'attempting to convince' Baleba to follow him to Old Trafford. The duo spent time together whilst on international duty representing Cameroon, providing Mbeumo, who is regarded as a 'big brother' figure to Baleba, the perfect opportunity to have a word with the player.",

      "Here are how United's players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Has been a breath of fresh air since making his debut against Sunderland. He made a few important saves again, including a stop to deny Yankuba Minteh when the advantage was two goals, but he should have saved Welbeck's free-kick. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Was recalled to the team due to Harry Maguire being absent with a knock. Had a few shaky moments in the first half, but recovered to deliver a decent performance. 6",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Might be enjoying the best season of his career. He has been very good this season and the crowd cheered wildly when he made a crunching tackle in the second half. 7",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Was brought off with a knock in the 64th minute. United fans will hope the injury is not too serious because Shaw has bounced back after a poor performance in the Manchester derby. 7",
      "Amad",
      "Was unplayable at times against Liverpool and looked sharp again down the right. Was denied a penalty in the first half. 7",
      "Casemiro",
      "Scored through a heavily deflected effort. The 33-year-old broke up play, made some important interceptions and looked good again. 7",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His 300th appearance for the club. Made a genius turn on the stroke of half-time and set the tone from the centre of the pitch. Provided quality in the final 10 minutes when Brighton tried to get back into the contest. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Didn't contribute much going forward and was fine when he needed to defend. Dalot's best position is on the right, so he deserves credit for performing on the opposite side in the last week. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha were the best players on the pitch. He has hit the ground running since arriving from Brentford and deserved his two goals. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Had chances to score but just came up short. The Slovenian is starting to find his feet at Old Trafford. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "His first goal since signing from Wolves in the summer was worth the wait. He was excellent in the closing stages at Anfield and outlined his importance again with a superb display. 8",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Did well after replacing Shaw. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Looked slightly like he lacked match practice. 6",

      "\"We'll back him from the Stretford End, he'll turn the Reds around,\" was aired from the Stretford End following Manchester United's second goal against Brighton.",
      "It felt like Amorim had a mountain to climb after defeats to Grimsby Town and Manchester City, but wins bring positivity and Amorim has now overseen three on the bounce in the league. Liverpool had to be the turning point and United built on that performance against Brighton despite a nervy ending.",
      "The last time United won three league games in a row was in February 2024. Erik ten Hag was on the ropes shortly after that run, but Amorim has managed to get up from the canvas.",
      "Brighton had won six of their past seven league fixtures against United. The Seagulls were also trying to become the first Premier League club to win four in a row at Old Trafford. The unwanted records stacked up last season, but Brighton didn't leave Manchester with a slice of history this weekend.",
      "There was a rousing rendition of 'Take Me Home, Country Roads' before kick-off. \"We've seen it all, we've won the lot,\" echoed around the ground once the game kicked off. Amorim was quickly down on his haunches to scan from pitch level.",
      "United considered Carlos Baleba in the summer transfer window, but Brighton valued the midfielder in excess of £100million and had planned to keep him at the Amex Stadium for at least another season.",
      "Baleba has made an unconvincing start to the campaign. Fabian Hurzeler has suggested his form has dipped due to the noise around his future, but he started the midfielder at Old Trafford.",
      "Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox were present in the directors’ box. They have the power to sanction a move for Baleba, who would have seen the game as a transfer audition.",
      "Baleba's first notable involvement was a tame shot from the edge of the box in the first half. He dragged his shot wide, the Stretford End sarcastically cheered and Brighton's analysts shook their heads.",
      "Amorim was shaking his head shortly afterwards when Anthony Taylor failed to award a penalty when Amad was brought down to the ground. Amorim vented to the fourth official, which is not often seen.",
      "United used that refereeing decision to spur them on - and Cunha opened the scoring moments later. He finished brilliantly into the bottom right corner after a spell of sustained pressure and was mobbed by his teammates. The Brazilian's first goal since signing from Wolves was worth the wait.",
      "The atmosphere cranked up another notch following Cunha's goal and his international colleague, Casemiro, extended the advantage with a heavily deflected effort.",
      "United academy graduate Danny Welbeck will celebrate his 35th birthday next month, but he is not slowing down with age and returned to Old Trafford as one of the most in-form strikers in the country.",
      "Welbeck had scored four goals in his last three games, however, he came up against one of the most in-form defenders in the league. Matthijs de Ligt is enjoying a superb campaign and was solid again.",
      "There were huge cheers for De Ligt when he made an exceptional recovery challenge at the beginning of the second half. The matchgoing supporters are aware of his importance this season.",
      "There were even bigger cheers when Bryan Mbeumo scored his first. Mbeumo has been a brilliant addition and has needed no time to settle after signing from Brentford. The Cameroon international is a goal machine and netted again during added time to notch his fifth of the campaign.",
      "United's recruitment hit rate has been shocking in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but Mbeumo and Cunha had Premier League experience on their CV and are both players with United DNA.",
      "Bruno Fernandes made his 300th appearance for the club against Brighton and dictated play from the deeper role again. Fernandes wanted United to sign personalities in the summer - and they have. Amorim overhauled the attack in a single window, and the investment was worth every penny.",
      "United never make it easy for themselves, though. Amorim will not be pleased with Brighton's late surge, and their two late goals are a stark reminder that there is still plenty more work to do.",
      "But Amorim has finally put United on the right track.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "Highlights and reaction below:",
      "It felt like Amorim had a mountain to climb after defeats to Grimsby Town and Manchester City, but wins bring positivity and Amorim has now overseen three on the bounce in the league. Liverpool had to be the turning point and United built on that performance against Brighton despite a nervy ending.",

      "Senne Lammens",
      "Has been a breath of fresh air since making his debut against Sunderland. He made a few important saves again, including a stop to deny Yankuba Minteh when the advantage was two goals, but he should have saved Welbeck's free-kick. 6",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Was recalled to the team due to Harry Maguire being absent with a knock. Had a few shaky moments in the first half, but recovered to deliver a decent performance. 6",

      "That's it. What an end to the game. Brighton looked to have set up a nervy finish but Bryan Mbeumo's second of the game wins it",

      "The resulting free kick by Welbeck beats Lammens. The free kick looked quite central on replays and perhaps Lammens should have done more.",
      "Dorgu is adjudged to have brought down Minteh. The referee gives a yellow and Hurzeler is unhappy. VAR has completed its check and it is not a red. Minteh lost control of the ball.",

      "Mainoo, Dorgu ON",
      "Casemiro, Amad OFF",
      "Heaven ON",
      "Shaw OFF",

      "Milner, Watson, Gomez ON",
      "Baleba, De Cuyper, Ayari OFF",
      "That was close but Minteh's curler just goes wide. Looks like Lammens saved it.",
      "Loose from Brighton as Sesko gets it and unleashes a strike but it is palmed away",
      "Professional second half so far. Cunha is getting frustrated by Taylor missing fouls on him but other than that it has been a good start to the half",
      "What a stop by Verbruggen he keeps Fernandes out superbly. Just seen a replay and it is an instinctive save. Fernandes very unfortunate to not make it three.",
      "Well that was his moment. He shapes to shoot but it flies over. Fernandes has a knock but should continue.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been \"surprised\" by the impact Senne Lammens has made at Manchester United.",
      "Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the October international break and he built on that impressive display by delivering another strong performance against Liverpool.",
      "The 23-year-old's long goal kicks were hugely effective in both of those United wins. Lammens made an important save to deny Alexander Isak during the first half at Anfield and received plaudits after the game.",
      "Speaking at Carrington on Friday, Amorim was asked whether Lammens' impact had surprised him. \"I think a little bit because it's hard in the moment of our club, all the speculation around the goalkeepers, he's not a young kid but he's still young,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"He coped really well with the pressure, he's really composed, he's defending really well. The importance of playing with both feet to kick the ball is so important nowadays, especially when you have to play against Liverpool in a more direct style. I'm a little bit surprised, but I was expecting a talented guy. But yes, a little bit surprised.\"",
      "Amorim discussed the direct approach, adding: \"I think you can see [progress] if you watch all the games. That game was different. If you have to point at a team who can control games with the ball, it is City or against Arsenal at the end of the game. Every team has to adapt and we adapt.",
      "\"We struggled to have long possessions against Liverpool, but if you go to the Arsenal game, it was completely different. Sometimes it is the environment, which is the first part we miss.",
      "\"Some players who are in different positions, who can give us more direct play than playing with the ball. We want to play a different style. Our style is a different style but I’m really pleased for the adaptation of winning games. Sometimes we are struggling but we can manage some things to win games and that is really important. If you judge our eight games, you know clearly what game we want to play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen (against Brighton). I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "Amorim continued: \"We are always talking about that [a turning point], but that connects with the other question about how we face competition. If you just think about that - that we are going to try to perform and put everything on the field - that is the most important thing.",
      "\"Sometimes when you talk too much about turning points, it is worse. Let’s take it naturally. We have won two games, it is no big deal, it should have come sooner. Let’s go for the next game and it is going to be really, really hard to play against Brighton. Let’s try to perform better than we did against Liverpool.",
      "\"Let's wait for the game. If you look at our wins, especially this year, it has to be a lot with attitude. I'm not saying that players don't want to win or to run, sometimes it's getting harder but sometimes we need to force ourselves to do the basics.",
      "\"If we do that, we are near to winning more football games but if you look at Brighton and you see the way they play, every team that presses a little bit higher struggles with them and they won those games.",
      "\"So all those things we need to be prepared for - not just against the top teams like you call it: Chelsea, Liverpool, but against these opponents that are really good, and we need to be really focused and really smart to play this kind of game.\"",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has spoken to the media ahead of the clash with Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday evening.",
      "Amorim provided an insight into the state of the squad ahead of the game. English duo Harry Maguire and Mason Mount are both doubts for the next match after issues picked up in training while Lisandro Martinez remains absent.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes received a glowing review from his manager on the eve of potentially his 300th appearance for the club. But Amorim chose not to be drawn into a discussion regarding the future of Maguire.",
      "The match winner against Liverpool is out of contract at the end of the season and has yet to sign an extension. But while Amorim is keen to focus on the here and now, he did insist that he was more than happy with the centre-back.",
      "Take a look back at everything Amorim had to say in his press conference below...",
      "That's everything from the first part of Amorim's press conference today. The second part is embargoed until later today but we shall bring you all of that this evening.",
      "Amorim was reluctant to discuss Harry Maguire's future at United. Maguire produced a headed winner against Liverpool in the 84th minute last weekend, and he admitted to journalists that it could have been his final visit to Anfield with the club.",
      "The England international is out of contract at the end of the season and could leave United.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim believes Bruno Fernandes is a \"great captain, leader and footballer.\" Fernandes is set to make his 300th appearance for the club against Brighton this weekend. He is regarded as the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era and was appointed captain two years ago.",
      "The midfielder received a lucrative offer to sign for Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal in the summer, but he decided to stay at Old Trafford, and he is practically undroppable for Amorim.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Amorim has revealed Mason Mount and Harry Maguire are injury doubts for Manchester United's clash with Brighton this weekend. Mount and Maguire started at Anfield but Amorim has confirmed they are doubts ahead of the game with Brighton.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is the only player who is definitely out of the team.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "It was good for him to play with three centre backs, I think he feels more comfortable. Because he plays in the centre, he does not need to go to the side so much so sometimes you help players with the way you play. Sometimes it is the opposite with some players. I am really pleased. He is not young but he can learn a lot, he can improve. I think he can be so much better with the ball because he has that quality and he needs to show that. Nowadays with the set pieces that you see, the amount of men that you put in the box and every cross from the opponent - everyone is playing like that. He is a massive player for us, I am really happy but that game is in the past, that goal is in the past and now let's look forward to the present and the future.",
      "We cannot change so much. I think they asked me about top four at the end of the question. I don't want to change so much with a difference of 20cms. If Gakpo's shot was 20cms here, the narrative would have been really different. I just want to maintain some calm and some direction with what we are doing. If you are a manager at this kind of club and you don't win a lot of games, people will doubt you and they have reasons for that but my point of view is that we need to be clear on our path and not changing so much because we win one game, that's all.",
      "I don't know when he will be fit. He trained really well, not with us but on the next pitch and I was watching the training. He is feeling well and responding well so I don't want to say a specific day or one week but he is near to start training with the team and then it depends on the rythmn of Licha if he wins the place or not. That will depend on him but he is closer to a return to training.",
      "We are really happy with Harry. Not the time to talk about his contract because that gives the idea that we are thinking so far away. We are really happy with Harry, he is really important for us but we just need to focus on the next game.",
      "The first thing we were really focused during the game and then we played different games. We have one identity, one way of playing but we adapt what kind of game we need to play in the moment. You could sense that the first half against Sunderland was not the same as the second half. We know how to manage that. Against Liverpool we scored right away in the first play and then we managed the game and played a different style because it was needed in that moment - that is a good thing. Then we have a good spirit and sometimes when you have a good spirit, you have a bit of luck that you need to win games.",
      "It is a little different what I was expecting, everything you read about a player is sometimes not that. You can understand the frustrations he feels because he wants to help a lot the teammates. Sometimes it is not the best way but he comes from a good place and you don't know that when you are not here. He wants the responsibility all the time. He suffers a lot when we lose, every time we don't win a game, you can feel it - he takes it personally - as he should be as the captain. He is a great leader, great footballer and let's see if he reaches that mark tomorrow.",
      "We use the good spirit of winning games we know that was a good weekend for us but our focus is on the next game. That is in the past and we need to understand that football changes a lot, especially this kind of club so we are not thinking about the last game, we are thinking about this game and it is going to be really hard to win.",
      "It is going to be a very difficult game. Brighton are really fun to watch they are really good on build-up, they are really strong on transistions in every aspect of the game. They are doing well at set pieces this season so they are a team who are really complete. We need to be really smart and to face that game with a real focus on everything that we do because they are a very strong team. You can see with how they play the game. They are really intense, the quality is there. They believe a lot on what they are doing even under pressure so I am a huge fan of him [Hurzeler].",
      "Squad is fine we have some doubts some issues during the week with Maguire and Mount. Knocks but nothing serious we shall see tomorrow. Licha is out but the rest are ready for the game.",
      "Amorim has arrived for his press conference. Updates to follow...",
      "Amorim is speaking to the assembled media at Carrington as we speak. We shall be bringing you all the updates when the embargo drops at 1.30pm.",
      "Stay tuned for the latest here...",
      "After their defeat to United last weekend, Arne Slot seemed to be less than complimentary about the system that Amorim implemented at Old Trafford. Now, the Liverpool boss has insisted that what he said was meant to be a compliment.",
      "Before their clash with Brentford, Slot said:",
      "It was meant to be a compliment to the opposing manager finding a way to play against us but I don't think it has come across like that...",
      "Saturday will mark a big afternoon for Brighton's Carlos Baleba who remains on United's shortlist to improve their midfield in the future. Speaking ahead of the midfielder's trip to Old Trafford this weekend, Fabian Hurzeler has called on Baleba to drown out the noise surrounding his future.",
      "It's the next step for him as a person to overcome the rumours and the noise. He needs to focus on what he can control because he can't influence the rumours and the noise, only the things he does on the pitch.",
      "We will be bringing you all the updates from Amorim's press conference right here so do not go anywhere! The Portuguese head coach is set to address the media at 1.15pm with his comments embargoed until 1.30pm.",
      "At which point, we shall provide you with everything that the United head coach had to say.",
      "United's captain is set for a special afternoon and evening at Old Trafford tomorrow when he is expected to make his 300th appearance for the club. In his previous 299 games for the club, Fernandes has managed 100 goals and 87 assists.",
      "Our United writer Steven Railston has spoken to him this morning and you'll be able to see what he had to say at 5pm on the MEN Sport website.",
      "We are just an hour and a half away from Amorim speaking to the media this afternoon. Here is what we can expect to be spoken about today.",
      "United's interest in Baleba didn't last long in the summer transfer window. Brighton valued Baleba at around £100million, which made it tricky for United to finance a deal, and they outlined that they were \"very confident\" he would remain at the Amex Stadium.",
      "The Seagulls had planned to have Baleba for at least another season. United sources eventually said the midfield was not a priority due to already having squad options viewed as strong and versatile.",
      "Baleba was considered at one stage in the summer transfer window, though, and United may have made an offer for the 21-year-old if they hadn't already spent a hefty sum.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "United's exciting 15-year-old JJ Gabriel trained with the first team at Carrington on Thursday. It's unusual for a player so young to be given the opportunity to train with the first team, but Gabriel is one of the most highly rated talents to come through the academy.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Ruben Amorim at Carrington.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "Hurzeler was asked in his press conference about United's inconsistencies under Amorim but Hurzeler was keen only to praise the Portuguese head coach.",
      "It's not my job to comment on that but the only thing I can say is that I am really looking forward to competing against one of the best managers. I think he is one of the best, of course he's not in an easy phase with Manchester but he's proved in the past how good he can be. Why can't they win three games in a row? I don't know because I'm not there.",
      "Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler has been speaking to the media this morning and had this to say on United:",
      "I think they are playing more direct and more vertical style so more long balls trying to target [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Benjamin] Sesko, trying to win the second balls and continue on the wing. Trying to attack the box with deep runs and of course they have a lot of individual qualities. They can change the game with one action. No matter who it is. They are a danger for us and we have to be staying alive for 90 minutes because they can score from every phase.",
      "Every United player who took to the field on Sunday against Liverpool played their part in the victory and created special memories for the fanbase who travelled perhaps more in hope than expectation.",
      "While Arne Slot's side were, and are, on a bad run of form, United's terrible experiences in recent years at Anfield suggested that Sunday could have been the day the host's returned to what they are capable of. And yet, within the first minute, that narrative was brushed to one side and United went on to record what will go down as a famous win.",
      "Choosing a man of the match after such a result is an unenviable task but the one player who managed to truly cement himself as an undroppable deserved the acclaim. Senne Lammens.",
      "Read more here >>>",
      "On Thursday, MEN Sport reported that Zirkzee was aiming to leave United in the January transfer window. It is understood that the Dutchman is keen to gain more minutes to revitalise his career.",
      "The World Cup next summer is likely to be a driving factor for the centre-forward who has not been called up for the Netherlands since November 2024. While he wants to remain in the Premier League, he would also be open to a move to another European club.",
      "West Ham are thought to be leading the way at the moment.",
      "Read more >>>",
      "United are looking strong at present ahead of the clash with Brighton.",
      "Mazraoui was a doubt heading into the Liverpool game but he managed to be fit enough to make the bench. Martinez is expected to be the only player missing from the squad again.",
      "However, he is closing in on a return in November.",
      "Amorim will address the media this afternoon at 1.15pm. However, what he says will be embargoed until 1.30pm.",
      "Once that embargo lifts, we shall bring you everything he spoke about in the first part of his press conference.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live blog of Amorim's pre-Brighton press conference.",
      "We will bring you everything he has to say this afternoon ahead of the Brighton clash, including team news and injury updates as United look to make it three wins in a row after last Sunday's excellent 2-1 win over Liverpool.",
      "Stay tuned for updates..."

      "Former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson believes Manchester United were denied a clear penalty during the first half of their clash against Brighton & Hove Albion. Amad went down in the Seagulls' penalty area after contact from Brighton's Maxim De Cuyper, but no spot-kick was awarded.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side are chasing a third straight victory after wins over Sunderland and Liverpool. The 2-1 victory at Anfield last weekend was their first back-to-back win in the Premier League under their Portuguese head coach.",
      "But there was frustration in the first half at Old Trafford against Fabian Hurzeler's team after the Reds were denied a penalty. The decision from referee Anthony Taylor not to award the spot-kick was slammed by Robinson.",
      "\"How that's not been given I do not know,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"That should be a penalty to Manchester United.",
      "\"That's a mistake from the referee. I'm not having it at all [there being a touch on the ball by Maxim De Cuyper].\"",
      "Taylor's verdict at M16 was backed by VAR. A statement from the Premier League's Match Centre account on social media platform X, read: \"The referee’s call of no penalty to Manchester United was checked and confirmed by VAR – with it deemed that De Cuyper played the ball.\"",
      "The decision perhaps inspired Amorim's side into action, with Matheus Cunha opening the scoring moments later for United. It was the first goal for him since joining the Reds from Wolverhampton Wanderers in the summer.",
      "United then doubled their lead before half-time, with a deflected effort from Casemiro giving them breathing room. Victory will see Amorim's team move into the top four ahead of Liverpool's trip to Brentford on Saturday evening.",

      "United will go into the game full of confidence, following last weekend’s 2-1 away win over rivals Liverpool. That victory means that the team won back-to-back Premier League games for the first time under Ruben Amorim since his appointment last year.",
      "But going into the match, Amorim will be sweating over the fitness of a couple of players. Centre-back Harry Maguire was the hero at Anfield, scoring the winning goal with six minutes of normal time remaining.",
      "However, Amorim has confirmed that the defender is a doubt for the game against Brighton after picking up a knock. It’s a similar situation for midfielder Mason Mount who has started the last two games.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "\"The squad is fine,” Amorim said in his pre-match press conference. \"We have some doubts, we had some issues in the week with Harry Maguire and Mason Mount. Knocks, nothing serious and we will see tomorrow.”",
      "One player who will definitely be unavailable is defender Lisandro Martinez. The Argentine is stepping up his recovery from an ACL injury and has returned to training, but still needs a bit longer.",
      "\"Licha is out,” Amorim confirmed. “He trained really well.",
      "“He was on the next pitch and I was watching. He's training really well, the knee is looking well but I don't want to say a specific week [for his return] and then it depends on Licha, whether he wins the spot.\"",

      "Long-term absentees Adam Webster and Jack Hinshelwood will be unavailable. Both are recovering from ligament injuries.",
      "Solly March is also expected to be on the sidelines, with a return coming later this year.",
      "There is, however, better news for Brighton on other players. Fabian Hurzeler has confirmed Brajan Gruda, Kaoru Mitoma and Joel Veltman are all close to returns.",
      "“They're all close to the team, so maybe one or two of them might be available for tomorrow,\" he said in his pre-match press conference. “They don't have big issues, they don't have anything serious.",

      "Former Manchester United player Alejandro Garnacho netted his first goal for Chelsea against Sunderland on Saturday and celebrated in a manner that reminded his old club of how quickly things can change in football. The Argentine star made a £40million move to Stamford Bridge last summer, and he's not the only ex-United player to have been shown the door under Ruben Amorim.",
      "After scoring against the Black Cats, Garnacho sat on the advertising hoarding in celebration, with team-mate Pedro Neto joining him. This echoed a similar celebration during United's triumph over West Ham in February 2024, involving Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund, which some interpreted as a jibe at former Hammers player Mohammed Kudus.",
      "Back then, photos of the trio were held up as evidence the future was bright for United, with Hojlund and Garnacho both on target in the 3-0 triumph. However, a loss at West Ham nearly nine months later led to the dismissal of manager Erik ten Hag, and his successor Amorim has overseen a tough time on the pitch while two of the three players from the iconic celebration have been allowed to move on and the other is struggling for minutes.",
      "Garnacho has now permanently left the club, while Hojlund is expected to follow suit after showing positive early signs following a loan move to Napoli. Mainoo remains at United but has yet to start a league match this season.",
      "This situation highlights the rapid pace of change in football. Not only have all three former United players found themselves in different cities, but also Ten Hag has lost two managerial positions, with his stint at Bayer Leverkusen lasting a mere 60 days.",
      "Garnacho's departure from United was virtually confirmed by his response to being left out of the Europa League final. The winger openly questioned Amorim's team selection, despite being brought on as a substitute whilst the Reds tried and failed to find an equaliser.",
      "\"Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today - I don't know,\" he said. \"I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.\"",
      "Garnacho found himself relegated to United's 'bomb squad' during the summer months, sitting out pre-season fixtures as Amorim looked to move him on alongside several teammates. Following Chelsea's Champions League triumph over Benfica, however, the player maintained there's no animosity towards his former club.",

      "All matches United play at Old Trafford in the run-up to Christmas are scheduled to land midweek, which means they will have an evening kick-off time. According to reports, Berrada has reached out to the Premier League to \"express concern\" about the way in which the fixtures have landed.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",
      "It's understood by The Athletic Berrada's conversation with Premier League representatives was \"constructive\" with the United CEO stressing \"the cultural importance of match-going fans to the fabric of the English game.\"",
      "He also reportedly requested the Premier League to make their decisions about broadcasted games at an earlier stage, to ensure supporters can plan their Christmas commitments around kick-off times. Berrada's meeting with Premier League representatives is a clear indication the club is listening to the concerns of United supporters.",
      "Fan representatives recently communicated their frustration towards this season's scheduling. They have felt match-going fans have had to deal with an unfavourable run of fixtures, in regards to the number of home games scheduled for midweek.",
      "The United Fans' Forum outlined these feelings in a letter sent to the club, who responded with a letter of their own. The Reds are one of many Premier League clubs who supported an increase in the number of Monday night and Friday matches, which was part of the new broadcast deal.",
      "It was also proposed as a solution to the expanded European schedule, which features a record number of clubs competing across the Champions League, the Europa League and the UEFA Conference League. United did not qualify for any of the continent's competitions this season.",
      "However, they did feel the full force of the lengthened schedule last season, when they played 15 matches in the Europa League, which saw them lose 1-0 in the final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Amorim will be looking to make it three wins in three Premier League matches when his side host Brighton. United's 2-1 away victory over Liverpool meant the Portuguese boss had finally recorded back-to-back victories in the Premier League.",
      "The victory over the defending Premier League champions and the 2-0 home win over Sunderland has also lifted United into ninth position. They are one point ahead of tomorrow's visitors Brighton, who boast victories over Manchester City and Chelsea this season.",
      "Amorim suggested Harry Maguire and Mason Mount are both doubts for the clash against the Seasiders. The United manager said: \"We have some doubts, we had some issues in the week with Harry Maguire and Mason Mount. Knocks, nothing serious and we will see tomorrow.",
      "\"Licha is out. He trained really well. He was on the next pitch and I was watching. He's training really well, the knee is looking well but I don't want to say a specific week [for his return] and then it depends on Licha, whether he wins the spot.\"",

      "Al-Hilal were interested in signing Mohamed Salah in the summer, but Salah committed his future to Liverpool and the Saudi Pro League club turned their attention to Fernandes as they looked to make a marquee signing.",
      "Al-Hilal offered a huge financial package in an attempt to lure Fernandes away from Manchester. However, no formal contact was made with United and Fernandes rejected their proposal.",
      "In the summer, Fernandes explained his decision to stay at United, but he provided fresh insight into the decision to reject Al-Hilal when he spoke to journalists at Carrington on Friday.",
      "He said: \"I had the conversations with Al-Hilal. Everyone is aware of that. Everyone knows that. There were also other clubs that tried after Al-Hilal, but obviously my answer wouldn't change.",
      "\"From Europe, I had some people talking to me, but we never got into the place where we would be offering on the table or not. Because it's all very nice and people want you, but then they need to put the money on the table for the club. If not, the club won't allow me to go.",
      "\"Obviously, I think the concrete one was from Saudi. To be honest, I didn't need to leave the club at the moment. I spoke with the manager, not only to Saudi, but also that's why I think with European clubs we didn't get into a point of... Because I didn't show very interest to go somewhere.",
      "\"So they a little bit felt that and they said, like, we'll be wasting our time and then it will say no in a month's time or two weeks' time. So the manager spoke with me. He said I was still part of the project.",
      "\"He wanted me to stay. The club said the same. And I always said that if the club was like ‘Bruno, we want to cash in, you are 30 years old. We want to make some money. We don't think you can be part of the future project’, or whatever, I would be like, OK, I have to find a solution for myself, whatever is best for me and my family. And I will leave.",
      "\"But obviously that wasn't the case. I felt that I was still part of the plan, that I could still help the club to achieve whatever was our aims. And that's what made me stay. Obviously, I have a big connection with the fans, with the club, also the country. My family feels very well here.\"",
      "Fernandes continued: \"My kids love to go to school. They love the way they live here, even with the weather and everything. Today is nothing wrong [laughs]. But obviously, everyone is settled very well.",
      "\"We're very happy to be here. Obviously, we miss home, but my aim is not to go now to play in Portugal again. And obviously, home for me is Porto, not Lisbon.",
      "\"Obviously, if I had a chance to go to play again in Portugal, I would always put Sporting in front of everyone to get the chance to play for them again. But we feel like home here also.",
      "\"Many times, speaking with my family, we say sometimes the house we have here, it feels more like home than the one we have in Portugal because we were there for two weeks, three weeks, not more than that. And that was one of the many reasons that was behind that.\"",
      "Fernandes was asked whether he spoke to Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, and he said: \"I spoke with both, obviously. I think the first time I spoke was already in Malaysia, because that was when everything started.",
      "\"I had a conversation with Omar and I told him, 'look, this is what is on the table. I know the club might be looking at this in a way. I will be looking at it in a different way. So I just want to know from your perspective, from your side, what's the point of view, what you guys want to do. And then from there on, I will do my things'.",
      "\"And obviously, the first one, Jason said, like Omar said, 'we won't say no. But obviously, it's the thing that we want you to stay at the club. But if you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us, because obviously it's massive money'. As I said this many times, the club's last biggest sale was £20million, probably from Daniel James.",
      "\"I'm not very sure. Scott [McTominay] went above that. But to go from that to the big amount that Al-Hilal was, like they could offer £80m, £100m. They were like more than eager to pay for the player to go.\"",
      "Fernandes added: \"And then from there on, I spoke with the manager also. I said, ‘look, this is what I have, this is the offers that I have on the table’. Obviously, I said to him, I have to think about if the club says, ‘we want you to go, because we want to get a different player. We need money to get more players or whatever’.",
      "\"That was not the case from the club. They always said to me that they will buy, they will reinforce the team. They wanted players. The manager said to me, like, ‘no, we want more players to help you to become a better team. So we don’t want you to go, because then if we bring some people and then we lose you, we’re still going to lose something’.",
      "\"So more or less, that was the conversation between all of us. I spoke with one at a time. I didn’t go to everyone together.\"",
      "Fernandes said his situation at United will remain unchanged and no talks will take place until after the World Cup. \"No, it will be the same situation,\" he said.",
      "\"As I've always said, I feel good here. I want to achieve my dreams still. But obviously I can't talk by the side of the club. I've seen a lot of news. I've seen a lot of people talking that I had an agreement to go already next season. If the club has done that agreement, it wasn't made with me.",
      "\"So I haven't spoken with anyone. I could tell you that there are still people talking to me and saying that they will be very eager to have me next year, of course.",
      "\"But from my side, that's not talked about. Because my agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won't speak to anyone.\"",

      "Fletcher scored an instinctive volley from 35 yards that dipped under the crossbar when he last played at Oakwell Stadium in 2024. His deflected goal may not have been as impressive, but they all count.",
      "Manchester United signed the Fletcher twins for £1.25million from Manchester City in the summer of 2023. The pair opted to move to United and are now pushing towards being involved with the first team.",
      "United use the EFL trophy to give 'elite young players' the platform to perform in a more pressured environment which prepares them for the first team.",

      "Leon made his international debut for Paraguay during the international break. He said it was an \"unforgettable night\" but he was back down to earth starting in South Yorkshire a week later.",
      "In August, there was a sense of frustration among academy staff that Leon had exclusively worked with the first team when he could have benefited from getting minutes in his legs during youth matches.",
      "Leon made his first appearance for the academy in a friendly shortly afterwards. The 18-year-old is still very raw and needs time to adapt to English football after his summer window arrival from Cerro Porteno.",
      "The Paraguay international struggled for the U21s against Liverpool and looked better against Barnsley, although he still has lots to learn, which was highlighted when he attempted to make an adventurous run through the middle of the pitch, only to be dispossessed in a dangerous area.",
      "Binnion shook his head on the touchline. United signed Leon for £3.3m fee, rising to £7m with add-ons, because scouts believed he possesses first team potential, but he still needs to develop his game.",
      "The U21 boss cut a frustrated figure again just before the interval when Barnsley were awarded a penalty after a foul from Dan Armer. Veteran striker David McGoldrick made no mistake from the spot.",

      "It didn't take long for Barnsley to take the lead when play resumed. McGoldrick, 37, rolled back the years when finishing beyond Will Murdock again, although Obi produced an immediate response at the other end.",
      "Lacey intelligently won the ball on the halfway line and slipped through a perfectly weighted pass to Obi, who found the net with a classy finish. \"Chido, Chido, Chido,\" sang the small section of United fans.",

      "Wayne Rooney finds himself unable to attend his son Kai's matches for Manchester United's academy due to the overwhelming attention his celebrity status attracts. The 15-year-old is the eldest of four boys shared by Rooney and his wife Coleen, alongside younger brothers Klay, 11, Kit, eight, and Cass, six.",
      "Kai, who plays as a striker much like his iconic father, became part of the Red Devils' academy setup in 2016, treading the same path as Rooney Sr, who marks his 40th birthday today. Whilst the youngster still has considerable ground to cover on his route to professional football, he's considered a promising prospect within the Old Trafford ranks.",
      "Sadly for the former England skipper, he must observe his son's performances from afar after the emerging talent requested his father stay away from matches due to the overwhelming media circus that follows him.",
      "This heartbreaking situation came to light during Coleen's stint on ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here last year. The 39-year-old claimed second place in the hit reality programme behind McFly vocalist Danny Jones, and it was whilst in the jungle that she revealed the difficult choice her son had made.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out,\" Coleen explained last December. \"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game.",
      "\"How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?' Adults, it's different you could speak to them, so he [Kai] just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "Whilst he might not be present on the sidelines during Kai's matches, he continues to play a significant part in his footballing development. Rooney has previously acknowledged that he generally leaves the coaching duties to the club's coaching staff, but ensures he offers guidance to his sons during practice sessions at home.",
      "During last month's instalment of The Wayne Rooney Show, the 40-year-old explained: \"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he told Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Considering Kai's position as the offspring of one of England's most celebrated players, Rooney commended his psychological resilience in handling the additional scrutiny and expectations that accompany being his son.",
      "During the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney told BBC Sport: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",

      "Sporting Lisbon came from behind to beat Marseille 2-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday, with former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood hooked at half-time.",
      "Greenwood came into the clash on a high after scoring four goals against Le Havre at the weekend. The 24-year-old has seven strikes and four assists so far this season, but he was sacrificed by Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi after the Ligue 1 side went down to 10 men in Portugal.",
      "De Zerbi's call to go safety first in the game has not gone down well with French media. Some outlets believe the Italian somewhat stifled his team's chances of winning by hauling Greenwood off and opting for a negative set-up, with De Zerbi seemingly still unconvinced when it comes to the defensive side of his game.",
      "Igor Paixao had put Marseille into the lead in the 14th minute. However, after Emerson was sent off in added time of the first half for diving to win a penalty having been set up by Greenwood, De Zerbi changed tact.",
      "His call to forfeit firepower in favour of solidity backfired as Sporting grew into the tie. Goals from Geny Catamo and Alisson Santos condemned Marseille to defeat.",
      "Prior to Greenwood's exit at half-time, French outlet L’Equipe offered reserved praise for his performance. They wrote: \"This goal freed his team, much higher, calm and dangerous, with a valuable Mason Greenwood in a more central role than usual.",
      "\"Marseille thought they were safe just before half-time, when, following a corner and a well-aimed pass from Greenwood, Emerson found himself knocked to the ground and Mr. Obrenovic [the match official] didn't hesitate to point to the penalty spot.\"",
      "The outlet also awarded Greenwood a 5/10 rating for his first-half contribution. They said: “Playing in support of the main striker, alongside Paixao, he was a little less prominent than his team-mates, even though he tried his luck several times (16th, 27th, 35th minutes).\"",
      "Le Parisien, subtly perplexed by Greenwood's hooking considering the player's general consistency, said: \"The second half was nothing but misery for Marseille, despite being so impressive in Ligue 1 with four consecutive victories and a first-place finish ahead of PSG.",
      "\"Roberto De Zerbi had anticipated this by adding a defender, Amir Murillo, to bolster their position. Mason Greenwood, who scored four goals against Le Havre on Saturday, paid the price.\"",
      "De Zerbi has been critical of Greenwood's work rate ever since the ex-United player made the switch to France in July 2024. The Italian took another chance to remind Greenwood of his defensive responsibilities following the defeat to Sporting CP.",
      "“Greenwood had already played up front at Lyon last season, but I needed players willing to do more, and Greenwood doesn't necessarily have the kind of characteristics to make that kind of sacrifice,\" he said. \"We had to find an alternative; we needed different characteristics.”",
      "He told Canal+: \"I made the choice to take Greenwood off because they sent off Emerson, we had to defend with five and, between Greenwood and Paixao, at that time, the one who had the characteristics to defend and attack at the same time was Paixao.",
      "\"Last year, when we were 10 against Lyon, we put Mason as a center forward and he had a lot of trouble. Even Vermeeren, who had played well in the first half, I had to replace him to put a little more weight on it.\"",
      "De Zerbi's strong words echo those he made in March, when he claimed he expected more from his striker. He said: \"I wanted him here, I said it over and over again. He was the first player I contacted, even before I signed for OM.",
      "\"I had already spoken to his father. No one can have more respect for him than I do. But that doesn't change anything: I expect more from him. He has to do more, because what he is currently showing is not enough. If he wants to achieve his ambition of becoming a champion, he has to be more consistent, sacrifice more and be more determined.\"",

      "Had Manchester United got their way, Casemiro would not still be playing at Old Trafford.",
      "United engaged several agents to try and sell Casemiro before the January transfer deadline, and they tried their luck again in the summer transfer window. Yet again they were unsuccessful.",
      "Despite it not being a leading priority, United were keen on strengthening their midfield options in the summer, but the continued presence of the high-earning Casemiro meant they were unable to do so.",
      "A £15million fee was required for United to avoid a loss under Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). It was clear Casemiro was going nowhere, try as United might.",
      "The Brazilian reserved his best football for European fixtures last season, and with no European football on offer at Old Trafford this term, it seemed he would be left to run down the final year of his contract while having very little impact on the first team.",
      "Seven weeks on from the closure of the summer transfer window and the narrative has definitely changed.",
      "It would be a stretch to say Casemiro is one of the first names on the team sheet, but his value to the team cannot be underestimated. Granted, that is partly down to the man who was brought in as his intended successor, Manuel Ugarte, failing to showcase his best form at Old Trafford, but Casemiro suddenly looks like a different player.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted last season that he was learning how best to utilise a player like Casemiro. No longer is he being asked to cover vast areas of the pitch, a task he simply isn't up to at the age of 33, but instead the Brazil international is simply being asked to sit in front of the backline and break up play.",
      "Amorim also showed against Liverpool that he's learnt his lesson when it comes to allowing the veteran midfielder to walk a disciplinary tightrope.",
      "As soon as Casemiro was booked against Chelsea alarm bells started ringing. Amorim decided not to take action and half an hour later he was sent off. Amorim wasn't going to run that risk against Liverpool and Casemiro was hooked as soon as a yellow card was brandished.",
      "United are expected to strengthen their midfield ranks next summer, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton among their intended targets. It's understood United could exercise the one-year extension option in Casemiro's deal if he agrees to reduced terms, but there's every chance he could be on his way out next summer on a free transfer.",
      "If this is to be his final year at Old Trafford, United are learning how to get the best out of him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Every Manchester United player who took to the field on Sunday against Liverpool played their part in the victory and created special memories for the fanbase who travelled perhaps more in hope than expectation.",
      "While Arne Slot's side were, and are, on a bad run of form, United's terrible experiences in recent years at Anfield suggested that Sunday could have been the day the host's returned to what they are capable of. And yet, within the first minute, that narrative was brushed to one side and United went on to record what will go down as a famous win.",
      "Choosing a man of the match after such a result is an unenviable task but the one player who managed to truly cement himself as an undroppable deserved the acclaim. Senne Lammens.",
      "Like the Sunderland match, Lammens did not necessarily have to play out of his skin to have a good game against Liverpool. But he did have his moments.",
      "The Belgian commanded his area in the hostile atmosphere and did superbly when he was called into action in the first half to prevent Alexander Isak equalising. In the second half, United came under further pressure but Lammens stood tall and inspired confidence from those who were in front of him.",
      "He did excellently to close down Mohamed Salah to ensure his strike sailed wide and while he was beaten for Cody Gakpo's goal, there was little he could have done to prevent that. Potentially Lammens' most important contribution though came in stoppage time.",
      "With Liverpool looking to pile on the pressure, the corners started to flow and that's when the goalkeeper truly impressed. Instead of wilting, the 23-year-old took charge of his box, punching the ball away and ensuring that there was no need for any further jangling nerves.",
      "After Sunderland, nobody wanted to get too excited about Lammens. We have seen too many false dawns in that position before.",
      "However, combine this with the Liverpool performance and suddenly it looks like there is even greater reason to be optimistic about the goalkeeper. Yes, Altay Bayindir tried his best to fill that role but it now feels as though that place firmly belongs to the Belgian.",

      "It is beginning to sound like a broken record for Manchester United supporters as, once again, Scott McTominay shines for Napoli.",
      "McTominay is firmly among the contingent of former United players who are benefitting from their new surroundings. What has been so impressive from the Scot's perspective is that he has gone from a player who was overlooked to a Ballon d'Or nominee.",
      "Such a meteoric rise does little to hide the envious looks that United fans are shooting over to the Naples club though. When he left, Erik ten Hag spoke about how disappointed he was to be forced to sell McTominay for Financial Fair Play (FFP) reasons and that assessment looks like an understatement, if anything, at the moment.",
      "However, the one small crumb of comfort that can be taken from McTominay adding another two goals to his Napoli tally in a Champions League defeat to PSV on Wednesday, which took him to just 13 behind his all-time United record - which was accomplished in 255 appearances - is that there is a huge chance he would not have replicated such figures at Old Trafford, had he stayed. The Reds never really utilised McTominay in the more advanced position in midfield.",
      "Scotland were the first to trust in him, perhaps out of necessity due to their lack of options in attacking midfield, and he flourished. Since then, that has been his position for Napoli rather than the defensive midfield role which he had become associated with in Manchester.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, that may have changed and he could have potentially been utilised in one of the No.10 roles. However, McTominay's new role for Napoli now is not one that Amorim uses.",
      "Antonio Conte picks a 4-1-4-1 system with McTominay on the wide left as either a midfielder or a winger, depending on how you look at it. For Amorim, the width comes from the wing-backs.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount have the luxury to play wider and attempt to stretch the opposition's defence but they are expected to focus themselves in a more central position for the team. This season, McTominay's goals for Napoli have come from wide left and it's unthinkable that Amorim would alter his formation.",
      "Instead, had McTominay still been at United when Amorim arrived, he would have either been played as a No.10, which may have worked but the competition with Mbeumo, Mount and Matheus Cunha could have stalled his progression. Or, the 28-year-old could have been asked to play that deeper role but would have found himself in the same difficulties that Kobbie Mainoo is experiencing trying to unseat Bruno Fernandes.",
      "So for United supporters, that is at least a small shred of comfort. Albeit knowing that McTominay may not have been correctly used throughout his time at the club, regardless of the manager, will come as a shame for most.",

      "The atmosphere around Manchester United's Carrington training ground this week should be joyous after the club's exploits on Sunday.",
      "Ahead of the game with Liverpool, you could see that Ruben Amorim was a whole lot lighter after the victory over Sunderland prior to the international break. However, an away win over your fiercest rivals, for the first time in nearly a decade, will breed confidence and leave Amorim feeling as though he is walking on air.",
      "Before the clash with Liverpool, United had a couple of injury concerns. Lisandro Martinez was the only definite absentee as his recovery from an ACL injury continues.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Martinez is likely to be out of action until November while the only other issue of note was Noussair Mazraoui, with Amorim unsure if he could play a part at Anfield.",
      "Mazraoui was fit enough to feature on the bench meaning, ahead of the clash with Brighton, just Martinez is out for the Reds.",
      "We are nearing the one-year anniversary of Amorim's arrival at United and during that time it is hard to remember when the Portuguese head coach has had all of his options to call upon. Last December, Amorim bemoaned the injury crisis with the likes of Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro, Tyrell Malacia and Mason Mount all having to be managed in terms of minutes.",
      "In February, Kobbie Mainoo, Toby Collyer, Amad and Manuel Ugarte were all unavailable for one reason or another just before Martinez suffered his serious injury. If, by some miracle, United did not have a long list of injuries, the relentless and arduous schedule forced Amorim to rotate his squad anyway.",
      "While nobody at United will be pleased about having plenty of free midweeks this season, it has allowed the Reds to nurture players back to full fitness and, most importantly, keep them there. Mount is arguably the main benefactor.",
      "Amorim having a full set of players to choose from for a matchday squad may seem a luxury that Premier League managers rarely get, and one that those at the top have to work around in modern day football. But United must now take full advantage and build a winning run.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Manchester United are being linked with midfielder after midfielder, making it increasingly unclear what type of player Ruben Amorim actually wants to sign.",
      "Sporting CP’s Morten Hjulmand is a player Man Utd have reportedly been tracking for some time, and his name has been thrown in the mix once again by Portuguese outlet Record (via Sport Witness).",
      "The report claims that Man Utd and Man City are both interested in signing Hjulmand, with a ‘January transfer battle’ on the cards.",
      "His form has unsurprisingly ‘caught the attention’ of the Manchester giants and they are ‘following him closely’ ahead of the winter window.",
      "Both clubs have links to Sporting through United boss Amorim and City’s director of football Hugo Viana, which means they both know the 26-year-old well — and that it’s a very easy transfer rumour to make up.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas said there was interest in the summer and that Hjulmand turned down offers to ‘triple his salary’, but the report claims that January could present him with ‘headaches’ as City and United ‘promise’ to move for the midfielder.",
      "Hjulmand will reportedly pick up a loyalty bonus if he stays at Sporting until the end of the season, and the Portuguese club are adamant they won’t negotiate below his €80m (£69.8m) release clause.",
      "On Friday, we covered a story from Fichajes linking Athletic Club’s Oihan Sancet, and another from talkSPORT linking six other midfielders with a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Surprisingly, Hjulmand’s name wasn’t mentioned by the latter, which claimed Man Utd are open to signing two midfielders in 2026 — with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Chelsea’s Andrey Santos, Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher, and Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller all appreciated.",
      "Hjulmand, a long-time target, becomes the eighth player added to Amorim’s midfield shortlist.",
      "The quantity of midfield targets proves that Man Utd are serious about strengthening in that area — but the quality and variety is confusing.",
      "The fact that Man Utd are reportedly considering signing two midfielders is a caveat, but the different profiles being linked with the Red Devils either shows they don’t know what they want — or that those reporting are just guessing. Or both. Definitely both.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has the ability to drop deep and dictate the tempo, but he’s wasted in those areas. United need him further up the pitch because he’s the most reliable goalscorer and creator Amorim has in his squad.",
      "What he doesn’t have are the defensive capabilities. He’s nothing like a prime Casemiro — the kind Amorim wishes he had — and he’s not a Patrick Vieira type who bombs up and down the pitch, winning tackles and making interceptions.",
      "With Fernandes an undisputed starter in Amorim’s midfield two, it’s clear the Portuguese boss needs a much more industrious player alongside him. Literally, if Casemiro were five years younger…",
      "There will be no unearthing of hidden gems like United almost managed with Moises Caicedo. Unknown quantities like Baleba and Santos — or under-the-radar Premier League and Championship ballers like Anderson and Wharton — are now commanding fees in a completely different stratosphere to what their current clubs paid.",
      "Stiller and Santos are similar in that they can play as a No.6, 8, or 10, but their best role isn’t what United need to become more defensively stable and get the best out of Fernandes.",
      "Gallagher is similar, but everyone knows what you’ll get from him: energy. The guy has an unparalleled engine and is a manager’s dream. But is he someone with the ability to dictate tempo and provide the defensive output required for Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system? Probably not.",
      "Baleba, Wharton and Anderson are all Premier League-proven and the right profile for Man Utd. Brighton midfielder Baleba is the perfect signing for me, Clive.",
      "Hjulmand is similar but lacks Premier League experience. He might be the most attractive signing of all eight players, but there’s no way United should be paying £70m.",
      "And then Sancet barely deserves a mention. He’s an attacking midfielder — and the source is, well, sh**.",
      "We all know Baleba will be the guy United sign at the end of the season. He’s going to cost around £100m, though. And knowing Man Utd, they won’t hesitate to pay it."

      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly left some staff feeling ‘bemused’ as an ‘outburst’ has gone ‘down like a lead balloon’.",
      "Ratcliffe has faced heavy criticism since joining the Premier League giants at the start of 2024.",
      "Upon purchasing a 27% stake in Man Utd for around £1.25bn, Ratcliffe took control of football operations at Old Trafford and has felt it necessary to implement a brutal cost-cutting programme to balance the books following years of mismanagement by the Glazer family.",
      "This was a sensible decision and it has improved Man Utd’s financial footing, though some of Ratcliffe’s cuts have been deemed too harsh as he’s quickly become a hated figure at Old Trafford.",

      "READ: Big Weekend: Brentford v Liverpool, Man United, Eberechi Eze, Thomas Frank, El Clasico",
      "Ratcliffe has also made digs regarding Man Utd’s current facilities, with the British billionaire recently claiming that the academy has “really slipped”.",
      "During an appearance on The Times’ The Business podcast, Ratcliffe said: “The academy has really slipped at Manchester United.",
      "“You need the academy to be producing talent all the time.",
      "“It helps you financially. That’s not a light switch. You don’t solve the academy problem overnight. It takes time. We just recruited a new academy director.”",
      "Now, a report from The Sun has revealed how ‘staff and parents’ have reacted to these comments, claiming they have been ‘left bemused by his outburst’.",
      "It is suggested that these comments have internally gone ‘down like a lead balloon’ because there is the feeling that Ratcliffe has not given a true reflection of the academy.",
      "A source for The Sun said: “Sir Jim’s comments don’t represent what parents think of the club. All it has done is unsettle some of the boys and their parents.",
      "“He might even find that what he’s said means some families start to wonder if their child’s future would be best served at another club.",
      "“His comments aren’t helpful and are confusing as most are happy at United. They have access to great pitches, the changing rooms are fantastic.",
      "“They have opened a new parents’ lounge, and the boys can use the state-of-the-art facilities that the first team use for gym and rehab. It’s quite the contrast from Sir Jim’s comments.",
      "“The majority of the parents have said that Sir Jim seems to have his own agenda, which does not align with what is really happening.",
      "“The coaches try to be upbeat and put a brave face on, but you can tell that Sir Jim’s comments have hurt them. They don’t understand what he’s talking about.”",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has commented on a potential Manchester United takeover and has shut down speculation regarding an “approach” to David Beckham.",

      "A seventh player has been added to the list of Manchester United midfield targets, with Ruben Amorim green-lighted to make two signings in 2026, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim is eager to add a new midfielder after missing out on Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in the summer, and talkSPORT has linked the club with six players, while the less reliable Fichajes says Athletic Bilbao’s Oihan Sancet is also a target.",
      "The Red Devils tried to sign Baleba in August but were put off by Brighton’s £100m valuation. The groundwork has been laid down, though, and they could revisit the Cameroonian in January or at the end of the campaign.",
      "The report from talkSPORT says the Premier League giants want two new midfielders next year as Amorim seeks ‘more pace and athleticism’ in the engine room.",
      "Two midfield additions would be made possible by Bruno Fernandes’ departure next summer, with clubs in Saudi Arabia interested and Man Utd valuing him at around £100m.",
      "Casemiro, meanwhile, is out of contract at the end of 2025/26 and not viewed as a long-term option in midfield. There is a club option to extend his deal for a further year, and even considering his resurgence under Amorim, that wouldn’t be a wise financial decision as the Brazilian earns around £300,000 a week.",
      "Amorim ‘values him highly’ but as everyone is aware, he is severely lacking the ‘pace and athleticism’ required.",
      "With that in mind, coupled with Fernandes and Casemiro’s uncertain futures, several midfielders are being linked with a transfer to Old Trafford.",
      "Carlos Baleba – As we are all well aware, Man Utd really like Baleba. Unfortunately for them, Brighton have ‘ruled out’ a winter sale, per talkSPORT. He is the club’s top midfield target and should be one of the sagas of next summer.",
      "Elliot Anderson – Are we looking at the perfect Man Utd signing? Anderson has been outstanding in the Premier League this season, leading the division for passes completed (569), progressive passes (71) and ball recoveries (64). He also ranks third for fouls won (19). He covers the ground required to fit Amorim’s 3-4-2-1 system and has the ability to be the link between defence and midfield, and midfield and attack. talkSPORT says no talks have taken place and Anderson is keen to stay at Nottingham Forest. Great start, lads.",

      "Adam Wharton – Another young England international, Wharton is appreciated by ‘several Premier League clubs’ but is not expected to leave Crystal Palace mid-season.",
      "Angelo Stiller – The Stuttgart midfielder is ‘tempted’ by playing in England, and Man Utd have been linked by several journalists. A £35m release clause is tempting, but the German side can pay £1.5m to remove that from his contract. A bit of a no-brainer, that.",
      "Conor Gallagher – Another name being relentlessly linked in recent weeks, Gallagher is another perfect fit for a system that requires energy and an all-round game in midfield.  The report adds that Man Utd tried to sign him on loan in the summer, but Atletico would only sanction a permanent sale. He would cost at least £35m and is ‘open to a return to England’.",
      "Andrey Santos – Chelsea don’t want to sell and the Brazilian is ‘content’ with his playing time with next summer’s World Cup in mind. Next.",
      "Oihan Sancet – In a Fichajes report also linking Sporting defender Ousmane Diomande in what would be a £104m double swoop, Man Utd have ‘set their sights’ on signing Sancet from Athletic Bilbao and are happy to pay €70m (£61m). It would be fair to quickly disregard Sancet as a midfield target for two reasons: the source and the fact that he’s much more suited to playing behind the striker in Amorim’s front three. He is a top player, though.",

      "Another big ol’ weekend of football on the horizon, and one now dominated by each and every one of us just desperately hoping and praying that Brentford do as they’ve been asked and keep the ball on the ground against poor little Liverpool.",
      "Please, guys, we beg of you. None of those beastly long throws. Liverpool do not like it when the ball is in the air, and the rest of us should definitely respect that.",
      "Elsewhere, Manchester United will have to overcome a recent bogey team if they want to take their first ever chance under Ruben Amorim to go on an actual decent little run, Eberechi Eze faces his old club, and Thomas Frank has to find some answers to Spurs’ suddenly soporific attack.",
      "Oh, and there’s quite a big game over in Spain as well. Might be worth a look.",
      "",
      "‘The biggest exception for me was the playing style of our opponent. We got some energy out of the moments we could press them — in the last four or five games we’ve played we were not able to press the opponent, because the ball wasn’t on the ground. It was through the air.’",
      "We love absolutely everything about the speed and totality with which Slot has responded to coming under pressure for the very first time as Liverpool manager by dusting off the ol’ Wenger and Klopp playbook and, having considered all the possibilities, come to the conclusion that it is the fault of other teams playing football wrong.",
      "We’d love it even if it were all true. The fact it’s also just absolute mad bollocks only makes it even more delicious.",
      "What we do know, though, is that Liverpool are going to face an aerial bombardment from Brentford this weekend and if they don’t cope with it then it’s all going to look very silly indeed thanks to the manager’s decision to come out and say they don’t like it.",
      "Liverpool are set to face a night of the long throws and, while that was always going to be the case, it now leaves them with no way to save face if they don’t come up with a solution.",
      "Because nobody is going to be interested in further complaints from Liverpool or their manager about opposition tactics.",
      "This was actually a weekend where picking a standout game was actually quite tricky. There’s lots of interesting games, lots of potential, but no clear and obvious blockbuster. So personally, we’re actually quite big fans of Slot’s tactics for making it so much easier for us.",
      "We’ve even resisted the overwhelming temptation to say that Liverpool’s season is at risk of being up in the air but, fair warning, we will absolutely not be able to do so should they come any kind of a cropper at the Gtech.",
      "",
      "Well now. That astonishing ball-in-the-air victory at Anfield has given United the chance to do something they haven’t managed to do at all even once in 11 months under Ruben Amorim: go on a little bit of a run.",
      "They’ve got some okay fixtures coming up over the weeks ahead, but that of course brings its own dangers. Lose at home to Brighton this weekend and all the air goes straight out of the balloon. United go straight back to crisis jail, they do not pass Go, Sir Jim does not collect £200.",
      "And the big problem here is that losing at home to Brighton is precisely the sort of thing Banter Era Manchester United do. Both generally and very, very specifically in this case. Brighton have won on each of their last three Premier League trips to Old Trafford.",
      "United have lost eight times to Brighton in their 16 league meetings, and the trend is one way: in the last four seasons, United have lost six out of eight games against the Seagulls.",
      "It all adds up to the worst possible fixture at the worst possible time in many ways. A fixture that sits precisely in the crisis-restoring sweet-spot of being one United will now be expected to win but recent history suggests they probably won’t.",
      "There’s more to consider here, though, because another thing that’s undeniably true this season is that Brighton only trouble themselves with beating the best. Their three Premier League wins this season have all come against sides who finished in the top five last season.",
      "So if United do lose to them, it’s not a crisis at all but actually proves United are big and good again. Which also means that maybe United shouldn’t win and go on that little run we mentioned earlier, because beating Brighton this season is clear and incontestable evidence that you are no good.",
      "It’s possible we’re overthinking this.",
      "",
      "A fascinating potential battle as Eze faces his former club at the Emirates. The player who got his move from Selhurst Park goes up against Marc Guehi, who very much did not.",
      "It’s a key match-up in a key game, with Palace suffering the most minor of wobbles via defeat at Everton and last-gasp draw against Bournemouth while it already feels like this is a pivotal stage of the season for Arsenal, for whom Palace represent one of the toughest challenges in a run of games that really do offer a captivating chance to open up a significant lead at the top of the table given the far harder challenges that simultaneously face the less convincing Liverpools and Citys of this world.",
      "Eze’s affection for Crystal Palace is deep and obvious, and it’s highly possible that if he were to score this weekend we might see the most muted celebration in Premier League history. Which, in a further twist, are actually the celebrations the Celebration Police should be investigating.",
      "",
      "Nothing is ruined yet, but there has been a sense all season that performances weren’t quite keeping pace with results in Frank’s early games as Spurs manager and now those two lines do seem to be converging.",
      "Spurs were cravenly limp in defeat against Aston Villa last weekend, extending their own dismal home form to a now scarcely creditable three wins in 18 league games while also giving Villa’s also-honking away form a timely boost.",
      "The midweek trip to Monaco produced more of the same, with the only difference being the performance of Guglielmo Vicario. Among the guilty against Villa, he was a hero in the Champions League and almost single-handedly allowed Spurs to burgle a point they absolutely did not deserve.",
      "Spurs have started to look horribly short of attacking ideas, with Plans A, B and C all seeming to amount to not much more than ‘Get the ball to Mohammed Kudus and await him performing a madness’.",
      "He’s been brilliant, and it should absolutely be a prominent element of the Tottenham playbook. But not the only one.",
      "There is a lack of cohesion about Spurs at the moment; this is a new team figuring things out under a new manager and right now it still looks like a bunch of talented individuals rather than a team.",
      "Injuries haven’t helped, for sure. Any one of Dejan Kulusevski, Dominic Solanke or James Maddison would shift the current uncertain and one-note efforts of the non-Kuduses Frank has at his disposal.",
      "But those players have been out for some time and will be out a while longer yet. Neither team nor manager can afford to wait in the hope their returns provide the spark Spurs currently lack.",
      "At least a first trip to the Hill Dickinson Stadium offers a rare chance for Spurs themselves to benefit from the enticing welcome of a stunning new stadium, given the extent to which it seems still to inspire visitors to Spurs’ own spectacular digs.",
      "",
      "It’s been quite the season so far for Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, who remain unbeaten in the Championship and have won their last five league games by a combined aggregate of 16-1.",
      "Mid-table Watford are the visitors to Frank Lampard’s Coventry City in one of this weekend’s Saturday lunchtime kick-offs, which gives Frank Lampard’s Coventry City a chance to put some significant scoreboard pressure on their rivals with a victory that would add to the growing sense that we really could see Frank Lampard and his team, Frank Lampard’s Coventry City, in the Premier League next season.",
      "",
      "You can’t ask for much more than a lovely bit of Clasico action, but if you were greedy and decided you did want to ask for more than that, then you’d ask for a Clasico where top spot in La Liga is up for grabs.",
      "Your gluttony sickens and appals us, but you have got your wish. Real Madrid take a two-point lead into this one, so there’s far more than just the standard-issue bragging rights on the line here.",
      "If you still insist on a bit more spice, then how about the fact this game takes place a year to the day after Barcelona won 4-0 at the Bernabeu to lay down an early title marker as well as establishing a dominance that would see them record three further all-competition wins over their old rivals before the season was through?",
      "Memorable wins they were, too, with that 4-0 actually the lowest scoring of the lot. There was a wild Spanish Super Cup clash that ended 5-2 in 10-man Barca’s favour, before more red cards and drama in a 3-2 extra-time Copa Del Rey win and the very best saved for last in the return La Liga fixture, one in which Real Madrid led 2-0 within 15 minutes, but trailed 4-2 by half-time and would eventually lose 4-3 despite Kylian Mbappe completing his hat-trick.",
      "It’s unlikely to be dull, is what we’re saying here.",
      "Tottenham boss Thomas Frank feels there is a “very good comparison” between Xavi Simons and Florian Wirtz, with the Spurs and Liverpool new boys struggling – and the stats show ...",
      "Liverpool’s summer of spending had many predicting another easy league title but their difficulty to settle is in stark contrast to other teams.",
      "A Tottenham insider has stated it’s “madness” two players have been snubbed by Thomas Frank, after he made an important squad decision recently.",
      "Insider Florian Plettenberg has confirmed that Tottenham are among the teams ‘closely monitoring’ a Brentford forward who scored 14 goals when being managed by now-Spurs boss Thomas Frank.",
      "Former Premier League boss Sam Allardyce has revealed the one “concern” he has about Tottenham under Thomas Frank this season.",
      "Tottenham are reportedly keen on signing a former Real Madrid defender, with Thomas Frank leading the push after his solid start to the season."

      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has commented on a potential Manchester United takeover and has shut down speculation regarding an “approach” to David Beckham.",
      "There has been a lot of change at Man Utd over the past couple of years.",
      "At the start of 2024, the Glazer family sold a 27% stake of the Premier League giants to INEOS chief Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who in turn took control of football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "This deal was worth around £1.25bn and Ratcliffe has since made a further investment to increase his share to around 29%, though he has been heavily criticised over his decisions since joining the club.",
      "Ratcliffe inherited a mess and decided to sanction a brutal cost-cutting programme to balance the books, though some have argued that certain changes were needless, as there have been mass redundancies, reduced payments to club legends and ticket prices have been hiked.",
      "This means that the British billionaire has quickly become a villain at Man Utd, so recent reports surrounding a potential takeover have been met with positivity.",
      "It has been claimed that an UAE-based consortium are plotting a full takeover of Man Utd and have made ‘approaches’ to several club legends, including David Beckham, over their potential involvement.",
      "Meanwhile, Saudi Arabian boxing promoter Turki Al-Sheikh has claimed that a deal is ‘advanced’.",
      "However, Jacobs, who has regularly reported on the Man Utd takeover saga over the past couple of years, has pointed out that Al-Sheikh’s comments were “misleading”, while Beckham is unlikely to be involved.",
      "“So I think now, as is quite widely reported, the interest in buying Manchester United comes predominantly from the UAE,” Jacobs said on the United Stand podcast.",
      "READ: Do Manchester United have the quality to offset ‘the new Ji-sung Park’?",
      "“The group haven’t made any offer to the Glazers. They haven’t even engaged in talks. So it can be simultaneously true that Manchester United are quite in the dark, and yet, there is a consortium out there that is building, and Turki Al-Sheikh tweet got everyone excited.",
      "“The word advanced was misleading. And although the consortium are maybe getting advanced in terms of where their money’s from and what it entails, it’s not advanced between a bidder, and Manchester United, in fact, quite the opposite.",
      "“The Glazers are still waiting to see whether anything actually materialises, and we still don’t know whether they would sell imminently, ie, within the next two years or less.",
      "“But within the UAE, what this consortium, as they build, have done is gone to ex Manchester United legends, including, as I revealed, Eric Cantona are as a possible ambassador, not at investor. We’ve heard David Beckham mentioned as well.”",
      "On the fabricated Beckham reports, he continued: “I have great respect for other journalists, so I’m not here to shout down anyone’s reporting.",
      "“You may recall when I first broke this on talks, but I said a series of ex-Manchester United legends have been approached.",
      "“But I have my doubts about David Beckham, because when Sheik Jassim approached David Beckham, and when Qatar 2022 approached David Beckham, he was willing to do stuff, but only after Qatar won, and only after, and he didn’t Sheikh Jassim won.",
      "“So I’d be surprised if David Beckham considered putting his name or his endorsement to any potential bidder for Manchester United until the point came where they were actually in the club, and then he may be open to some kind of involvement.",
      "Whereas there are other Manchester United legends that would be prepared to endorse a consortium even if it didn’t develop, even if it was just a publicity stunt, even if they never held any talks with the Glazers. So that’s kind of where we’re at the moment. Let’s see whether or not it develops.”",
      "Jacobs later pointed out that Ratcliffe “is not that fearful” about losing power as the takeover situation is “relatively quiet”.",
      "“I think the lines of communication are open enough that Ratcliffe, in agreeing to this sale, including the drag clause, is not that fearful that the Glazers are going to go in the next year or two, definitively in 100%,” Jacobs continued.",
      "“But let’s see if there’s a pathway to a strategic investor, or let’s see whether a consortium just blows the valuation of the Dragon claws out the water, in which case we may have to reconsider the position of all parties.",
      "“But right now, it’s relatively quiet on the takeover front, even though Turki Al-Sheikh got everybody very excited.”",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly left some staff feeling ‘bemused’ as an ‘outburst’ has gone ‘down like a lead balloon’.",
      "The Glazer family are “not really rushing in to sell” Man Utd following claims of a potential bid from a UAE-based consortium, according to reports.",
      "A UAE-based consortium, who are hoping to buy Man Utd, have approached David Beckham over a potential role in the deal, according to reports.",
      "A 38th player has been capped for England while at a foreign club despite having ‘just completely forgot about’ the national team after seven years out.",
      "According to reports, a UAE consortium have had a ‘formal takeover approach rejected’ by Manchester United in the ‘last 24 hours’.",
      "Some Man Utd legends have been ‘approached’ by a UAE-based consortium looking to buy the club from the Glazers, according to reports."

      "It is also noted that staff have been impressed by Cunha after they ‘had been warned that he could be prickly to deal with and that he had a tendency to turn on the charm in public’.",
      "Despite this, ‘United figures’ dealings with him have been almost purely positive’, while he’s ‘also struck up an unlikely friendship with Luke Shaw, despite the multitude of Portuguese speakers at the club’. So that’s nice.",
      "It is also indicated that the Red Devils have ‘marvelled’ at Cunha’s showing against Liverpool, while there is a feeling that he has helped captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The report claims: ‘Dressing room sources feel his ball retention and ability to advance has relieved pressure on captain Bruno Fernandes.’",
      "It is also firmly believed that Sesko is an ‘upgrade’ on Rasmus Hojlund.",

      "Ji-sung Park is one of the great unsung heroes in Premier League history, but do Manchester United currently have the attacking quality to offset the limited goal contributions of his Old Trafford regen?",
      "After joining United from PSV Eindhoven for just £4m in 2005, Park made over 200 appearances for the Red Devils and was frequently leaned upon by Sir Alex Ferguson in the toughest fixtures as a reliable 7/10 player in a squad brimming with star talent which would frequently be snubbed in favour of the South Korean.",
      "Park won eight major titles with United, including four Premier Leagues and the Champions League, and Ferguson believes they would have won another had he used the midfielder to man-mark Lionel Messi in the 2011 final.",
      "“That’s where I lost the final against Barcelona at Wembley,” Ferguson said. “I should have changed at half-time and put Ji-Sung Park on Messi. That was a mistake.”",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov were just some of the highly-skilled forwards to have shared the pitch with Park, whose standout attribute was his extraordinary ability to get around the pitch and snap into challenges to win the ball back for United. He was a pressing demon before it became so in vogue.",
      "And the weight of numbers of those he was playing with offset Park’s relatively meagre contributions – he got 19 goals and 23 assists in 154 Premier League appearances across his seven seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha – promising though their starts to life at United have been – offer nothing like the same goals/assists buffer as Ronaldo, Rooney et al. Which begs the question, can Ruben Amorim afford to include the new Ji-sung Park in his starting XI?",
      "On the Stick to Football podcast, Gary Neville said: “Do you know what I think about [Mason] Mount? He reminds me, say, Darren Anderton or Adam Lallana, Ji-Sung Park, maybe a little bit.",
      "“Players who do that sort of ugly bit well, but they also connect and glue things with, like, he starts the press.”",
      "But Roy Keane doesn’t think Mount is worthy of a place in Amorim’s starting XI, pointing out his poor record in what he believes is his baffling selection.",
      "He said: “That’s a head-scratcher, I think. He’s doing well to get in the starting United team, Mount.",
      "“A lot of managers have loved him over the years, he was the main man with England for a while, Chelsea of course and now obviously the manager wants to put him in.",
      "“But you go back to stats as an attacking player. At United, his stats when he’s played are really poor. It’s not as if you’re going, yeah I can see he’s getting a lot of assists, his stats are really poor.”",
      "Mount has scored one goal this season but has managed just two further Premier League goals since his arrival from Chelsea in 2023, and remarkably, is yet to provide an assist in his 37 games in the top flight for the Red Devils.",
      "Park’s inclusion could be seen as something of a luxury afforded to Ferguson, made possible by the goal contribution machines he was playing with.",
      "But it’s impossible to know whether those more creative and deadly players would have racked up those numbers without Park scrapping for possession alongside them.",
      "Amorim is faced with the same chicken-and-egg scenario with regard to Mount, but without the goals and assists in the team besides to nullify his shocking lack of quantifiable contribution to points on the board for Manchester United.",
      "Paul Merson has called on Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim to drop Mason Mount for their next Premier League match against Brighton over the weekend.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Mason Mount insists that the Red Devils team are “together with the manager” despite rumours about Ruben Amorim’s future.",
      "Pundit Paul Merson has revealed why he thinks one Manchester United star has flopped at Old Trafford, while Ruben Amorim has “underestimated” one thing.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Neville has hit out at Ruben Amorim over an “unforgivable” decision and has commented on the head coach’s future.",

      "According to football analytics expert McKay Johns:",

      "For each shot, the model will generate a random number between 0 and 1. If the number is less than the value of the xG of that shot, it says it is a goal and adds to that game’s simulation tally, and at the end compares the actual goal tallies.",
      "If a team wins that simulated match they get 3 points, draw they get 1 point, and a loss they get zero.",
      "Running that same simulation over many iterations (say 1000) gives the output of how often a team would have won, drawn, or lost, and then we can take the average of all the points they have accumulated in the simulations to get their expected points which will fall between 0 and 3.",

      "Manchester United capitalised on recent momentum by beating Brighton at Old Trafford as Matheus Cunha scored his first club goal in a frantic and somewhat controversial 4-2 win.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side seem to be one of contrasting fortunes as a torrid start to this season has made way for a particularly productive recent period, with three wins on the spin propelling them, temporarily at least, into the top four.",
      "Man Utd had lost six of their last seven league games against Brighton and rode their luck at times in the first half, needing some wasteful finishing from Danny Welbeck to pave the way for two goals in 10 minutes, scored by Cunha and Casemiro. The opener was sumptuous, the second via a harsh deflection much more fortunate.",
      "Bruno Fernandes should have made it three before Bryan Mbeumo did, driving a devilishly clever strike through Lewis Dunk's legs, despite an obvious foul by Luke Shaw on Georginio Rutter in the phase before. And that was not the only decision under scrutiny on the night.",
      "Neither referee Anthony Taylor nor VAR awarded Amad a penalty when he was upended by Maxim De Cuyper in the first half, because the defender supposedly \"played the ball\", while Patrick Dorgu only received a yellow for a last-ditch foul on Yankuba Minteh - albeit the forward had probably lost control of possession when the whistle finally went.",
      "The drama did not stop there. Welbeck latterly made his presence felt when guiding a belting free-kick beyond Senne Lammens to rid him of a second consecutive clean sheet, before Charalampos Kostoulas arrived from the bench to force what looked to be a needlessly tense end.",
      "Mbeumo had other ideas, though, finding the net in the 96th minute with an emphatic finish to round off a frenzied finale, with Gary Neville praising Amorim for his \"best and most important week in the job\".",
      "\"The narrative coming into this game was that Manchester United couldn't take a step back after what happened at Anfield last week and the win today was absolutely crucial.",
      "\"I think it has been Ruben Amorim's best and most important week in the job. It gives him a bit of time.",
      "\"I am not saying he's off the hook but Manchester United are up there towards the top of the league and it certainly takes a lot of pressure off him.\""

      "Saturday 25 October 2025 17:38, UK",
      "Brighton face Manchester United on Saturday with six wins from the last seven Premier League meetings between the sides. Two of them were masterminded by Fabian Hurzeler last season. The youngest head coach in the country is going for a third.",
      "The trip to Old Trafford, scene of a 3-1 victory in January, is another chance for the 32-year-old to show his potential to be one of the game's next elite coaches and comes with Brighton unbeaten in five games following last weekend's win over Newcastle.",
      "\"Don't prove it only once, we have to prove it twice, maybe a third time, that we are able to compete with the best teams in the league.",
      "\"And this will be the challenge against Manchester United as well because they are one of the best teams in the league. They have unbelievable individual quality. Of course, they had a big win against Liverpool, so we expect them with a lot of confidence, with a lot of belief. But we will go there to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We will go there to win this game.\"",
      "They will aim to do it by applying the lessons of their last visit.",
      "\"First of all, it's always a big challenge to go there because it's just a special atmosphere,\" says Hurzeler. \"The second thing is that you have to go there and play with a lot of belief and a lot of courage, especially in possession. You can't go there and only defend.",
      "\"What I learned from last season is that you have to be at the highest level in all the small match-ups. That's the main thing against United, especially with the individual quality they have. They can decide a game with one action, in one moment.\"",
      "Brighton's win there in January, secured by goals from Yankuba Minteh, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter, prompted Ruben Amorim to describe his side as \"maybe the worst in Manchester United's history\". Are they a different proposition now?",
      "\"Every time teams bring more individual quality into their team, it gets more and more difficult to beat them,\" says Hurzeler. \"They play a similar formation to last season but they seem to be more stable. They seem to get more and more into their rhythm.",
      "\"For sure, the more the teams spend, the better they will be and the higher the challenge is, but we never hide, we are never afraid. We have a lot of respect for every team and every player but we go there with the biggest self-belief that we can beat every team.\"",
      "Hurzeler knows what to expect tactically. Manchester United have started every game under Amorim with a back three. The Brighton boss is something of an expert on the system having used it at his former club St Pauli, even if he terms it differently.",
      "\"I played a lot with a back five at my previous club, so I know that you can defend the whole width of the pitch,\" says Hurzeler. \"It's easier to do that so I think that's one advantage.",
      "\"You need to be very good between the lines. You need to have centre-backs who defend forward, otherwise it's easy for the opponent to turn in front of the defence.",
      "\"One of the challenges when you play against a back five is that you always face a very compact team, with very short distances between each player. When you face a four, you have a little bit more distance between the opposition players.",
      "\"The challenge is to find the gaps, to be patient, to not force it, because if you force it with the first action, then for sure they are going to transition.",
      "\"So, you have to be patient, you have to switch the play, you have to create overloads on the wings to make them move, then find the gap where you can play through or run through.\"",
      "There are parallels between Hurzeler and Amorim as up-and-coming coaches who earned their moves to the Premier League having built their reputations on the continent. But they have approached their respective tasks very differently.",
      "While Amorim has rigidly stuck to his favoured system at Manchester United, Hurzeler has embraced change at Brighton, using a back four in all but one of his Premier League games in charge despite having used a three consistently at St Pauli.",
      "\"I think the most important thing is to understand the profiles of the players,\" he says. \"So, what is the natural system for the club? What is the natural system for the players? In which position and on which base can the players show the highest potential?\"",
      "Hurzeler points out that his system is fluid and interchangeable.",
      "\"I always stick to my principles, but principles don't mean you always have to play a back four or always a back five,\" he explains. \"In the game you have thousands of different situations and patterns, so you always have to be able to react.",
      "\"We really try to train decision-making from the players, and in my experience this decision-making is better when you stick to your principles. You need to adapt or adjust without losing your style of play and that's what we try to do consistently.\"",
      "One of Hurzeler's principles is to press opponents aggressively.",
      "Brighton have forced more high turnovers than any other Premier League side this season. Opta's advanced metrics show they hold one of the highest defensive lines in the Premier League.",
      "How might he adapt, then, to Manchester United going direct? Their goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, has sent 83 out of 90 passes long in their last two Premier League games. Arne Slot highlighted the issues they caused by bypassing Liverpool's press.",
      "\"United played a lot of long balls in the last two or three games, they were quite efficient on that,\" says Hurzeler. \"They are really keen on winning the second ball. It's a very effective way of being successful. They proved it can be very powerful.",
      "\"The main thing you need to understand is that it starts with the press, how you attack the goalkeeper, which centre-back you want to attack. And then make sure that you're ready for the long ball.",
      "\"When the long ball is played, there are two things that are very important: that you try to win the second ball, and that, if you don't win the second ball, you have good positioning for the third ball.",
      "\"Make sure that, with your last line, you always cover the inner line, so when they try to flick the ball, especially with [Benjamin] Sesko, you can defend against the deep runs from [Matheus] Cunha, from [Bryan] Mbuemo, from [Mason] Mount.",
      "\"They are very good at these things, so it's a job for the whole team, not only of the defensive players. The main thing is to keep the compactness, make sure you have close distances, that you close the gaps, and that you're really intense for the second ball.\"",
      "One player who can help them is Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old made an indifferent start to the season following strong interest from Manchester United in the summer but he looked back to his best in the win over Newcastle after Hurzeler urged him to \"take responsibility\" for his situation.",
      "\"I saw a Carlos Baleba who stepped up,\" says Hurzeler. \"These were good actions and good behaviours he showed, but he has to make habits out of those good behaviours. That's the next step in his development, to bring consistency to his performance.\"",
      "Hurzeler wants him to \"overcome the noise\" around his future at Old Trafford on Saturday. He has been firm with Baleba and continues to push the midfielder, even if it risks upsetting him.",
      "\"For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players,\" he says. \"I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.",
      "\"It's important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it's important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "\"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That's where we try to support him and make him better.\"",
      "Baleba is of course just one of many young players to have excelled at Brighton, a club with an exciting trajectory and a head coach whose appetite for improvement is abundantly clear.",
      "\"I always say that learning has no finish line, so you will never be finished with progressing,\" Hurzeler says. \"That is what we try to live as a club, and what I try to live as an individual.",
      "\"We see the progress, but the main thing is to keep going, to keep trying to improve things, because the other teams, they won't rest. You always have to be ready to adapt and develop.\"",
      "It is a mantra that is serving Hurzeler and Brighton well.",

      "Manchester United's win at Anfield was huge for this team, make no mistake about it.",
      "Getting back-to-back wins for the first time, not just under Ruben Amorim, but since May 2024, is finally a topic we do not have to talk about anymore.",
      "Also, to be the first United side and head coach to win at Anfield for the first time since 2016 is another impressive feat.",
      "This is in addition to the 2-0 win against Sunderland before the latest international break, which was seen as a huge challenge for a United side that had just come off a disappointing defeat to Brentford one week before. Again, well-handled by United.",
      "They are overdue a bit of credit after what had all the potential to be a disastrous few weeks, the type of few weeks that could raise even further questions about Amorim's future.",
      "Having spoken to a few of the players after the Liverpool game, including Diogo Dalot and Senne Lammens, I get the feeling the players sense this could be the start of real momentum under Amorim.",
      "However, United hosting Brighton at Old Trafford this weekend will truly be a measure of how this team has developed under Amorim in the last 12 months.",
      "Sometimes you come across strange statistics when two teams face each other. From memory, it was pretty easy to remember Brighton had beaten United in both of their meetings last season.",
      "However it is more shocking to learn that Brighton have beaten them in six of their last seven meetings. No team has beaten the Red Devils on more occasions than Brighton since 2022.",
      "For Amorim's only game in charge against Brighton, United were dismantled last season by long balls as well as their own errors - including one by Andre Onana, who is now out on loan in Turkey.",
      "With United's new keeper Lammens continuing his impressive start to life at Old Trafford, the side have improved from last season in terms of showing defiant defensive performances when they have needed to against the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and Burnley.",
      "However, they will have to show they can contain Brighton's imposing and incisive style of play - a type of test they have yet had at Old Trafford bar the opening day against Arsenal.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba starred (while also giving away a penalty) in last season's win at Old Trafford and it will undoubtedly be an interesting subplot as Baleba's form has taken time to warm up amid interest shown in him by United during the summer transfer window.",
      "Since Amorim's arrival, United have won just 11 games in the Premier League. When you dissect those 11 wins, four have come against the 'bigger' sides in the league.",
      "Then you look at the other seven, five are against promoted sides, one against a relegation-threatened Everton last season and a win away to Fulham which, after a decent sample size, feels like a bit of an outlier.",
      "United have shown glimpses of what they are capable of but, other than Tottenham Hotspur in a few weeks, until they face Aston Villa on December 21, all of their upcoming fixtures would be classed as against mid-table sides.",
      "These are the games United have struggled in over the last 12 months, the games they have failed to consistently make an impact, produce a performance or gather consistency.",
      "This is going to be a pivotal time in the season for Amorim's United. The Portuguese manager as well as his players have spoken repeatedly about building momentum and wanting to put last season's troubles behind them; this is their first opportunity to do so.",
      "There will be interesting selection dilemmas for Amorim ahead of their match against Brighton.",
      "When you look at their two previous wins, he has gone with two slightly different teams - the first difference being who leads the line as the No 9. Matheus Cunha displayed an accomplished performance against Liverpool, but then Benjamin Sesko also picked up his first goal at Old Trafford against Sunderland in the previous game.",
      "Other dilemmas will be whether Amorim continues with the combination of Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo on the right - their chemistry a huge positive of the season so far - and will Harry Maguire continue at the back after his Anfield heroics? Or could Leny Yoro be recalled with Brighton's threat of pace in behind?",
      "Interesting selections for Amorim to ponder but he has got all of his tactical and in-game situations right in the last two games, so this does not seem just a huge opportunity for his side but also for the manager himself who has made no secret of just how tough the job leading this United side has been over the last 12 months.",
      "If United are able to string back-to-back wins against two opponents they have had poor results against in recent years it would do wonders for this team's confidence but also perhaps it would gain the trust and respect of not just the fans at Old Trafford but of opponents, pundits and the media alike as well.",

      "Marcus Rashford has made it clear he wants to stay at Barcelona as he gears up for his first El Clasico against Real Madrid on Sunday.",
      "Rashford moved to Barcelona on loan from Manchester United this summer and the LaLiga giants have the option of making the deal permanent next year.",
      "Having scored five goals in 12 games, including a double in the midweek Champions League thrashing of Olympiacos, the 27-year-old is clear where his future lies.",
      "Asked if he wanted to stay, Rashford told ESPN: \"Oh yeah, for sure.",
      "\"I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game.",
      "\"To play here, it's an honour.\"",
      "Rashford has a contract at Old Trafford until 2028 but having also spent a brief spell on loan at Aston Villa last season it is highly unlikely he will return under current boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Rashford believes the timing was right for him to move from United last summer, saying he is benefitting from a \"new environment\" at Barca after more than 20 years at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It's been a big change but it hasn't felt big,\" Rashford said. \"I watched Barcelona for years and I felt if I was to move, this team would be a perfect fit.",
      "\"I am happy here and to be with the group is a special feeling.",
      "On his move away from United and needing \"a change\", he added: \"It was so many years in one place.",
      "\"People forget this, but 24, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United, so sometimes you just need a change. I think maybe this is the case with me and I'm enjoying everything.",
      "\"There's not been much change in me.",
      "\"It's a new environment and a new culture, and I've looked forward to coming here. It hasn't disappointed.",
      "\"I'm hungry to improve and I know there is more to come from me.\"",
      "Rashford was on loan at Aston Villa for the second half of last season and he produced some promising displays under Unai Emery at Villa Park as he looked to get his career back on track.",
      "However, at Barcelona this season he has looked much more like the Rashford of old.",
      "His two goals on Tuesday in the Champions League against Olympiakos took his tally to five in 12 games in Spain, with his form leading to an England recall under Thomas Tuchel.",
      "\"I just believe that things happen when they're supposed to happen,\" Rashford said.",
      "\"It's not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn't happen in the past and now is my opportunity to make it happen.",
      "\"I feel like there's no time like the present now. So I just take things day to day.",
      "\"Every day I just take it day by day and just try to improve from the day before.\"",
      "Rashford's Spanish adventure continues on Sunday with his first El Clasico as Barca travel the Bernabeu to face LaLiga leaders Real Madrid.",
      "Hansi Flick's side are currently two points behind Real and have the chance to leapfrog their rivals into top spot with a win.",
      "\"For me, it's the biggest game in football,\" Rashford said ahead of his first experience of El Clasico.",
      "\"Being from Manchester, it's not the biggest game in Manchester or England, but for me, we were always watching El Clasico. The one game to watch was this game.",
      "\"To play in it will be an unbelievable experience, but for me, it's about winning.",
      "\"To make the experience memorable, I have to try and help the team win.",
      "\"That's the main objective but of course it is a great team we are playing against. They are in really good form so it's not going to be easy but we will give our best to get the job done.",
      "\"It's been an okay start but obviously this next game is a good opportunity to accelerate the process. We are looking forward to it and like any game, we'll try to get the job done and win.\"",
      "It's Jude Bellingham vs Marcus Rashford as Barcelona travel to Real Madrid on Sunday afternoon; kick-off 3.15pm."

      "After calling events at Anfield last weekend to a tee, The Radar column returns with a look at Tottenham's mismatched midfield pairing of Joao Palhinha and Rodrigo Bentancur and the numbers underlining the super-powers of Man Utd's Bruno Fernandes",
      "Saturday 25 October 2025 08:12, UK",
      "",
      "🤔 Tottenham's midfield issue analysed📊 Fernandes' unrivalled creativity🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Wednesday's game against Monaco was just the latest in which the balance has looked off in the centre of Frank's team. It is becoming increasingly apparent that Palhinha and Bentancur are too similar, both players' strengths lying out of possession.",
      "Spurs are struggling to progress the ball through midfield. Amazingly, the pair only directed seven of a combined 58 passes forward against Monaco. They only found striker Richarlison three times. Substitute Randal Kolo Muani was not found once.",
      "The issue was clear in Spurs' defeat to Aston Villa too, with Palhinha and Bentancur sending only 15 of their 79 passes forward and only finding Mathys Tel once. Even in the win over Leeds, in which Tel scored, he was only fed twice by Palhinha and Bentancur.",
      "Tel's goal proved crucial at Elland Road but he was substituted in the second half of the game having only touched the ball 13 times.",
      "Spurs profile similarly to Burnley, West Ham and Everton for forward passes and defenders bypassed from central midfield this season, at the opposite end of the scale to the Premier League's top sides.",
      "Frank might argue that pairing Palhinha and Bentancur together is a means of adding defensive solidity. But that is a hard case to make after Wednesday's game. Monaco cut through Spurs easily. They had enough chances to win it twice over.",
      "Their record with and without them is revealing.",
      "Spurs have only won three out of nine games with both players starting this season, and one of them was against League One Doncaster Rovers in the Carabao Cup. The side's record is far better in their other games, with three wins and a draw from four.",
      "In fairness, they are not the only ones being found wanting when it comes to servicing the side's forwards. Xavi Simons provided an assist against West Ham from a corner on his debut following his arrival from RB Leipzig but has struggled since.",
      "Across two starts in the No 10 role against Leeds and Aston Villa, he did not manage to complete a single pass to Tottenham's strikers.",
      "The disconnect running through the heart of the team can be seen in their passing network, which highlights the lack of combinations between their midfield and attack this season.",
      "So what are the alternatives? With Simons still finding his feet, Frank is unfortunate to be without the injured James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, key players who ranked first and third respectively among Spurs players for progressive passes last season.",
      "Frank's pool of midfielders without them is a shallow one. He has Lucas Bergvall and also mentioned Archie Gray as an option after using him at left-back against Monaco. Pape Matar Sarr might be his best bet to bring some much-needed drive having impressed with a goal and two assists earlier in the campaign.",
      "In the long-term, Spurs will probably need to use future transfer windows to redress the balance between ball-winners and ball-players at the base of their midfield. But in the meantime, a change to the Palhinha and Bentancur axis looks necessary.",
      "He reaches the milestone with an outstanding body of work behind him. His total of 100 goals in 299 games puts him 26 clear of any current or former team-mate in the same timeframe. His total of 84 assists is more than double anyone else's.",
      "Fernandes has had to endure periods of heavy criticism during his time in the Premier League. His status as captain remains the subject of some debate. But few players can claim to have been more consistent when it comes to the stuff that really matters.",
      "The 31-year-old is out on his own among Premier League players for chances created since his debut in 2020, his total of 560 roughly 30 per cent higher than the next player on the list in Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "He also comes out on top for expected assists, which highlights the quality of the opportunities created as well as the volume.",
      "Fernandes has been moved further back by Amorim this season, into his midfield two. But he continues to deliver unmatched creativity.",
      "The sensational first-time cross to set up Harry Maguire's winning goal against Liverpool at Anfield was one of 22 chances created by him this season. No other player has created more than 17.",
      "Where Manchester United would be without him hardly bears thinking about after the lows of last season. But his robustness is another super-power. Fernandes has featured in 203 of a possible 212 Premier League games since his arrival, starting 199.",
      "He is always there. And he almost always delivers.",
      "Savinho's Manchester City future appeared uncertain following interest from Spurs in the summer but he signed a new contract earlier this month and looks to be getting back to his best having provided assists in back-to-back games against Everton and Villarreal. Erling Haaland will aim to make the most of his service against Aston Villa.",
      "Ruben Amorim's back three to cause issues for Arne Slot, Liverpool's problems when playing against back threes, Man Utd being better with less possession... Last week's column previewing their meeting at Anfield was ahead of the game.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
