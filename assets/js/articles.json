      "A free agent who idolised Ryan Giggs when he was at Manchester United is reportedly eager to join Wrexham. Welsh international Tom Lawrence is currently unattached after his contract with Scottish club Rangers expired at the end of last season.",
      "The attacking midfielder, born in Wrexham, was plagued by injuries following his move from Derby County to Ibrox in 2022. Despite the setbacks, the 31-year-old managed to make 65 appearances and netted 11 goals during his three-year stint in Glasgow.",
      "He's now on the hunt for a new club, with Wrexham, owned by Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, said to be interested in acquiring his services. While Lawrence has reportedly attracted interest from clubs in the Middle East and Turkey, the Mail reports that the prospect of playing for his hometown club is an appealing one.",
      "The Red Dragons, who clinched promotion from League One to the Championship in April, have already signed one local talent in the summer transfer window. The North Wales outfit announced the signing of goalkeeper Danny Ward on a two-year deal on Tuesday, following his release from Leicester City.",
      "If they manage to secure Lawrence's signature, Wrexham would be adding a player who honed his skills under some of the best in the business during his time at Manchester United.",
      "He joined the Premier League heavyweights at just seven-years-old and had the privilege of learning from Manchester United legends such as Sir Sir Alex Ferguson and Paul Scholes, as well as his hero Giggs.",
      "Highlighting the impact this had on him in an interview last year, Lawrence told the Sun: \"I was at United from the age of seven until I was 20. So the number of figures that helped me out along the way, I couldn't name them all.",
      "\"What I will say is that you looked up to those who were in the first team at the time, the likes of Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. Coaching-wise Paul McGuinness and Warren Joyce helped me massively.",
      "\"I am really thankful to them all. There were role models everywhere. It was just all about standards, it makes you have those standards from such a young age.\"",
      "He added: \"Sir Alex Ferguson was one for big standards and you couldn't mess up. That grounding never leaves you. When you grow up hearing that you just get used to doing the same high level standard stuff every day. It's instilled in you.\"",
      "Despite his lengthy tenure at United, Lawrence's first-team outings were limited to a single senior match in May 2014 against Hull. At the time, Giggs was juggling roles as United's player-manager when Lawrence played most of the game.",
      "In a poignant moment, Giggs replaced Lawrence on the pitch with 20 minutes to go, marking his final appearance for United.",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",
      "Lawrence said: \"He was a big hero growing up, there were a few of them. But he gave me my Manchester United debut so I'll be forever grateful. Nothing will ever come close to that.",
      "\"I had been out on loan and got recalled. I played a game at Anfield for the under-21s and I played well. The first team played a few days later and I got a call to say I was in the squad.",
      "\"We went to the hotel and later that day he told me I was starting. I went back to my room and told my family and they all came up.\"",
      "Wrexham AFC is the arguably the fastest-growing club in the world at the moment thanks to a certain Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.",
      "The Dragons have achieved two consecutive promotions and are cheered on by crowds from not only North Wales but also from all over the globe, thanks to the success of the Disney+ documentary 'Welcome to Wrexham'.",

      "It’s not easy getting a deal for Bryan Mbeumo over the line - just ask Brentford technical director Lee Dykes. The Cameroon star remains at the top of Manchester United’s wish-list as Ruben Amorim strives to pep up his forward line following a dire season at Old Trafford.",
      "United have seen several bids, including a £60million offer, rejected but remain hopeful of getting their man, having already snared Matheus Cunha from Wolves. Brentford signed Mbeumo from French side Troyes in 2019, although their pursuit of the striker was far from straightforward. It was a big moment for Dykes, who had recently joined from EFL side Bury.",
      "“I felt big pressure because I walked into a function where I was trying to take forward some of the good work that had already been done,” he told the Bees’ website in December 2023.",
      "“Coming into Brentford, I’d never really spent a lot of money. I’d always worked at League One and League Two level.",
      "“The most I’d spent was £50,000 on a player, and then six weeks later we are paying €5million for Bryan Mbeumo. So obviously you start to think, ‘Wow, this is big money.’ But, at the end of the day, it’s just different money, same process.”",
      "Dykes, co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen and head coach Thomas Frank made a whistlestop trip to France in an effort to complete a deal Mbeumo, only for those initial talks to come to nothing.",
      "“We were figuring that there was a possibility to sign Bryan,” said Dykes. “We had cleverly sourced that information, having been told that he wouldn’t entertain the Championship.",
      "“It became quickly apparent that we had to get in and out of France in a day as Thomas (Frank) had his training commitments because it was near to the season starting.",
      "“Where the meeting was going to take place, there was no airport close enough we could find from London or a route to do in one day, so we didn’t know if we could make it work.",
      "“I remember Rasmus just calling me up saying, ‘I spoke to Matthew (Benham, club owner) and he said he’ll fire up a jet and we’ll get over there’ - at that point, I was just thinking, ‘Wow!’",
      "“But that’s when I started to feel the pressure. I’d lined it all up with Troyes, as well as the agents that were involved, so me, Thomas and Rasmus got on this jet.",
      "“We got there, it was one of the hottest days of the year, it had reached about 43°C when we landed. It was a 60-minute journey and the air conditioning wasn’t working in the taxi we got in!",
      "“We had the meeting, spoke with the player, the club and the agent, but the deal broke down. So, I had convinced everyone to fly over to France to get this deal done - I thought it was going to get done - but it had broken down.”",
      "A bad day then got even worse for Dykes before a deal for Mbeumo was eventually revived. He added: “On the way back, and I’m not a good flier in general, the pilot turned to us and said, ‘It’s chaotic weather in London, it’s snowing, there’s thunder, there’s lightning.’ I was thinking, ‘What? It was 43 degrees when we left France.’",
      "“And the journey back was horrendous - I could see the pilot avoiding the dark spots on the radar. I was bricking it!",
      "“But, fortunately, we landed safely and, more importantly, managed to turn around the deal a few days later and eventually sign him. So, Brentford fans must know that I risked my life to sign Bryan Mbeumo!”",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "Manchester United have a little under two months left of the transfer window - and the Red Devils really need to get down to work. They have already sealed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "But the spending is unlikely to stop there. United are in dire need of a new forward to potentially solve their goalscoring issues and appear to have identified their man.",
      "A new midfielder, left-back and winger could all be set to arrive before the window closes on September 1. But before that, exits might have to be the first port of call as United attempt to gather funds after missing out on a spot in Europe for next season.",
      "And there are already a few candidates to leave Old Trafford, with some potentially worth millions. Where does the land lie right now though?",
      "It’s fair to say that the Brentford forward is right at the top of United’s shortlist of signings. They’ve already had two bids turned down for the Cameroonian and while it appears that the Bees are open to selling, they will only let him go for a price they deem suitable.",
      "As it stands, United chiefs remain confident of reaching an agreement before the end of the week. They might want to move a bit quicker to get everything rubber-stamped but all the signs are pointing to this one getting done.",
      "From Brentford to Aston Villa now, United are interested in adding an out-and-out striker to their squad. Having been linked with a host of options, it appears that Villa star Watkins is now the outstanding candidate.",
      "United reportedly held talks with Villa regarding a deal in January only for nothing to come of their initial discussions. But they are now making a concerted effort to sign the England man despite Villa’s £60m asking price.",
      "One reason that United have turned their attention to Watkins is the ongoing furore surrounding Viktor Gyokeres. The Sporting Lisbon striker was thought to be at the top of United’s list, only for him to prioritise a move to Arsenal.",
      "Even then, a deal has proven to be difficult, with Gyokeres accusing Sporting of upping their demands, threatening strike action and even turning down clear-the-air talks. It’s all gotten a bit messy but it appears that the Gunners are inching closer to an agreement, putting United out of the race in the process.",
      "One deal that is a lot easier to do is a move for young defender Diego Leon. He is set to fly to the UK this week to undergo pre-season testing.",
      "Leon has already suggested that he is ready to fight for his place at Old Trafford. He said: \"I'm really happy, I think every player dreams of this. When you're a professional, you have to adapt quickly, it is a massive opportunity.",
      "\"Everyone thinks I'll go out on loan, but I don't have that mindset. I'm going to kill it in pre-season and within one or two games, I'll already be playing with them.\"",
      "Over recent days, United’s interest in Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Fabian Ruiz emerged but a deal looks somewhat tricky to do. The Spaniard has two years left on his contract in the French capital, while manager Luis Enrique apparently wants to keep him around.",
      "Ruiz would be a quality addition to their midfield options but this one just appears to be speculation for now.",
      "While Enrique wants to keep hold of Ruiz, the same could certainly not be said of Ruben Amorim and Marcus Rashford. The forward was exiled to Aston Villa last term, the Midlands side recently confirming that they will not be activating their option to sign him.",
      "Rashford has already made his preference clear having ruled out a move to London, while he also does not want to reduce his £300k-per-week pay packet. He has also expressed interest in a move to Barcelona, who are interested in a move despite their imminent capture of Nico Williams. It looks like this one could rumble on for some time.",
      "With Rashford primed for an exit, he could be joined by Alejandro Garnacho, who has also fallen out with Amorim. Serie A champions Napoli were reportedly interested but that has not progressed.",
      "A potential swap deal with Chelsea involving Christopher Nkunku was touted but that looks slightly unlikely right now. The Blues could still move for him but again, that might be another one that gets more clarification later in the window.",
      "Sticking with Chelsea, they have already dealt a considerable blow to United’s transfer window this summer. The Blues had a £25m obligation to buy former loanee Sancho but paid a £5m penalty clause to back out of that agreement.",
      "He is now set to return to Old Trafford. Juventus have recently emerged as potential suitors in a sensational swap deal, while Napoli and Fenerbahce have also been linked in the past. It’s clear that Sancho won’t be a United player next season, it just depends on where.",
      "Fellow forward Rasmus Hojlund could also depart over the coming months. The Danish forward endured a woeful second season at Old Trafford, with it being suggested that United were happy to cut their losses.",
      "Inter Milan looked to be the most likely to move for him but they have since cooled their interest in the former Atalanta man. It was reported that United would only move for Watkins should Hojlund leave so his future could potentially be key to how the rest of the window plays out at Old Trafford.",
      "Brazilian winger Antony has been a disastrous signing at Old Trafford and he looks sure to leave. All the suggestions are that Real Betis will make a renewed move for the former Ajax man following his successful loan move last season.",
      "But the Spanish side would struggle to match United’s current demands. Reports in Spain suggest that an agreement over a move is still some way off despite Antony making his desire to return to Seville abundantly clear.",
      "Amorim has a decision to make over United’s number one position. Andre Onana has struggled to convince during his time at Old Trafford and according to reports, United would be open to letting him leave on loan.",
      "Ligue 1 side Monaco emerged as suitors for his services but have since cooled their interest. The Red Devils have picked out a few potential replacements but Onana will need to leave before anything progresses.",

      "Rashford spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa after falling out with boss Ruben Amorim, and Garnacho's provocative stunt was seen as him taunting the United boss after he, too, suffered the same fate as the England forward.",
      "Garnacho was dropped for United's 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao, prompting the winger – who turned 21 yesterday – to publicly criticise Amorim over the decision and reveal he was considering his future.",
      "That in turn convinced Amorim that Garnacho has no place in his future plans, with the club actively looking to sell the £50million-rated Argentina international this summer.",
      "Former United striker Louis Saha said ex-skipper Keane would have dealt with Garnacho in the most brutal way possible – by subjecting him to a series of fierce tackles on the training pitch to show him he was out of line.",
      "“Back in my day, I think Roy would have welcomed Garnacho back to the training ground with a few crunching tackles to help him understand what he thought of him,” said Saha. “I can’t say for sure, but I really doubt Keane will agree with what Garnacho did.",
      "“It’s the type of things we see from new generations. To be honest, I can’t only blame Garnacho. The way the squad has been built, it’s why Garnacho thinks he has the right to do something like this.",
      "“It's why he thinks he can make stupid comments and say things on social media. He thinks he’s going to get something out of it and, right now, United are the club who are giving him the platform to act this way.",
      "“He already thinks he’s a top player, already makes demands, acts without respect. It’s a shame, but there are other factors than just the player. The club and the squad, they’ve already lost the leaders. The bad influences have already taken over. They think they’re bigger and better than they are.",
      "“Keane, Rio Ferdinand, David Beckham, Gary Neville, they would all make sure you understand what wasn’t allowed. They wouldn’t give players the luxury to act like this. He’s been let down because he’s been given too much responsibility for a player who hasn’t earned it yet.",
      "“It’s fine if you’re playing like Wayne Rooney. If you score 20 or 30 goals a season, do what you want, demand what you want. Garnacho has five goals and he’s carrying on like this. It’s crazy.”",
      "Asked if a potential swap deal involving Garnacho and Chelsea striker Christopher Nkunku would be a good move, Saha said: “Everyone can benefit from the move. It’s a win-win. United want players who are dedicated, work hard, are eager to play and who have talent.",
      "“We want players who want to play well, and there’s extra motivation in the year of a World Cup. I think Nkunku knows if he plays well, he can get back in the French squad for the summer. At the same time, he’s not the kind of player who disrupts the dressing room.",
      "“As for Garnacho, if he wants to go, get rid of him. I used to be a huge fan, but that’s over. Anyone like this, if they want to go, go. Even if you lose money, it doesn’t matter, because you can bring in a player who can behave as they should.”",

      "But things soon went awry having fallen out of favour during his second season, while he found the net just 15 times. Lukaku was eventually sold to Italian giants Inter Milan.",

      "After his exit from United, Lukaku managed to rediscover his goalscoring form, scoring 64 goals over two seasons before he eventually got his much-desired move to Chelsea. He was allowed to leave after just one season though, rejoining Inter on loan before a spell with Roma.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres has been the subject of non-stop speculation this summer as the striker continues to be linked with a transfer to Manchester United or Arsenal. The forward has caught the eye since joining Sporting CP two summers ago, where he has developed into one of the most clinical No. 9s in the world.",
      "Gyokeres’ incredible tally includes 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting on his way to winning two Primeira Liga titles. United have developed an interest in the 27-year-old, partly because of their need for a goal-scorer and partly because Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim was the man who brought the best out of Gyokeres when he signed him from Coventry City.",
      "Yet, they face fierce competition from Arsenal, who are in search of their own striker after being left with no recognised centre-forwards for the second half of last season. The Gunners have been negotiating deals for both the Swede and RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko in the hope they can complete the transfer that offers the best value.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe delivered the bombshell news on Tuesday that Arsenal were on the verge of reaching a verbal agreement with the striker over personal terms. It was reported that the agreement would be a five-year deal.",
      "After negotiating at length for the Slovenian’s move again this summer, the deal is now seemingly on the backburner. It is Gyokeres, rather than Sesko, who looks to be Emirates-bound, despite suggestions that Arteta and his staff preferred the latter due to his younger age and experience playing in a tougher league.",
      "Another key character in the ongoing circus surrounding Gyokeres this summer has been Frederico Varandas. The outspoken Sporting president first took issue with a claim made by Gyokeres’ agent, who said he had a gentleman’s agreement in place whereby the club had promised to let the forward leave for a fee of £59m - considerably less than his £85m release clause.",
      "But Varandas has now handed Arsenal and United a potential boost by admitting there is a \"strong likelihood\" Gyokeres will leave the club this summer - and for a possible discounted fee - saying: \"Sporting is calm regarding this matter. Secondly, Sporting does not need to sell Viktor Gyokeres. Fortunately, we have moved past the phase of selling our main asset.",
      "“However, we remain sensitive to Viktor’s dreams or those of any other athlete. Sporting has made a commitment that, after weeks of meetings, we will not demand the full amount of the clause; we will be reasonable regarding the amount requested for Viktor.\"",
      "Hinting at a potential new price tag, he added: “Today, there is a strong likelihood that he will leave. I won’t disclose the amount, but the player knows what it is. I can say that Viktor will not leave for 60+10m (euros). He won’t leave, absolutely not.",
      "“In recent weeks, we have been paying attention. I saw a player, [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go [potentially to Arsenal] for £55m, and I saw Matheus Cunha move to Manchester United for around £62.5m.",
      "\"We are talking about players who are 26 years old. I believe Viktor could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world, which I don’t believe, as his agent is one of the best in the world.”",
      "In another boost to both Arsenal and United’s hopes that Gyokeres will leave Sporting, the Portuguese champions now appear to be looking to replace him. The Lisbon club have reportedly set their sights on Union Saint-Gilloise striker Franjo Ivanovic in the past week.",
      "As reported by Germanijak.HR, Sporting have lodged a bid of around £17m, which is short of the Belgian club’s valuation of £25.6m. Besiktas and Frankfurt, plus teams in Italy, are also said to be interested in Ivanovic, who netted 20 goals for his side last season.",
      "Sporting landing a striker with a strong goal-scoring record for less than £30m may also help Arsenal and United in their negotiations for Gyokeres, who has been vocal in his frustrations towards the Sporting hierarchy over his price tag until now.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

In May, Bristol Rovers confirmed that the Englishman would be leaving the club following their relegation to the fourth tier.",

Villa ultimately went out, losing 5-4 on aggregate, and Rashford failed to score in either game.",
      "Watkins, meanwhile, was given just 25 minutes across the two legs, as he spent much of the contest on the bench. The striker couldn't hide his frustration in the days following Emery's decision and responded in the best way possible.",
      "\"I played 20 minutes against PSG in both games, so I'm not going to lie - I was fuming I wasn't playing,\" Watkins admitted. \"I let him know that. He's the manager at the end of the day. I respect his decision. But I'm not one of the players happy to sit on the bench.",
      "\"It's something I haven't experienced before, missing out on the biggest stage. You always want to play, especially in the Champions League. Me and a few others are disappointed we didn't start the game, but like I said, it's the manager's decision... Rather than let it hinder you, you have to use that anger as motivation.\"",

      "\"On Tuesday [against PSG], it was difficult for him to read the match and show his power. But he worked, he is ready. I am so, so happy with him, and I want to win tomorrow [away to Manchester City]. As players, they can be sad at not playing or angry at not playing - I prefer angry.\""

With Villa having missed out on Champions League football on the final day of last season, losing 2-0 at United, Watkins is said to be open to a new challenge elsewhere.",
      "It is understood United have held tentative talks with Villa about signing Watkins, who Amorim sees as the ideal player to lead his attack - given his proven goal scoring prowess. Villa would want around £60million for Watkins, who has three years left on his contract, but United are unwilling to pay that much, given his age and lack of resale value.",
      "United were willing to offer Rashford as part of a swap deal involving Watkins, but Villa decided against signing the 27-year-old for £40m once his loan deal was up. One obstacle to United's pursuit of Watkins is their inability to offer European football, following their 1-0 Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in May.",
      "United also need to off-load the likes of Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony to raise money to fund new signings. Watkins signed a new long-term contract with Villa in October 2023, keeping him at the club until 2028.",

      "United sold McTominay to help them comply with profit and sustainability regulations, with his £25.7million fee counting as pure profit on the balance sheet due to his status as an academy player.",
      "But former United coach Benni McCarthy, who worked with McTominay under former boss Erik ten Hag, said it was a major error to sell the 28-year-old, given the form he has shown for Napoli.",
      "“Of course, there are different reasons why you sell homegrown players sometimes,”said McCarthy. “When they go, the profit lets you sign more players.",
      "“Having said that, it was one of the biggest mistakes in football to let him leave. He was born to play for United. Maybe he wasn’t the most technical, but he had fight, and I think it’s what they will get back with Matheus Cunha.",
      "“Scotty was a player that you look for in a dressing room to get you where you want to be. To let him go for what was a small transfer fee was a big shame. I think everyone at the club regrets that decision.”",
      "McCarthy, who left United last summer, also revealed he pushed for United to sign Liverpool forward Cody Gakpo, only for the club's scouting department to veto the move.",
      "“Gakpo was the one that we wanted the most and missed out on,” said McCarthy. “I think he was the first player that we sat down and discussed, and decided that he was the player who would fit in perfectly.",
      "“We knew we could play him alongside Marcus Rashford, when Rashy was really on song in 2022. I think we were so close to getting him. At one stage, it was ours to lose. The agent knew Erik and there were really good talks.",
      "“The manager asked me to write up a profile for the player and to take it to the scouting department, so they knew my opinion. I watched the player, I made my case for why he would be ideal.",
      "“He could play on the left, he could work as a false nine. With him and Rashford we’d have been strong down the middle and on the left.",
      "“Then I was told the scouting department had watched him numerous times and they didn’t rate him. They said the stats weren’t right. For me, with my experience, I know what you need to deliver at a special club.",
      "“You don’t need stats to tell you that. The naked eye gives you so much more than just stats. Obviously the club have a system, and the system won, so he joined Liverpool and won the league.”",

      "It was a mystery as to why a top club hadn't signed Jonathan David, and the striker has finally got his move.",
      "David announced in May that he would be leaving Lille when his contract expired this summer and fans implored Manchester United to make a move.",
      "The 25-year-old has been one of the most prolific strikers in Europe across the last few seasons and Juventus are about to complete a deal that will see him sign on a free transfer.",
      "David scored 109 goals in 232 appearances for Lille, putting him second in the club’s list of all-time top scorers, and he has netted an impressive 34 goals in 63 appearances for Canada.",
      "The striker has been plying his trade in Ligue 1 since 2020, which is probably the weakest division of Europe's top five leagues. However, he has carried his domestic form into the Champions League, finding the back of the net against Juventus, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Liverpool and Feyenoord last season.",
      "United have been linked with David over the last few years, but he was never close to moving to Manchester.",
      "Even though he was never a genuine target for United, his move to Juventus means a top-class striker has been taken off the market as United look to sign a prolific goalscorer.",
      "Victor Osimhen joined Galatasaray on loan for the 2024/25 season and signed a one-year contract extension with Napoli until June 2027 so that his value would be protected during his stint away.",
      "That means Napoli still have some negotiating power when it comes to selling Osimhen after the conclusion of his Galatasaray loan, but every club knows they want to sell him and that has to be a factor in any potential deal.",
      "Napoli were entertaining bids in the region of £70million for Osimhen before talks collapsed with Chelsea last summer and he only turned 26 in December so should be coming into his prime. Yes, Osimhen is a big name and would demand large wages, which goes against Ineos' policy, but he is a prolific centre-forward.",
      "Osimhen scored 37 goals in 41 games for Galatasaray - an undeniably impressive record, even in a weaker division - and he would be the dream centre forward signing for many United fans.",
      "So why hasn't Osimhen found a new club yet? The answer is probably wage demands. They have appeared to be a stumbling block so far in this window in talks with other clubs and United will not break their wage structure.",
      "Having said that, United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League last season and Osimhen would be the perfect solution to Ruben Amorim's biggest problem, so perhaps a compromise could be found.",
      "The longer the transfer window goes on, the more United and Osimhen might need each other and a compromise could possibly be reached.",
      "Osimhen needs a move away, just as much as United need to sign a prolific centre forward."

Also getting hit, crying, getting angry, getting up and moving forward was part of my football training and growth and as a person without a doubt.",
      "“I will not get tired of thanking every club where I was for all that they did for me, Benfica, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Paris Saint Germain and Juventus, for helping me grow as a player and as a person, in every club I was lucky to find good teammates and people from staff (cooks, utilities, physicians, doctors, and all those people that no one sees or knows and work tirelessly to help us) I will never forget you.",

      "Manchester United are prepared to cover a significant percentage of Marcus Rashford's £300k-a-week wages if it means receiving a higher transfer fee.",
      "Former United chief scout Mick Brown told Football Insider: “Man United are open to covering Rashford’s wages. They want to get a decent fee for him, around £40million ideally, but they’re finding it difficult.",
      "“The way they see it, they’re prepared to take a certain amount of losses and could factor a percentage of his wages into that if they get a good fee up front. That might be the only way they get a big offer.",

      "Manchester United still have the bulk of their transfer business to conduct if they are going to hand Ruben Amorim his dream attack force, as was the intention heading into this summer.",
      "Last term, a 15th-placed Premier League finish was as sore as it gets for United, but shifting from one manager to the next involved a level of acceptance of teething problems. What was made obvious was deficiencies in attack, as only four other top-flight teams scored less than Amorim's men with 38 matches played.",
      "This is what prompted the swift payment of Matheus Cunha's £62.5m release clause from Wolves. The scorer of 17 goals in all 2024/25 competitions became the first signing of the summer...",

      "The number a player wears may seem like just a digit stitched onto a kit, but at a club like United, it carries serious weight. Think of the famous No.7 shirt worn by legends such as Cristiano Ronaldo, David Beckham and Eric Cantona. It's not just a number, it’s a legacy...",

But United have been handed an apparent blow in their pursuit for Gyokeres, with the Sporting CP striker said to have reached a \"verbal agreement\" with Premier League rivals Arsenal.",
      "However, an alternative option in Juventus' Dusan Vlahovic may well now be easier to acquire after reports from journalist Fabrizio Romanothat the Serie A giants have agreed a deal for Canadian striker Jonathan David. With Vlahovic only having a year left on his current deal - it looks likely that the Serbian will leave this summer.",

The saga then took another turn when journalist Sacha Tavolieri claimed the Gunners had in fact agreed a five-year deal with Gyokeres' agent.",
      "However, United's hope of hijacking their Premier League rival's move have been bolstered - with Fabrizio Romano revealing his information. Speaking on his YouTube channel, the journalist said: \"There are many rumours that a deal is getting closer between Arsenal and Sporting. I'm told that there are still no changes, no advance negotiations to get a deal done between the clubs.",
      "\"We know Gyokeres and Arsenal have been in discussions for weeks because he is one of the main targets but, at the minute, nothing has been done. The price has to be clarified before Arsenal can agree a deal with Sporting.

      "Things need to change at United and they know it. Steps forward have certainly been made in recent years, with the club looking to follow the lead of their rivals in inserting sell-on clauses into deals that ensure they will profit if those who leave Old Trafford go on to thrive elsewhere.",
      "But the initial fees received when players are sold remain a problem.",

Antony's time at United has been nothing short of a disaster but he has created a market for himself with an impressive loan spell with Real Betis, yet it's the sale of Garnacho that will truly test whether United have changed.",

He is an Argentina international who has already made nearly 150 appearances for United, scoring 26 goals in all competitions. His fallout with Amorim undoubtedly weakens United's hand, but the club are well within their rights to demand more than the £40m they rejected from Napoli back in January.",

      "A free agent who admired Ryan Giggs during his time at Manchester United is reportedly keen to sign for Wrexham.",
      "Tom Lawrence, who came up through United's academy, is currently without a club after his contract with Scottish side Rangers ended last season. The attacking midfielder, a native of Wrexham, was beset by injuries following his transfer from Derby County to Ibrox in 2022.",
      "Despite the challenges, the 31-year-old managed to make 65 appearances and score 11 goals during his three-year spell in Glasgow. He's now seeking a new club, with Wrexham, owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, said to be interested in securing his services.",
      "While Lawrence has reportedly drawn interest from clubs in the Middle East and Turkey, the Mail suggests that the opportunity to play for his hometown team is an attractive one for the Welsh international. The Red Dragons, who secured promotion from League One to the Championship in April, have already signed one local talent in the summer transfer window.",
      "The North Wales club announced the signing of goalkeeper Danny Ward on a two-year contract on Tuesday, following his release from Leicester City. If they manage to land Lawrence, Wrexham would be adding a player who developed his skills under some of the best in the game during his stint at United.",
      "He joined the Red Devils at just seven years old and had the honour of being mentored by legendary United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and players like Paul Scholes, alongside his idol Giggs.",
      "Reflecting on the influence this had on him in an interview last year, Lawrence told The Sun: \"I was at United from the age of seven until I was 20. So the number of figures that helped me out along the way, I couldn't name them all.",
      "\"What I will say is that you looked up to those who were in the first team at the time, the likes of Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes. Coaching-wise Paul McGuinness and Warren Joyce helped me massively.",
      "\"I am really thankful to them all. There were role models everywhere. It was just all about standards, it makes you have those standards from such a young age.\"",
      "He added: \"Sir Alex Ferguson was one for big standards and you couldn't mess up. That grounding never leaves you. When you grow up hearing that you just get used to doing the same high level standard stuff every day. It's instilled in you.\"",
      "Despite spending a significant period at United, Lawrence's opportunities with the first team were scarce, amounting to just one senior appearance in May 2014 against Hull. At that time, Giggs was balancing his duties as United's player-manager when Lawrence played most of the match.",
      "In a touching moment, Giggs substituted Lawrence off the field with 20 minutes remaining, signalling his own final appearance for United.",
      "Lawrence said: \"He was a big hero growing up, there were a few of them. But he gave me my Manchester United debut so I'll be forever grateful. Nothing will ever come close to that.",
      "\"I had been out on loan and got recalled. I played a game at Anfield for the under-21s and I played well. The first team played a few days later and I got a call to say I was in the squad.",
      "\"We went to the hotel and later that day he told me I was starting. I went back to my room and told my family and they all came up.\""

      "Chelsea paid a £5million penalty charge to Manchester United to break their agreement to sign Sancho on a permanent transfer, meaning the winger needs to find a new club in the summer window.",
      "Fenerbahce was suggested as a potential destination for Sancho and a move to Turkey would confirm his spectacular fall from grace.",
      "Juventus would clearly be a more appealing option. The Italian side are not the force of years past, but they remain a huge European club and Turin is an attractive city for footballers.",
      "And reports have claimed Juventus are interested in signing Sancho on a permanent basis, and they are open to negotiating a swap deal involving a few players from their dressing room.",
      "Dusan Vlahovic, Timothy Weah and Douglas Luiz have been named as potential makeweights in a deal, although it would only make sense for United to consider Vlahovic and Luiz.",
      "Weah plays on the right wing and Ruben Amorim does not need another player in that position. Weah is also not good enough for United. On the other hand, Vlahovic is a striker and central midfielder Luiz impressed when he played in the Premier League for Aston Villa.",
      "Vlahovic was tipped to become one of Europe's finest goalscorers when he signed for Juventus in 2022, but the Serbian hasn't quite lived up to expectations, despite having a respectable record in front of goal.",
      "He would still provide more value at Old Trafford than Sancho and would offer a presence at the focal point of the attack, which has been a problem with Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "Vlahovic would not be a hugely exciting signing, but fans wouldn't turn their noses up if he arrived as part of a swap deal for Sancho, whose time in Manchester has been up since September 2023.",
      "A potential deal with Juventus would be a relatively straightforward solution, killing two birds with one stone - bringing in a striker to strengthen the attack and getting rid of Sancho.",
      "If a swap deal did materialise, though, perhaps it would be logical for Luiz to be included, not Vlahovic, because United also need a player in that position after a mixed first season for Manuel Ugarte.",
      "United are targeting a top-six finish in the Premier League next term, so can they achieve that with Ugarte and Bruno Fernandes starting the majority of games in midfield? It feels unlikely.",
      "Ugarte delivered hit-and-miss performances during his debut season in Manchester and Luiz could be an upgrade. The Brazilian contributed 10 goals and 10 assists in 2023/24 for Aston Villa and Villa Park chiefs only sanctioned his move to Juventus to comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Luiz is a box-to-box midfielder and could be the ideal foil for Fernandes. He would be able to offer adequate defensive cover and the kind of energy that Amorim wants from his players.",
      "United need to get rid of Sancho, who has another year remaining on his contract, and a potential swap deal with Juventus would tick a lot of boxes if the right deal structure could be agreed.",
      "Vlahovic and Luiz are certainly not deadwood and could be valuable additions. Getting Sancho off the books at the same time would make a lot of sense."

I think our position is he had an unbelievable season last year and we expected interest in him. If that deal is right, then there's a deal to do, but if not, then he'll stay.\"",
      "When Brentford's sporting director, Phil Giles, sat down to offer an update on Bryan Mbeumo's situation, it's clear he was keen to stress that the Cameroon international would be happy to remain at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Mbeumo's desire to move to Manchester United has been well documented, and so Giles' update focused more on the player's mindset should an agreement between the two clubs not be reached. And United should be encouraged by the update.",
      "Far too often, we see examples of players taking matters into their own hands and attempting to force a move away from a club.",
      "Take Antony, for example. He is by no means the only player to have adopted such a strategy, but his refusal to train or play for Ajax prior to his move to United in 2022 was a red flag before he had even stepped foot inside Old Trafford.",
      "United were said to have been impressed by the \"attitude\" Antony had shown to sign for the club, but there was nothing impressive about it.",
      "He would apologise just days later, insisting he was sorry if he had \"failed\" the fans. Attitude is as important as ability when it comes to representing a club of United's stature, and you can tell a lot about a player from the manner of their exit from a club.",
      "Antony may have forced his way out of Ajax but he has shown little to suggest he has what it takes to force his way back into United's plans and he is on the club's list of priority sales this summer.",
      "It would be remiss to imply Antony's failure to live up to his £86m price tag was purely down to his attitude. The Brazilian has struggled to showcase his talents in the Premier League, with the slower pace of La Liga unsurprisingly bringing out the best in him while on loan at Real Betis.",
      "But goading a Championship team, having thrown away a three-goal lead and scraped past them in an FA Cup semi-final on penalties, and showboating against FC Sheriff with the score locked at 0-0 aren't examples of the attitude needed to play for a club like Manchester United.",
      "Brentford know there is a deal to be done for Mbeumo and they are well within their rights to hold firm until their valuation is met. The ball is in United's court on that front.",
      "But do they risk being saddled with an unhappy player if they refuse to sanction his exit? It certainly doesn't seem like it.",
      "Brentford were the club that brought Mbeumo to England and gave him the opportunity to be linked with a club like United. They are the club that pays his wages and respect should be shown.",
      "Mbeumo has every right to want to move to United, but there's a right way and a wrong way to go about it.",
      "He is doing things the right way, and that is good news for United."

      "Benni McCarthy has revealed that Jadon Sancho was misunderstood at Manchester United, with his shyness behind the scenes being mistaken for a bad attitude.",
      "Sancho was signed for £73million from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 after a lengthy transfer saga. But he never managed to show the same consistency he had displayed in Germany at Old Trafford, scoring just 12 goals throughout his miserable time with the club.",
      "In September 2023, he fell out with then-Red Devils manager Erik ten Hag over his application in training and refused to apologise for hitting out against the Dutchman's claim on social media, which led to him being frozen out of the first-team squad.",
      "It resulted in the 25-year-old being sent out on two consecutive loan spells, initially to Dortmund and then to Chelsea last season, where he failed to set Stamford Bridge alight but scored in the Europa Conference League final win. The Blues decided at the end of the 2024/25 season to pay United a £5m fee instead of signing the winger permanently for £25m.",
      "And current United boss Ruben Amorim has shown no indication of wanting to reintegrate the Englishman, meaning he is likely to depart this summer as a failed signing.",
      "Now, McCarthy, who worked under Ten Hag as a first-team coach for two years between the summer of 2022 and 2024, has defended Sancho’s character. The South African, now manager of the Kenya national team, says Sancho wasn’t the most sociable team-mate at United and would often head straight home after training, which may have been misconstrued from the outside.",
      "McCarthy told betonlinepromocodes.com: “I couldn’t fault Jadon in training. He brings unbelievable quality, ability and skills. He can make you stop in awe and ask yourself just how he can do things. He brought unmatched quality.",
      "“I think what didn’t help Jadon was that he’s a very closed-off person. He keeps to himself, and from the outside it looked like he wasn’t trying to make friends with his team-mates. He might not have joked around but really he was just quiet, and I don’t think you should judge players on who he gets on with or not.",
      "“Based on his ability and craft, I never saw any problems in his relationships. He was quiet-natured, and so when training is done, he doesn’t stay to talk, he heads home. He’s very private. I think a bit of an introvert, which isn’t the opinion he gets branded with in the press.\"",
      "However, he went on to comment on Sancho’s main issue with consistency, saying: “I think that when it came to Erik, he wanted to see Jadon at his best everyday. Monday to Friday, no days off. I think that’s what the manager would expect from his players, and so it’s up to the players to give it to him. If you can’t do that, you’re going to have problems, and I think the differences and problems then surfaced.",
      "“For me, I don’t have a bad thing to say about Jadon. I loved him, he was unbelievable, sometimes he was unplayable. I don’t want to rush to judgement on players if they’re reserved.”",
      "Sancho could finally get his permanent move away from Manchester this summer. Transfer journalist Fabrizio Romano wrote for GiveMeSport that Serie A giants Juventus have no problem meeting United's asking price for Sancho, believed to be in the region of £25m.",
      "But the Old Lady are not willing to match his eye-watering wage demands of over £300,000-per-week as talks continue with his representatives. The same report added that Juve are prepared to offer as many as three players in order to complete a deal for the United outcast.",
      "It's claimed that the Italians have offered Douglas Luiz, Tim Weah and Dusan Vlahovic to sweeten a deal for Sancho. United reportedly have not yet responded to that proposal and could prefer straight cash amid attempts to boost Amorim's budget."

      "McTominay's excellent performances have made some supporters question whether it was the right decision to sell him, and McCarthy thinks it was a huge mistake.",
      "McCarthy was part of Erik ten Hag's backroom staff and said: \"Of course, there are different reasons why you sell homegrown players sometimes. When they go, the profit lets you sign more players.",

He could play on the left, he could work as a false nine. With him and Rashford we’d have been strong down the middle and on the left.",

      "It is believed United hold a 20% sell-on clause on any transfer for Elanga meaning they will be entitled to 20% of any profit Forest make on the player.",
      "Should Forest sell Elanga for £50million, they will make a £35million profit on their £15million investment from two years ago.",
      "It means United would pocket £7million and that would go towards their own transfer business this summer.",
      "Having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5million from Wolves, United are also keen to sign Bryan Mbeumo, a new forward and potentially a new goalkeeper, midfielder and wing-back.",
      "To do that, they must recoup some funds and while £7million won't solely buy a new player, it is a helpful amount towards sealing any future transfer business this summer."

      "Mbeumo, the Cameroon international, has made it clear he wants to join Utd, but talks between the clubs have been slow and complex.",
      "Utd’s initial offer of £45 million plus £10 million in add-ons was rejected, and a second bid of £55 million plus £7.5 million in add-ons also failed to meet Brentford’s valuation.",
      "The west London club believe Mbeumo’s worth exceeds the amount the Red Devils recently paid for Matheus Cunha, intensifying the standoff. Cunha’s £62.5 million transfer clause was triggered in June, and the fee will be paid to Wolves over two years.",

      "“So constant contacts between the two clubs to reach an agreement for Bryan Mbeumo. There is still no here we go, but may United keep working on that, United keep advancing, United keep their confidence and their optimism to make the deal happen.”",

      "Mbeumo’s Premier League statistics underline why United are so keen to sign him. The 25-year-old finished last season as Brentford’s top scorer with 20 goals in 38 appearances, leading the squad in key passes per game and match ratings.",
      "His ability to unlock defences with pace and precision has made him one of the league’s most dangerous forwards.",
      "Although there’s growing hope he could line up in a Brentford shirt next season, the club is preparing for the possibility that their star player will leave this summer. The financial realities facing the Bees, combined with Mbeumo’s desire to play on a bigger stage, suggest the transfer could be imminent.",

      "But the former forward also pinpointed a key issue: Sancho’s reserved nature off the pitch, which may have given Erik ten Hag and his Utd team-mates the wrong impression.",
      "“I think what didn’t help Jadon was that he’s a very closed-off person. He keeps to himself, and from the outside it looked like he wasn’t trying to make friends with his team-mates.",
      "He might not have joked around but really he was just quiet, and I don’t think you should judge players on who he gets on with or not.”",
      "McCarthy emphasized that the winger’s quiet personality shouldn’t overshadow his talent or work ethic.",
      "“Based on his ability and craft, I never saw any problems in his relationships. He was quiet-natured, and so when training is done, he doesn’t stay to talk, he heads home. He’s very private. I think a bit of an introvert, which isn’t the opinion he gets branded with in the press.”",
      "But when it came to consistency, McCarthy explained where the cracks began to appear.",
      "“I think that when it came to Erik, he wanted to see Jadon at his best every day. Monday to Friday, no days off. I think that’s what the manager would expect from his players, and so it’s up to the players to give it to him. If you can’t do that, you’re going to have problems, and I think the differences and problems then surfaced.”",
      "Despite the difficulties, McCarthy reserved praise for Sancho’s moments of brilliance.",
      "“For me, I don’t have a bad thing to say about Jadon. I loved him; he was unbelievable, sometimes he was unplayable. I don’t want to rush to judgement on players if they’re reserved.”",

      "18) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThe story goes that Gyokeres has told United he’s up for joining them now Arsenal seem to be veering in Sesko’s direction. If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites.",
      "",
      "17) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "16) Mohammed Kudus – West Ham to Tottenham\nSpurs have apparently cooled their interest in Eberechi Eze to prioritise a move for Kudus, who has an £85million clause active for the first 10 days of July. But the feeling is West Ham would be open to offers in the region of £60million since they need to generate whatever they wish to spend this summer. Not £50million, which was apparently Spurs’ opening low-ball offer.",
      "",
      "15) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",
      "",
      "14) Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Bayern Munich\nWhen you scratch the surface of the reports of Bayern’s interest, it seems Rashford makes only their ‘longlist’ of targets. And it seems a similar story at Barcelona. So if Rashford is to get his big move to a European club in contention for titles, it almost certainly won’t be until late in the window by which time United will have been backed into a corner.",
      "",
      "13) 🔼 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nUnited are focused on Mbeumo right now and, apparently, multi-tasking is beyond the Old Trafford execs. They have, though, managed to pick up the phone to Villa to initiate a conversation about Watkins while they suss out their striker options. Most of which depend on selling their wantaway stars. But reports this week suggest Watkins is now at the top of their striker list.",
      "",
      "12) Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nAnother we reckon is buried rather deep on Arsenal’s list of targets, somewhere behind Eberechi Eze, Nico Williams and Rodrygo, but Madueke has already been the subject of a bid, apparently.",
      "",
      "11) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nThe stumbling block around any move for Sancho is always going to be the enormous salary that Manchester United are contracted to pay him for another year. Juve cannot afford those sums, but they seem to be serious about finding a solution. If they do, Sancho should be thanking his lucky stars.",

      "",
      "9) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Something over £17million ought to do the trick since Mosquera is out of contract in a year.",
      "",
      "8) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nLiverpool need rid of Nunez if they are to create room in their squad and budget for another forward. Napoli want to take him, but not on Liverpool’s terms, which start at around £55million. Frankly, that’s a nonsense fee, but Liverpool have cast spells in the market this summer. Regardless, Napoli want some clarity on the matter in the coming days before they move for a much cheaper alternative. We can see this happening, probably with big add-ons.",
      "",
      "7) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more before a deal is done next week.",
      "",
      "6) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nIt’s widely reported that Arsenal met with Eze’s representatives over the weekend. The next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full. Quite right too.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited had their second offer rejected by Brentford but that isn’t likely to be the end of it. The Bees turned their noses up at £55million plus £7.5million in add-ons, insisting on the total amount up front. United don’t want to be screwed for the 427th time but the gap appears small enough to be bridged, especially since Mbeumo has told Brentford he only wants United. Reports suggest United are confident of getting a deal before next week.",
      "",
      "4) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nThe Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres and Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19. It’s looking very positive on that front…",
      "",
      "3) Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea\nA fee has finally been agreed. It’s not confirmed how much Chelsea will pay for Gittens but it should be between £45-50m. After Fabrice Hawkins broke the news, Fabrizio Romano gave it the Here We Go.",

      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. The Bees say they expect this to go through and their skipper will go with their best wishes.",

      "There’s not so much talk over moves for wing-backs, which feels odd given Amorim’s reliance on them in his 3-4-3 system, though the news that Dumfries is available for just €25m [£21m] should light a fire under United’s recruitment team.",

      "In a week in which Chelsea have signed Joao Pedro from Brighton as Manchester United decide whether to overpay for Bryan Mbeumo while Tottenham and Arsenal make plays for Mohammed Kudus and Eberechi Eze, we’re faced with two troubling realities: one old, one new.",
      "Big Six clubs poaching the best of the rest has been commonplace for at least the last two decades. But this summer does feel particularly poignant in what has been a 21st century Premier League d*ck-measuring contest given the sheer number of these pillagings and because two of the raiders were worse last season than the teams they’re looting: United finished 14 points behind Brentford; Tottenham finished five points behind West Ham.",
      "It doesn’t seem fair, but then neither does the Small 14 being able to plunder potential future Big Six stars from every other club in Europe outside your Real Madrids, Barcelonas and Bayern Munichs.",
      "All of these players being targeted by the top (or formerly top) Premier League clubs are of a type. Managers, sporting directors, whoever’s making key decisions at football clubs these days, want forwards whose first thought is to dribble rather than pass. Matheus Cunha is another example and we suspect interest in Anthony Gordon and Morgan Rogers isn’t about to go away any time soon for the very same reason.",
      "The desire to have these sorts of footballers in top teams isn’t what’s troubling – the opposite if anything. Who doesn’t want to see Eze or Kudus diddling defenders with the ball at their feet before letting fly from 25 yards? Yes please. It’s the impact of what’s clearly becoming a bit of an obsession on your classic playmaker that’s disturbing.",
      "It’s the guys who have a picture in their head before the ball comes to them in a tight space and manoeuvre away from a defender before delivering a killer through ball, rather than drifting past or barrelling through them, that we’re concerned for. We’re looking at you, Martin Odegaard. And you, Bruno Fernandes.",
      "We’re of course looking forward to the irony of Manchester United turning down £100m from the Saudi Pro League for their 30-year-old captain in the summer when by Christmas, after a year of Ruben Amorim trying to fit Fernandes into his entirely unsuited system, he’s sitting on the bench watching Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro in the pivot with Mbeumo and Cunha ahead of them as his value plummets, but we would much rather be watching a United team with Fernandes in it.",
      "We got a taste of what Arsenal would be like without Odegaard last season – both when he was and wasn’t injured, as he wasn’t the same Odegaard we enjoyed the season before – and it wasn’t pretty. It was robotic. We knew what each and every player was going to do on that pitch before they did it.",
      "MORE ARSENAL COVERAGE ON F365…\n👉 Arsenal now ‘well advanced’ on £68m fifth signing from PL club as next three targets are named\n👉 Arsenal get huge boost over ‘dream target’ as £75m transfer takes shape after exit update\n👉 Advantage Spurs in north London with one Arsenal star ‘jealous’ amid new Gyokeres ‘blow’",
      "We like a bit of that. We like that full-backs essentially know Bukayo Saka is going to run at them, jink inside and get a shot away because them being powerless to stop him is a thoroughly enjoyable display of his brilliance. But we would also like some mystery, some guile, some head-on-a-swivel-how-the-f***-did-he-see-and-play-that-pass stuff.",
      "Odegaard must be concerned by Arsenal’s push for Eze; aware of the turning tide away from players like him as we are. It would have been unthinkable a year ago to imagine an Arsenal side without Odegaard, but amid this increasing desire for players who dribble past opponents to create overloads after a very poor season by his standards, there won’t be too many surprised to see a midfield three of Martin Zubimendi, Declan Rice and Eberechi Eze next term.",
      "Hope for the future is retained in the hybrids – your Cole Palmers, Morgan Gibbs-Whites and Florian Wirtzs – who can dribble with the best of them but whose eye for a pass sets them apart.",
      "But in a season in which Odegaard and Fernandes could lose their formerly nailed-on places we may be left thinking wistfully of Cesc Fabregas and David Silva, and wondering whether their regens will ever again be given the opportunity in a Premier League now valuing forward mobility over subtle craft.",
      "Teddy Sheringham has praised Bruno Fernandes for staying at “big club” Manchester United while they “aren’t at the top of their game.”",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.7bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "England fans were so unimpressed by the drab win over Andorra that only two people wrote in about it – more were interested in defending Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been eviscerated in the Mailbox but there is plenty of time and space to thank Ange Postecoglou for making Spurs interesting again.",

      "Who’s the dream signing for every Premier League club? We’re all over it.",
      "From Rodrygo heading to Arsenal to Alexander Isak eyeing Liverpool, these potential transfers might sound ambitious — but they’re far from impossible.",
      "",
      "Arsenal: Rodrygo\n‘Dream’ signings should really involve players not already trying to force through a move, which rules out Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal, for example. That makes the signing of an elite left-winger the dreamiest of scenarios, and Real Madrid superstar Rodrygo is our pick over Athletic Bilbao’s Nico Williams.",
      "Rodrygo was an unused substitute in Madrid’s Club World Cup last-16 win over Juventus, making it one start out of a possible four and just 88 minutes played in the United States. This saga should rumble on into the closing weeks of the transfer window, but Arsenal are there and ready to pounce for a genuinely outstanding forward. Rodrygo can take this lot to the next level.",
      "READ: FAO Arsenal and Liverpool: the biggest signings take longer because of secret clauses and Zaha",
      "",
      "Aston Villa: Rafael Leao\nA slight downgrade on Rodrygo – but still a fantastic and dangerous winger – Leao looks increasingly likely to leave AC Milan this summer. With Chelsea signing Jamie Gittens, and Arsenal and Liverpool targeting other options, the Portuguese international might just settle on a slightly less ambitious move to Aston Villa.",
      "The Villans are hardly lacking ambition themselves and could feasibly qualify for the Champions League in 2025/26 after narrowly missing out last season. That, combined with the lure of the Premier League, could tempt Leao into making the surprise switch to Villa Park.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth: Jorrel Hato\nWe wanted to somehow include Ajax wonderkid Hato joining a non-Big Six club. He’s wanted by Europe’s elite, with Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal in the picture.",
      "Bournemouth are absolutely not in the picture, but that’s not to say it’s a completely unrealistic transfer. Hato could view the Cherries as a perfect stepping stone to the really big time. Dean Huijsen says hello. Milos Kerkez says hey. Illia Zabarnyi also says hi, amidst interest from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Andoni Iraola is a superb manager for any young, ambitious player and is desperate for a new centre-back after selling Huijsen to Real Madrid. Furthermore, Hato can play right or left-back, and Iraola has just lost Milos Kerkez – albeit he has signed a replacement in Adrien Truffert – while an ancient Adam Smith remains his first-choice right-back.",
      "",
      "Brentford: Bryan Mbeumo\nHe’s better than anyone they could get, and that’s the bottom line. Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last season; only Mohamed Salah, Erling Haaland and Alexander Isak scored more.",
      "Mbeumo is wanted by Manchester United, but there’s no agreement between the two clubs. The Cameroonian winger isn’t causing a fuss and is open to staying at Brentford if a deal can’t be struck, with the Red Devils already failing with two bids. He’s probably playing the long game, knowing he can leave for less next summer or for nothing in 2027, with a tasty signing-on bonus and salary.",
      "",
      "Brighton: Harvey Elliott\nElliott to Brighton felt pretty realistic but all of a sudden, it would be a major coup for Fabian Hurzeler’s side. There are Champions League clubs in the mix after an immense Under-21 European Championship-winning campaign with England.",
      "He just feels very Brighton, doesn’t he? And £40m would be a very good deal for everyone involved. With a buy-back clause, obviously.",
      "",
      "Burnley: Bilal El Khannouss\nBurnley will forever be the most awkward team in our ‘one per club’ features. That’s painfully obvious once again, with El Khannouss deemed the best and most ambitious signing they could realistically make this summer.",
      "Would signing El Khannouss from Leicester be a dream come true for Burnley? Well…no. But what would feasibly be a ‘dream signing’ for the Clarets that could actually happen? We’re hardly going to say Lionel Messi or Neymar. Their fans would probably be beside themselves with the signing of Lewis Cook, to be honest.",
      "",
      "Chelsea: Marc Guehi\nThe Blues have finally strengthened up front, signing Liam Delap for £30million and agreeing a deal for Brighton’s Joao Pedro. So, looking at their strongest XI, a central defender is clearly the next priority.",
      "Enter Guehi. We initially focused on a left-footed centre-back, overlooking the fact that Levi Colwill exists, and went with Inter’s Alessandro Bastoni. But Guehi and Colwill would make a more natural defensive partnership.",
      "Chelsea sold Guehi to Crystal Palace for £18m in July 2021 and have been linked with him quite a bit since then, the fools that they are. This would be a hilariously typical Blues signing but a fantastic one that would massively benefit them and England.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace: Ousmane Diomande\nThis one is actually on. On like Donkey Kong.",
      "Oliver Glasner wants a new centre-back with Marc Guehi attracting serious interest, and Sporting’s Diomande is right at the top of his wish-list. We like it. We like it a lot.",
      "A dominant presence with pace, power and a ridiculous ceiling, Diomande would be a statement signing.",
      "",
      "Everton: Mohammed Kudus\nExtending Jarrad Branthwaite’s contract is huge for Everton, who have a pretty settled centre-back partnership in the 23-year-old and James Tarkowski. A couple of full-backs wouldn’t go amiss, but hardly ‘dreamy’. David Moyes could also do with a new defensive midfielder, but we reckon an X-factor on the right wing would make the biggest difference, especially with Villarreal striker Thierno Barry set to join and Iliman Ndiaye leading the Toffees’ attack in 2024/25.",
      "Picking between Mohammed Kudus, Johan Bakayoko and Antonio Nusa was tough. Ultimately, we went for Kudus, who might have to swallow his pride to agree a move from West Ham to Everton.",
      "He’s been linked with Tottenham, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, but it’s unclear how keen those big boys really are after a season with just five goals and three assists in the Premier League. For the Toffees, though, playing under his former manager Moyes, Kudus could thrive and help the club kick off their new era at the Hill Dickinson Stadium in style.",
      "",
      "Fulham: Ivan Toney\nWillian was tempting, you know, for s**ts and giggles, but Toney to Fulham feels just realistic and ambitious enough to qualify as a ‘dream signing’.",
      "Toney might have been disappointed to end up at Saudi club Al Ahly last summer, but his bank account certainly wasn’t. That said, he could easily follow the growing trend of players ditching the Saudi Pro League after a year – or six months in Jhon Duran’s case.",
      "The obvious stumbling block is his current salary, which no Premier League club will match. But if Toney’s willing to take a modest pay cut, he could do a lot worse than Fulham…and Fulham would struggle to do much better than Toney.",
      "",
      "Leeds United: Christian Pulisic\nSigning Christian Pulisic would be a real statement from Leeds’ new American owners.",
      "The Whites need a Raphinha-style forward to help them survive in the Premier League and avoid the fate of the last six promoted clubs. They’re well equipped to stay up, but only if their summer recruitment hits the mark.",
      "A Raphinha return would be ridiculous to suggest, but splashing the cash to bring Pulisic back to England after an inconsistent Chelsea spell would be a transfer masterstroke. Crucially, it’s not completely out of the question.",
      "‘The LeBron James of Soccer’ has 55 goal involvements in two seasons for AC Milan and boasts an impressive international record with 33 goals in 78 caps.",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Alexander Isak\nThis transfer is unrealistic, mainly because of Newcastle United’s eye-watering asking price. But there is an asking price. If Liverpool decide Isak is worth £130m, they’ll get him. Simple as that.",
      "The Reds have already smashed their record transfer fee this summer with Florian Wirtz, and after being stingy in recent windows, they’re clearly ready to spend big now, especially after realising they’ve replaced Jurgen Klopp with an elite, title-winning head coach.",
      "Having already signed an attacking midfielder, right-back, and left-back, Liverpool’s priority is now moving on Darwin Nunez and bringing in a ready-made replacement. Interest in Isak is genuine (and terrifying) for Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, and most of all Newcastle, who are understandably reluctant to lose a player who’s scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances.",
      "But when money talks, £130m+ will be impossible to turn down.",
      "MORE: Isak, Newcastle know what happens when clubs ‘break’, ‘bend’, ‘smash’, ‘dismantle’ or ‘rip up’ wage structure",
      "",
      "Manchester City: Gianluigi Donnarumma\nA new goalkeeper feels like the next natural upgrade for City. Ederson’s reliability has dipped, and while Donnarumma isn’t quite as comfortable with the ball at his feet, he’d be a fantastic replacement.",
      "The Italian is expected to extend his PSG contract, but as it stands, his deal runs out in 2026, and Pep Guardiola is keeping an eye on things.",
      "Ederson continues to attract interest from Saudi Arabia and fittingly made a howler in a Club World Cup win over Juventus just hours after insisting he wanted to stay. It might not be your call, fella.",
      "Donnarumma is the best possible replacement. He’s only 26, a Champions League-winning goalkeeper, and already a veteran. Every other Premier League club will be hoping City don’t pull this off.",
      "",
      "Manchester United: Viktor Gyokeres\nThis one hinges on an extremely ambitious (or unrealistic) hijack of Arsenal’s pursuit of Gyokeres or the Gunners deciding to move on and go full Sesko instead.",
      "After scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season, Gyokeres is a wanted man. United’s interest seems doomed to failure as the striker waits for Arsenal to pull the trigger, but with his old boss Ruben Amorim now at Old Trafford, there’s just enough hope to keep the delusion alive.",
      "United are desperate for an actual goalscorer. Rasmus Hojlund clearly isn’t that. And nobody knows what Joshua Zirkzee even is.",
      "United would undoubtedly find a way to United all over Gyokeres’ output, but even if he bags half of last season’s total, he’d still be a colossal upgrade on what Amorim currently has to work with.",
      "",
      "Newcastle United: Raphinha\nSince leaving Leeds United in 2022, Raphinha has been furiously linked with a move away from Barcelona. Arsenal and Chelsea have been mentioned plenty, but Newcastle are very much in the picture. As are Manchester United; but only for clicks.",
      "Raphinha has been in Ballon d’Or form for Barca but won’t be thrilled watching his bosses chase Nico Williams and Liverpool’s Luis Diaz. Competition’s healthy, sure, but the 28-year-old will be wondering why they’re bothering after him and Lamine Yamal combined for 102 goal involvements in 2024/25.",
      "With Barca targeting a left-winger, Raphinha could be on the move. Newcastle desperately need a right-winger, and the Brazilian would be a genuinely sensational signing, even if he turns 29 this December and would cost a fortune.",
      "It’s about time these rich f**kers went out and signed a world-class, world-renowned superstar. We’ve been waiting since the day they were bought by PIF.",
      "",
      "Nottingham Forest: Dusan Vlahovic\nNuno Espirito Santo’s side are the surprise frontrunners for Vlahovic’s signature, with Juventus reportedly open to selling him for around £40m.",
      "That would have been incomprehensible this time last year – but with Forest heading for Europe and Vlahovic struggling in Italy, it suddenly feels very realistic. The Serbian has been offered to Manchester United and former suitors Arsenal, but neither have batted an eyelid. That says plenty, especially about the former.",
      "Chris Wood has been a fantastic player for Forest, but he turns 34 in December and scored just twice in his last 11 Premier League appearances in 2024/25 as his side bottled Champions League football. Vlahovic has similar physical attributes, is eight years younger, and still has the potential to become one of Europe’s best strikers.",
      "",
      "Sunderland: Gustavo Hamer\nWe’re back in familiar territory: the Burnley conundrum. Sunderland have already made two excellent, and expensive, signings in Habib Diarra and Enzo Le Fee, so splashing out again might seem excessive. But improving their attack should still be the priority.",
      "Promoted clubs need a forward capable of winning games on their own – but short of that, they could do a lot worse than Hamer. He went down with Sheffield United last year, but this would be a top-class addition.",
      "",
      "Tottenham: Xavi Simons\nA game-changing forward is exactly what Spurs need, with Harry Kane long gone and Heung-min Son’s world-class ability also nowhere to be seen.",
      "Kudus has been strongly linked, and new Spurs boss Thomas Frank reportedly wants to reunite with Mbeumo, but the prospect of a world-class talent arriving from abroad is too good to ignore. A Rodrygo hijack would be sexy, but RB Leipzig attacker Simons is our man for Spurs.",
      "He’s one of the best available players around and can operate as an attacking midfielder or on either wing. We’d love to see him in the Premier League, and Spurs would benefit massively from making it happen.",
      "",
      "West Ham: Piero Hincapie\nGraham Potter wants to rebuild this West Ham squad using the Kudus funds, a year after Julen Lopetegui did the same with signings that felt ambitious at the time but quickly became questionable at best.",
      "An elite centre-back accustomed to playing in a back three would be absolutely perfect, though the Hammers also need reinforcements up front and in central midfield.",
      "Hincapie is an outstanding talent, and Bayer Leverkusen will want a huge fee. The 23-year-old Ecuadorian has been linked with plenty of big clubs, but the clout mid-table Premier League sides now carry has never been stronger. This would potentially go down as the signing of the summer.",
      "",
      "Wolves: Ademola Lookman\nLookman seems destined for a Premier League return after a previously miserable time representing Everton, Fulham and Leicester City. He is the personification of ‘unfinished business’.",
      "With Matheus Cunha gone, Wolves need a versatile, take-the-game-by-the-scruff-of-the-neck forward. Lookman could be that guy – but he won’t come cheap from Atalanta.",
      "Transfermarkt value the 27-year-old at €60m (£51.5m), which is slightly less than Cunha fetched from Manchester United. Wolves have been pretty reluctant to spend big in recent years due to the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules, but could find themselves in relegation bother if their former talisman isn’t properly replaced.",
      "The prospect of finally shining in Our League could tempt Lookman to push for the move, which could play into Wolves’ hands.",

It literally happens to everyone. Not just United. Liverpool with Allison and VVD who were obvious bargains now but at the time everyone thought we’d over paid. City with Robinho, Mangala, Grealish. Chelsea have about 600 of them. Arsenal with Pepe and a few others.",

The Everton story is well known – whilst trying to break into the top 4 we ended up overpaying for players and giving them long contracts on high wages. Then one of our most effective players got suspended over sexual allegations, results on the pitch didn’t go our way, and we ended up getting through managers quite quickly.",
      "Years of financial problems then followed because we had a load of deadwood in the squad that we couldn’t offload because of their high wages…….so quite a similar story to the Man United of recent years.",
      "But things are not equal. The lure of playing for Manchester United is still greater than playing for the other 14. Thanks to their loyal support base Man U’s revenue is so great that they can afford to pay the Man U tax and even make duff transfers.",

Everton have sorted out their problems and the future is looking bright – in my view this puts them years ahead of Man Utd. But players will still choose to play for Man United if given the choice.

You quite rightly declined to publish it, because I started to regret it before it was even clear you’d binned it, as my confidence began to unravel.",
      "Mbeumo was clearly a transfer that had to be accomplished fast. If we wanted to sign him — and his fbRef page shows why he could be incredible for us — we should have offered Brentford their asking price on day one of the window and figured out a way of working him into the wage structure.",
      "Lowballing them made it a public spectacle and got Manchester United and Spurs involved, costing us what my nephew (the most informed supporter I personally know in the US) called “the perfect player for us, for Howe.” But at least we didn’t over-pay.",

James, however, suggests that Eddie and his son are in charge and emphatically the problem, and if he’s right in his facts, he’s right in his opinion. The board would be/are mad to put him in charge of such decisions and the strategies that they require.",

Besides the Cup and two UCL spots, the only other person between the Board and the squad is General Manager Jamie Reuben, hardly a man used to swimming these waters.

Mitchell may have had beef with Howe, but it was the Board’s responsibility to manage that. Darren Eales reportedly stepped down as CEO — he’s still technically in office until a replacement is named — after a leukemia diagnosis, which can hardly be blamed on the Board. But his effective absence is fast becoming a disaster. If Eddie and his boy are the only people left standing, we may be effed for this summer.",

Liverpool will have spent 60m on Quansah’s replacement, and then lose 25 million (the buy back fee minus the original transfer fee received by Liverpool) bringing him back. That’s already 85 million pounds wasted, before you take into account the 150k a week salary they are lumbered with for the next five years.",
      "In total, replacing Quansah with Guehi and the then buying Quansah back would cost Liverpool up to 121 million pounds.

      "Arsenal usually don’t sign players in June maybe because of paying those wages earlier on.",
      "However, still talking about wages I see many Arsenal fans moaning about how much players earn with us. And I am wondering if that wasn’t the reason we moved to the Emirates in the first place.",
      "Have we forgotten in such a a hurry Nasri, Sagna, Clichy, Cole and RvP left us because we weren’t paying enough.",
      "If we don’t pay them enough, other clubs would easily pay them as much or isn’t that the case?",

      "They’re also making moves to sign a new central midfielder, with Inter Milan pair Davide Frattesi and Hakan Calhanoglu on their radar along with Paris Saint-Germain’s Fabian Ruiz to replace Christian Eriksen.",
      "But any further moves to bolster Amorim’s squad will require player sales after United failed to qualify for Europe, and the club is struggling to offload big-name stars to fund a rebuild.",
      "Marcus Rashford has been sent back to United from his Aston Villa loan having made it clear he wants to play Champions League football next season, ideally for Barcelona.",
      "But the Catalans are on the verge of a deal for Nico Williams and are unlikely to find the money required for Rashford amid their own financial struggles.",
      "There’s hope Bayern Munich may launch a bid for the England international, although the United bosses are thought to be coming to terms with the possibility of having to send Rashford out on loan again while subsidising his wages.",
      "Jadon Sancho has attracted interest from Napoli and Fenerbahce having been sent back to United from Chelsea, but it’s now reportedly Juventus who are pushing to sign the winger, with the Old Lady said to be offering the Premier League side three players in swap talks.",

      "Napoli were keen but they’ve gone quiet, as have Chelsea, who have been linked with the Argentinian since last summer, and United are clearly concerned.",
      "After a report last week claimed United are ready to slash their asking price for the 21-year-old from £70m to £45m to force his transfer, GIVEMESPORT claim ‘intermediaries on behalf of United are checking in to see whether the Blues are still considering a move’ for Garnacho as ‘Old Trafford officials are aware of Chelsea’s spending spree’.",
      "The Blues have signed Liam Delap and Joao Pedro for a combined £85m and have also reportedly agreed a £55m deal with Borussia Dortmund to add Jamie Gittens to their attacking ranks.",

      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",

He played 13 times for the Reds, was praised by Jurgen Klopp for his “big skills”, had seven spells on loan and eventually left in 2022. Maribor, to save you a Google.",
      "",
      "15 – Fran Merida (£2.2m, Barcelona to Arsenal in 2005)\n“An absolutely amazing player,” was the assessment Arsene Wenger once offered of Merida, who replaced fellow former Gunners prodigy Jermaine Pennant as the most expensive 15-year-old footballer in history. The Spaniard retired in 2024 in his mid-30s.",
      "",
      "16 – Pietro Pellegri (£17.5m, Genoa to Monaco in January 2018)\nThere is precious little separating Pellegri from fellow youthful Monaco recruit Willem Geubbels, who joined a few months later. Neither made an impact in the principality.",
      "",
      "17 – Jude Bellingham (£25m, Birmingham to Borussia Dortmund in July 2020)\nA total of 44 first-team appearances for Championship side Birmingham was enough to tempt Bundesliga giants and professional stepping stone Borussia Dortmund into signing Bellingham; none of the parties involved will have any regrets.",

      "18 – Leny Yoro (£52m, Lille to Man Utd in July 2024)\nMan Utd revelled in beating Real Madrid to “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”, even if it did largely come down to which side was willing to spend the most money.",
      "",
      "19 – Kylian Mbappe (£166m, Monaco to PSG in June 2018)\nThe most expensive teenager in the world and it is not particularly close; Joao Felix joined Atletico Madrid at the same age for £113m, while Bellingham’s move to Real Madrid could cost a couple million more than that with add-ons. The ridiculous Mbappe became PSG’s record scorer before leaving.",

That really does have to sting. The former Man Utd captain might consider himself to at least be in the same conversation now, if only just listening in the background and awkwardly laughing at all the in-jokes while being hawked around for about a quarter of what he was signed for.",

      "27 – Luis Suarez (£65m, Liverpool to Barcelona in July 2014)\nAfter arriving with a customary months-long ban for biting, Suarez really did crack on establishing a phenomenal Barcelona legacy. The only player not named Lionel or Cristiano to win the Pichichi Trophy for La Liga top scorer between 2010 and 2021, Suarez also claimed 13 trophies and a place at number three on the Blaugrana’s list of all-time top scorers. Then when they let the Uruguayan go for free he fired Atletico to the title while fuelled on pure thirst for revenge.",

      "28 – Eden Hazard (£143m, Chelsea to Real Madrid in July 2019)\nIf you had told Real Madrid in the summer of 2019 that Hazard would activate all the clauses in his Chelsea transfer to take it from an £88.5m deal to the full value of £143m, they would presumably have been chuffed at the success the Belgian must have enjoyed. But those add-ons were accidentally triggered across four seasons utterly ruined by injury, before being released with 12 months of his contract remaining and then retiring.",
      "",
      "29 – Diego Costa (£57m, Chelsea to Atletico Madrid in January 2018)\nZinedine Zidane was unmovable for almost two decades, but then Diego Costa won two Premier League titles in 20-goal seasons, was dumped by Antonio Conte over text, did not play for months and went AWOL, yet Chelsea still sold him back to Atletico for almost double what they initially paid, despite the striker turning 30 later that year and the Spanish side operating under a transfer ban. Todd Boehly could never.",
      "",
      "30 – Harry Kane (£100m, Spurs to Bayern Munich in August 2023)\nRaising the bar set by predecessor Casemiro by quite a way, Kane finally broke his Daniel Levy shackles with a 47-goal gap to Alan Shearer’s all-time Premier League record, so desperate was he to finally grab a couple of trophies.",
      "",
      "31 – Neymar (£86.3m, Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal in August 2023)\nFor more than 23 years, Gabriel Batistuta reigned as the most expensive 31-year-old in football history; it was a simpler time. Then Saudi Arabia came along, changed the game and rescued a load of superclubs from their financial burdens, including even mega-rich PSG.",
      "",
      "32 – Riyad Mahrez (£30m, Manchester City to Al-Ahli in July 2023)\nYep. Not that Manchester City were desperate to offload Mahrez, but the Algerian had won everything on offer in England and earned his jaunt in the Middle East.",
      "",
      "33 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£99m, Real Madrid to Juventus in July 2018)\nFive trophies, 101 goals in 134 games and consecutive Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, but still a failure of a signing after being picked up to win the Champions League – or at least to stop scoring against Juventus in the Champions League – yet not being able to take them beyond the quarter-finals after being knocked out by Ajax, Lyon and Porto.",

      "34 – Yann Sommer (£8.3m, Borussia Monchengladbach to Bayern Munich in January 2023)\nA Sommer signing completed in January, with Manuel Neuer injured and out for some time it was decided by Bayern that they would shop locally for a short-term replacement. And that he was, joining Inter that August after winning the Bundesliga.",
      "",
      "35 – Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£8.4m, Marseille to Al Qadsiah in July 2024)\nA 30-goal season with Marseille was slightly better than the campaign he spent playing irregularly and scoring even less often for Chelsea, with Aubameyang using that rediscovery of his goalscoring prowess to earn a Saudi pay day.",
      "",
      "36 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£12.9m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2021)\nManchester City lurked, Man Utd panicked, Sir Alex Ferguson was mobilised and Rio Ferdinand crowed. And for a while Ronaldo scored. But then a non-sycophantic grown-up was appointed as his manager and toys were expelled from prams with the toadying help of Piers Morgan as the Portuguese prompted a Saudi revolution.",

      "Joao Pedro has joined the increasing legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m. Will Alexander Isak be among them soon?",
      "This is the summer of the intra-Premier League transfer but Isak and others considering future employers closer to home have some way to go to reach this list.",
      "",
      "23) Aaron Wan-Bissaka – £45m rising to £50m (Crystal Palace to Manchester United, June 2019)\nIt is unknown exactly when Manchester United added Wan-Bissaka to an apparent 804-strong list of potential right-backs, but they cannot pretend it was any earlier than about halfway through his first full season of top-flight football.",
      "Crystal Palace cashed in on stock which would never be quite so high, raking in about £1.19m for each of his Premier League career appearances to that point. Wan-Bissaka remains the most expensive uncapped English player ever.",
      "",
      "22) Kyle Walker – £45m rising to £50m (Spurs to Manchester City, July 2017)\nOne prominent journalist called it ‘the moment we all knew the Premier League had lost its mind,’ but even with Walker’s regression as the captain who betrayed Pep Guardiola mid-season his signing was transformational for player and club.",
      "Even if it was wild to see Walker reign as the most expensive defender ever for a few months, he will leave after eight years with about twice as many trophies won.",
      "",
      "21) Amadou Onana – £50m (Everton to Aston Villa, July 2024)\nWith Douglas Luiz forced out in a PSR panic, Aston Villa prepared for their Champions League debut by scouring the Premier League for clubs in similar financial disorder, who also happened to boast one of the country’s better midfielders.",
      "",
      "20) Ben White – £50m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nThe laborious false equivalences with Raphael Varane did not last long. Arsenal had a series of bids rejected for a defender whose entire career consisted of a single season in each of League Two, League One, the Championship and the Premier League as Brighton knew what they had and how much it was worth.",
      "",
      "19) Fernando Torres – £50m (Liverpool to Chelsea, January 2011)\nA generationally dreadful British record transfer, yet one which delivered Torres the trophies he craved when leaving Liverpool after a productive but entirely potless three and a half years.",
      "",
      "18) Richarlison – £50m rising to £60m (Everton to Spurs, July 2022)\nWith a ‘nonsense’ and ultimately phantom £85m Barcelona bid firmly in his rear-view mirror, Richarlison and Everton both felt it was time to cash in on four decent, hard-working seasons when Spurs chucked a healthy profit their way.",
      "It has been far from seamless in north London for the Brazilian, who has been hoist by the disallowed-goal-followed-by-booking-for-removing-shirt-when-celebrating petard an absurd number of times. But the bloke has won a Europa League so…",
      "",
      "17) Pedro Neto – £51.4m rising to £54m (Wolves to Chelsea, August 2024)\nArsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs were sniffing around but Chelsea live for the hijack and swooped at the latest annual Wolves car boot sale.",
      "Was six goals and nine assists in 45 games across his debut season worth it? Doesn’t matter when you feed off transfer vibes.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Nunes – £53m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe repurposing of Nunes as a competent right-back should not mask how ludicrous it is that Manchester City can put more than £50m down on a player the manager later publicly decries as “not clever enough” to play in his preferred position.",
      "",
      "15) Romeo Lavia – £53m rising to £58m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThe numbers are a little shady but they paint a compelling picture: Lavia has missed more than three times as many Chelsea games through injury (67) as he has played for the Blues since joining (21).",
      "There is a phenomenal player within but as his own personal physio said recently, “questions gradually arise”.",
      "",
      "14) Joao Pedro – £55m rising to £60m (Brighton to Chelsea, July 2025)\nNewcastle made a play but their opening bid was knocked back by Brighton and Pedro wanted Chelsea in any case, presumably to guarantee there were some familiar faces to greet him.",
      "“They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing – win,” he said, clearly having never heard of Dan Burn.",
      "",
      "13) Mason Mount – £55m rising to £60m (Chelsea to Manchester United, July 2023)\nYet it is a similar story for a player Lavia might have passed in the Stamford Bridge departures lounge. Mount has missed 50 games through injury since making his move to Manchester United, for whom he has played 46 times.",
      "But obviously Ruben Amorim loves the manager’s dream. “When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him,” said a head coach who needs some of that assistance to be reciprocated.",
      "",
      "12) Dominic Solanke – £55m rising to £65m (Bournemouth to Spurs, August 2024)\nLiverpool had a buy-back clause but chose not to use it, leaving Spurs with a free hit after Arsenal were ruled out on the basis they do not spend significant sums on actual forwards.",
      "They can hardly be dissatisfied with their lot from a heavily disrupted 16-goal season which culminated with Solanke scoring in three of four Europa League quarter and semi-final legs before lifting the sodding trophy in Bilbao.",
      "",
      "11) Marc Cucurella – £56m rising to £63m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nManchester City had offers of £30m and £40m rejected before balking at demands of around £50m. Chelsea picked up the slack and it remains one of the biggest Premier League transfer overpays of all time.",
      "Cucurella has at least started to repay the faith and fee, becoming a bastion of reliability under Enzo Maresca as a European champion with Spain.",
      "",
      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",
      "Mahrez might not regret that delayed exit in retrospect. It allowed Pep Guardiola to crystallise his interest in a player who would win 10 further trophies at the Etihad.",
      "",
      "Cunha only finished one place lower with Wolves but that was not for his own lack of effort or ability in a season spent scoring 17 goals, assisting six and apologising countless times for intimating that he would quite like to leave at some point.",
      "",
      "8) Kai Havertz – £65m (Chelsea to Arsenal, June 2023)\nRarely has a transfer ever continued to polarise the footballing world long after it was made quite so fundamentally as Arsenal throwing their new-found title weight behind a Chelsea cast-off.",
      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time. A total of 42 combined goals and assists in 87 games is a fine record for a player whose strengths are ignored and shortcomings highlighted like few others.",
      "",
      "7) Wesley Fofana – £70m rising to £75m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nThe final boss of the Lavia-Mount strand of player. Fofana has missed 105 club games through injury while contracted to Chelsea, for whom he has played 34 times.",
      "The Frenchman is still 19 Blues games from surpassing the number of appearances he made for Leicester. Thomas Tuchel was in charge when they signed him!",
      "",
      "6) Virgil van Dijk – £75m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nLiverpool received a slapped wrist for their ‘illegal approach’ of Van Dijk but the inevitable could only be delayed for so long by Southampton.",
      "More than seven years later it looks like Saints were fleeced if anything.",
      "",
      "5) Romelu Lukaku – £75m rising to £90m (Everton to Manchester United, July 2017)\nThe transfer narrative that defined summer 2017 revolved around Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Manchester United, Chelsea and some quite uncomfortable comparative undertones.",
      "There were precisely no winners from the sorry old mess. It is a great bit that former Chelsea and Manchester United striker Lukaku’s three best goalscoring Premier League seasons were with Everton and West Brom.",
      "",
      "4) Harry Maguire – £80m (Leicester to Manchester United, August 2019)\nAnother player Manchester City flirted with before, in Guardiola’s words, it was decided the club with a basically unlimited budget “could not afford it”, Maguire was Manchester United’s answer to the conundrum Liverpool posed with Van Dijk: what if teams actually spent considerable money on a centre-half?",
      "Maguire’s greatest asset since has been mental resilience. He was stripped of a captaincy awarded to him within half a year of joining and has been ostracised by two managers before both realised their mistake and brought him back into the fold.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish – £100m (Aston Villa to Manchester City, August 2021)\nA player so good Aston Villa had to sign three before he left to replace him.",
      "Grealish was the free-running show pony in a modest stable, who will soon be turned to glue or lasagna after being consumed by the great Manchester City outdoors.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",
      "Rice will probably have to at least match his West Ham trophy haul of one at Arsenal for the signing to be considered a success, but any shortcoming on that front thus far has certainly not been his.",
      "",
      "1) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nChelsea, however, made an absolute mess of their record move for a midfield cheat code that summer, but Caicedo has ultimately rendered that moot by growing into his role impeccably.",
      "According to reports, six Manchester City stars are on the ‘chopping block’ after the Club World Cup, with the ‘most high-profile’ exit ‘almost certain’.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes – including three Man City cast-offs and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Pep Guardiola has reportedly asked Manchester City to include Jack Grealish in a deal for a Real Madrid superstar in order to lower the price of the deal.",
      "Chelsea have already directly replaced three transfer-listed players they are yet to sell this summer, with 10 stars available for £337.6m on their ways out."

      "7) Tottenham – £60.52m\nThat’s a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel and Luka Vuskovic before Thomas Frank even gets a say.",

      "6) Juventus – £62.27m\nEvery penny has so far been spent on making loan signings permanent, with Nico Gonzalez their most expensive purchase.",

      "4) Real Madrid – £100.5m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City – £109.6m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon and a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, and all of them feel like bargains. Pep Guardiola wanted Florian Wirtz but he will eventually cost more on his own.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £154.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £196m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m."

      "Brentford director of football Phil Giles says Bryan Mbeumo would be happy to stay at the club if a deal cannot be agreed with Manchester United.",
      "The two clubs have held talks, and Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite added interest from Tottenham, who have appointed his former boss, Thomas Frank.",
      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",
      "\"He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer.",
      "\"If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",
      "\"It's a massive boost if he stays,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
