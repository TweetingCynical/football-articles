      "After watching some of their Premier League rivals strengthen in the early part of the summer, Manchester United are aiming to do the same. Liverpool have announced record signing Florian Wirtz and Manchester CIty made a number of early additions ahead of the Club World Cup, but it's been slower going for Ruben Amorim's side.",
      "There was an early bit of business, with Matheus Cunha completing his permanent move from Wolves. United have also handed Tom Heaton a new contract, but the veteran goalkeeper won't be offended if we say fans will likely hope that's not the last announcement of the summer.",
      "One thing which won't be happening this year is an Old Trafford return for Paul Pogba. The French midfielder had been touted for a third spell during his time as a free agent, but has instead opted for a move to Monaco.",
      "Head coach Amorim is looking to freshen up in a number of areas as he aims to build a squad capable of playing to his tactical preferences. Bryan Mbeumo is a major attacking target, while further investment could hinge on an ability to offload some out-of-favour high earners.",
      "Timothy Fosu-Mensah broke into Manchester United's first team at the same time as Marcus Rashford, and believes the forward needs to ensure he can find a club where he feels good. The Dutch defender made his Premier League bow on the same day as Rashford, and was speaking as he continues his own search for a new club after leaving Bayer Leverkusen in 2024.",
      "“I just want him to be happy. Everybody just wants him to be happy,\" Fosu-Mensah told The Independent. \"The most important things is for him to feel good, for him to feel happy. Look, the quality is definitely there. Nobody needs to say anything about this quality, because he’s a top player.”",
      "Rashford looked to be enjoying his football during a loan spell at Aston Villa last term, earning an England recall. However, he left at the end of the season after Villa missed out on Champions League qualification.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Joshua Zirkzee both appeared to green-light a move for Bryan Mbeumo with their social media activity. The pair 'liked' a report indicating United are poised to continue talks over a move for the Brentford star.",
      "Cameroon international Mbeumo has been eyed by both United and Tottenham. The latter are managed by former Brentford boss Thomas Frank, and can offer Champions League football, but those might not end up being deciding factors.",
      "Mbeumo has a year left on his current deal in West London, and Brentford hold an option to extend it until 2027. He is due back in pre-season training if no agreement can be reached before then, but exit talk persists.",
      "Manchester United are ready to sanction a loan exit for Andre Onana, according to The Sun. The former Inter Milan star has had ups and downs since moving to Old Trafford in 2023, and a difficult second half of the 2024-25 season has led to increased chatter around an exit.",
      "Monaco are said to be among the interested parties, though their financial situation has prompted some doubt over a permanent switch. Philipp Kohn and Radoslaw Majecki shared goalkeeping duties at the Ligue 1 club last term as they finished third and qualified for the Champions League",
      "Emi Martinez remains an option to replace Onana if United do move for an alternative. If they are to pursue a cheaper alternative, Botafogo keeper John is said to be an option.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres will refuse to return to Sporting Lisbon this summer in an attempt to force through a transfer. Things have turned increasingly sour between the Swedish striker and his current club, who are dragging their feet over his exit in an attempt to extract the best transfer fee possible.",
      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas has been extremely vocal recently about the bitter saga in an attempt to keep supporters onside. At the centre of the dispute is an apparent gentleman's agreement, made between Gyokeres and the club hierarchy, that he would be allowed to leave for less than his official release clause.",
      "Gyokeres has made it clear that this summer is his time to leave Lisbon in search of new opportunities and a higher level of football. He plundered 53 goals and 13 assists in 51 games across the 2024/25 season, helping Sporting win the league and cup double, and feels he should be afforded some good will.",
      "Sporting have granted Gyokeres an extra week off before he is due to report for pre-season, but Portuguese newspaper Record says he has no intention of showing up.",
      "The 27-year-old is fed up with the situation and has personally told Varandas that he feels betrayed and therefore won’t play ball. He has also threatened to speak publicly to give his side of the story.",
      "Gyokeres has been a target of both Manchester United and Arsenal, who previously saw an offer of £55m rejected by Sporting. But with United moving for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, and Arsenal preferring RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko, there has been little movement in recent weeks.",
      "That has left Gyokeres frustrated, with the former Coventry man wanting to get a move sorted as soon as possible. Things have deteriorated and, when he does leave, it will be under a cloud, with Varandas refusing to back down.",
      "\"Sporting is calm regarding this matter,\" he said. \"Secondly, Sporting does not need to sell Viktor Gyökeres. Fortunately, we have moved past the phase of selling our main asset.",
      "\"However, we remain sensitive to Viktor’s dreams or those of any other athlete. Sporting has made a commitment that, after weeks of meetings, we will not demand the full amount of the clause; we will be reasonable regarding the amount requested for Viktor.",
      "\"Today, there is a strong likelihood that he will leave. I won’t disclose the amount, but the player knows what it is. I can say that Viktor will not leave for 60+10m. He won’t leave, absolutely not.",
      "\"We have been watching the market and I saw [Martin] Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, leave for €65million. I saw Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, both forwards but who, in my opinion, do not have Viktor's market value or quality, being negotiated for around €75million.",
      "\"Given the demands we consider fair, I believe Viktor could leave – unless he has the worst agent in the world, which is hard for me to believe, because he is one of the best footballers in the world.\"",

      "The Swede is looking to leave the Portuguese champions this summer after scoring more than 50 times and the Manchester outfit - as well as Arsenal - are both keeping tabs on his availability.",
      "The biggest stumbling block to Gyokeres' departure is Sporting's willingness to let him depart and how much they will ultimately demand before deciding to let him leave for pastures new. United have already spent £62.5million to land Cunha - their only summer signing.",
      "Brentford have rejected the same fee as they look to keep hold off Mbuemo, who is also on United's radar. Sporting have used those two figures as a reference point when it comes to the demands they make for their leading light.",

      "United were able to land Cunha due to a release clause in his contract but their pursuit of Mbeumo, and potentially Gyokeres, has seen clubs demand huge fees and drag out negotiations in an effort to maximise their profits.",

He was loaned out to PSV last year but they do not want to sign him permanently - despite having an £8.5million option to do so.",
      "Malacia is up for sale in Manchester but currently no buyers have been forthcoming for a player who has been unable to showcase his best football, largely down to injuries. After an positive first season he has since only managed three league games due to his horrific luck.",
      "The 25-year-old was ruled out for 18 months after a meniscus tear, a failed surgery, which then led to another surgery as he underwent a lengthy rehabilitation process.",
      "That is unlikely to encourage buyers and United may have to accept a cut-price deal to simply get Malacia off their books, which is likely to be an issue throughout their summer window.",
      "Despite signing Matheus Cunha the club are having to deal with a lengthy list of players whose futures need to be resolved. The majority of them don't appear to have roles to play under Amorim but getting them out of the club is a tough ask, especially for those earning big wages.",
      "The likes of Marcus Rashford and Antony are looking for ways out of Old Trafford - but the Red Devils could end up paying to offload them. Alongside Rashford and Antony, Jadon Sancho was also loaned out last term but the trio are now back in Manchester. They all fell down the pecking order under Amorim and he's offered no indication that he wants to bring them back into the fold.",

      "He was then retained by Ruben Amorim as he replaced the Dutchman. But Fletcher has now seen his role changed once more. The Athletic report that he has been offered the role of the lead coach of the under-18s by director of football Jason Wilcox and outgoing director of academy Nick Cox as a replacement for Adam Lawrence.",
      "Fletcher was given the option of staying on as a member of Amorim’s staff but is expected to accept the move and launch his managerial career. Having achieved his UEFA A Licence, Fletcher would lead United’s under-18 side in the FA Youth Cup.",
      "First team star Manuel Ugarte was previously full of praise for Fletcher for helping him understand the demands of being a Man United player. Speaking earlier this season, he said: “We all know what it means to be United, with the history we have.",

However, the Gunners, who are desperate to land a top-class number nine this summer, may feel compelled to focus on another target, which would be excellent news for United.",
      "Benjamin Sesko could be a more realistic target and a cheaper option after RB Leipzig dropped their asking price from £68million-£85m to around £59.7m, according to German outlet Bild. With the Gunners looking elsewhere, United could have an opportunity to swoop and make a statement signing ahead of Amorim’s first full season.",
      "And in a fresh boost for United, Sporting appear to be making plans for life after Gyokeres, who is at odds with the club over his price tag. With their star striker’s future up in the air, the Lisbon side have reportedly set their sights on Union Saint-Gilloise striker Franjo Ivanovic as a potential replacement.",
      "Per Germanijak.HR , Sporting have lodged a bid of around £17m, which is short of the Belgian champions’ valuation of £25.6m. Besiktas and Frankfurt , plus clubs in Italy, are also said to be interested in Ivanovic, who netted 20 goals for the Belgian champions last season.",
      "Sporting landing a striker with a strong goalscoring record for less than £30m may also help United in their negotiations for Gyokeres, who is at odds with the Sporting hierarchy over his price tag.",

Sporting president Frederico Varandas has denied that such an arrangement exists but has confirmed that the club did promise the 27-year-old they would not hold out for the full value stated in the release clause, believed to be almost £85m.",

      "Marcus Rashford's former Manchester United team-mate Timothy Fosu-Mensah insists the \"most important things is for him to feel good\" as he weighs up where he'll be playing his football next season.",
      "The academy star is back in Manchester after his loan spell with Aston Villa came to an end. At Villa Park, Rashford looked back to his best, but the Midlands club have not exercised their option to buy him permanently and it looks unlikely that he'll forge a way back into the United first-team.",
      "Rashford has been linked with a move to Barcelona and a switch to the Nou Camp would be his dream move, but the Catalans are going after Nico Williams which could curtail that move.",
      "The United star, when he's on it, has been a deadly individual, scoring 30 times in Erik ten Hag's first season in charge. Since then though he's struggled to hit those heights with his body language and attitude question. Rashford made his Premier League debut in 2016 alongside Fosu-Mensah and the defender just wants to see his former colleague enjoying his football.",
      "He told the Independent: “I just want him to be happy. Everybody just wants him to be happy. The most important things is for him to feel good, for him to feel happy. Look, the quality is definitely there. Nobody needs to say anything about this quality, because he’s a top player.”",
      "Rashford's demise has coincided with Ruben Amorim's arrival. It quickly became apparent that the Portuguese coach didn't fancy the forward and he was left out of a number of matchday squads before sealing an exit in the New Year.",
      "Amorim continued to hint at an attitude problem as he said: \"In January we lost Rashford and Antony and we didn’t bring new ones – was a risk. But there are things here that are more important than to score 10 more goals this season. We are trying to do something that is more important. We can hurt the squad now, but in the future it is going to help the club. So we are on that path.”",
      "The United boss wasn't shy in suggesting that Rashford's efforts in training were a major reason for his omission. He once claimed that he would rather pick his 63-year-old goalkeeping coach in his squad rather than Rashford.",
      "He said: \"If things don't change, I will not change. It's the same situation for every player, if you do the maximum and right things we can use every player. You can see on the bench we miss a bit of pace on the bench, but I would put [ Manchester United goalkeeper coach Jorge] Vital before a player who doesn't give the maximum every day.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's side were prepared to pay Brentford a guaranteed £55m plus £7.5m in potential add-ons for the winger, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season. United side had already seen an offer of £45m plus up to £10m in add-ons turned down earlier this month.",
      "It's been reported that Brentford would want at least £62.5m up front before approving his sale. That's the same fee amount which United paid to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves at the start of window, triggering his release clause.",
      "Mbeumo, 25, also has interest from Tottenham but he only wants to join United. The Red Devils are hopeful that a deal can be agreed in time for the Cameroon international to link up with Amorim's squad at the beginning of pre-season.",

      "On Instagram, both Cunha and Joshua Zirkzee liked a post from journliast Fabrizio Romano which said that United will continue talks over signing Mbeumo. Cunha and Zirkzee could be the men playing alongside the 25-year-old in Amorim's front three next season.",
      "But there's still a way to go yet, with Mbeumo still firmly a Brentford player and due back there for pre-season training. The French-born star has 12 months left on his contract, although the Bees can exercise an option to extend it by a further year.",
      "Mbeumo's prolific form last term piqued the interest of Arsenal, Newcastle and Tottenham but his heart is set on a move to Old Trafford. Tottenham recently appointed Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new manager and it was hoped that his connection to Mbeumo would help persuade him to snub United.",

Before joining Tottenham, he was quoted as telling Tipsbladet: \"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",

      "After heading out of the Stamford Bridge exit this summer, Jadon Sancho has already shown his love for the man likely to replace him at Chelsea. And he would know a thing or two about Jamie Gittens, having previously played in the same Borussia Dortmund line-up.",
      "Sancho, 25, spent this season on loan in west London but failed to make enough of an impact to convince the Blues to sign him permanently. In fact, Chelsea paid parent club Manchester United £5million to circumvent his purchase clause in the hopes they could make better use of their funds.",
      "And it appears Dortmund winger Gittens is the preferred option as he homes in on a return to Cobham this summer. Niko Kovac insisted his attacker only missed his side's Club World Cup win over Ulsan because of illness, but it's been suggested the omission was actually due to the fact that Gittens is on the verge of leaving. The Sun claim Chelsea are now on the verge of signing the winger in a £55.5m deal.",
      "Sancho previously impressed at the Westfalenstadion before returning to the club on a short-term loan last year. He struck up a bond with Gittens during that spell and reached out to his fellow Englishman last winter when the 20-year-old really started to take off as a first-team talent.",
      "\"He [Sancho] wrote to me to say, 'Keep it up,'\" Gittens told the Dortmund website in December. \"'It's your time to show everyone what you can do.' He is a top player and also a top friend.\"",
      "Sancho also complimented Gittens in public last season after the youngster scored twice in a Champions League win over Club Brugge. The United winger commented on one of Gittens' Instagram posts by calling him a \"balla [baller]\" as a show of support for his work.",
      "Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has already confessed that the club will sign a new winger this summer after Mykhailo Mudryk missed more than half of this season. The Ukrainian tested positive for a banned substance and is facing a potential four-year ban as a result.",
      "Add Sancho's departure into the equation, and Chelsea's need for reinforcements out wide becomes even more dire. Brazilian winger Estevao is due to arrive in England after completing his transfer from Palmeiras, but the 18-year-old will require some easing into his Premier League surroundings.",
      "Gittens and Sancho spent just six months together as team-mates in Germany, but it's evident the latter made an impact in that time. And former Chelsea academy prospect Gittens admitted as much at the conclusion of a breakthrough 2023/24 campaign.",
      "\"I've learned a lot from Jadon,\" he told German outlet WAZ in July 2024. \"For example, that I have to play with one or two touches more often, that I have to offer deeper runs more often. And when he plays, he enjoys himself; I've learned that too. Jadon is a friend.\"",
      "Gittens spent a brief period of time training with Chelsea's academy as a youngster but never went full-time in their ranks. And it just so happens he made his Champions League debut in a 1-0 win over the Premier League giants in February 2023.",
      "After scoring 12 goals in 49 appearances for Dortmund last season (both career highs), Gittens appears to have done enough to earn Chelsea's interest once again. And it seems as though Sancho is among his advocates as he prepares for a summer homecoming."

But the same performances that caught United’s attention have prompted Bournemouth to set the 25-year-old’s transfer value at a whopping £70m.",
      "That figure is part of a wider trend seen this summer, where Premier League clubs are charging more for their players as the traditional big clubs shift their attention to signing players with experience in England’s top flight.",
      "The i Paper reports that, in addition to United, Spurs showed the most interest in Semenyo, having stayed in contact with the Cherries after making an initial enquiry last week. But there’s an increasing belief he will stay at Bournemouth, with the Red Devils, Spurs and Newcastle all unwilling to meet their hefty asking price after he agreed a five-year contract extension with the club last year.",
      "United’s reluctance to pay so much is a clear indication of their approach to the summer transfer window, where they are under financial constraints and will not splurge as recklessly as they have done in the past.",
      "For example, Brentford’s Bryan Mbeumo has emerged as Ruben Amorim’s top target over Semenyo, but the Red Devils only want him for a reasonable fee. Despite the Cameroonian's desire to join the Red Devils, United are yet to agree a deal with Brentford, who rejected a second bid of £55 million plus £7.5 million in bonuses for the 25-year-old.",
      "The Bees want at least the same fee United paid Wolves for Cunha up-front and it is still unclear whether the Red Devils will pay it. After missing out on European football next season, Amorim’s transfer budget this summer is not as big as it might have been if he had won the Europa League final in May.",
      "However, United’s latest financial results for the first three months of 2025 revealed a more encouraging picture despite Sir Jim Ratcliffe earlier this year suggesting the club was on course to run out of money by Christmas.",

But they will need to sell the likes of Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony before making any further additions beyond Mbeumo.",
      "If United bank the fees they are looking for for the aforementioned players, they will secure somewhere in the region of £170m. It is not expected that Amorim will sign a third forward, with those funds set to be invested in other areas of the pitch.",
      "That will mean missing out on Semenyo, who, former United striker Michael Owen, encouraged Liverpool to buy back in March as a replacement for Salah, whose future at the time was still unclear.",
      "Owen claimed the versatile winger could be a suitable heir to the Egyptian at Anfield, saying: “I like Antoine Semenyo at Bournemouth, who plays in the same position as Salah. I like him, a younger version, but definitely got energy, scoring capabilities and a good player.”",
      "He added: “That being said, you can’t replace Mo Salah. I mean if you said Mo Salah and Darwin Nunez went and Alexander Isak and Antoine Semenyo came then I don’t think it’s the worst swap in the world if we’re playing fantasy football here, but realistically Liverpool want to keep hold of their best players and Mo Salah is their best player so hopefully he doesn’t leave.\" Semenyo now looks set to stay at Bournemouth unless the club drop their valuation or the player tries to force a move through.",

      "Manchester United's summer transfer business is starting to take shape.",
      "As we head towards July when the transfer rumour mill really begins to wind up, United have been heavily linked with moves for attacking midfielders, goalkeepers and forwards.",
      "But while signing a new midfielder was also considered a priority this summer, the links with specific players have been few and far between this summer.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is expected to drop deeper this season and play in a central midfield role, while United still have Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro as options to partner him.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "£85",
      "But given Fernandes will be the first name on the team sheet, it is perhaps wise to look at players with similar characteristics to the United captain as a way of identifying players who would thrive in Ruben Amorim's midfield.",
      "Using DataMB's player similarity generator tool to bring up players with similar characteristics to Fernandes, Mainz midfielder Nadiem Amiri ranked in the top five most similar players to the United skipper.",
      "The 28-year-old left Bayer Leverkusen last summer after falling out of favour under Xabi Alonso but has reinvented himself as one of the best midfielders in the Bundesliga since moving to the MEWA Arena.",
      "Amiri scored eight goals and bagged five assists from midfield last term and was a key driver in Mainz finishing in sixth place and securing European football next season.",
      "The Germany international was named in the Players' Bundesliga Team of the Season and, despite having three years left on his current deal at the club, would be a fairly cheap option for United to consider - particularly when they are seeking big money moves in other positions.",
      "Germany boss Julian Nagelsmann is a big fan of Amiri, having previously coached him at Hoffenheim, and praised him when recalling him to the national side in March.",
      "\"Nadiem is having an outstanding season,\" Nagelsmann said. \"He’s a very good example of how you can take a step back to push your career forward.\"",
      "Valued at around £17million by Transfermarkt, United could do a lot worse than look in Amiri's direction in their bid to strengthen their midfield options."

      "Tom Heaton has signed a new one year contract to remain as the club's third choice goalkeeper but it feels as if one of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir will leave the club this summer.",
      "Onana has now had two years as the club's number one and while he did have an impressive period between the posts, that was bookended by some high profile errors at the start of his time at the club and in recent months.",
      "Bayindir has not shown any signs of proving he is up to the level of playing for United when he has had to deputise for Onana and may leave in search of regular first team football.",

      "As such, United are already running the rule over potential replacements. Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez has been linked but so too has Portugal international goalkeeper Diogo Costa.",
      "Costa is Portugal's number one goalkeeper, is well known by Ruben Amorim, and has impressed at both the 2022 World Cup and 2024 European Championships, winning 36 caps for his country.",
      "Portugal manager Roberto Martinez is a huge fan of Costa's ability, describing him as 'the most hidden secret' in European football after his performance in Portugal's penalty shootout win over Slovenia last summer.",
      "\"I think Portugal’s secret is Diogo Costa,\" Martinez said. \"Diogo Costa is the most hidden secret in European football and today he showed up.\"",
      "At 25, Costa's best years are still ahead of him despite already racking up considerable experience in the Champions and at international level.",
      "Adept with the ball at his feet, but strong at the fundamentals of goalkeeping too, Costa would be the perfect fit as Onana's successor.",
      "Costa is said to have a release clause of £64million his current contract and while that may seem a bit steep for a goalkeeper, it could well be a price worth paying if it ends any awkward uncertainty surrounding the goalkeeper situation this summer."

      "Elsewhere, the links to Aston Villa's Emiliano Martinez continue to be strong with the goalkeeper reportedly favouring a switch to United. If he were to move to Manchester, Andre Onana's future would be in doubt as the club's No.1.",
      "MEN Sport understands that Onana has been informed that he will be staying at Old Trafford but whether this will still be the case should Martinez join the club remains to be seen.",

      "Gyokeres, it has been said, has been left feeling betrayed and tired by his treatment.",
      "According to a report from Nathan Salt, reiterated by Fabrizio Romano, Man United prospect JJ Gabriel is set to sign a new contract.",

      "\"I won't say what the price we asked for. It was communicated to the agent. But I can guarantee that Viktor will not leave for €60m plus €10m. Viktor already knows and I want Sporting fans to take advantage of this summer, in which they are two-time champions, in which they have a double, to celebrate, to be calm, because there are only two scenarios.",
      "\"One club respects the price requested by Sporting and Viktor will fulfil his dreams, and from that moment we will be ready to attack the targets, or that club does not want Viktor and Viktor, with a three-year contract, stays at Sporting and we will be very happy.",

      "“But hey, as long as Antony hasn’t committed to a third party, we, with the utmost humility, are going to play our cards to be able to opt for Antony. I insist, despite being a complex operation, we will try to carry it out in different ways without mortgaging the club .",
      "“In the end, the most important thing is also the sustainability of the entity. We will try to be creative, as we have been in the past, so that Antony can be here.”",

      "Graeme Bailey said: “Middlesbrough don’t need the money to stay afloat or anything, but if they really want to back Rob Edwards, then they do need some money. And selling homegrown players is what Middlesbrough’s academy is there for, to a certain extent.",
      "“So yes, I do expect Hackney will go. The likes of Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham, Man United, and West Ham have watched him.”",
      "AS Roma have reportedly put Evan Ndicka up for sale amid interest from Man United.",
      "The 25-year-old defender played 51 times for the Italian side last term, leading to interest from United, Arsenal and Newcastle. Now, it's claimed that FFP regulations have forced Roma to agree the sale of Ndicka for around €35million.",

      "The report claims that Ter Stegen is 'one of the most concrete names under consideration' at Old Trafford. The Germany international, who has three years left on his deal, missed a large chunk of last season after suffering a serious knee injury.",

      "In an interview with the Daily Star, Luke Littler singled out Alejandro Garnacho. The teenage Darts sensation and United fan said: \"Garnacho doesn't have a United future anymore.",
      "\"I think Nkunku can either play as a 10 or play as a 9. Obviously, we wouldn't be offering more money if we didn't think he [Mbeumo] is going to fit in well. I think we're up to £60million, £65m as of today. But I'm sure we'll get him over the line.\"",
      "AS Monaco have announced the signing of Paul Pogba on a two-year contract.",
      "In a recent interview with French television channel TF1, the former United star opened up about how he was treated by Juventus before being released. He said: \"I asked Juventus for help, but I wasn't given it.",
      "\"I asked to get a fitness coach. I had the right, and I was always part of the team. They weren't very kind to me, and they did not support me, and I was shocked. I did not understand why.\"",
      "Pogba added: \"I'm mentally and physically ready, and I'm eager to start again. I'm 32, but I still feel like a young kid.\"",
      "According to the Mirror, Chelsea have been offered the chance to sign Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa for £45m. The 32-year-old goalkeeper has recently been linked with a move to United as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his defence.",
      "The report claims Villa could be forced to cash in on Martinez in order to remain compliant with the Premier League's spending rules. It's said that Unai Emery's side are aware that the Blues are in the market for a new shot-stopper.",
      "The Mirror adds that the Argentina international would prefer a switch to Old Trafford over Stamford Bridge. However, Amorim reportedly has other priorities and Enzo Maresca's assistant, Willy Caballero, is thought to be a 'huge admirer'.",
      "According to journalist Ben Jacobs, United want to announce the signing of Bryan Mbeumo before pre-season gets underway on July 7. That means the Reds have two weeks to secure his signature...",

      "According to CaughtOffside, United have made Rafael Leao their primary target this summer. The 26-year-old winger faces an uncertain future at the San Siro after AC Milan finished eight in the Serie A and failed to qualify for each of UEFA's three club competitions.",
      "The report claims Leao, whose contract expires in June 2028, has a €175m (£150m) release clause, but it's said that the Italian giants may consider offers in the region of £68m to £85m. CaughtOffside reckons that United are monitoring the situation closely, with plans to potentially submit a £60m bid.",
      "Manchester United are slowly but surely starting to change their approach to the transfer market.",
      "The club are desperate to make the 'United tax' a thing of the past, but their problems haven't been limited to buying players for the right price.",
      "Selling players for the right price has also been an issue, but United are looking to adopt a strategy that has brought a number of their rivals success in recent years. Adding sell-on clauses to deals means the financial boost that comes with selling a player can extend beyond the initial payment received.",

      "An update has been provided on the future of Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho.",
      "The 25-year-old spent last season on loan at Premier League rivals Chelsea, but - despite their £25million obligation to make that move permanent - the Blues opted to pay a £5m penalty fee to send him back to Old Trafford.",
      "United will be hoping to sell the winger this summer as they look to strengthen their attack. It is believed that the former Borussia Dortmund former does not have a long-term future under Reds boss Ruben Amorim and is expected to leave United M16 again. Clubs from Italy, including Juventus and Napoli, have been linked as well as Turkish giants Fenerbahce.",
      "Read more here",
      "Manchester United spent millions in the transfer market under Erik ten Hag and it's not an unfair assessment to say most of it was wasted.",
      "Very few of the Dutchman's signings during his time at the club have improved United, with the signings of Antony and Rasmus Hojlund surely set to go down as two of the worst in Premier League history given the enormous fees involved.",
      "Read more here",
      "Paul Pogba is reportedly closing in on a summer move to AS Monaco. The French midfielder, who returned to Manchester United in August 2016 for a record-breaking fee of £89million at the time, is now allowed to return to professional football.",
      "Pogba was banned following a positive test for the prohibited substance DHEA. The 32-year-old left Juventus in November despite having his four-year ban reduced on appeal.",
      "And the 2018 World Cup winner is now free to play again and has been linked with a move to several clubs, including his former team. Pogba would have two spells at Old Trafford, winning the League Cup and Europa League during his second spell, which was characterised by inconsistent performances, before he departed once more on a free transfer in June 2022, joining the Old Lady.",
      "Read more here",
      "Amorim is clearly a fan of Gyokeres, having played a key role in the striker’s development into a world-class player during their time together at Sporting CP. But until now, the Swede has made it clear that he only wants a move to Premier League rivals Arsenal this summer, as the Gunners weigh up whether to buy him or RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Sesko is believed to be Mikel Arteta’s preferred signing, but Gyokeres was very much still in the running due to his lower price tag. Yet, according to Bild, Leipzig have now backed down from their initial asking price of £68-£85m to a figure of around £59.7m, which could see Arsenal push on with their deal for Sesko.",

      "Aston Villa goalkeeper Emi Martinez has been linked with a move to Old Trafford and that would be a transfer that almost certainly fits in the latter category.",
      "However, a fresh report in the Sun over the weekend suggested that United are looking at two potential options and which of those routes they take will tell us a lot about Onana's future.",
      "The first route was a move for Portugal international goalkeeper Diogo Costa. The 25-year-old is considered one of the best goalkeepers in Europe and is believed to have a £64million release clause in his Porto contract.",
      "The second route was a move for Botafogo goalkeeper John Victor, who has impressed at the Club World Cup this summer.",
      "The 29-year-old has helped Botafogo win the Brazilian League Championship and the Copa Libertadores in recent years and is said to be available for just £6million.",
      "A move for Costa would surely spell the end for Onana - whether United seek a permanent exit or a loan move away from the club with an obligation to buy.",
      "However, a move for Victor, who is unproven in European football, would suggest United are prepared to keep faith in Onana as number one and he would replace Bayindir as the club's second choice goalkeeper.",
      "Should either of those moves materialise, it will tell us a lot about United's plans for Onana."

      "It was also five years ago that Rashford became an ambassador for FareShare, helping fight hunger in the nation’s most vulnerable communities at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "\"He’s a great example of how football can make a huge difference off the pitch. It will be a real milestone moment for us when we get to the point where massive clubs are interested in supporting and working with us.”",

      "Adam explained: \"There was a huge gap for casual games of football that can accommodate all abilities and anyone who wants to play. We do not mind that you have a dodgy knee, have never kicked a ball before, or are feeling a bit old these days.",
      "\"We are proud to provide the space where you are welcome to play. We won’t charge more than £4 per player as we want to make sure that our games are always accessible and affordable for all. This does mean that many of the pitches in Manchester are out of our price range, and we’d risk running at a loss if we didn’t fill the pitch every week.",
      "\"As a result, we are reliant on the generosity of our current venues offering special rates for community-focused organisations, allowing us to make the money that goes on to make the difference for those who need it. Not every pitch offers such rates, so it’s a real sign that a particular venue cares about being part of the community, and it’s something we’d like to see more of, as our organisation is an example of bringing that to life.\"",
      "In Manchester, the organisation hosts three men's games each week, along with one game specifically for women and gender minorities. \"The games are at different times on different days to try and accommodate as many different lifestyles as possible,\" Adam stated.",
      "\"Mens currently play Mondays at 8:00pm at the Manchester Academy High School and on Tuesdays, the game is played at Burnage Rugby & Football Club at 9pm. On Wednesdays, men's, women & gender minorities play two games at The Energy Box at 7pm.\"",
      "If you're based in Manchester and want to take part, it's simple to get started. \"We have two Facebook groups – one for our Men’s Division, and one for our Women and Gender Minorities Division,\" he detailed.",
      "\"We love giving everyone a chance to get involved, so our players can join whichever group they feel comfortable playing with. Sign-up posts go live at 6pm two days before each game, and spaces are allocated on a first-come-first-serve basis depending on pitch size.",
      "\"On the day, turn up and pay your £4 fee, and we’ll take care of the rest. Once a month, we do a big shop where around 70% of the money left over after paying for the pitch gets used to buy food, toiletries and hygiene products which we then donate to foodbanks in the area.\"",
      "The organisation has seen great success, with Adam and his team running games non-stop since launching the initiative in Manchester in May 2021.",
      "\"We have put on games every week - other than a well-earned break over Christmas - since we started in Manchester, and there is no sign of slowing down,\" he revealed.",
      "The past few years have been incredibly rewarding for the organisation, and it has been difficult to choose just one standout moment among so many meaningful experiences.",
      "\"We have so many wonderful moments to choose from,\" Adam recalled. \"We have organised multiple 11-a-side friendlies against other like-minded teams in the Greater Manchester area, and when we do this we ask players to bring a bag of food rather than pay money to play.",
      "\"On one such occasion we combined the physical donations and the cash raised by one month of games, to donate over £600 to Humans MCR - their biggest donation ever, all through passive income from kicking a ball about and having a laugh.\"",
      "However, if football’s not your cup of tea, you can still support Football for Foodbanks with a donation. The organisation’s own merchandise helps raise donations which are then exchanged for food.",
      "A total of 15 foodbanks are supported by the organisation. They are proud to support Clay Cross Foodbank, Chesterfield Foodbank, Derbyshire Community Hub, MK Foodbank, Emmeline’s Pantry, Perry’s Pantry Foodbank, Little Bundles, Humans MCR, Manchester South Central Foodbank, The S2 Foodbank Network, Grace Foodbank, Burngreave Foodbank, Baby Basics, Stannington Foodbank and Sheffield S6 Foodbank.",

      "\"If you want to support your local foodbank, contact them directly - many of them have direct donation options and are able to claim Gift Aid to boost your donation even further,\" Adam encouraged.",
      "While community support remains strong week in and week out, Football for Foodbanks is still in need of sponsorship. “We have been successful in some small funding applications over the years to enable us to build a website.",
      "\"We have had some very generous players over the years that have helped fund trophies, kits, or donated their time to referee our organised games, but we have not had formal sponsorship up to now.”",

      "Ruben Amorim has been full of praise for Heaven since his arrival from Arsenal, saying after the final day win over Aston Villa: \"Bringing Ayden... it is these kind of players that we need because he show a lot of character and quality after a big injury. We want this kind of player.\"",
      "Heaven has already shown himself to be more than capable of holding his own in the first team, and his addition could prove to be crucial as United look to build a squad able to challenge for a European spot next term.",
      "Should they complete a deal for Bryan Mbeumo, United will still have plenty of work to do in the market. A striker, midfielder, goalkeeper and maybe even a full-back are wanted at Old Trafford. It's a hefty to-do list for one summer, and so not having to add a centre-back to that list is a huge boost.",
      "Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans have both left the club, while Lisandro Martinez's injury means it is unclear when he will be available again. That leaves Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt and Leny Yoro as United's natural centre-back options, though Luke Shaw and Noussair Mazraoui can fill in if needed.",
      "Tyler Fredricson performed admirably when given a chance last season but it is perhaps still too soon to judge whether he could cut it in the Premier League week in, week out. Had Heaven not arrived in the mid-season window, with only three senior, natural centre-backs available to Ruben Amorim to fill the three spots in the back line, there's every chance United would have needed to add a new centre-back to their summer wishlist.",
      "Signing Heaven for little over £1m might have saved United millions."

      "Both are looking to bounce back under a new manager (or relatively new, in United's case), yet it is Spurs who can offer Champions League football next season while United's campaign will be restricted to domestic matters.",
      "But of course, it is impossible to take away the history and glamour of United. Last season was their lowest ebb of the Premier League era, and yet still they remain an attractive option.",

      "Man Utd are preparing to go head-to-head with Leeds United for a high-profile Serie A outcast, as the Premier League duo circle a player once billed as world-class. But only once the PSR deadline passes, according to a report.",
      "Leeds United have made the first move, with reports in Italy claiming an approach has already been made. The newly promoted side are looking to strengthen their midfield ahead of a tough Premier League campaign.",
      "Man Utd, meanwhile, are watching the situation closely. With heavy spending already secured a deal for Matheus Cunha and talks with Bryan Mbeumo ongoing, the club must tread carefully around financial regulations.",
      "That’s why they are expected to delay any further serious moves until next month.",
      "According to Calcio Mercato, the player attracting interest from both clubs is Douglas Luiz, who joined Juventus from Aston Villa in a £42m move just last summer.",
      "It’s been a rough ride in Italy. Luiz has failed to settle, fallen out of favour with manager Igor Tudor, and managed just 27 appearances in all competitions without a single goal or assist.",
      "Juventus would prefer to finalise a deal before June 30 to help balance their financial books ahead of the PSR deadline. As Calcio Mercato explains:",
      "“The sale of Douglas Luiz by June 30 – at least at the same cost – would therefore give a positive push to the club’s accounts.”",
      "The Serie A giants paid around £42m for Luiz last summer and are now hoping to recoup that figure in full to avoid posting a capital loss.",
      "With new boss Igor Tudor not counting on him, the report describes Luiz as “a 100% foreign body” and “out of every project.”",
      "Leeds are seen as the likeliest Premier League club able to strike early. Man Utd, however, are preparing to challenge that interest as soon as the financial reset kicks in.",
      "Sources in Italy suggest Luiz remains highly rated at Old Trafford and may be targeted if Leeds don’t firm up their interest and make progress with a deal in the coming days.",
      "There is also a Jadon Sancho subplot here. The winger has been linked with a move to Juventus, potentially as part of a deal involving Luiz.",
      "However, a proposed move to Fenerbahce now looks dead after Turkish outlet Fanatik claimed Jose Mourinho vetoed the transfer, citing concerns about Sancho’s professionalism.",
      "Luiz is not short of suitors. Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest have also been mentioned, but neither have made any official moves at this stage.",
      "According to reports, Leeds United would have to pay a ‘record’ fee to sign Fulham star Rodrigo Muniz after having an ‘offer rejected’ by their rivals.",
      "According to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, Manchester United have been ‘offered a swap deal’ to offload £86m flop Antony to Serie A giants Juventus.",
      "Manchester United are interested in the former Aston Villa star this summer and a £20m bid for a new defender ‘could be accepted’ by Fiorentina.",
      "A former Aston Villa star has spoken about his “desire to return” to the club after recently stating he “misses” it there and they are “always in my heart”.",
      "Manchester United reportedly failed with an attempt to sign Douglas Luiz on loan from Juventus in the ‘final hours’ of the winter transfer window.",

      "Both Premier League clubs are chasing the Sweden international this summer and were recently dealt a blow after Varandas dismissed reported claims that Gyokeres had a gentleman’s agreement to leave the club for well below his £85m asking price.",
      "The Gunners are said to have had a bid of around £55m rejected for the 27-year-old while United wait to find out which of Gyokeres or Benjamin Sesko will move to the Emirates before feeding on the ‘scraps’.",
      "Varandas has doubled down on his claim that Gyokeres ‘will not leave for €70m’ and cited the Arsenal and United transfers that have already been made or are set to be imminently confirmed this summer as the reason why.",
      "As quoted by the Portuguese media outlet A Bola, Varandas said: “Sporting is very calm about Gyokeres. Sporting does not need to sell Gyokeres.",
      "“We have already passed the stage where we had to sell our best assets. We do not have to sell him. In the same way that we do not have to sell him, we are still sensitive to Viktor ‘s dreams.",
      "“Sporting has a commitment, made by the president, not to ask for the value of the termination clause and to be reasonable in relation to Viktor’s performance last season.",
      "“If you ask me today, there is a strong possibility that Viktor will leave. We have been keeping an eye on the market, I saw a player like Zubimendi, who is six months younger than Viktor, go to Arsenal for €65 million (£55m).",
      "“I saw two players being sold in the Premier League – Matheus Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo – forwards who do not have the quality of Viktor, in my opinion, were sold for around €70m.",
      "“We are talking about players who are 26 years old. So, given the demands we are making in relation to Viktor ‘s value, I believe he could leave, unless he has the worst agent in the world. Which I find hard to believe.",
      "“I won’t say what the price we asked for. It was communicated to the agent. But I can guarantee that Viktor will not leave for €60+€10 million. Viktor already knows and I want Sporting fans to take advantage of this summer, in which they are two-time champions, in which they have a double, to celebrate, to be calm.",
      "“There are only two scenarios: one club respects the price requested by Sporting and Viktor will fulfil his dream, and from that moment we will be ready to attack the targets, or that club does not want Viktor and Viktor, with a three-year contract, stays at Sporting and we will be very happy.”",
      "We’re all tired of the Gyokeres or Sesko to Arsenal or Man Utd nonsense, but if we can just hang on the outcome looks set to be very, very funny.",
      "Gyokeres has come to an ‘agreement’ with Sporting over his transfer this summer while one ‘condemned’ Man Utd star is ‘set to stay’ after a shock U-turn.",

      "Gyokeres may still end up at Man Utd as Romano has rubbished claims that the striker has ‘said no’ to the move to Old Trafford amid interest from Arsenal.",

      "The England international has been dealt a major blow as the Catalans close in on Nico Williams as their new left winger, and although reports have suggested Flick is still keen on Rashford after sporting director Deco revealed last month that “we like” the Red Devils star, the La Liga giants’ financial struggles are providing a significant roadblock to his transfer.",
      "For their part, United want to seal his permanent exit in order to raise funds for their own rebuild and to get his £300,000-per-week salary off their wage bill, but a report from The Telegraph claims the club bosses now accept that they will now likely need to heavily subsidise loan moves for a number of their players this summer ‘with buying clubs ready to exploit the need to offload players before the start of the Premier League season’.",
      "The report states:",
      "‘[Alejandro] Garnacho, Rashford and Brazil forward Antony have contracts until 2028, which United are now expected to subsidise even if they leave the club and are playing for a rival. Jadon Sancho will also be allowed to leave after loans in the last two campaigns.",
      "United will look to negotiate “salary recovery” from loan deals for their players, although intermediaries believe their ‘bargaining power has been undermined by clearly wanting players off their books.’",
      "That report has led Tottenham News to claim United are ‘ready to seal a Rashford agreement with Tottenham’ as United paying a significant portion of his wages would be the only way Daniel Levy would sanction the move, but Rashford may well wait for Barcelona.",
      "He may well be waiting indefinitely though as a report from Spanish outlet Nacional has claimed Flick ‘has been clear: there is no place for him if there are no departures’.",
      "It’s claimed Ferran Torres and Robert Lewandowski are ‘the two options’ who could leave to open the door for Rashford, but ‘both look complicated’ as neither player wants to leave the club.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘At Barça they value his [Rashford’s] profile, his offensive versatility and his experience, but Flick believes that, with the arrival of Nico [Williams], the attack is already covered, and he does not want to incorporate unnecessary players that complicate the balance of the locker room or the management of the group.",
      "‘The Barça coach has made it clear that he does not want an oversized squad, especially in attack. With Nico Williams, Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Ferran Torres and Lewandowski, the offensive positions are more than covered. That’s why Flick has been categorical: Rashford could only arrive if a weight loss occurs first.’",
      "From Andrey Santos to Evan Ferguson, these returning Premier League loanees could make a real splash in the 2025/26 season – if they’re not sold first.",
      "Newcastle United are casting their net far and wide in the hunt for a new winger, according to reports.",
      "Newcastle have the ‘strongest interest’ in signing the Man Utd star this summer and are making ‘serious moves’ to beat Tottenham and other suitors to his signature.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona have made a significant decision on Manchester United star Marcus Rashford as they are ‘keen on a loan deal’.",
      "According to reports, one proposed Manchester United transfer is off as a manager has ‘made the decision’ to ‘block’ his club from completing a deal.",

      "“Dortmund are fighting for their player and do not want to sell him under any circumstances.”",
      "Nmecha featured 39 times in all competitions for Dortmund last season, scoring six goals and registering three assists. A regular fixture at Signal Iduna Park, he has become an important part of the setup despite the club’s inconsistent domestic campaign.",
      "Reports earlier in the year had valued Nmecha at closer to €50m, but BILD now claim Dortmund would consider bids in the region of €28m (£24m), offering a potential window of opportunity for clubs like Utd, who are watching the market closely.",
      "Dortmund, however, remain reluctant to let him go. The club’s position, according to Falk, is clear: they do not want to sell under any circumstances.",
      "With no release clause to trigger, any deal would require either a major bid or a change of stance from the Bundesliga side.",
      "According to the report, Nmecha’s familiarity with Manchester, having come through Man City’s academy before moving to Germany, is also seen as a plus. His experience in English football and language fluency could ease any transition, should the move progress.",
      "A subplot to any move would be a potential family reunion of sorts. Nmecha’s brother, Lukas, recently joined Leeds United, and the two clubs are set to face each other in a friendly this July as well as in the Premier League next season.",
      "For now, though, Utd’s interest remains tentative, and Dortmund’s hard stance means any transfer would be far from straightforward.",

      "On the back of a day in which Football365 published entirely contradictory stories on Arsenal’s painstaking choice between Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres, with one ‘ready to sign’ a few hours before a report insisted the other ‘will sign’, we were just about ready to call time on a transfer window which still has 66 days left to run.",
      "We even saw Fabrizio Romano looking ever so slightly exasperated at having to explain that Gyokeres “didn’t say no” to Manchester United but also definitely didn’t say yes as if he was talking Red Devils fans down from a ledge, and he bloody loves this stuff.",
      "He knows as well as we do that it’s these sort of transfer sagas that keep him in multiple mobiles and whatever else he spends his money on, and essentially pays our wages. And this one really is a doozy: two big-name strikers; two Premier League giants; desperation on each and every side.",
      "There are multiple angles to approach it from, opportunities for nuance for those tricksy headline writers and therefore thousands upon thousands of transfer-obsessed eyeballs lapping up every last update, U-turn and plot twist.",
      "We both want it to rumble on so we can garner those sweet, sweet clicks and for it to stop immediately so we can write about something, anything besides. But even if we have to grin and bear it for several more weeks while our advertisers rub their hands with glee, with a goal-orientated mindset we can all take solace in the likely outcome being very, very funny.",
      "The thought of United feeding on Arsenal’s transfer ‘scraps’ is in itself delightful. But far better than that is the very good chance that one of Gyokeres or Sesko will flop while the other shines having either won or lost the race to sign for Arsenal.",
      "Both being held in such high regard means it would be funny no matter which of them flops at which club. Manchester United spending another £60m-odd on a striker to score no goals is funny. Better than that? Gyokeres being that striker having scored them at a rate of one every 84 minutes under the very same manager at Sporting. That would excellent.",

      "But not as excellent as Arsenal starting the season with the striker they’ve needed for half a decade before reverting to Kai Havertz come Christmas and then Mikel Merino when it comes to the Champions League punch in March, before we’re all treated to the revisionist pundits insisting they didn’t ever think a striker was the answer anyway.",
      "And that brings us to our ideal scenario. We want Mikel Arteta and Andrea Berta, after what may or may not have been but have certainly been reported to be several flip flops between the two strikers, to choose Gyokeres as their flop because a) he has very little sell-on value as a 27-year-old, b) their concerns over him scoring goals in a minor league would prove to be amusingly well-founded, and c) (and this is absolutely the main reason) he was Manchester United’s first choice all along.",
      "Even if Sesko somehow weirdly decided there was a different option after being snubbed by Arsenal and didn’t join the transfer market scavengers, we will have been well sated by Gyokeres being utterly terrible for the Gunners given they will have both chosen him and won a battle with United to secure his signature. That’s good stuff.",
      "But of course (and we appreciate that we’re asking too much and probably don’t deserve such joy) the absolute best-case would be for Gyokeres to be absolute balls for Arsenal and Sesko to bang goals for Manchester United as the second-choice striker for the second-choice club. *Chef’s kiss*",

      "Amorim then performed a U-turn and backed the midfielder to see out his contract at Old Trafford as he wants to retain leaders in his dressing room, and now – having earned a shock recall for Brazil by Carlo Ancelotti earlier this month – Casemiro now wants to stay as he believes he has a better chance of playing in the 2026 World Cup if he remains at United.",

      "These eleven Premier League players are all expected to move clubs this summer. It’s a pretty decent side, to be fair.",
      "Players expected to make intra-Premier League moves took priority for us, as they’re more interesting — with a couple of exceptions, like European champions Paris Saint-Germain wanting a Bournemouth player.",
      "",
      "GK: Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa)\nHe cried as he waved goodbye to the Villa Park faithful in Aston Villa’s penultimate match of the season. There aren’t many clearer signs a player is leaving than that, surely?",
      "Martinez is ready for a fresh challenge and is apparently desperate to join Manchester United, which should be enough to put off other potential suitors, because honestly, what is he on?",
      "We also had the option to pick from Chelsea’s goalkeepers. Kepa Arrizabalaga is closing in on a move to Arsenal, youngster Mike Penders will leave on loan to continue his progression into a Thibaut Courtois regen, and Djordje Petrovic is surplus to requirements after a stellar campaign on loan at Strasbourg in France.",
      "",
      "RB: Axel Disasi (Chelsea)\nThe majority of the Chelsea squad would be sold in an instant if a decent enough bid comes in. There are some exceptions like Cole Palmer and Moises Caicedo, with the money the Blues would accept being at world-record level — which is never going to be offered.",
      "Disasi spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and frequently played right-back for them after doing so for Chelsea. He’s 27 now and clearly not wanted at Stamford Bridge. His Villa Park loan didn’t do much to increase his value, but the Blues will be confident they can flog him back to France, or maybe even Saudi Arabia if it comes to that.",
      "",
      "CB: Nayef Aguerd (West Ham)\nFor pure variety reasons, we have shifted Disasi to the right and brought in Aguerd, rather than including Aston Villa youngster and natural right-back Kosta Nedeljkovic right after Martinez.",
      "Despite hoping to avoid returning loanees when possible, we’ve gone back-to-back in that respect. Moroccan international Aguerd spent last season at Real Sociedad and a permanent departure is on the cards.",
      "There’s interest from Italy in the form of Juventus and Roma, which kind of suggests he should be starting for West Ham…",
      "",
      "CB: Illia Zabarnyi (Bournemouth)\nPerhaps the most debatable name on this list as Bournemouth have already sold half of their defence and aren’t re-signing their on-loan goalkeeper, but PSG are hell-bent on landing Zabarnyi. The writing is on the wall.",
      "Zabarnyi is a very impressive young centre-back who was overshadowed by the younger Dean Huijsen, who has signed for Real Madrid. Milos Kerkez has also joined Liverpool for £40million. Bournemouth are going to look very different next season.",
      "",
      "LB: Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nArsenal are going to get rubbish money for Zinchenko, but they’ll still move him on. He only has one year left on his contract and earns £150,000 a week [Capology], so anything over £10million will probably suffice.",
      "There’s reportedly interest from Atletico Madrid, who are also considering signing Liverpool’s Andy Robertson. In the Premier League, Fulham have been linked as Marco Silva looks to continue his evil plan to become Arsenal B.",

      "",
      "CM: Kalvin Phillips (Manchester City)\nWe really have zero clue what’s next for Phillips. This never seemed possible, but even Leeds United are reportedly unwilling to go near him now. Every player in this XI has interest, but not Phillips. It’s anyone’s guess where he ends up. The idea of a move to Rangers or Celtic makes so much sense in my head. More so Rangers — he feels right for Russell Martin’s system.",
      "Phillips spent last season on loan at Ipswich Town, who got relegated with a pathetic 22 points. He had his injury problems, but looked poor at the start of the season and got sent off against Leicester City on matchday 10, which resulted in a one-game ban. He didn’t return for nearly two months thanks to an ankle injury and being an unused substitute three times.",
      "If he couldn’t get sufficient minutes for the second-worst team in the Premier League, how is he expected to stay at Man City? Well, he isn’t.",
      "",
      "CM: Sean Longstaff (Newcastle United)\nThe pure profit Newcastle are seeking from the sale of Longstaff should help them, though we can’t imagine him fetching a large fee. If Christian Norgaard is worth £10m, surely he is worth around the same, taking into account his homegrown status.",
      "Newcastle have outgrown Longstaff, and there’s minimal chance he usurps Sandro Tonali or Bruno Guimaraes in Eddie Howe’s pecking order. Those two are in a different stratosphere, with all due respect.",
      "",
      "CM: Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\nIncluding Eberechi Eze was tempting, but he’s not guaranteed to leave Crystal Palace, is he? There’s a decent chance he does, but it’s hard to envision him pushing for an exit and getting all arsey about it.",
      "Elliott has discussed his future, saying he doesn’t want to waste his best years sitting on the bench for Liverpool, and there should be lots of clubs interested in signing him this summer. Everton are a frustratingly good fit, but that doesn’t seem likely because of, you know, the rivalry and that.",

      "",
      "RW: Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nManchester United looked destined to sign Mbeumo but have been messing around with their valuation, with Brentford standing very firm. This has allowed Tottenham Hotspur to creep in, and even with Thomas Frank’s appointment, the Cameroonian hasn’t exactly had his head turned. He’s certainly open to joining Spurs if the Red Devils don’t get a grip, but Old Trafford is his preferred destination.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is an honourable mention. Bournemouth are under no pressure to sell and their asking price is reportedly £70m, which Semenyo is not worth.",
      "",
      "LW: Jadon Sancho (Manchester United)\nSancho and his pal Marcus Rashford are both available, but the latter’s wages make his exit more complicated. The former is also on a lot of money, but not as much, has played abroad before, and has a lower asking price; he’s clearly the more realistic permanent departure.",
      "Rumours of a move to Fenerbahce to play under Jose Mourinho have unfortunately been quashed, but there’s also interest from Italian clubs Napoli and Juventus.",
      "",
      "ST: Joao Pedro (Brighton)\nChelsea and Newcastle are both vying for Pedro’s signature this summer, and despite his departure leaving Brighton very light up front, it looks inevitable after a difficult end to 2024/25, which reportedly involved a training ground bust-up with Jan Paul van Hecke.",

Even if it’s just that Liverpool make a move upon which they are told to f*** all the way off. But selling Isak doesn’t have to be the end of the world for Newcastle.",
      "",
      "18) Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nArsenal’s ‘dream signing’, apparently. And it could be a go-er since the Brazilian has had his nose put out of joint by Real, and he’s asked to leave. Real have even lowered their asking price from £85million since it became clear absolutely no one was prepared to pay that much.

The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",

      "16) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nSpurs are reported to have piqued Mbeumo’s interest and the prospect of staying in London to play for a manager he trusts would certainly appeal. But now United have returned to Brentford with a second offer, how serious are Spurs about reuniting Mbeumo and Thomas Frank?",
      "",
      "15) Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle failed with an opening £45m offer for Elanga, with Forest apparently looking for £60million. Which seems… excessive? Newcastle have sought to compromise at £50million. Forest are thinking it over…",
      "",
      "14) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nSpurs and Arsenal are reportedly set to battle it out for the FA Cup-winning England star, who is unlikely to leave Palace for less than his £68m release clause.

If you think you’ve heard that before, it’s because you have. But United could become the Swede’s most viable option for a big move this summer. Once the Red Devils sell the players that almost no one wants to buy. For now, though, we’d still make Arsenal favourites… just.",
      "",
      "12) Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal have already had one bid rejected for the Spain Under-21 centre-back but they aren’t done. A second round of talks is scheduled but given the speed at which Arsenal are working this summer, we hold little hope of a swift resolution.",
      "",
      "11) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nEven if Sesko is the man most wanted at Arsenal, the Gunners see an opportunity to get more bang for their buck with Gyokeres. The Swede has made it abundantly clear that he wants to leave Sporting, going as far as telling them he won’t report for pre-season training next week. So time is of the essence for Gyokeres but Arsenal are working to their own timetable even if Mikel Arteta wants a new striker to be boarding the plane for the pre-season tour on July 19.",
      "",
      "10) Joao Pedro – Brighton to Newcastle\nChelsea were linked with the Brighton striker but Newcastle always seemed most keen, which has led to a £50million offer. Brighton reportedly wanted £60million initially, but the forward has made it clear he wants to move on. We would expect the Magpies and Seagulls to find common ground soon. Pedro won’t be going to from the south coast to the North-East to play second fiddle. So what could that mean for Alexander Isak?",

      "9) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Trafford wants the move and Newcastle have offered Burnley £25million plus add-ons. They have already secured a keeper of their own but we expect they’ll squeeze Newcastle a bit more here.",

      "8) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal are still refusing to pick a lane. The momentum swung with Sesko, then Gyokeres, now it seems the Slovenian is back in the running. Indeed, some reports suggest Sesko is the preferred option among the big-hitters at Arsenal but Leipzig aren’t willing to roll over and have their bellies tickled. Honestly, we don’t know.",

      "7) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nOnly the fact that United have made a second bid puts them ahead of Tottenham. We’re still waiting to see Spurs’ reaction and whether they counter – Brentford will pray they do something to prolong any bidding war. Apparently, United have been having conversations with the Bees so we have to assume they are confident this offer will suffice, but only if Daniel Levy and Thomas Frank don’t show similar intent.",
      "",
      "6) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nCity have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder and a medical was scheduled for almost a fortnight ago, but we’ve heard nothing since while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",
      "",
      "6) Jarell Quansah – Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen\nA £34million deal has been agreed – that’s decent money for a back-up centre-back – but Quansah won’t be heading to Germany until after he’s faced them in the European Under-21 Championship final.",
      "",
      "4) Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nNice and easy, this, because of the £5million clause in his Chelsea contract. A reminder: he joined them for £72million and remains the world’s most-expensive goalkeeper. Apparently, Kepa has done his medical and put pen to paper on a deal that should give David Raya the heebie-jeebies.",

      "2) Christian Norgaard – Brentford to Arsenal\nWe thought Brentford might attempt to squeeze more out of Arsenal after their initial bid but it seems £10million plus add-ons has done the trick. A medical is in the offing.",

      "1) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment six weeks ago but, finally, the midfielder is in London to sign for Arsenal for £51million. Actually, he’s been there since Monday so we expected an unveiling by now, but we may have to wait for next week."

      "What does Liverpool know about PSR…?\nTo funstar andy:\nNo, Liverpool wasnt always top 5 or top 8 since the 1950s. Why, there’s a gigantic statue of Bill Shankly becos he won LFC the championship in 1962… the 2nd division championship (back when the top division was division one). We spent at least a couple years looking up from a lower division.",
      "And big 6? Maybe. For some periods of time.",
      "But after we were sold to Dumb and Dumber Hicks and Gillette, who proceeded to shave us bald (ok, cold joke), we almost went bankrupt in 2010. If FSG (then known as NESV) hadnt convinced RBS to sell us for £300mil, we’d have been in administration, booted to Champo division, with no guarantee that we’d be back. We most definitely werent big 6 back then, as recently as 2010, barely 15 years ago.",
      "We had Roy Hodgson for manager (whom Stevie G thot the world of, lol, whilst he was critical of Rafa for playing him in his most devastating position of 10 or RW or LW just not 8 or 6), who bought Mark Konchesky for LB. We were in relegation positions when Roy was finally sacked after half a season. We had Joe Cole, whom Stevie G compared to Messi in training, and whom we spent years part paying his salary to get him off our books. We had Milan Jovanovic as our big ticket free agent, porn star lookalike Andriy Voronin as 10, no kidding. And we cheered for david ngog who was an improvement. Torres couldnt wait to jump off the boat the moment he got healthy and better.",
      "2010. FSG brought us back. However tightwad fans think they are, i’d always be grateful to them. They literally brought us back from our darkest time in recent memory.",
      "I know u guys had mike ashley for 14 years from 2007 till 2021. That’s a terrible decade and half, bouncing between divisions. But trust me, u dont want to get anywhere near bankruptcy, the way we did. It was a time lfc could really have disappeared for good.",
      "So no, we werent always top 6 since the 1950s. We almost disappeared in 2010, not too long ago.",
      "As tightwad as fsg are, and as frustrated as i am with them sometimes, they’ve proven their financially prudent management works. The club is profitable and the asset value has risen from £300 mil in 2010 to £3-4bil today. All without investing the kinds of crazy sums that sugar daddies do. (Read: forest, everton). In net spend terms, we’ve been consistently 5th or below, outspent by other clubs below us. So it’s doable, with lots of luck, skill, hard work.",

      "I thought Ldjub – LFC stranded in Salford’s mail thoughtful and interesting; his “do it the right way” point was fairly persuasive.",
      "And Danny, LFC NY (now London) made fair points about the desire of many (most, I’d say) Newcastle supporters to ignore or even venerate the club’s new Saudi owners. And I agree with him that there’s too much whining about PSR from our lot.",
      "Although neither is completely wrong, I think both of them are oversimplifying these matters.",
      "While it’s true that the ostensible reason for PSR was to prevent clubs from unsustainable and destructive spending, that hasn’t particularly worked. Everton is only one EPL club that’s been in financial hot water (and I’m not just talking points deductions) since the rules were introduced. Heck, Ruben Amorim was insisting that ManU was about to go bankrupt at the start of their current spending spree.",
      "Additionally, because I gather that the rules only apply in the EPL, they do nothing to protect the clubs below them, where we’ve seen a number of clubs in dire straits recently. Those are the clubs that need PSR.",
      "Anyway, given that PIF is the richest club owner in the world, what exactly are these rules protecting us from?",
      "I’ve always suspected that PSR rules were also intended to rein in the growth of player costs; if so, it has failed utterly, to the sorrow of us relative minnows.",
      "Whatever the “reasons” for PSR, their effect has been confusion and frustration for clubs and their supporters, as the rules have militated against long- term planning, particularly for clubs bouncing in and out of the UCL. Nobody, but nobody, wanted to sell Elliott Anderson; PSR made that happen. On the other hand, that ridiculous deal last summer might have been (for us) the result of counting unhatched chickens with the Tonali and Gordon buys, given the 2023-24 league table.",
      "And every Liverpool supporter should understand that they were already among the richest clubs in the world in 2013, no matter how long it had been since they’d won the league: 10th in the world, according to a 2014 Forbes article using 2013 data. This was also the year that Real Madrid replaced ManU as the world’s wealthiest club.",
      "Whether Liverpool’s earlier long domination of English football was a result of doing things “the right way” is an open question, as far as I’m concerned. How often were they able to throw their financial weight around with smaller clubs? A lot, I’m guessing.",
      "But still, I’m hugely ambivalent about PSR. It frustrates me on behalf of clubs like Newcastle and Forest. But by not allowing a club like Newcastle to buy a billion dollars worth of players this summer, they do prevent all clubs (except evidently Chelsea) from just buying success. That’s a good thing. And yet again, they have contributed to a concentration of wealth at the top. That’s bad.",
      "I think there are versions of PSR that really would work and be fair, but this version ain’t one.",
      "(Also, Danny was just wrong about our recent signings. This is our fourth consecutive window without a first- team signing. It’s not complete, and we’ll sign players, but I should think James, NUFC could be forgiven for calling 22 months two years.)\nChris C, Toon Army DC",

But then, as a City fan, there’s always going to be an element of “He would say that wouldn’t he?” Which is fair enough and, importantly, it was only one game. But the main takeaway I have from that article is that the new signings meant that City ‘purred.’ They did. And in a competitive game, not a pre-season friendly.",

      "I saw in your reporting of Ronado’s extended deal with Al Nassr that you described him as a veteran which I’m going to suggest is inaccurate. Might I propose the following labels for outfield player lifestages:",
      "Teenagers: Depending on potential, must be described as one of ‘prospect’ if they’re average, ‘sensation’ if they have moments of brilliance, ‘prodigy’ if they’re enigmatic and not from Europe and ‘wunderkind’ if they’re already pretty good and from Europe.",
      "Early 20’s: Depending on the club they’re at and how often they’re featuring and how well they’re performing must be described as ‘player’ if they’re average, ‘mercurial’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has flashes of incredible, ‘middling’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has periods of rubbish and ‘star’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "Late 20’s: As above, but ‘journeyman’ if they’re average, ‘frustrating’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has flashes of incredible, ‘dross’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has periods of rubbish and ‘world class’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "Early 30’s: As above, but ‘experienced’ if they’re average, ‘unfulfilled potential’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has flashes of incredible, ‘stealing a wage’ if they’re inconsistent in a way that is mostly average but has periods of rubbish and ‘a wise head’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "Mid-late 30’s: As above although by now there are only two types, ‘veterans’ if they’re average but reliably so and ‘legends’ if they’re consistently performing.",
      "After the late 30’s is no time for professional outfielders to be seriously playing and so the only labels available are ‘sad geriatric’ if they’re clogging around at the base of the league pyramid, probably doing so in the number 43 shirt because 4+3=7 and they used to wear 7 or ‘delusional egomaniac’ if they’re still clinging on in any kind of credible league while demanding a single digit squad number.",

      "ABUism…\nHello F365,",
      "I’d normally edit this down before sending it in, but during this period of off-season somnolence, I reckon you’re desperate enough to print it in full. So fair warning: it’s long.",
      "There’s an often-discussed feeling many of us can relate to: when that little-known band you follow suddenly make it big, when that book you enjoyed years ago gets made into a lavish HBO series and everyone is talking about it, or when that under-18s player you’ve been tracking through youth tournaments and reserve appearances steps up to the first team and bosses the midfield like a seasoned pro. Probably the Germans have a word for it: that mixture of pride, satisfaction, excitement, smugness, but also an indefinable sense of loss, as the special thing which was known only to yourself and a few other obsessive nerds goes mainstream. Now national journalists are writing in-depth columns about this exciting new thing, and the most basic of armchair fans is telling you, ‘Oh I really like so-and-so, have you heard of them?’",
      "There have been many heartwarmingly hilarious things about Man Utd’s decline over the last decade-plus: Moyes, Fellaini, Pogba, Ed Woodward, Antony. The club has been like a clown car that just keeps giving out: every time you think enough daftness has emerged from that apparently-finite-sized vehicle, out pops another grinning idiot in polyester wig and enormous shoes, tripping over his own feet and crashing into lampposts.",
      "But spare a moment’s thought for the ABU. Utd’s continued dedication to wringing the neck of their own legacy has turned everyone not born within 30 miles of TTOD into a loud, proud member of the ABU gang. ABUism has gone mainstream. I’ve been growing a touch concerned by how easy it is for this new generation to flaunt their Utd-baiting credentials, so I’m going to offer some important historical context to the younger ABUers out there.",
      "READ: Newcastle blame Manchester United, makes Rashford U-turn and launch worst £125m ‘triple-swoop’ ever",
      "You see, ABUism didn’t used to be so easy. I know this will shock some, but back in the day, Man Utd were good; and when they weren’t good, they were lucky, and when they weren’t good or lucky they were still twice as rich as everyone else. Being an ABU in those days was lonely work. As Man Utd hoovered up title after title, with one of the most stubborn managers in history helming every aspect of the club with iron authority, us ABUs were the laughing stock of school playgrounds and pub saloons up and down the country. Where to turn, for the humiliated ABU, as Utd win the league with 79 points? How do you maintain your dignity, when Utd have just won three league titles in a row and another UCL on top, and we’ve stopped even bothering to count the FA and league cups?",
      "In those days, us ABUs had to nurture the flame of our passion quietly, even secretively. I grew up in suburban south London, where Man Utd ‘supporters’ were ten-a-dozen. Being an ABU in those circumstances was not easy, but for some of us, it was never a conscious choice. My dad was an ABU; his dad was an ABU. Cut me open and I bleed ABU. To this day, my old man proudly recounts the tale to anyone who’ll listen of how my mum tried to put a red dummy in my mouth and I spat it on the floor. ‘Fuck United!’ I babbled, and these were my very first words.",
      "Back when Utd were so good they were inevitable, being an ABU meant something. For many Utd supporters, That Night in Barcelona stands as the greatest moment in their sporting lives; and in a way it was for me, too, but for entirely opposite reasons. As I sat in the bosom of three generations of my ABU family, and together we watched that Norwegian goblin prod the ball home for the most undeserving winning goal in the history of sport, and wept as those scarlet-bibbed idiots celebrated in a sweaty Manc pile, I knew I belonged: the passionate, white-hot hatred I felt was meaning, purpose, identity, community. The very next morning, my old man and I got matching tattoos: a camp little devil being sodomised by a Kaiser Wilhelm-style old dude. The devil screams his safe word: ABU! ABU! But Kaiser Wilhelm is just laughing and sodomising, laughing and sodomising. My girlfriend has begged me to get this tattoo lasered off (it’s in a very particular, usually-covered place). I’ve told her repeatedly: I love you, you’re my soulmate, we’ll grow old together. But I would sooner die than erase this part of myself.",
      "It was a tough, brutal time, and sometimes you had to defend your ABU beliefs with your life. But it inculcated a defiance, a determination to persist. We were hacking through the tough times towards those longed-for sunlit uplands. And now – here we are. The sunlit uplands are everything we hoped for: bountiful, nourishing and, most importantly, hilarious. Every year, Utd find new depths of ineptitude to plumb. Every year their rhetoric grows more and more detached from reality. Every year they circle closer to the holy grail, the utopia of relegation. And yet, something feels slightly off, for me at least. I look around at the happy faces of the new, young breed of ABUs, those who’ve never known anything but success, never known first-hand quite how terrifyingly omnipotent Utd can be. I meet the eyes of my fellow lifelong ABUs, those of us past 35ish years old, and I see old scars lurking beneath the merriment. Are there enough of us still standing? Some, it is true, have started to abandon the battlefield, wearied by the fight. They say they feel sorry for Utd, that the Prem needs a strong Utd to make it competitive. Let them go: we don’t need them. But those of us who remain are constantly totting up the numbers, evaluating the condition of our fellow warriors. The young’uns are untested in the theatre of war, so how trustworthy are they really? What if, against all reason, sense and logic, Amorim’s plan starts to bear fruit? What if Mbuemo and Cunha turn Utd into the most potent attack in the league? What if they raise north of £200m selling Onana, Maguire, Mainoo, Antony, Sancho, Rashford and Hoijlund, and reinvest it efficiently and effectively? What if, revitalised, they start chasing down Liverpool, Arsenal and City? If Utd rise again, will the new generation of ABUs have the grit to see it through? Or will they, like so many previous generations of Surrey-based milksops, fold under the pressure and start claiming, ‘Well I’ve supported them since my dad drove past the Trafford Centre once in 1976’?",
      "I didn’t mean for this to develop into an ‘aging-man-gets-angry-at-the-modern-world-as-it-races-away-from-him’ diatribe. I don’t want to denigrate the young’uns out there, taking their first steps into the world of ABUism. But I just want them to know – if any of them have put down their Tiktoks long enough to read this far – that it wasn’t always this easy to laugh at Man Utd. For two decades, it was really bloody difficult, actually. And despite the absolute calamity of the last few years, the club remains rich enough and prestigious enough to mount a comeback. So it might happen. If that day comes, me and the other OGs are gonna be out here, standing tall, the old defiance rekindled, ready to ride again. Can we rely on you youngers to stand alongside us, even as Utd drop £250m on a 28-year-old Lamine Yamal and go on to win their second treble in two seasons?",

      "From Andrey Santos at Chelsea to Evan Ferguson at Brighton, these returning Premier League loanees could make a real splash in the 2025/26 season – if they’re not sold first.",
      "",
      "Andrey Santos (Chelsea)\nChelsea have a decision to make: keep Santos and make him a useful squad player, or cash in after an incredible season on loan at Strasbourg.",
      "Arsenal are reportedly interested in signing the Brazilian midfielder and if the Blues receive a very handsome offer they probably would sell; they have Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo, and seem to value profit over keeping very capable players.",
      "Should Santos stay at Stamford Bridge, he is guaranteed to make a positive impact. There’s a lot of football to be played next season and Chelsea will be jaded going into the campaign after the Club World Cup.",
      "He should be above Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall in Enzo Maresca’s pecking order and competing with Romeo Lavia as Fernandez’s deputy. And given Lavia’s injury issues, Santos could become an important player if he isn’t flogged in the summer transfer window.",
      "",
      "Enzo Barrenechea (Aston Villa)\nThere is a strong chance the young defensive midfielder stays at Valencia after a very productive season on loan, but Aston Villa head coach Unai Emery really should consider keeping Barrenechea around.",
      "Valencia massively benefited from the appointment of Carlos Corberan as head coach, enjoying a dramatic upturn in results as the players began enjoying their football in a functional system.",
      "They were in relegation trouble when the ex-West Brom boss joined, but after losing his first game against Real Madrid, Corberan enjoyed a run of only two La Liga defeats – against Barcelona and Atletico Madrid – in 17 matches.",
      "Barrenechea was central to that success and won’t have minded missing the 7-1 defeat to Barca. He could make a real impact at Villa next season.",
      "MORE: Transfer rumour power ranking: Gyokeres to Man Utd on again as Arsenal eye Sesko, Eze",
      "",
      "Julio Enciso (Brighton)\nIpswich weren’t very good last season, but Enciso was a rare positive. Unfortunately for them, he was only on loan and is back at Brighton. He’d have torn it up in the Championship.",
      "After an awful meniscus tear in August 2023, Enciso was used sparingly in the latter stages of 2023/24 and a loan move made perfect sense.",
      "Playing for relegation favourites was risky for his development but we reckon the big-fish-small-pond transfer worked out pretty well. Not spectacularly well, but Brighton will be content with their youngster’s season at Portman Road.",
      "There’s talk of a permanent exit this summer but Brighton know how good the Paraguayan can become. It feels like him or Facundo Buonanotte will leave, or at least depart on loan again, but Fabian Hurzeler would benefit from having a creative attacking midfielder like Enciso next term.",
      "",
      "Eli Junior Kroupi (Bournemouth)\nMore a forgotten signing than a returnee, Kroupi was signed by Bournemouth for around £10million in the January transfer window, staying at Lorient until the end of 2024/25.",
      "It was absolutely the correct decision to keep the 19-year-old in France. In 30 Ligue 2 appearances, he scored an impressive 22 goals and helped Lorient gain promotion as champions.",
      "Kroupi is primed for another loan, probably to an English club this time, but with Enes Unal still injured and Antoine Semenyo expected to leave, there could be sufficient minutes available to justify keeping him around.",
      "He is a young French attacker with tonnes of potential, and that alone should be enough to get Bournemouth fans excited.",
      "",
      "Kosta Nedeljkovic (Aston Villa)\nVilla were delighted to sign one of the most promising right-backs in Europe, but young Nedeljkovic hasn’t had much of a chance to impress in the Premier League.",
      "Shipped out to Leipzig in February, the German club have an option to buy Nedeljkovic this summer. Should they opt not to exercise that option, the 19-year-old Serbian will be ready to usurp Matty Cash as Villa’s first-choice right-back — that is, of course, assuming Emery doesn’t bring in another.",
      "",
      "Zeki Amdouni (Burnley)\nThere is plenty of interest in Amdouni, but Burnley fans are hopeful he stays around after a year on loan at Portuguese giants Benfica.",
      "He is another player with an option to buy included in their loan agreement and after scoring 10 goals in 45 matches last term, a decision has not yet been made.",
      "Burnley would likely be content with a decent fee for Amdouni, but if he isn’t sold, he could be a real asset for Scott Parker’s newly-promoted side.",
      "",
      "Evan Ferguson (Brighton)\nWell, Ferguson’s career is not going in the direction the vast majority of us anticipated. He was supposed to be the next big thing, the next big-money Brighton sale, getting them over £100million, but no — he’s absolutely nowhere near attracting that sort of fee.",
      "After a failed West Ham loan (eight matches, zero goals or assists — yikes), it’s anyone’s guess what happens with Ferguson. Will Brighton decide to sell and risk him reaching his astronomical potential elsewhere, or persist and hope he can blossom at the Amex?",
      "Should they opt for the latter, the Seagulls won’t make Ferguson their first-choice centre-forward, but if he impresses off the bench, Hurzeler will be well aware that the 20-year-old’s stock can rise significantly once again.",
      "MORE TRANSFER FEATURES\n👉 Manchester United pair among greatest market value decreases in Premier League players this year\n👉 Man Utd, Chelsea starlets three of 10 Premier League youngsters ripe for loan\n👉 Fofana to Arsenal? Lyon players reassigned to Premier League clubs after Ligue 1 expulsion",
      "",
      "Fabio Vieira (Arsenal)\nThe chances of a significant return impact are low, but not non-existent.",
      "He might be lightweight and yet to really prove himself in 33 Premier League appearances, but Vieira’s technical ability will always create the lingering thought that he could come good.",
      "Arsenal could’ve done with Vieira last season when Martin Odegaard was injured and then struggling in the second half of the campaign — and that lack of attacking midfield depth could be what convinces Mikel Arteta to give the Portuguese playmaker another chance.",
      "",
      "Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nNever going to happen, is it? But if Ruben Amorim and Rashford don’t put their differences behind them and promise to be better in their relationship, the latter is going to be leaving on loan every single summer until his contract expires. That might be more useful than ripping up his contract now, but it’s still wildly impractical for everyone involved.",
      "Rashford just needs to enjoy his football and be shown a bit of love from his manager to thrive. He looked electric at times on loan at Aston Villa last season, and United boss Amorim is actively seeking a difference-making attacker in the transfer window. You’ve got one right here, mate. Come on…kiss and make up.",
      "",
      "Ben Doak (Liverpool)\nAnother long shot, but if Liverpool don’t sign a new winger this summer, Arne Slot might be tempted to hand young Doak some minutes.",
      "We’re not expecting him to become a regular starter even if the stars align, but the Scottish international has an incredible amount of potential and could develop into a very capable back-up next season.",
      "Man Utd are ‘ready to seal a Rashford agreement’ with their Premier League rivals as Barcelona boss Hansi Flick has told him ‘weight loss’ is required for his transfer.",
      "Newcastle United are casting their net far and wide in the hunt for a new winger, according to reports.",
      "Newcastle have the ‘strongest interest’ in signing the Man Utd star this summer and are making ‘serious moves’ to beat Tottenham and other suitors to his signature.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona have made a significant decision on Manchester United star Marcus Rashford as they are ‘keen on a loan deal’.",
      "According to reports, one proposed Manchester United transfer is off as a manager has ‘made the decision’ to ‘block’ his club from completing a deal.",
      "Marcus Rashford may be denied his ‘dream’ move to Barcelona as ‘heavyweights’ at the club are concerned over his dressing room impact."

      "Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has reportedly informed his club and Tottenham ‘of his decision to sign’ for Manchester United, following a ‘trust’ suggestion relating to Thomas Frank.",
      "Mbeumo’s future has been up in the air for a while. That’s been less about if he’s going to leave Brentford – after 20 Premier League goals last term – but which of two clubs he was going to sign for.",
      "United were the early frontrunners, but Tottenham took up a good position when former Brentford boss Frank was named their manager, before it was again suggested Mbeumo would stick with his first choice of United, and then reports of a U-turn surfaced.",
      "Now, there seems to be a definitive answer, as one of the most trusted insiders in the game, David Ornstein has stated in The Athletic that Mbeumo has ‘informed Brentford and Tottenham of his decision to sign for United if he makes a transfer this summer’.",
      "Despite interest from Spurs and some other Premier League clubs, who seemed to have less chance, the Brentford striker wants to join United, subject to the clubs reaching an agreement.",
      "Talks are continuing between them after two bids from United have been turned down, the latest of an overall package of £62.5million, as United look to ‘find a compromise’.",
      "It’s suggested Tottenham are no longer in pursuit of Mbeumo, which is said to be a ‘stance that might change only if United do not complete the acquisition.",
      "Spurs knew they were in a battle, but for Frank, knowing that one of the most trusted players he has worked with does not want to do so again.",
      "Robbie Keane suggested trust was something the manager would look for when compiling his Tottenham squad, but it seems that trust will not be returned by Mbeumo.",
      "Keane said: ‘All eyes will be on the transfer window now. When a manager comes in, he always wants to bring his own people in. Whether that’s Brentford players or not, I’m not sure, but he certainly knows he can trust his former players.",
      "‘Bryan Mbeumo is one who I think could come and fit in well. He’s had good season, scored some goals and got some assists, and now has teams like Man Utd looking at him. I’d expect him to do very well at Spurs.’",
      "But unless United’s negotiations come to a screeching halt, Frank won’t be able to reunite with Mbeumo, while former Bees midfielder Christian Norgaard is also being taken off the table, by now-rivals Arsenal.",
      "According to reports, Man Utd have made a shock £30m ‘offer’ for a Bryan Mbeumo alternative as the club bosses deem Brentford’s demands ‘excessive’.",
      "Including Man Utd target Bryan Mbeumo and Liverpool star Harvey Elliott, these 11 Premier League players are all expected to move clubs this summer.",
      "According to reports, Brentford have set an ‘enormous demand’ for Bryan Mbeumo as Manchester United target the 20-goal forward.",
      "Three factors are key to PSR-ed Newcastle United producing a repeat of Liverpool’s £4bn growth, while it’s the ‘same old Spurs’ under Thomas Frank…",
      "Manchester United and Brentford have agreed a fee for the transfer of Tottenham Hotspur transfer target Bryan Mbeumo, according to reports.",

      "Teddy Sheringham has praised Bruno Fernandes for staying at “big club” Manchester United while they “aren’t at the top of their game.”",
      "Fernandes has been United’s best player for essentially his entire spell there. He’s deservedly the captain, being the club’s talisman, with 98 goals and 86 assists in 290 games there.",
      "Last season, Fernandes was quite obviously the best player at United by some way, as he was directly involved in 19 Premier League goals during a 15th-placed season, and helped push them to the Europa League final with seven goals and four assists.",
      "This summer, he had the opportunity to head to Saudi Arabia, with Al-Hilal reportedly offering £100million for his services, but he turned it down.",
      "At the time, he said he still wanted to play “at the highest level possible,” which is in Europe.",
      "Sheringham has praised the United captain for not ditching the club despite them being in hard times.",
      "He told Racing Tipster: “I think it’s great that Fernandes wants to stay. He realises what a big club United are. United probably had that same thought, where they could have sold him to Saudi Arabia for 100 million or something like that, for a 30-year-old.",
      "“They could have landed big money to really start recharging the batteries at United with new players.",
      "“But good on Fernandes. He realises that United obviously aren’t at the top of their game at the moment, but they’re still one of the biggest football clubs around. You want to stay there for as long as you can.",
      "“I really like Bruno. He’s head and shoulders the best player. You would much rather have a Manchester United team with him in it than without him.”",
      "It is clear that United are a better side with Fernandes in, and they are fortunate that he was strong enough to turn down what was reported as a three-year contract worth around £200million.",
      "That sort of money is not likely to be offered within Europe, but if a big sum did come in from a club in the continent who are of a comfortably higher standing that United, there’s a chance the Red Devils would not have been so lucky.",
      "But whether anyone in Europe will come in with a big offer for him after he showed loyalty to United is a question in itself now, with the fact Fernandes is soon to be 31 also a potential barrier to a big move.",
      "Man Utd have spent a mere £1.7bn since Sir Alex Ferguson retired at the end of 2012/13. That’s a lot of wonga for zero Premier League titles…",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "England fans were so unimpressed by the drab win over Andorra that only two people wrote in about it – more were interested in defending Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has been eviscerated in the Mailbox but there is plenty of time and space to thank Ange Postecoglou for making Spurs interesting again.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is a ‘whiny baby’ who ‘was never world class’ and has screwed Manchester United players over with a decision based entirely on his ‘ego’.",
      "In which the Mirror do weird things with Bruno Fernandes quotes both ancient and modern, Florian Wirtz is absolutely furious and Mary Earps should be more like Joe Root."

      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘politely declined’ the chance to sign a striker who scored just three goals last season, as his club attempted to secure a swap deal for Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "United have already given up on Hojlund. The £72million striker looked positive in his first season at Old Trafford, with 16 goals in all competitions.",
      "Last term, though, his 10-goal return included just four strikes in 32 Premier League games, against higher level opposition than in the Europa League, where he scored six times.",
      "United are looking to get at least some of their original outlay back for Hojlund, and are welcoming offers.",
      "It’s been heavily reported that Inter Milan are making attempts to land the Dane, taking him back to Italy – where he played prior to signing for the Red Devils, with Atalanta.",
      "The latest report suggested that Inter had made a cheeky attempt to land Hojlund by offering up a faltering striker.",
      "Indeed, United In Focus reports the Manchester outfit ‘rejected’ a loan-to-buy offer from Inter, which brought about ‘another possibility’ of Mehdi Taremi heading to Old Trafford.",
      "After being offered the chance to sign the Iranian striker, it’s reported United ‘politely declined’ as they have ‘no intention’ of signing him. It is not hard to see why they would do that.",
      "Taremi scored just three goals in 43 games last season – his first one with Inter – and seems in no way a fair asset to swap places with a player who cost £72million.",
      "Hoping to remove the chances of other such offers, it’s said United ‘want a full sale’ and are ‘uninterested in swap proposals’.",
      "Whether Inter come back to the table with a transfer fee attached remains to be seen. In any case, it seems that although he had a very tough time last season and is on the chopping block now, Hojlund wants to fight for his place at United.",
      "He said recently: “I have a contract until 2030, so I expect to play for Manchester United. I’m looking forward to going on a summer vacation, and then I’m fully dedicated to the project that’s underway.”",
      "It’s not clear yet whether United will receive the sort of offer they’d accept for Hojlund, so there’s a chance he remains if nobody comes to the table with enough money.",

      "Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund could be on the move in the transfer window and another Serie A club has ’emerged’ as an potential destination, according to reports in Italy.",
      "United paid £64m for Hojlund only two years ago but already look like they are willing to let the misfiring striker go.",
      "Former England manager Fabio Capello has suggested that a struggling Manchester United forward is a safer signing for Inter Milan than another option.",

      "That scenario is at odds with reports earlier this month which claimed Gyokeres had ‘rejected’ United, but Romano backed up Jacobs’ claim, insisting that what is currently a ‘closed door’ could reopen for the Sporting striker’s move to Old Trafford should Arsenal decide to plump for Sesko.",

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."
