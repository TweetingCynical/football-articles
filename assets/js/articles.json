      "Chris Wood insists players could go on strike unless football bosses put measures in place to protect them.",
      "A report published by world players' union FIFPRO has laid bare the demands placed on footballers last season, in terms of minutes played, miles travelled and insufficient recovery time between matches and seasons. It also stated that all of the 32 teams involved in this summer’s Club World Cup who were analysed in the report, did not have the minimum 28-day rest period recommended by FIFPRO.",
      "This comes on the back of FIFPRO finding that just 14 per cent of players in Europe’s big five leagues who featured in Euro 2024, had the same minimum rest period. And Nottingham Forest striker Wood has called on the game's authorities to start listening to players, before they take matters into their own hands.",
      "Wood, who has joined FIFPRO's Global Player Council, was asked if a strike could happen. He said: \"It's a potential thing I'm sure, but we don't ever want to get to that point. We want to be able to try and safeguard as early as possible, to prevent anything happening.",
      "\"As FIFPRO we want to work with FIFA and other governing bodies, to come to a better outcome and protect the players of the future, or the players of now.",
      "\"From the Club World Cup into the World Cup next year, there's not going to be a lot of rest time for a lot of these players.",
      "\"And it's about working together and coming to agreement, or a way of working in the future where we don't have to go to those extremes, and be able to just see each side's point of view.”",
      "But it remains to be seen if FIFPRO and FIFA will be able to reach a compromise, when it comes to the amount of games players are expected to be involved in.",
      "FIFPRO is involved in two separate legal actions against world football’s governing body, over what it sees as a failure to consult over the international calendar. Relations between the two organisations are not good, with FIFA accusing the union of 'blackmail' in a statement in July.",
      "FIFA wants to work with other player representative bodies, which FIFPRO insists are not legitimate enough to consult on players' behalf.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Barcelona manager Xavi has reportedly expressed his eagerness to take over from Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, according to fresh claims. Amorim finds himself facing mounting scrutiny following yet another Premier League setback.",
      "Saturday's crushing 3-1 defeat at Brentford marked the Portuguese coach's 17th loss in just 33 league matches since taking charge. With only six fixtures completed this season, United languish in a disappointing 14th position.",
      "Nevertheless, numerous managers have been linked to the role, following the disappointing result at the Gtech Community Stadium. Gareth Southgate, Andoni Iraola, Oliver Glasner and Fabian Hurzeler have all emerged as possible candidates on United's shortlist.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano claims Xavi would eagerly seize the chance to manage at Old Trafford. The reporter revealed that the Spanish tactician has been \"studying\" the Premier League and would \"immediately\" accept the position if approached.",
      "Romano also suggests that United's absence from European competition hasn't deterred Xavi's interest. The former midfielder remains unemployed after departing Barcelona, where he secured the La Liga championship.",
      "Despite Romano's assertions, separate reports from The Sun indicate that Xavi has yet to attract genuine consideration from within United's corridors of power. Despite speculation about his future, Amorim has reiterated that he focuses on improving his team's performance.",
      "\"I am never concerned about my job - I am not that kind of guy,\" he stated following the Brentford match \"It is not my decision. I will do the best I can every minute I am here.\"",
      "He further added: \"We need to work on a lot of things. And again today, my biggest concern is we didn't settle down the game in the final third.",
      "\"We missed a lot of crosses. We suffered goals in transition that we knew during the week and work on that. So that is the things that we need to improve.\"",

      "Alan Shearer has stood firm on his criticism after Nathan Collins escaped a red card during Manchester United's 3-1 defeat to Brentford. The Premier League's all-time top scorer had previously slammed the decision not to dismiss the Bees defender for his role in Saturday afternoon's penalty incident.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo appeared set for a clear sight of goal as he latched onto Matheus Cunha's delivery, but Collins dragged him down, leading to a spot-kick. Despite preventing a clear goalscoring chance, the Irishman only received a booking.",
      "He was let off the hook by Caoimhin Kelleher, who denied Bruno Fernandes from 12 yards. The Premier League Match Centre explained that the 24-year-old centre-back avoided dismissal because it was adjudged that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.",
      "However, the justification from the Stockley Park officials failed to convince the Newcastle United legend, who maintained it was an incorrect call. Shearer expects the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) boss, Howard Webb, to acknowledge the error.",
      "\"Well, I'm told that was the match centre, that put that out, that's what the VAR relayed to each other and put that out,\" he said on the Rest is Football podcast.",
      "\"But I'm pretty certain, you will probably, no you will see Howard Webb coming out to say, 'That's another one we got wrong.' There's no way he's going for the ball.",
      "\"He clearly pulls him back, Mbeumo would've put it in the back of the net – it's a ridiculous decision, it's clearly a massive error by the referee and the VAR again.\"",
      "This came after his assessment on BBC Sport's flagship programme, Match of the Day, where he blasted the officials. Shearer insisted that United had every right to feel hard done by following the blunder.",
      "\"So they should [be aggrieved]. Yes, they got the penalty, but what they didn't get, the officials, it should have been a red card as well,\" said Shearer on the show.",
      "\"They get it right in terms of the referee's call: he gives the penalty for the pull back. But what they didn't get right was the yellow card check for Collins.",
      "\"They deemed that Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball, I mean honestly, it's just a terrible decision. He can't be in control of the ball because someone is pulling him back, he's a yard from the ball, clearly.",
      "\"Yes, [Fernandes] had to wait four-and-a-half minutes before getting to that decision, but that's a mistake from him. [Collins] should have been sent off - absolutely no doubt about it.\"",

The 27-year-old struggled initially following his season-long loan switch from United during the summer transfer window, but has found his rhythm since the September international break concluded.",
      "Rashford has now contributed either a goal or an assist in his previous five outings for the Catalan giants. The England star netted his maiden and second strikes for Barca against Newcastle United in the Champions League this month and has provided one assist across his last four La Liga fixtures.",

      "Barcelona left-back Alejandro Balde also responded with two fire emojis.",
      "Following his team's seventh victory in eight matches this season, Flick expressed: \"We found it very difficult, but we also deserve this win. I really appreciate how my team is playing, how they perform.",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has launched a scathing attack on the club, claiming it has lost its soul under the leadership of Ruben Amorim. The Red Devils suffered another setback in their Premier League campaign, slipping further down the table after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford at the G-Tech Community Stadium.",
      "Amorim, who took over from Erik ten Hag as head coach in November 2024, has struggled to find consistent form, failing to secure back-to-back victories in the English top-flight. The Portuguese head coach, whose contract at Old Trafford runs until June 2027, has managed to gather just 34 points from 33 matches.",
      "Rooney, speaking on his podcast with the BBC, expressed his dwindling faith in Amorim's abilities. The former England captain said: \"I just don't know what's going on. I have tried my hand in management, and it didn't work out too well – so I get it.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim is my age, he's still a young manager, and I'm sure he's got a massive future, but what is going on at Man United? This is not Man United.\"",
      "The 39-year-old also criticised the current squad. Rooney said: \"I don't recognise the whole football club. I don't see players fighting. I don't see character. I don't see a desire to win. I don't see ability. I don't see match winners.",
      "\"Nothing gets me off my feet. I go into a game watching, expecting, 'Okay, here we go again,' expecting the team to lose or maybe pick up a point. This is not Man United.\"",
      "Rooney continued: \"All day I've been debating this... do I say this? Shall I say it? Because I know it's going to bring pressure, and it's going to go into media, and it's going to get picked up, and the manager's going to get asked questions about it, but I feel I need to.",
      "\"I was at the football club for 13 years, and what is going on is not right. And this is not all on the manager, by the way. I'm seeing players, they're not deserving to wear that shirt, and it hurts.",
      "\"When you've been at a football club for that long and you care for the club, this is not acceptable what is going on. Man United haven't won back-to-back games for I don't know how long.\"",
      "Taking aim at the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Rooney said: \"I think there needs to be a clear message. A clear message from the owners. Whether that's the Glazers, whether that's Radcliffe, whether that's– there has to be a message of where this club is going. Because at the minute, we're all sitting there waiting for it to crumble.\"",
      "Rooney called for action from the United board, adding: \"The soul has gone from the club. It needs a new engine, a new lease of life. It needs something to kickstart that football club. What is going on? This is not all on the manager, by the way. Players, they're not deserving to wear that shirt and it hurts.\"",
      "On his view as a parent, Rooney said: \"The culture of that football club has gone. I see it on a daily basis. I see staff losing jobs, people walking out of jobs.",
      "\"I've got two kids (in the academy) at that football club and I really hope this doesn't affect what they're doing. What I'm seeing at that football club is not Manchester United.\"",

      "United were beaten 3-1 by the Bees, meaning Amorim is still yet to win successive Premier League games since he arrived at Old Trafford back in November. The Portuguese coach has managed just 34 points from the 33 league games he has overseen during that period and scrutiny is beginning to grow on the beleaguered United chief, whose refusal to deviate from his preferred 3-4-2-1 system has also raised eyebrows.",
      "Although Amorim's torrid record continues to be questioned, the top brass at United insist they have no plans to replace their manager. But Rooney says he has not seen anything over the past 11 months to convince him that a turnaround is imminent.",
      "“I just don’t know what’s going on,” the former England and Manchester United striker said on the latest edition of his new BBC podcast, The Wayne Rooney Show. “I have tried my hand in management and it didn’t work out too well, I get it. Ruben Amorim is my age, he is still a young manager and I’m sure he still has a massive future.",
      "“But what’s going on at Man United – this is not Man United. I honestly hope he can turn it around and he does. But if you’re saying to me: ‘Do you believe he will?’ then, after everything I’ve seen, honestly, I’ve got no faith in it.",
      "“I am not seeing anything which is giving me any confidence. There needs to be big changes in my opinion. Manager, players, whatever that is. Whatever it takes to get Manchester United back.”",
      "United spent in excess of £260million on new players in the summer, including £200m on three new attackers in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, who scored his first goal for the club in Saturday's chastening defeat at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "While Rooney does not believe Amorim is the right person to fix the problems at United, he went on to make it clear that there are issues far beyond the manager, saying the \"soul from the club has gone\" in a brutally honest exchange.",
      "“I don’t recognise the whole football club,” he added. “I don’t see players fighting, I don’t see character, I don’t see desire to win. I go to a game watching, expecting, here we go again – expecting the team to lose or maybe pick up a point.”",
      "He continued: “It’s not even just results on the pitch. It’s everything about the club that needs fixing – Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos have walked into a real challenge. We’re seeing staff members getting sacked after 20, 30 years who are very important people to that football club.",

      "Just goal difference keeps Sunderland in fifth behind Tottenham Hotspur in fourth, and they sit just four points adrift of table-toppers Liverpool. United would typically be fancied to overcome the newly-promoted side, but Neville is concerned the Black Cats could cause an upset.",
      "Speaking on his podcast at St. James' Park after Arsenal's win over Newcastle, the United legend insisted 'very big questions' would be posed to the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe should Sunderland emerge triumphant. He also explained why he's 'worried' about the club's future.",

      "\"And if they were to be 14th, 15th, 16th in October, which was where I said at the start of the season, if Manchester United are where they were last season in October, it's not a one-off.",

      "Neville continued: \"So, look, that's why I'm worried. That's why I'm worried because this is not going to go away, and it's going to build up in this next week or so. And I think that a victory is needed more than ever at Old Trafford on Saturday against Sunderland.\"",
      "Speaking about the Brentford result, the ex-England international said: \"I think there are a lot of United fans coming out of that ground last Saturday, including me, thinking Brentford away, Sunderland at home next week has a real opportunity to get nine points on the board, on the bounce, and then you'll be well up in the top six or eight.",
      "\"But the Brentford game was a really poor performance and a real worry. I felt for the first time, just through instinct, watching it on the television, seeing players' faces and body language, that there might be an element of players really doubting the system and what's going on.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim is no stranger to dealing with pressure since becoming Manchester United manager, but this time it feels different.",
      "Amorim has won just 18 of his 49 matches in charge of United since November. As he approaches a year in charge, his players still appear no better at playing his prescribed formation. The 3-1 defeat at Brentford on Saturday wasn't a nadir - that honour would have to go to Grimsby - but it was still telling.",
      "United were completely outplayed by their opponents and their manager appeared powerless to turn the tide. Amorim's side are 14th in the Premier League, having won two of their six matches, and owners Ineos are beginning to get twitchy.",
      "Sorry, Crystal Palace fans. Look away now. Oliver Glasner is the best and hottest managerial property in the Premier League right now. If Manchester United were to make a change then he would be the perfect fit.",
      "Glasner is not a flash in the pan. Unlike Ruben Amorim, he has got a proper body of work and real experience behind him. The job he has done at Palace has been phenomenal. They are hard to beat - they have not lost in the Premier League for nearly six months - and won the first trophy in the club’s history under him. Now they are enjoying a European campaign. But he has also managed big clubs - Wolfsburg and Eintracht Frankfurt - and won the Europa League.",
      "I am absolutely convinced that he would be RB Leipzig manager now if he had not won the FA Cup and had such a brilliant end to the season with Palace. Steve Parish, the Palace chairman, did so well to keep Glasner amid strong interest. Glasner is also a manager on the up. That is so important. He has got energy, experience and improves players. He would be perfect. But getting him would not be easy…",
      "Manchester United need someone to bring some calm to all the chaos at Old Trafford. Someone with experience and a level head. Someone who makes teams better and gets results. David Moyes, anyone?",
      "Moyes might have tried but failed - spectacularly it has to be said - in his previous time as United manager. But since then he has become older, wiser and better equipped to deal with the all-consuming challenge of managing United.",
      "He won a trophy for West Ham and is currently doing a wonderful job back at Everton. They say you should never go back, but if I was Sir Jim Ratcliffe I would be looking at appointing Moyes. Because this time round, the Scot wouldn't be filling the boots of a certain Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Simone Inzaghi is the man to replace Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. At Inter Milan, he took a financially-cautious, patched-up squad (ring any bells, United fans?) and spun them into gold: one Serie A title, two Coppa Italias, three Supercoppas, and two Champions League finals. That’s exactly the kind of alchemy Old Trafford has been crying out for.",
      "His three-at-the-back system slots perfectly into United’s recent tactical shift, removing the need for another expensive squad overhaul. More importantly, his robust, no-nonsense approach would jolt United’s underperforming dressing room, instilling discipline and accountability where it’s sorely needed.",
      "Unlike tactically rigid managers - whose predictability increasingly feels outdated - Inzaghi thrives on flexibility. He adapts formations and rotates players based on context, ensuring he thrives in the modern game’s dynamic demands. His ability to balance spark with defensive grit would also address United’s fragility while unlocking their offensive potential.",
      "Inzaghi’s success, forged at two clubs (Inter and Lazio) burdened by big expectations but haunted by inconsistency, proves he’s ready to revive a sleeping giant like United. He may have just joined Al-Hilal, but if the hook is baited well enough, he'll bite.",
      "Ruben Amorim seems to be keeping his job on the strength of the Manchester United managers before him losing theirs. The cold, hard fact is he has been the worst of the lot since Fergie. They should be turning elsewhere and should be looking at current Premier League managers who have been successful in England. I think Spurs were really shrewd in appointing Thomas Frank and believe he would have been perfect for United.",
      "Now he's off the table, I'd be looking at Andoni Iraola. The job he's done at Bournemouth has been nothing short of remarkable. Yes, he's had a bit of money to spend. But the Cherries are by far and away the Premier League's smallest club, you only have to take one look at their stadium, and they continue to punch well above their weight.",
      "Not only that, they are doing it by playing attractive football and taking the game to their opponents, whoever they may be. They came close to securing European football last season and have made an impressive start so far this term, already sitting sixth.",
      "The Old Trafford hotseat is becoming something of a poisoned chalice, and it says it all when Iraola might actually think whether taking the United job right now is worth it. But he'd be my choice if I was Sir Jim.",
      "If Manchester United are to part ways with Ruben Amorim, and they may well decide it’s time to pull the trigger, they’ll need someone capable of hitting the ground running. They’ll also need someone capable of playing with a three centre-back system, and someone who can deal with an atmosphere which often looks to be just a minute away from turning poisonous.",
      "Step forward Gareth Southgate. One of his biggest cheerleaders, Dan Ashworth, might have left Old Trafford, but the argument for his appointment remains. The question is whether the former England boss wants this to be his first foray back into management. It feels like a poisoned chalice, but - on the plus side - any club job taken by Southgate would come with plenty of attention. The England job felt like just as much of a hiding to nothing when Southgate took the reins, and he did okay then. Surely it’s worth a try.",
      "The perfect Ruben Amorim replacement? Ruben Amorim. Without going full Unai Emery and repeating his name like Marco Bizot, there's no other solution for Manchester United right now than sticking with him. If Ineos truly want to breed a new era at Old Trafford, they have to break the groundhog day cycle. And they're in too deep with Amorim regardless having recruited for his unique system.",
      "How did it work out having Ralf Rangnick in interim charge for months on end? That's the situation United will be in if they axe him because doing so at this point in a season might work well for a relegation-threatened side who can call in a firefighter, but it very rarely works when you want to be competing at the other end of the table. I'm firmly in the 'give managers time' camp and so should Jim Ratcliffe be.",
      "Even after the poor start to the season that United are experiencing, I would still be surprised to see Amorim leave. It seems that Sir Jim Ratcliffe is determined to stick by his man no matter what. Were he to leave though, I feel that a move for Oliver Glasner would be exactly the sort of hire they should go for. In my mind, Glasner comes with the same kind of reputation that Thomas Frank had heading into Tottenham.",
      "He has overachieved at Crystal Palace and would be the kind of manager to install confidence into these players. My only fear would be whether or not the job would begin to wear him down. However, you look at the calibre of player that Glasner has managed and nurtured since arriving at Selhurst Park, you have to feel that his appointment would be both realistic and a step in the right direction.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Chief Manchester United Football Correspondent. North-West Football Awards Journalist of the Year 2014, Highly Commended in Sports Journalists Association for Scoop of the Year 2010. Covered four World Cups and four European Championships.",
      "If Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Manchester United hierarchy are not devising a succession plan for Ruben Amorim, then they are burying their heads in the sand and doing the club a disservice.",
      "In simple terms, the gamble on Amorim has failed spectacularly and the time has come to accept that reality, however uncomfortable and embarrassing, end his ill-fated tenure and appoint a replacement head coach who can steer the club out of their current crisis.",
      "Amorim's nine wins from 33 Premier League games and an equally lamentable haul of 34 points from a possible 99 is indefensible and there are no clear signs that the situation is improving, as evidenced by Saturday's meek 3-1 capitulation at Brentford.",
      "United have seven points from 18 this season and have lost three times already – Erik ten Hag was sacked after four defeats in nine last term, and Amorim is heading the same way as his predecessor.",
      "Amorim has failed to win back-to-back league games after nearly a year in charge, something even the doomed David Moyes managed in his ill-fated spell in charge, and United have regressed under the 40-year-old Portuguese head coach.",
      "Players are starting to lose faith in Amorim and his methods, in particular his intransigence over his controversial 3-4-3 system and refusal to move away from it, even when it is patently clear to see that the personnel he has at his disposal are ill-suited to it and cannot get to grips with it.",
      "Amorim's insistence on playing skipper Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, rather than in a more advanced attacking position where he is more comfortable and effective, is an act of self-sabotage, with United's talisman having scored just once from open play this season.",
      "The failure to qualify for Europe last season – only the second time in 35 years United have suffered that fate - was framed as a blessing in disguise by Amorim, the free weeks meaning it would give him and his staff more time to work with the players on the system and philosophy.",
      "But that theory has been blown apart by United's miserable start to the season, as has the bold rhetoric from United that a full pre-season under Amorim, coupled with £236million worth of new signings would make the team stronger from the get-go.",
      "United are currently languishing in 14th spot, one place above where they finished last season, with a goal difference of minus four, while their humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby means they now have even fewer games in which to address their shortcomings, as well as seeing one route to a trophy closed off.",
      "It is not just the defeats that are doing for Amorim – even their two league wins have been unconvincing. Against Burnley, they should have been out of sight by half-time, but were twice pegged back before needing a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 3-2 win. It was a similar story against 10-man Chelsea, leading 2-0 before Casmerio's dismissal saw them cling on for a narrow 2-1 win.",
      "Amorim's charisma and candour is refreshing, but cannot mask United's clear regression under him. There is a desperation within United for him to turn things around, not least from chief executive Omar Berrada, who put his reputation on the line by personally driving his appointment, but there is no shame in admitting that was a mistake and moving decisively and swiftly to rectify it.",
      "United did so with former sporting director Dan Ashworth, jettisoning him after just five months, and must now do the same with Amorim, before the crisis deepens, leaving the team facing an ugly relegation battle – a genuine possibility given their current precarious position.",

      "Sam Allardyce is shocked that Ruben Amorim is still at the helm of Manchester United, describing their current run as \"relegation form.\" Following a disappointing Premier League campaign last season, where the Red Devils ended up in 15th place, over £200million was splashed out in the summer to try and turn things around.",
      "However, this season seems to be following the same pattern as the last, with losses becoming a regular occurrence. On Saturday, Amorim's squad suffered their third top-flight defeat of the season, losing 3-1 to Brentford away from home.",
      "Coupled with a shocking Carabao Cup exit at the hands of Grimsby Town, it paints a grim picture. Former Bolton and West Ham manager Allardyce can't fathom how Amorim has managed to hold onto his position.",
      "\"The bottom line speaks for itself: nine wins in 33. If I'm at a Premier League side, it's hard to say, but I would not be keeping my job at a club far lesser than Manchester United,\" Allardyce stated on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast, brought to you by Boyle Sports.",
      "\"They would expect better results than that. I think that's relegation form, you know what I mean. There may be a few draws in that, but it's not gonna be 30 points, or anywhere near it.\"",
      "Players like Bruno Fernandes have failed to fully thrive in this system and Allardyce, who possesses tactical expertise in deploying a back three or five, reckons United's star performers need to be utilised in their favoured roles.",
      "\"So, after the start to the season and the change around players - more players in - there's not been too much of a change in the systems of play,\" continued Allardyce. \"Look, I've played a back three, back five, many, many times. Explained it to all the players and trained with it.",
      "\"It is not easy. It's not easy if you're not used to your centre halves not having anyone alongside them. It's a different way of defending. You've got one spare in the middle, so they pick up who's there.",
      "\"I sometimes feel that you're normally facing one up front, and you've got a free player, and there are too many spare. They can talk about any system they want, but it's the individuals who are not playing at their best.",
      "\"If some players are playing out of position and he's one of the top players, he [Amorim] has to put his top player in the position he wants to play in more. They've spent enough money to be more creative, but they aren't scoring.\"",
      "Despite numerous voices questioning Amorim's approach to his tactics, the manager concedes he will never modify how he structures his side. The Portuguese boss quipped that not even the Pope could persuade him to alter his methods.",
      "\"No, no, no,\" Amorim declared earlier this month when questioned about altering his team's tactics. \"No one. Not even the Pope will change... This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life.",
      "\"So, I will not change that. If I'm a player and I have a coach that, with a lot of pressure and [people] all around the world, are saying 'you need to change the system', says 'I'm going to change', they will look at me in a different way.",
      "\"Everything is important when you think about the impact that a decision is going to have on the team. I'm doing things my way. I hope to have the time to change but it will be an evolution.\"",

      "Gary Neville has slammed Ruben Amorim's baffling decision to persist with Mason Mount at left wing-back. The 26-year-old midfielder was brought on for Luke Shaw during Manchester United's crushing 3-1 defeat to Brentford.",
      "Mount featured once more at the weekend, but he was powerless to rescue a point for Amorim's struggling side. Shortly after his introduction, Mathias Jensen delivered the killer blow with the third and decisive goal following a lightning-quick counter-attack.",
      "Speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast at St. James' Park on Sunday evening, Neville dissected the disappointing result at the G-Tech Community Stadium. The United legend once again branded the choice to deploy Mount at left wing-back as 'absolutely ridiculous'.",
      "\"There was something that happened in that game that I mentioned on my podcast two or three weeks ago that I said we couldn't see again,\" said Neville. \"I said that Mason Mount ended up at left wing-back.",
      "\"There's sticking to your plan, and then there's your coach that's got an idea and making sure that he delivers that idea and not flip-flopping with his idea with players, which can sometimes undermine what you're trying to achieve.",
      "\"But then when you're putting Mason Mount at left wing-back – and he's ended up at left wing-back again at Brentford in the last five minutes of the game – it starts to look awful.\"",
      "Neville added: \"You can't put Mason Mount at left wing-back. I'm sorry, it just can't happen. I can't watch Mason Mount play left wing-back in a football team.",
      "\"I struggled at times to watch him in his natural position, but actually putting him out there on the left wing, is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "\"You start to look at the Chelsea win less positively. That's just football. I think there are a lot of United fans coming out of that ground last Saturday, including me, thinking, 'Brentford away, Sunderland at home next week has a real opportunity to get nine points on the board, on the bounce, and then you'll be well up in the top six or eight.'",
      "\"But the Brentford game was a really poor performance and a real worry. I felt for the first time, just through instinct, watching it on the television, seeing players' faces and body language, that there might be an element of players really doubting the system and what's going on.\"",

      "Pressure continues to mount on Ruben Amorim. Saturday's latest reverse, the 3-1 failure at Brentford, another showcase of his stubbornness and refusal to change from Plan A - no matter how ill-equipped his team looks in doing what he asks, and no matter how much opponents now know exactly what they're facing.",
      "The suggestion from Old Trafford is that, ahead of this weekend's meeting with newly-promoted Sunderland and the upcoming international break, the Portuguese continues to retain the backing of the board and that no replacement is being lined up.",

But the latest defeat at Brentford just summed it all up: they looked like a rudderless ship, paralysed by a stupid formation and system which just does not suit these players.",
      "The most remarkable thing in all of this is the way that the fans have given him so much support and backing. They have been incredible. And you cannot question the board's backing either: their summer spending spree was massive and all designed to help Amorim's failing tactics work. I admire their loyalty now.",

It was a similar story against 10-man Chelsea, leading 2-0 before Casemiro's dismissal saw them cling on for a narrow 2-1 win.",
      "Amorim's charisma and candour is refreshing but cannot mask United's clear regression under him. There is a desperation within United for him to turn things around, not least from chief executive Omar Berrada, who put his reputation on the line by personally driving his appointment.",
      "But there is no shame in admitting that decision was a mistake and moving decisively and swiftly to rectify it.",
      "Manchester United Writer",
      "I'm reluctant to say Amorim should be sacked, given we're just six games into the Premier League season, but it's beginning to feel like dithering on his future is only delaying the inevitable.",
      "The Grimsby Town debacle was a shocking new low. The Manchester derby defeat was embarrassing. The mood improved after Chelsea, but Amorim failed to win back-to-back league games for the first time against Brentford, which forced the club to clarify their position on his future again.",
      "A roaring success story is now required for Amorim to turn United around - but he cannot win two games on the bounce. All the signs are currently pointing toward Amorim losing his job in the coming weeks.",
      "I understand their logic in giving Amorim more time. United heavily backed him in the summer window and have come this far, so what damage could a few more games in charge cause?",
      "Sacking Amorim would also reflect badly on Berrada and Wilcox, who should be scrutinised if Amorim is axed.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim retains the backing of Manchester United's hierarchy after Saturday's defeat to Brentford, but candidates continue to be linked with the vacancy. The Portuguese suffered his 17th Premier League defeat in 33 games over the weekend to add more pressure.",
      "Amorim was hoping to build on the 2-1 win over Chelsea and secure back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time. But United suffered another miserable defeat with Brentford cruising to victory. In the aftermath of the defeat, speculation has intensified over Amorim's future at the club.",
      "Reports on Sunday claimed that Gareth Southgate, Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola are all among the candidates, with talkSPORT suggesting Southgate has had direct contact with Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "However, fresh reports have named more potential replacements.",

      "Amorim has won just 34 points from a possible 99 in the Premier League since his arrival less than a year ago.",
      "Speaking after Brentford, Amorim said: \"I know guys. We talk about this every time our team lose [basic mistakes].",
      "\"We need to work on a lot of things. And again today, my biggest concern is we didn't settle down the game in the final third.",

      "Adding salt to the wound, his side was knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby Town in the second round and failed to secure a spot in any European competitions this season, underscoring the need for better league results. The noise around Amorim's future is growing louder.",
      "And if he were to be shown the door, Zidane could well emerge as an early favourite to take over. The 53-year-old Frenchman, who won the World Cup as a player, is currently without a club, having left Real Madrid for the second time in 2021.",
      "His impressive track record in the Spanish capital makes him a tantalising prospect for the top job at Old Trafford.",
      "During his first stint at the helm of Los Blancos between 2016 and 2018, Zidane boasted a winning record of 70 per cent. He bagged nine trophies during this period, including an unprecedented hat-trick of Champions League titles in 2016, 2017, and 2018.",
      "Under Zidane's leadership, Real triumphed over Atletico Madrid, Juventus, and Liverpool in the finals, making him the only coach in history to win Europe's premier club competition three times on the trot.",
      "During his second tenure with Los Blancos, Zidane boasted a 60 per cent win rate, bagging two more trophies to bring his total haul with the club to 11.",
      "Moreover, United fans can take delight in Zidane's personal record against some of Europe's toughest teams. During his time with Real, he never tasted defeat in six visits to Camp Nou - the home of arch-rivals Barcelona.",
      "He remained unbeaten in three trips to cross-city rivals Atletico Madrid's new home, the Wanda Metropolitano.",
      "However, it's worth noting that the Frenchman was on the losing side during the club's final visit to Atleti's former home, the Vicente Calderon.",
      "That was a Champions League semi-final second leg clash, but Real still progressed to the final. In visits to Germany with Real, Zidane went unbeaten in two trips each to Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena and Borussia Dortmund's Westfalenstadion.",
      "Furthermore, Zidane's mastery of the toughest challenges included remaining undefeated on visits to Anfield to face Liverpool, Juventus' Allianz Stadium, and the San Siro, where Inter Milan were his opponents.",
      "The 53-year-old boasts an impressive honours list as a manager, winning two La Liga titles, three Champions League titles, two Club World Cups and two Supercopa de España.",

      "The La Liga champions looked to be heading into half-time with a 1-0 deficit following Alvaro Odriozola's opening goal. But just one minute before the board went up for added time, Rashford whipped in an inch-perfect corner to find the head of Jules Kounde, who powered home the equaliser.",
      "Robert Lewandowski then scored the winner in the second half, courtesy of an incredible assist from super sub Lamine Yamal, to send Barcelona top of the table. Barca's form could hardly be more different from that of United, who suffered their fourth loss in seven games on Saturday, going down 3-1 at Brentford.",
      "Rashford's parent club are in turmoil while the England international is thriving with his new team-mates.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim is under increasing pressure, having cast Rashford aside nearly a year ago; ruthlessly deciding that the Red Devils' academy graduate wasn't part of his plans at Old Trafford.",
      "Having joined Barcelona on a season-long loan in July, Rashford has contributed to five goals in eight games. The 27-year-old scored two goals in their Champions League opener against Newcastle and now has three assists in domestic action.",
      "That's a stark contrast to United's new forward line of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, who have just three goal involvements between them so far. It's no wonder that talk of Rashford staying with Barca permanently is already ramping up.",
      "After the win on Sunday, Rashford posted on Instagram: \"Huge 3 points! Let's keep pushing.\"",
      "Barcelona boss Hansi Flick was pleased with Rashford's display, saying: \"We practice dead-ball situations a lot and it's really important to have this strength. We are very happy with how it is going.\"",

      "Igor Thiago capitalised on Harry Maguire's shaky defending to net the opener, before Altay Bayindir handed the striker a second. Benjamin Sesko pulled one back for United with his maiden goal for the club, but Bruno Fernandes failed to convert from the penalty spot for the second time this season.",
      "Mathias Jensen sealed Brentford's victory in injury time, handing United their third defeat of the season and casting further doubt over Amorim's future at Old Trafford.",
      "Questions about his tenure surfaced following the Manchester derby loss to Manchester City, and it was revealed that United would have to fork out a hefty compensation package if they decided to sack Amorim.",

      "United shelled out approximately £9.2m to buy him out of his contract, and should they choose to part ways with Amorim within the first year of his contract, they will face a significant compensation bill.",

Just days after restoring some optimism with a much-needed win over Chelsea, the Red Devils surrendered all their momentum in a bruising day at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "One positive to take from the game was the fact Benjamin Sesko finally opened his account with his first United goal. But the milestone was overshadowed by the team's latest poor performance and collapse.",
      "United spent the afternoon chasing the game, conceding twice within the opening 20 minutes. Sesko offered a lifeline by pulling one back midway through the first half, but any hopes of a comeback were extinguished in stoppage time as Brentford sealed the victory with a third goal.",
      "The defeat wasn't without controversy. Bruno Fernandes squandered a chance to draw level when he missed a penalty after United fans had been incensed that Nathan Collins escaped with only a yellow card after dragging down Bryan Mbeumo in what many viewed as a clear last-man foul.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has reportedly made direct contact with Gareth Southgate as doubts over Amorim's future continue to mount. The INEOS chief is said to have placed the former England manager on a three-man shortlist of potential successors.",
      "According to talkSPORT, the other names under consideration are Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola. However, Southgate may hold the advantage given Ratcliffe's long-standing admiration for him, as well as being the only free agent.",
      "Southgate's name first emerged as a candidate for the United job when Ratcliffe became co-owner in February 2024, and resurfaced again following Erik ten Hag's dismissal later that year.",
      "The 55-year-old has been out of work since stepping down as England manager after Euro 2024, but his prospects at Old Trafford may hinge on timing. Reports suggest United are reluctant to part ways with Amorim before November 1, when the compensation owed to the Portuguese coach would be significantly reduced.",
      "Many felt United were hard done by on Saturday after Brentford narrowly avoided a red card, including former Premier League referee Mark Halsey. Collins conceded a second half penalty after bringing down former Bees forward Mbeumo in the box as the last man.",
      "He was awarded a yellow card, but some think he should have been sent off since he was denying a clear goalscoring opportunity. VAR disagreed, confirming referee Craig Pawson's on-field decision following a review.",
      "A statement from the Premier League Match Centre was later released explaining the decision. \"The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR - with Collins deemed to have pulled Mbeumo back,\" it read. \"VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins - and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.\"",
      "However, Halsey, who officiated in the Premier League for more than 10 years, slammed both the decision and the subsequent explanation, suggesting the correct call was cut and dry.",
      "\"The statement from the Match Centre said that Mbeumo did not have control of the ball,\" he told the Sun. \"It doesn't say in law about having the ball under control. It's about the likelihood of keeping control of the ball.",
      "\"In my opinion, the Match Centre statement was absolute nonsense and it was a clear, clear denial of a goalscoring opportunity. Manchester United will be very disappointed with that decision. A red card should have been shown to the Brentford player.\"",

      "Amorim spoke for six minutes and 12 seconds during his post-match address to the media. And it's starting to feel like United's head coach is on borrowed time in Manchester.",
      "Amorim praised United's aggression against Chelsea, but that was absent against Brentford, who did not look like the team that had suffered a bad defeat the previous weekend.",
      "The warning signs were there from the first whistle. Brentford found pockets of space to exploit and Amorim did not look pleased, pacing up and down the touchline with his water bottle.",
      "Nathan Collins should have received a red card for bringing Bryan Mbeumo to the ground, but Bruno Fernandes did not convert the penalty. That decision went against United, but they were not good enough.",
      "Amorim chugged water and dropped his bottle to the floor when Mathias Jensen scored Brentford's third goal. He looked like a manager on the brink, although United sources have insisted he retains the backing of the board and no replacement is currently being lined up.",
      "Speaking before Brentford, Amorim said: \"It's normal the fans don't know what is going to happen in the next game. To be honest, I have an idea, but I don't know how it's going to be and I'm the manager.\"",
      "Amorim was not joking when he said he doesn't know which version will turn up, but that is the reason many fans are starting to believe he is not the manager to take United forward.",
      "It's worrying that Amorim still needs to micromanage his players during matches, despite being in charge for 11 months. His behaviour on the touchline hasn't changed from his first game against Ipswich Town.",
      "Every football manager gives instructions from the touchline during matches, but the extent to which Amorim must gesture for players to get into the areas he wants is a red flag.",
      "There have been concerns with the system from the moment Amorim was appointed. Some loyal season ticket holders questioned why a coach who plays a formation that does not align with United's traditional philosophy had been appointed, while others suggested it was time for meaningful change.",
      "Amorim is wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and has joked that even the Pope could not make him change his approach. That stubbornness may prove to be his undoing at Old Trafford.",
      "The outlook for the weeks ahead looked significantly better after a spirited Chelsea victory, but Amorim was unable to win back-to-back league games for the first time. United continue to take one step forward and two steps back, which has made progress impossible.",
      "The underlying data suggest United have improved this season, but a spreadsheet will not save Amorim from the chopping block - securing wins and moving up the league table will.",
      "The three games sandwiched between the September and October international breaks felt huge for Amorim, although it's illogical to decide his future on a game-by-game basis.",
      "What would change if United win against Sunderland before the October break? It feels like a victory would only delay the inevitable, but it's not a surprise that Ineos are dithering.",
      "Amorim was Omar Berrada's appointment. Jason Wilcox has been the driving force behind recruitment since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's investment. It reflects badly on United's chiefs if they decide to sack Amorim.",
      "United spent £215million in the summer transfer window and Amorim has no excuses not to make it work. However, a roaring success story is now required for him to turn it around.",
      "\"The good days are coming,\" promised Amorim on the final day of last season, and a banner with those words has recently been unfurled in the Stretford End to show support for him.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "If Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Manchester United hierarchy are not devising a succession plan for Ruben Amorim, then they are burying their heads in the sand and doing the club a disservice.",
      "In simple terms, the gamble on Amorim has failed spectacularly and the time has come to accept that reality, however uncomfortable and embarrassing, end his ill-fated tenure and appoint a replacement head coach who can steer the club out of their current crisis.",
      "Amorim's nine wins from 33 Premier League games and an equally lamentable haul of 34 points from a possible 99 is indefensible and there are no clear signs that the situation is improving, as evidenced by Saturday's meek 3-1 capitulation at Brentford.",
      "United have seven points from 18 this season and have lost three times already – Erik ten Hag was sacked after four defeats in nine last term, and Amorim is heading the same way.",
      "Amorim has failed to win back-to-back league games after nearly a year in charge, something even the doomed David Moyes managed in his ill-fated spell in charge, and United have regressed under the 40-year-old Portuguese head coach.",
      "Players are starting to lose faith in Amorim and his methods, in particular his intransigence over his controversial 3-4-3 system, even when it is patently clear to see that the personnel he has at his disposal are ill-suited to it and cannot get to grips with it.",
      "Amorim's insistence on playing skipper Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, rather than in a more advanced attacking position where he is more comfortable and effective, is an act of self-sabotage, with United's talisman having scored just once from open play this season.",
      "The failure to qualify for Europe last season – only the second time in 35 years United have suffered that fate - was framed as a blessing in disguise by Amorim, the free weeks meaning it would give him and his staff more time to work with the players on the system and philosophy.",
      "But that theory has been blown apart by United's miserable start to the season, as has the bold rhetoric from United that a full pre-season under Amorim, coupled with £236million worth of new signings, would make the team stronger from the get-go. United are currently languishing in 14th spot, one place above where they finished last season, with a goal difference of minus four, while their humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town means they now have even fewer games in which to address their shortcomings, as well as seeing one route to a trophy closed off.",
      "It is not just the defeats that are doing for Amorim – even their two league wins have been unconvincing. Against Burnley, they should have been out of sight by half-time, but were twice pegged back before needing a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 3-2 win. It was a similar story against 10-man Chelsea, leading 2-0 before Casemiro's dismissal saw them cling on for a narrow 2-1 win.",
      "Amorim's charisma and candour is refreshing, but cannot mask United's clear regression under him. There is a desperation within United for Amorim to turn things around, not least from chief executive Omar Berrada, who put his reputation on the line by personally driving his appointment, but there is no shame in admitting that was a mistake and moving decisively and swiftly to rectify it, in the face of such overwhelming evidence.",
      "United did so with former sporting director Dan Ashworth, jettisoning him after just five months, and must now do the same with Amorim, before the crisis deepens, leaving the team facing an ugly relegation battle – a genuine possibility given their current precarious position.",

      "The last time an Austrian took charge at Manchester United things went downhill. And fast.",
      "That was back in 2021 when Ralf Rangnick became caretaker boss at Old Trafford, given the job on an interim basis following the end of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's tenure. Rangnick went on to become known as 'Wreck-it Ralf' - and left at the end of his first season.",
      "But fast forward to now and elsewhere in the Premier League, another Austrian is doing the exact opposite to what Rangnick did. He's repairing the reputation of his nation when it comes to success, winning trophies, leading his side to new heights and enhancing his own reputation beyond what anyone had ever imagined. Take a bow, Oliver Glasner.",
      "In fact, the only thing Glasner has got wrong since taking charge of Crystal Palace is to defend Rangnick in an interview, insisting people have got it all wrong when it comes to his close friend. We can forgive him for this, because the ex-Eintracht Frankfurt manager's work at Selhurst Park has been nothing short of remarkable.",
      "When Glasner replaced Roy Hodgson in south London in 2024, he walked into a club that had never landed a major trophy. He made dreams come true with their FA Cup success, beating Manchester City in the final.",
      "Then they outlasted Liverpool in the Community Shield. Arne Slot's side, the best team in the land and reigning English champions, again fell to the Eagles at the weekend. It left Slot, of all people, complaining about too much stoppage time at the end - talk about a lack of self-awareness.",
      "But more importantly, it left Glasner's men boasting an 18-match unbeaten record. That equals a club record dating back to 1969. The high-flying Eagles now sit third in the table and if they can continue on this path, they're Champions League contenders.",
      "This season, on the back of that FA Cup triumph, they're in Europe for the first time. Had it not been for some baffling bureaucracy, Palace would be competing in the Europa League instead of the Conference League.",
      "Now what would United give for European football? The lofty heights of a place in the top four?",
      "Heck, what would they give for back-to-back wins right now? That's still something Ruben Amorim hasn't been able to manage.",
      "Even Palace's decision to sell big names for big fees, including Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, has had no impact on Glasner's progress.",
      "Chairman Steve Parish deserves huge credit for appointing Glasner. He did his homework and targeted someone with a genuine talent for rejuvenating struggling sides. The biggest decision a chairman ever has to make is deciding who the manager should be. And no doubt, Parish appears to have hit the jackpot.",
      "United boss Amorim earns almost double what his Austrian counterpart banks - and while the Portuguese can't get his 3-4-3 formation to work at Old Trafford, Glasner's 3-4-3 has turned Palace into a nightmare opponent for the Premier League elite.",
      "But in the fanciful and fickle world of football, there's no question that United should be looking to replace Amorim - and Glasner ticks a hell of a lot of boxes.",
      "Parish would do well to secure Glasner's future. But doing so won't be easy, when Glasner knows he's on bigger clubs' radars and has seen the likes of Thomas Frank make big moves - doubling his salary.",
      "However much it costs Parish to keep Glasner it will be money well spent, because he's worth his weight in gold. But if United are looking into a post-Amorim era, then hiring the club's second Austrian boss may be the smart move.",

      "Oliver Glasner has refused to rule out replacing Ruben Amorim after admitting he is aware of speculation linking him with Manchester United. The Reds' poor start to the campaign continued at the weekend when they were beaten 3-1 by Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "As reported by the MEN on Monday morning, Amorim retains the backing of the United board despite the defeat to the Bees, and no replacement is being lined up. However, that hasn't stopped speculation around the 40-year-old's Old Trafford future.",
      "And after guiding Crystal Palace to FA Cup glory last season and entering the last 12 months of his contract at Selhurst Park, Oliver Glasner is the favourite with the bookies to replace Amorim. And when asked directly about the rumours linking him with United and other 'top clubs' by the Austrian edition of Kicker, he replied: “I follow all the rumours – and that’s all there is – neutrally and completely relaxed.",
      "“Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.”",
      "\"I think when it gets to this point, you've got to see what happens next Saturday against Sunderland,\" he said. \"You've got a game at home against Sunderland.",
      "\"And Sunderland, as we know, are obviously in decent form. But if that game goes against Manchester United, you're going to start seeing very, very, very big questions being asked of the ownership.",
      "\"Big questions. They brought a young manager in. He's played a completely different system. They've invested in a completely different system. They brought [Patrick] Dorgu in, and they brought other players.",
      "\"And if they were to be 14th, 15th, 16th in October, which was where I said at the start of the season, if Manchester United are where they were last season in October, it's not a one-off.",
      "\"It becomes what you are, and it becomes a pattern, and then managers come under huge pressure. We've seen what's happened with Graham Potter (at West Ham) in the last few days.\"",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville podcast, the former defender concluded: \"So, look, that’s why I'm worried.",
      "“That's why I'm worried because this is not going to go away, and it's going to build up in this next week or so.",
      "“And I think that a victory is needed more than ever at Old Trafford on Saturday against Sunderland.\"",

      "Alan Shearer has called out Roy Keane's double standards after the Manchester United legend recently accused him of dirty tactics during his playing days.",
      "Speaking on a recent instalment of The Overlap, Keane claimed that Shearer utilised \"sneaky elbows\" during his goal-laden Premier League tenure with the likes of Southampton, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United, while Gary Neville was compelled to agree with his stance.",
      "Keane said: \"Shearer was sneaky. Sneaky elbows,\" before Neville added: \"I thought Alan was just, to be fair, nasty I'll be honest with you. He was nasty, Alan, he was horrible.\"",
      "When probed on whether he would have supported Shearer in his own team rather than playing against him, an incensed Keane replied: \"No, I didn't admire people who were nasty. Why are you saying that?I wouldn't I don't like nasty people. He was nasty, sneaky elbows, back of the head.\"",
      "In a bid to diffuse the situation, Ian Wright said: \"No, I don't think he's nasty,\" before Neville added fuel to the fire with: \"I think he was horrible Alan, as a player. He knew how to dig you.\"",
      "When asked by Jill Scott if that makes a good player, Keane remained straight-faced as he said: \"No. [Eric] Cantona, [Andy] Cole. All these strikers I played with weren't sneaky. They were good honest pros, turned up every week and they weren't sneaky.\"",
      "Shearer has since defended himself against Keane's comments with a little help from long-time friend and colleague, Gary Lineker. Speaking on The Rest Is Football, Lineker brought up the topic by saying: \"I saw Roy Keane had a swipe again at you, Alan.",
      "\"Sneaky, sneaky, he said, nasty, sneaky elbows and all this. It's amazing what rival pods will do to get a bit of PR.\"",
      "Highlighting perceived double standards from Keane, considering the midfielder was known for his meaty tackles and aggressive nature on the pitch, former Newcastle striker Shearer replied: \"Someone sent me that the other day, Micah [Richards] sent me and Wrighty, I mean really? Come on. I mean, sneaky and nasty, some of the tackles? Come on, really? Yeah, okay.\"",
      "Lineker then underlined his stance by adding: \"Pot, kettle, black and all that kind of stuff,\" before the duo moved on. Premier League icons Keane and Shearer endured a fierce rivalry against one another in the early 2000s while playing for United and Newcastle respectively.",
      "Tensions bubbled over particularly during a clash between the two teams at St James' Park in September 2001. In the final minutes of the match, which ended 4-3 in Newcastle's favour, Keane threw the ball at Shearer after heading to the touchline to take a throw in, before the striker pushed him in response.",
      "Keane then lost his temper with Shearer, taking a swing at him, receiving a straight red card from referee Steve Bennett as a result, before he was held back by team-mates as he furiously rushed towards the Newcastle man. Speaking previously about the incident, the now 54-year-old said: \"I lost my temper, we were losing 4-3, I think, in the last minute.",
      "\"If you're going to get sent off, the worst thing is, I pushed him. If you're going to get sent off you might as well punch him properly because you're going to get the same punishment. You might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. That's what I was thinking afterwards. It was just a push. It was ridiculous.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney has claimed that he is concerned about his children's future at Manchester United and called for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazers to send a clear message about where the club is heading.",
      "After securing a 2-1 win against Chelsea, optimism was building that United might have turned a corner, but it was back to the drawing board as Brentford beat them in west London.",
      "Igor Thiago's brace and Mathias Jensen's late strike condemned United to a third league defeat of the season and one that stretches their winless run on the road to seven matches.",
      "Ruben Amorim has come under more pressure with the Portuguese collecting just 34 points from his 33 top-flight matches in charge. In fact, Amorim has now won just 18 of his 48 games in all competitions since replacing Erik ten Hag as the club's new permanent head coach last November.",
      "While United's fortunes on the pitch look bleak, there appears to be little to shout about off it. Ratcliffe has implemented significant cost-cutting measures since taking over in February 2024 with several rounds of redundancies impacting hundreds of employees.",
      "As well as this, United announced a major ticket price increase in the summer. Taking it all into consideration, United legend Rooney has expressed his worries about the direction that United are heading in right now, both on and off the pitch.",
      "\"There needs to be a clear message from the owners,\" Rooney told BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show. \"Whether that is the Glazers, [minority owner] Sir Jim Ratcliffe, there has to be a message of where this club is going. At the minute we are all sitting there waiting for it to crumble.",
      "\"The culture of that football club has gone. I see it on a daily basis. I see staff losing jobs, people walking out of jobs. I've got two kids [in the academy] at that football club and I really hope this doesn't affect what they're doing. What I'm seeing at that football club is not Manchester United.\"",
      "\"I am not seeing anything which is giving me any confidence, there needs to be big changes in my opinion,\" Rooney added. \"Manager, players, whatever that is. Whatever it takes to get Manchester United back.\"",
      "Rooney's eldest son Kai has been playing for United since 2020 and he has since made appearances for the club's Under 18s squad. Rooney's younger son Klay is also involved in the Reds youth set-up.",

      "Manchester United's transfer record in recent years makes for pretty ugly reading.",
      "The Reds have spent heavily with little success as they bid to recapture past glories. Ruben Amorim splashed the cash again this summer with up to more than £200million shelled out on attacking trio Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "But since Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe invested at Old Trafford, there has been a shift in recruitment policy. The big-money names have still arrived but beneath that United have invested more in potential, with several prospects having arrived in recent years.",
      "Chido Obi is perhaps the most high-profile having arrived from Arsenal in 2024 while Ayden Heaven also joined from the Gunners. And United have looked abroad when scouting for the next superstars, with the likes of Sekou Kone and Enzo Kana-Biyik arriving over the past 18 months, Diego Leon joining in the summer and last week the Reds reached a preliminary agreement to sign teenage midfielder Cristian Orozco.",
      "Orozco, 17, plays for Fortaleza CEIF and has captained Colombia's Under-17 team. The defensive midfielder will not be able to complete a move to Old Trafford until he turns 18 next year and will officially join in July.",
      "Spotting the best young talent from all corners of the globe can pay off handsomely and United have the opportunity to spot their next prospect during the Under-20 World Cup.",
      "The tournament got under way last week in Chile and there is a raft of youngsters tipped to make major breakthroughs in South America.",
      "United have already been linked with two players - Nigerian goalkeeper Ebenezer Harcourt who is just 15 and 16-year-old Mexico wonderkid Gilberto Mora, who has had reported interest from several top European clubs.",
      "With Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero and Paul Pogba past winners of the player of the tournament, and Erling Haaland the top scorer in the 2019 edition, the competition can offer an indicator of the future.",
      "For Ineos and United there is the chance to see how talented teenagers fare in tournament play and potentially identify the next young stars to join the ranks at Old Trafford.",
      "England have failed to qualify but there is a raft of talent in action. Prospects from Argentina and Brazil stand out with 19-year-old forward Pedro, who joined Zenit in Russia in 2024, tipped to shine for the latter.",
      "Argentina have a clutch of prospects with Maher Carrizo catching the eye in his homeland for Velez Sarsfield. The 19-year-old right winger has 10 goals in 31 games this season.",
      "Away from Argentina and Brazil, Mexico midfielder Obed Vargas, who has caught the eye for Seattle Sounders in the MLS, and Spanish centre back Jon Martin, who has broken through at Real Sociedad, are also highly rated.",

      "Ruben Amorim is coming under increased pressure after Manchester United lost again in the Premier League.",
      "Having beaten Chelsea 2-1 at Old Trafford last weekend, Amorim had the chance to earn back-to-back league wins for the first time since he joined United nearly a year ago.",
      "But once again, he failed, overseeing a poor 3-1 defeat away to Brentford. United were battered in the opening stages before a goal from Benjamin Sesko, his first for the club, gave them hope of a comeback.",
      "But when Bruno Fernandes missed his penalty after a bizzare decision not to show Brentford's Nathan Collins a red card, it became clear that it wouldn't be United's day. The Bees added a third in stoppage time, condemning Amorim to his 17th league defeat in just 33 games.",
      "Now speculation over his position is intensifying, as MEN Sport takes a look at a new development.",
      "Gareth Southgate is reportedly on Manchester United's three-man shortlist to potentially replace Amorim - and he's already been in direct contact with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. That's according to talkSPORT, who report that United are likely to wait until November to pull the trigger.",
      "This would be to reduce the level of compensation, as Amorim will've been in charge for 12 months. Ratcliffe has reportedly been in contact with Southgate in recent weeks to gauge the possibility of him taking over, having been out of work since resigning as England manager in July 2024.",
      "The two other options that United reportedly have shortlisted are Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner and Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola. Southgate, 55, was heavily linked to the role prior to his England exit, and his name was also mentioned during the process of appointing Amorim, who could have four games to save his job.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Gareth Southgate has made it increasingly clear that he's decided to move away from football management. In December 2024, the former England boss told the BBC: \"I've been 37 years a player and coach, and I'm not against the next period of my life being totally different. When you've had one of the biggest jobs, how do you follow that up?\"",
      "\"Southgate's comments suggest that he's looking for leadership roles outside of football, as he's hinted at during other media appearances since leaving the Wembley hot seat. Perhaps Sir Jim Ratcliffe is trying to convince Southgate to change his mind, but without ex-FA chief Dan Ashworth on board at United, it seems far-fetched that Southgate would get the job at this point - if he even wants it.",
      "\"Some would argue, though, that United is an even bigger job than managing England, so maybe it is a worthy next role. But the stars don't feel aligned, and given Glasner and Iraola's current careers in the Premier League, they look more suitable candidates for what United are trying to build.\"",
      "The Manchester United hierarchy, including Sir Jim Ratcliffe, remain in full support of Ruben Amorim, according to BBC Sport. Their report dismisses speculation that a shortlist has been drawn up, insisting that Old Trafford chiefs are fully backing the Portguese to turn things around.",
      "Ratcliffe feels that it's only fair to judge Amorim over the course of a full season with what the United co-owner views as the right squad to make progress. Sources add that no one is currently being lined up.",
      "MEN Sport says: \"Sir Jim Ratcliffe is once again showing patience with a Manchester United manager. He allowed Erik ten Hag to continue despite a dreadful 2023-24 season, backing him with a summer of spending before ultimately pulling the plug, trusting fellow bigwigs Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada's judgement.",
      "\"But he's playing a dangerous game as ire builds up within the fan base. Constant false dawns are filling United supporters with apathy and if results don't improve, it'll only be a matter of time before things turn toxic at matches.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former France international Emmanuel Petit has previously claimed that Zinedine Zidane would need demands to be met before taking charge of Manchester United. The Champions League-winning head coach has been mentioned in the conversation to replace Ruben Amorim as pressure mounts.",
      "United failed to make it back-to-back wins as they failed to build on last weekend's triumph over Chelsea, with Brentford running out 3-1 winners on Saturday. Two first-half strikes from Igor Thiago gave the visitors a mountain to climb following a slow start in the capital.",
      "Benjamin Sesko reduced the arrears, netting his first for the club, before Bruno Fernandes squandered a golden opportunity from the spot to level proceedings 15 minutes from time.",
      "Mathias Jensen rounded off the scoring deep into stoppage to compound a miserable afternoon for the travelling United contingent.",
      "It leaves United in 14th on seven points as Keith Andrews' side leapfrogged them with their triumph.",
      "Amorim continues to face speculation over an exit after failing to arrest their inconsistency and poor form. It has led to Zidane being linked with the post, but should a decision be taken, they will have to coax the former Real Madrid head coach in from the cold.",
      "Zidane has not been in the dugout since 2021 after leaving Los Blancos for a second time. In order to do so, Petit, one of his former teammates, says demands will have to be met.",
      "\"Honestly, I know a little bit, Zizou [Zidane], and he needs to get guarantees if he wants to sign over there in Manchester United,\" Petit said in 2024.",
      "\"At the moment, the environment at Manchester United for years has not been good. The stability of the bench, the level of the players as well, the expectation of the club is not the same that it used to be.",
      "\"United is still a huge club, but not on the pitch anymore. And Zizou is very conscious and very careful about that, the quality of the players.\"",
      "He added: \"Could he manage to overturn the situation over there? I think the only answer is yes. But at the moment, when you look at the team, I'm not convinced at all about the level of some players.",
      "\"So if I am Zizou, I think it will be very easy, actually, to answer this question [of joining United]. If I don't speak English on top of it, that will be more problems in terms of communication in the dressing room.",
      "\"If he takes the job at Manchester United, that means he's got solutions. At the moment, I'm not sure a lot of people have the solution to turn the situation at Manchester United.",
      "\"Does he want to leave the sunny days of Madrid? His life is in Madrid, he is dedicated to Madrid.",
      "\"I'm not sure that he speaks very good English as well. And communication is very important in the dressing room.\"",

      "\"Today is Nick Cox's last day. How on earth that has been allowed to happen is beyond me,\" read a text from a contact.",
      "Cox has departed Manchester United after nine years of service, six of which were spent as head of the academy.",
      "In that time, Cox played a pivotal role in United's academy renaissance, helped 35 players make their senior debuts, secured top youth signings and oversaw an FA Youth Cup triumph.",
      "Cox already had a foot through the exit door when the Under-21s played at Old Trafford in midweek, but he is understood to have followed the game. He would have smiled as the youngsters scored a last-minute winner at the Stretford End. That is the kind of experience he spoke so warmly about.",
      "United are losing an integral cog in their academy. Cox has joined Everton to become their technical director and he will look back on his time in Manchester with great pride.",
      "Cox joined United from Sheffield United in 2016. He joined as academy operations manager, working alongside Nicky Butt, and was promoted to academy head three years later.",
      "\"He leaves the academy in excellent shape to continue attracting and developing world-class talent, and well-rounded young people,\" said a club statement in June announcing he would leave.",
      "Cox's main priority was supplementing the first team with academy talent, and he will look back on the players who made that step up during his tenure with huge fondness. However, he had just as much time for youngsters who didn't achieve that dream, the players whose careers were destined for elsewhere.",
      "He was self-deprecating and generous with his time during interviews. Academy staff probably dread the sight of a reporter walking over to speak after a youth game, but Cox always engaged with a smile.",
      "Covering the academy during Cox's tenure has been uplifting, especially at a time when United's first-team has often disappointed. The academy has always been there to produce special moments.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League last season, but the Under-18s gave fans something to cheer about by reaching the FA Youth Cup semi-final. They were superb in the quarter-finals against Arsenal at the Emirates, but ran out of steam in the last four against eventual winners Aston Villa.",
      "In 2021/22, United sacked Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and remained in the doldrums with Ralf Rangnick. That season coincided with the U18s winning the Youth Cup for the first time since 2011.",
      "That night, Cox said: \"As the kids are running across the pitch, I'm looking and I'm seeing the Under-23s, too old for the competition, there, with their mates racing across the pitch as well. That was amazing. That was a group of mates, that was a group of kids, living out their dreams tonight.\"",
      "The Class of '22 were a supremely talented bunch of young players. Alejandro Garnacho was the star of the team, but the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Dan Gore and Rhys Bennett sparkled.",
      "Cox tells the story of how United signed Garnacho from Atletico Madrid in 2020. Garnacho, then 16, was persuaded to join over Zoom while Cox's children bickered about a video game in the background.",
      "Garnacho made 144 senior appearances for United. The winger scored against Manchester City in the 2024 FA Cup final and was sold for £40million in the summer, making him United's fourth-highest sale in their history.",
      "Through Cox's leadership, the academy regained its reputation. Facilities at Carrington improved, allowing the club to keep talents like Mainoo, who in previous years might have signed for City.",
      "Mainoo joined the club's academy aged nine, but he spent time with United and City before then. The midfielder chose to join United's academy and although City attempted to lure him away at ages when it would have been possible, he chose to stay each time.",
      "Cox understood the importance of talent retention, but recruitment was equally important during his tenure. Alvaro Fernandez arrived in the same transfer window as Garnacho in 2020 and now plays for Real Madrid.",
      "Fernandez was educated at Carrington in the latter stages of his development and feels like the one that got away. Erik ten Hag overlooked Fernandez, but academy staff are proud of his journey since leaving.",
      "More recently, Cox played a pivotal role in the signings of Toby Collyer, Harry Amass, Ayden Heaven and Chido Obi. The opportunity to sign Collyer, regarded as one of the finest young midfielders in England, came about unexpectedly, but Cox's work helped United to be at the front of the queue for his signature.",
      "Club sources were keen to give Cox the credit he deserved for signing Obi from Arsenal, describing his work as \"crucial\". The young striker's arrival last year was considered a genuine coup.",
      "Cox told the MEN: \"Because he holds a Danish passport, the whole of Europe was open to Chido. We quite simply became aware of the fact that Chido was about to make a move to Europe.",
      "\"He’d been to visit a club and identified the club where he was going to potentially end up. We thought if this player is available and is looking to leave, then we should make every effort we possibly can to sign him.",
      "\"The pretty familiar formula for Manchester United's senior and youth teams has always been having the best local players and adding some of the best talent from further afield.",
      "\"If you look back, it's George Best, it's Bobby Charlton, or it's Duncan Edwards from further afield, added to a group of local lads. Then fast forward and it's someone like Paul Pogba.\"",
      "The statistics from Cox's time at the club read well. United academy graduates played 25 per cent of first-team minutes between 2019 and 2024 - only second to Bayern Munich in the top five leagues - and United ranked second in the Premier League for minutes given to teenagers last season.",
      "Cox oversaw the continuation of United’s record of including an academy in every first-team matchday squad for over 4,200 games. That record has recently seemed under threat.",
      "The U18s won three national trophies in 2023/2024. And in the last two seasons, the U13s, U14s and U15s have been national champions. Delivering results was crucial, but Cox genuinely cared about the academy and his passion for youth development was obvious when you spoke to him.",
      "Cox was well-versed in the club's rich academy history. He wanted children to understand they were following in the footsteps of legendary United academy graduates each day.",
      "The 47-year-old became a patron of the Manchester Munich Memorial Foundation and visited Manchesterplatz as part of an academy delegation. “It is my job, in part, to make sure that our youth players fully understand and embrace the great legacy and history of our football club,\" he said.",
      "Cox was born in Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire, but felt part Mancunian due to his lengthy association with United.",
      "He deserves credit for establishing the academy alumni programme, which has ensured that former players remain actively engaged with the academy and receive access to support, help and advice.",
      "United's has been a forward-thinking academy. They were the first academy in England to introduce a player-coach role with the U21s, something that Liverpool subsequently copied.",
      "The pro experience programme was created, which saw young players train with EFL and non-league clubs while still playing for the academy to prepare them for potential loans.",
      "Cox helped raise £100m from academy sales, but he never wanted the academy building to become a cash cow for first-team signings. Of course, academy sales have become important due to Profit and Sustainability Rules, but Cox was an advocate of promoting talent from within.",
      "Cox faced challenges along the way. The academy has been United's only well-functioning area in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but that hasn't stopped Ineos from making changes.",
      "When mass redundancies were made, the academy lost talented staff members. Cox has worked in difficult circumstances at Carrington over the last 18 months, with reduced resources due to cost-cutting.",
      "Ineos scaled back the coverage of the academy on MUTV. There is still no dedicated social media account for academy content, or a specialised junior communications executive for media enquiries. That means existing resources and staff members have been stretched, often working long hours.",
      "It will be a near-impossible task for Cox's successor, Stephen Torpey, to emulate his work.",
      "Cox leaves behind a wonderful legacy. Just ask the players who worked with him.",

      "Manchester United lost 3-1 against Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Brentford made an excellent start to the game, taking a two-goal lead within 20 minutes after a brace from Igor Thiago, giving United a mountain to climb at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit before the interval. United had a golden chance to draw level when Bryan Mbeumo won a penalty with 15 minutes remaining, but Bruno Fernandes' low effort was saved by Brentford goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher.",
      "Brentford wrapped up the victory with an injury-time goal from Mathias Jensen.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed:",
      "The system is a problem",
      "Brentford opened the scoring far too easily, launching a long ball forward after stifling an attack from United. Harry Maguire was isolated and Thiago lashed the ball beyond Altay Bayindir.",
      "It was concerning that Brentford were able to bypass United's entire team with a simple long ball. There had been instances of the team looking disjointed before that breakthrough, with a large gap between the backline and attack, so the manner of Brentford's goal wasn't surprising.",
      "Ruben Amorim finally had a chance to address the problem when Sesko halved the deficit, which allowed him to usher Maguire and Luke Shaw to the touchline to receive tactical instructions.",
      "United's head coach should not need to address the space between the backline, midfield and attack at this stage of his tenure. That should be second nature to his players.",
      "The problem is part of the ongoing conversation around Amorim's system and the debate about whether he will succeed at Old Trafford with his approach. He is still yet to win back-to-back league games.",
      "The chant from United's fans",
      "The tempo dropped after play resumed for the second half and there was a worrying lack of urgency from United, who were trailing by a goal and supposed to be trying to find a way back into the game.",
      "\"Attack, attack, attack,\" pleaded the travelling away support. It all looked far too pedestrian, despite Amorim trying to gee up his players from the sidelines.",
      "There was hope United would build on their Chelsea victory but it's another false dawn.",
      "The reception for Mainoo",
      "There was a loud cheer when Kobbie Mainoo was introduced to the game in the 66th minute. Many wondered whether Mainoo would be given his first start of the Premier League season against Brentford, but Manuel Ugarte was selected to start alongside Fernandes instead.",
      "Ugarte was wasteful, losing possession far too often. The 24-year-old is not having a good season and the reaction to Mainoo's introduction hinted United fans think he should be involved more often.",
      "It didn't take long for Mainoo to offer what Ugarte did not. The youngster escaped a tight space with the ball at his feet, and impressively broke up a Brentford attack moments later.",
      "Amorim's handling of Mainoo has been questionable this season.",
      "Cunha showed his frustration",
      "It didn't take long for Cunha to become frustrated with how the game was unfolding. He tried to encourage his teammates as they prepared for the restart following Thiago's opener and became animated with Sesko when he picked the wrong pass, which botched a sweeping move forward.",
      "Cunha had further words with Sesko when the ball went out of play for a throw-in. The Brazilian isn't afraid to dish out orders to his teammates and Amorim has praised that part of his character.",
      "However, it works both ways, and Cunha can make wrong decisions on the ball himself, just like when he chose to shoot from the edge of the box instead of sliding Fernandes through.",
      "Cunha, Sesko and Mbeumo started together for the first time against Brentford and there were teething problems.",
      "Mbeumo reunion",
      "Mbeumo returned to the Gtech Community Stadium for the first time since signing for United for £65m in the summer. The forward spent six successful years with Brentford and left on good terms.",
      "Before the warm-ups began, Mbeumo chatted with his former teammates on the pitch and seemed in good spirits. He shared an embrace with a handful of his former colleagues, and Brentford's supporters gave Mbeumo a loud cheer when the stadium announcer read out his name.",
      "Mbeumo scored in Brentford's 4-0 hammering of United in August 2022 when Erik ten Hag was in charge, and memories of that game came flooding back as the Bees took a 2-0 lead within 20 minutes.",
      "The Cameroon international played a brilliant cross into the box in the second half, but nobody was there to connect with it. Mbeumo didn't have that problem during his stint with Brentford.",
      "\"Bryan, what's the score?\" sang Brentford's fans at the end of the game.",

      "United were 2-0 down after 20 minutes, with Brentford forward Igor Thiago scoring twice, before Benjamin Sesko pulled one back with his first goal since his £74million summer move.",

      "Despite this latest setback, Amorim said he remains confident he can turn United's fortunes around and bring the glory days back to the club, despite their results suggesting otherwise.",
      "“I'm always doing my job,” said Amorim. “If I win, I'm in a different state of mind. That is normal, but I'm always confident, because I know what to do.",
      "“It's my job and I'm not here just to protect the players. I'm trying to do what is best for the club and the team.",

      "“I'm not trying to protect the players or myself. I'm just trying to win the next game, create the momentum.",
      "“I try to be really objective in my analysis of the game. Today we played the game of Brentford, not our own game. And when you play the opponent's game, it's harder to win in the end.",
      "“When we win, it's not the system, when we lose it's the system. I understand that. I think it's more that we play this game like Brentford wanted to play this game.",
      "“We never settled down to play our game. We never pushed the opponent. We knew that every time they recovered the ball, they would make a run and they would fight for the ball.",
      "“We need to work on a lot of things. My biggest concern is that we didn't settle down in the game. In the final third we missed a lot of crosses.",
      "“That is frustrating. We can do better with the ball. We can have more control. We can understand that sometimes when the decisions are not in your favour, the momentum is not in your favour, we can still control the ball.",
      "“When everything, the moments, the penalty, the foul before the first goal, all these things are against us, we need to have more personality to control the game and calm down the game.",
      "“When you win, you feel that everything, the momentum, is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and you fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.”",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim's 3-1 defeat to Brentford was dubbed \"a joke\" by Usain Bolt, and exiled defender Tyrell Malacia also sent the Red Devils' head coach a telling message.",
      "Amorim's side endured their third defeat of the current Premier League campaign on Saturday when they made the trip to the Gtech Community Stadium. Bees forward Igor Thiago netted a first-half brace before Benjamin Sesko reduced the deficit, and despite United being awarded a spot-kick on 76 minutes, Bruno Fernandes was unable to find the net.",
      "Brentford claimed a third strike to confirm United's downfall deep into stoppage time, and during a disastrous opening period, one of the club's most prominent supporters, 100m and 200m world record holder Bolt, labelled the display a \"joke.\"",
      "Meanwhile, ostracised left-back Malacia has delivered a statement to his boss through his training efforts, and Rio Ferdinand has cautioned the head coach that one player needs to be restored to the first team.",
      "Brentford's opener on Saturday saw Harry Maguire keep striker Thiago onside before he found the net beyond Altay Bayindir after merely nine minutes. Fewer than 10 minutes later, and it was 2-0, the Brazilian claiming his second as United's keeper pushed a delivery into his path.",
      "This catastrophic opening 20 minutes left some supporters furious, and even Bolt felt compelled to express his disappointment. He turned to social media and wrote on X: \"This must be a joke.\"",
      "Supporters in the comments section of this post shared similar frustrations, with one stating: \"United are a joke. Have been for a decade.\" Another commented: \"Even Bolt cannot believe how useless this club is.\"",
      "Despite Sesko netting his maiden goal for the visitors to reduce the deficit, Amorim's team suffered another setback. The Portuguese manager has still not managed to secure back-to-back Premier League victories since taking charge of the Red Devils.",
      "Beyond the Brentford encounter, outcast Malacia has demonstrated to prospective clubs and Amorim that he remains match-ready. Missing out on a transfer this summer represented another setback for the Netherlands international, who has endured a challenging period in Manchester following his arrival under Erik ten Hag.",
      "Despite joining as a potential first-choice full-back, Malacia has struggled for playing time. A knee problem in 2023 kept him out for more than 500 days, which certainly didn't aid his situation.",
      "Potential switches to Spanish side Elche and Turkish clubs failed to materialise during the summer window, following his loan spell at PSV in the latter half of last campaign. Currently, Malacia finds himself marginalised, unsuited to Amorim's wing-back system.",
      "Nevertheless, the 26-year-old has signalled his readiness to return to action, sharing Instagram footage of himself training at Shawe View, the home of nearby non-league outfit Trafford FC. He has demonstrated to both Amorim and managers at clubs potentially interested in a January move that he is maintaining his fitness levels.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was brought on after 66 minutes against Brentford, and whilst he struggled to leave a significant mark, he has demonstrated flashes of potential in recent weeks. Amorim persists with Manuel Ugarte at the heart of his midfield setup in the suspended Casemiro's absence, though.",
      "Red Devils legend Ferdinand believes the manager must do everything possible to secure Mainoo additional playing time. Speaking exclusively to the MEN as he fronts Talking Futures' new initiative Half Time Talks, Ferdinand said: \"If he was agitating to get a loan now, if he is not playing in January, he will be agitating and knocking the door down even more to go and get game time.",
      "\"You have to have two hats in these situations. If you think about it, being a player again, you have got to be thinking about yourself in these situations. You are lucky to go to multiple tournaments in your career, you are lucky to go to just one tournament, so I understand that with my selfish, football player hat on, thinking about England and yourself.",
      "\"But, at the same time, if you are thinking long-term for Manchester United, I think Manchester United have to find a way of getting this kid in the team, he is a huge talent.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United chiefs have reached a verdict on whether to sack head coach Ruben Amorim, with the ‘dressing room astonished’.",
      "Amorim is under immense scrutiny at Man Utd, who have lost 19 of their 49 games in all competitions under the head coach.",
      "Man Utd‘s problems from last season have carried over into this campaign as they are still toothless in attack and easy to play through, with Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 not working.",
      "Despite this, Amorim is naively refusing to budge and is sticking to his guns over his formation, which will likely prove to be his downfall.",
      "Over the weekend, Man Utd suffered a damaging 3-1 loss against Brentford, with a brace from Igor Thiago and a late strike from Matthias Jensen mounting pressure on Amorim.",
      "This result leaves Man Utd 14th in the Premier League after six matches, with Amorim currently the favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Arsenal, Amorim, Palace, Forest, Sunderland, Maresca, Buendia",
      "Amorim is said to ‘retain the backing’ of co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe, while there is also a claim on reports suggesting Man Utd are already are already searching for his replacement.",
      "The report added:",
      "‘Despite reports to the contrary, sources are adamant the bosses are not lining up a list of replacements.",
      "‘The club, under its new INEOS stewardship, is determined to take a long-term view in all the decisions it takes – about player recruitment, facilities and the coaching staff – and so will not make any knee-jerk reaction to individual defeats.’",
      "However, a report from The Sun has indicated that Amorim is losing backing among the squad, with ‘dressing room sources’ insisting the  ‘players are astonished by how quickly they have spiralled this season’.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘The United squad was genuinely optimistic of having a successful season after a harmonious pre-season in Chicago but there is already uncertainty over the future of head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "‘United are monitoring potential replacements for Amorim, with Premier League-based coaches Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Fabian Hurzeler all under consideration. United denied whispers that Amorim had been called in for talks on Saturday night after the debacle at Brentford.’",
      "After the loss to Brentford, pundit Alan Shearer has raised a potential reason behind Man Utd’s decision to stick with Amorim.",
      "“Ruben Amorim is under massive pressure,” Shearer said.",
      "“I think the hierarchy have made so many errors since coming to the club, they can’t be seen to have made another in appointing this manager. I think he is very fortunate.”",
      "One Sir Jim Ratcliffe quote helps explain why Ruben Amorim is still at Man Utd. Maresca and Liverpool messed up but Arsenal, Palace and Sunderland impressed.",
      "Ruben Amorim did something “alarming” during Manchester United’s defeat at Brentford, says Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘considering’ a new target to replace head coach Ruben Amorim, while they look to have been given an ultimatum.",

      "Club legend Wayne Rooney has revealed his clear verdict on Ruben Amorim and INEOS, insisting there is “no soul” at Manchester United.",

      "It has been claimed that Marcus Rashford has given Manchester United a “big issue”, with the Premier League giants “boxed in”.",
      "Rashford left Man Utd in the summer as he joined FC Barcelona on loan with an option to buy for around £26m.",
      "The England international decided at the end of 2024 that he wanted to leave Man Utd for a fresh start, as he butted heads with head coach Ruben Amorim en route to departing.",
      "The versatile forward was keen on a move to Barcelona in January, though they opted against the move at the time amid his huge salary and poor form over 18 months.",
      "Instead, Rashford secured a loan move to Aston Villa and returned to form under Unai Emery, grabbing four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Arsenal, Amorim, Palace, Forest, Sunderland, Maresca, Buendia",
      "This boosted his chances of joining Barcelona in the window and they sanctioned a loan deal after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams.",
      "27-year-old Rashford has overcome a slow start at Barcelona as he’s shone for the Spanish giants in recent weeks. He has two goals and four assists for his new club in eight appearances across all competitions.",
      "Now, football finance expert Stefan Borson has explained that the Red Devils have a “big issue” with Rashford, whose ‘agreed cut-price deal’ with Barcelona has no “upside” for the Premier League giants.",
      "“The player is going to end up boxing Manchester United in,” Borson told Football Insider.",
      "“I think it’s clear that United obviously want to sell the player. I mean, you just loaned him out. Where are we going to get to next summer?",
      "“Whatever he does, whether he plays well or whether he’s mediocre, whether he’s patchy, you get to next summer and there’s one bidder on the table and the player says he only wants to go to Barcelona.",
      "“Well, in that scenario, they may well get him for £25m.”",
      "Borson added: “It’s a big issue for Manchester United because it is very hard to see where the upside is.",
      "“You’re not going to bring him back unless there’s a change of manager and he’s very keen, which must be unlikely. Not so much the first bit, but the second bit.",
      "“So, he’s not coming back, and he’s almost certain to say he wants to go to Barcelona if Barcelona want to sign him, so you’re negotiating against yourself.”",
      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’.",
      "Paul Scholes has received criticism for admitting he ‘struggles to feel happy’ for Marcus Rashford in Barcelona. But why should he?",
      "Marcus Rashford is a player who did not even ‘fake defend’ for Manchester United so he deserves no sympathy.",
      "Paul Scholes knows the unique pressures of Manchester United – and the possible ‘mistakes’ – better than anyone. So what’s his Marcus Rashford problem?",
      "Man Utd loanee Marcus Rashford has been accused of ‘self-sabotage’ after losing his place in the Barcelona team for poor punctuality."

      "One Sir Jim Ratcliffe quote helps explain why Ruben Amorim is still at Man Utd. Maresca and Liverpool messed up but Arsenal, Palace and Sunderland impressed.",
      "We have a Premier League title race again and signs of life have started to emerge at the bottom.",
      "And by ‘a Premier League title race’, we obviously mean Crystal Palace, Sunderland and Bournemouth are winning the lot.",
      "",
      "For a team which has finished second comically often in recent seasons, it is difficult to recall the last time Arsenal capitalised on the Premier League leaders slipping up in any meaningful way.",
      "They have set the pace against Manchester City instead of chasing, then gave Liverpool far too much of a head start last campaign. Arsenal taking advantage of another team’s stumble to close the gap feels significant.",
      "And the way in which they did so was monumental. After the criticism of his selection and approach against Manchester City, Mikel Arteta would have travelled to St James’ Park knowing the reaction to any defeat: that Arsenal had been bullied, couldn’t handle the pressure and are made of a material a level below that of champions.",
      "This team and this stadium was perfect for a ‘typical Arsenal’ backlash. Newcastle had won their last three home games against the Gunners without conceding; when Nick Woltemade scored, the visitors must have felt a sense of deja vu reading the script.",
      "But they stood up, chucked around a few of the fists and elbows they had kept the receipts for from Joelinton and Bruno Guimaraes, set aside perceived VAR injustices and ground out the result they needed.",
      "Even when Mikel Merino equalised, the goalposts were being moved. Gary Neville noted that “champions would go on and win here”; Arsenal did.",
      "They have everything necessary to fit that bill. It’s what makes any Arsenal setback so frustrating. This weekend just reinforced how there are eight months left of this race to run, and these players and this manager is absolutely up for it.",
      "",
      "When Crystal Palace quite unforgivably refused to sell Liverpool their captain in the middle of the season without having secured a replacement of the requisite standard, the reaction from a vocal minority at Anfield was a sort of mockery.",
      "They found it difficult to understand how a club had bent to the whims of a ludicrously overachieving manager whose contract expires within the year. The suggestion was that Oliver Glasner would have quit had Marc Guehi been sold, and thus Palace had written £35m off to keep on punching in a relationship ultimately doomed to end soon.",
      "Some at Liverpool have lingered on that for far longer than anyone at Palace. While reputable journalists write about how Guehi ‘dropped his head and walked off alone’ while ‘the rest of his team-mates ran over to celebrate’ with Ismaila Sarr after the first goal, Glasner, his captain and players have all knuckled down and reached a whole new level.",
      "This is a phenomenal team under a remarkable coach, players as comfortable chasing a goal as they are defending a lead, with full clarity about their roles and responsibilities in any game state.",
      "The title questions will be asked by those on the outside looking in because they have to be. But the only thing on the agenda internally is to keep pushing the boundaries of what this club and those of a similar size should be. Palace are not supposed to win trophies, play in Europe or beat the champions but each achievement has been entirely on merit and glass ceilings are being shattered each week.",
      "Guehi will have been disappointed at the breakdown of his Liverpool move, and there is every chance both he and Glasner depart this Palace project within the next year or two. But to be part of this piece of ongoing history must feel incredible – and it entirely vindicates some difficult business decisions.",
      "",
      "It does appear to have been embedded in the Brentford DNA to beat Manchester United at home, so Keith Andrews and his employers will know not to read too far into an ostensibly impressive result.",
      "But it is another tick against the name of a manager thrown in at the deep and and expected to survive. Brentford had a clear game plan with enough flexibility to adjust when needed. This is far from the scalp it once was but the Bees still had to take it.",
      "It will not always be as simple as Jordan Henderson thumping it long and Igor Thiago smashing one in off the post. But Brentford do seem to have rediscovered their home form and Andrews is halfway to matching Martin O’Neill for Premier League wins against Manchester United, which he will quietly enjoy.",
      "",
      "Those familiar with Regis Le Bris will know that two of his favourite words to use when discussing Sunderland are “solutions” and “connections”.",
      "Six games into his first season as a Premier League manager, him and his players seem to possess an abundance of both.",
      "Sunderland are picking up points in vastly different ways: from resounding counter-attacking victories to late comeback wins and obdurate defensive performances. They scored five goals and conceded three in their first three games for six points, then scored two and conceded one for five.",
      "Only Brighton and Fulham have gained more points from losing positions and Sunderland are one of just six clubs not to drop points from a winning position.",
      "Against Nottingham Forest, six summer signings started – not including the loanee made permanent in Enzo Le Fee – and looked as though they had played together for years. They have established the “connections” and Le Bris more often than not will find the “solutions”.",
      "",
      "More than a few strays have been aimed in his general direction already this season but Buendia has often seemed alone in his willingness to see Aston Villa’s situation as an opportunity rather than a predicament.",
      "While others have bemoaned the PSR overlords, complained about the shackles placed around them and wilfully ignored that ludicrous revenue-to-wage ratio, Buendia has sought to provide solutions instead of more problems.",
      "Already given about three times more Premier League minutes in 2025/26 than in the last two seasons combined, Buendia has knuckled down and maximised the chances which would never have fallen his way had Villa been able to spend what they please – and more importantly found a buyer for the Argentine as they had clearly hoped.",
      "Buendia’s mere presence in the side was for many a negative reflection of their squad-building issues in toeing the financial line. Even his introduction for Harvey Elliott against Fulham was polarising, a decision Unai Emery might have suspected would go down as well as a Fabian Delph tribute video at Villa Park.",
      "But within six minutes the mood was transformed as Buendia became the fastest half-time substitute in Premier League history by quite some margin to score and assist after coming off the bench.",
      "Emery was right to think his “energy” would help, but the key part is that Buendia “wanted to stay, be involved and work for Aston Villa”. That has not applied to many at the club since the summer but that win could turn the tide.",
      "",
      "The good doctor changed the prescription at the last second to a medication rather less transformative, but once it gets into Wolves’ system they should feel the benefits from simply stopping their losing run.",
      "On which note, Pereira was right to take heart from the fact Wolves “can play in different systems” now when the opponent or game state suits. Having not started with a four-at-the-back formation in the last 66 games of his coaching career, spanning reigns at two different clubs, the 57-year-old has showed he can change to deliver a deserved win and spirited draw.",
      "A relegation-adjacent Portuguese manager who has received undue backing from the owners, displaying tactical flexibility and a willingness to compromise when the need to do so has become painfully obvious? It’ll never catch on.",
      "",
      "The split in the Brighton fanbase between Fabian fanatics and Hurzeler haters might never fade. That comes with the territory of a 32-year-old manager essentially learning on the Premier League job at a club whose motto is the Latin translation of ‘upwards mobility thanks to Paul Barber’s laptop’.",
      "The critics and supporters can agree on one thing: whether Brighton are winning, losing or drawing, Hurzeler’s substitutions are game-changing.",
      "He turned defeat into victory against Manchester City after sensing a shift in momentum, conjured one point out of three with needlessly defensive changes against Spurs, and capitalised on Chelsea’s apparent desperation to surrender any match once they have a player sent off.",
      "The Trevoh Chalobah red card was transformative but only because Hurzeler made it so. All three goals were scored or assisted by one of his substitutes.",
      "",
      "It will only be solidified when Pep Guardiola aggressively and performatively remonstrates with him on the pitch at full time but as the Spaniard said of his “unstoppable” forward, Doku is “an incredible threat against teams that are a low block and deep” and his decision-making has improved markedly.",
      "Doku racked up 13 carries into the penalty area against Burnley. Only Yankuba Minteh (21) and Jack Grealish (19) have registered more in the Premier League across the entirety of the current season.",
      "And ten goals or assists in 14 games for club and country since the June internationals does suggest that end product is being supplied more reliably by a player whose floor and ceiling at the Etihad has often resided in different postcodes.",
      "",
      "Only the second teenager ever to score a Premier League goal for Bournemouth – and Football Manager enthusiasts would be willing to bet good money that he follows the same sort of career trajectory as Dean Huijsen.",
      "The Cherries will take their time with Kroupi; keeping him on loan at Lorient for the rest of last season after signing him in January underlined how he was more for the future than the present.",
      "But Bournemouth will not regret unwrapping him early. The runaway top scorer in Ligue 2 last campaign is up and running in the Premier League, obviously with his shirt removed.",
      "",
      "The first player ever to score in consecutive Premier League games twice under Scott Parker. The knighthood is in the post.",
      "Anthony has 32 matches left to find the two goals which will take him past Bobby De Cordova-Reid as the highest scorer in a single top-flight season for Parker. The race is on.",
      "",
      "Only Arsenal, Brighton (both eight) and Liverpool (seven) have had more different scorers in the Premier League this season than Leeds, who will need such variation and shared responsibility in attack when that version of Dominic Calvert-Lewin shows up.",
      "Daniel Farke and company would understandably prefer to forget the Carabao Cup disaster against Sheffield Wednesday but Jayden Bogle’s goal in that shoot-out defeat means seven players have scored precisely once for Leeds in this season’s hottest Golden Boot race.",
      "",
      "After a 17th defeat in 33 Premier League games which have garnered 34 points, Manchester United are left entirely alone in thinking this could work. And even those inside the club drinking from a half-full glass are only doing so because of how badly the inevitable would reflect on them.",
      "It is a phrase used frequently on these pages but one which becomes more relevant with each defeat: this is Sunk Cost Fallacy FC, sacrificing results, performances and dignity at the arrogant altar of not only Ruben Amorim, but those responsible for his appointment.",
      "This falls on Amorim, on Jason Wilcox, on Omar Berrada, on Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The players too, of course, for these are ultimately their losses, their reputations being shredded, their livelihoods reduced to weekly ridicule and derision in front of the world.",
      "Manchester United have backed Amorim to such a ludicrous extent that he cannot simply be sacked without every other element of their footballing operation coming into question, without the very edifice of their grand plan collapsing in on itself.",
      "That helps explain why Amorim is still there. That old Ratcliffe quote about employing “the right people” who are “best in class in all aspects of football” comes to mind once or twice a week, no more so than when watching his side be outcoached by a first-time manager of a club which was plundered in the summer, including for the £71m forward Manchester United ended up playing at wing-back while chasing a deficit.",
      "Accepting that the head coach they have yielded so heavily to is not even vaguely “the right people” or “best in class” would prompt too many uncomfortable questions as to who at Old Trafford precisely is. On current evidence, no-one comes close.",
      "",
      "It is all starting to feel a little bit Roberto Martinez at Everton, but without the year of slightly misleading brilliance in between.",
      "Perhaps it is easier for a trophy-winning, attack-minded coach to inherit and build upon a sound defensive structure in the summer with a pre-season than it is to oversee that drastic metamorphosis in the middle of a campaign.",
      "Maybe that transition is also far better as a natural process in replacing a headhunted manager rather than sacking an overachieving coach who is popular with the squad.",
      "Martinez was able to elevate Everton’s attacking platform for a while before the instincts and muscle memory in the squad David Moyes left behind started to wear off. Ange Postecoglou has not yet been able to make sense of the myriad forwards he has come into possession of, and the regression to the defensive mean which had started under Nuno Espirito Santo has only been accelerated.",
      "Forest had not kept a clean sheet in 11 games under Nuno, their last coming against Manchester United in April. Postecoglou is without one in 17 Premier League matches, his last coming against Manchester United in February. That is, as ever, reason to laugh at Manchester United, but also the club which chose to engineer this unnecessary mess.",
      "And again, it is not as if security has been sacrificed for entertainment. Forest are conceding as frequently and scoring considerably less often, just with far more of the ball.",
      "Before this season the most possession they had managed in a Premier League game since promotion three years ago was 61%. Postecoglou has already beaten that mark twice and garnered a single point for it against sides who have just come up from the Championship.",
      "",
      "The world is slowly realising Maresca’s ideal game state.",
      "The Italian revealed after the Manchester United defeat that he would “prefer to be 1-0 down after three minutes than one player down”. It can probably be assumed that he would also rather it be 1-1 with 11 men after 53 minutes instead of leading 1-0 with ten.",
      "An obvious solution would be for his players to stop putting themselves into situations whereby such a crucial snap decision has to be made. Robert Sanchez, Andrey Santos and Trevoh Chalobah have all made diabolical calls in consecutive weeks, compounding systemic mistakes with individual errors.",
      "But Maresca must understand the message his reaction sends out. He surrendered to Manchester United after a matter of minutes and seemed to instantly accept a fate Chelsea could still have avoided against Brighton.",
      "Three defenders and Romeo Lavia were brought on for Santos, Estevao, Jorrel Hato and Pedro Neto in the 40 minutes or so after that red. Having a player sent off is sub-optimal but it only automatically equates to a defeat through the manager’s response.",
      "",
      "As Arne Slot said, “we can only blame ourselves” and the opponent “deserved to win”.",
      "Liverpool have probably been spoiled in that respect. Those six exhilarating victories, the majority of which were delivered through late winners, bred that some monster mentality Jurgen Klopp used to revel in harnessing. It creates a team that never knows when it is beaten, that always sense the game is there to be won.",
      "Perhaps that is where Slot will benefit from a little more self-analysis.",
      "“One of our players ran out because he wanted to play a counter-attack, which was of no use because time was up, so it was only about defending,” he said after the Palace defeat. “One player was too offensively minded in that moment, which led to them scoring the winner and us losing the game.”",
      "It was a situation which had echoes of the opening weekend when Jamie Carragher pushed Slot on Liverpool committing players forward at the wrong times, and something the Reds will be more minded than ever to work on now their vulnerabilities have been exposed.",
      "",
      "There is admittedly not a great deal of shame in losing to Liverpool, Barcelona and Arsenal, especially with those two Premier League defeats being meted out in the depths of second-half stoppage time.",
      "But there remain concerns over Newcastle’s attacking output and two league defeats at St James’ Park is already as many as they suffered throughout the whole of 2022/23, one off their 2023/24 total and just three behind last season.",
      "It is heartening that Eddie Howe chose to focus on those collective shortcomings going forward, the general effort of his players and how Arsenal were ultimately better, steadfastly refusing the referee-blaming olive branch offered post match. Newcastle need introspection rather than excuses right now.",
      "",
      "It just had to be. The Spurs of last season do probably lose that through some absurd hilarity like a Richarlison overhead kick own goal, so the progress under Thomas Frank remains clear.",
      "But so too does the room for improvement. Spurs are struggling to create chances and no-one is currently available to reliably convert them in any event.",
      "",
      "It is a phenomenal bit that Fulham’s longest winning run in the Premier League since January 2023 is still two entire games, and that at absolutely no point in those intervening years have they been even vaguely concerned by the threat of relegation.",

      "According to reports, Liverpool are already ‘on the verge’ of ‘completing’ a ‘controversial’ transfer as they battle Manchester United for a signing.",
      "In the summer, Liverpool were comfortably the biggest spending club in Europe as they invested around £414.5m to secure several statement signings.",
      "The Reds broke the British transfer record twice in the same window to land Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz, while they also signed Hugo Ekitike, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez and Giovanni Leoni.",
      "However, Liverpool’s summer window was not perfect as they missed out on Crystal Palace and England standout Marc Guehi on deadline day.",

      "However, Liverpool’s agreed £35m deal for Guehi fell through on deadline day as Crystal Palace pulled the plug after failing to secure a suitable replacement.",
      "This leaves Arne Slot’s side short at the back, with Leoni’s season-ending ACL injury leaving Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate and Joe Gomez as their only fit and natural centre-backs.",
      "Liverpool will re-enter the market for a new centre-back in 2026, and while it has been assumed that they would sign Guehi for a reduced fee in January or on a free transfer next summer, they are also linked with alternatives.",

The Reds consider the 22-year-old English centre-back a strategic investment to bolster their defence in the coming years. His physical ability, defensive leadership, and maturity despite his young age convinced the board that the €74 million fee was worth the effort.’",

      "Here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans are raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to nod in agreement. At Palace, the Dutch stopper kept a clean sheet despite Palace’s 1.59 xG and Forest failed to beat him despite an xG of 1.65.",
      "",
      "Of the 14 ever-presents through the first five games, no keeper has conceded fewer than the three goals Henderson has seen past him. As we’re certain he’d tell you.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list has done Trafford. Though the PSxG stat won’t account for the way he gave Tottenham the ball before their crucial second at the Etihad in his home debut for his boyhood club.",
      "",
      "The Italian has the highest saves percentage (84 per cent) in the league and only one keeper has made more saves. He was bloomin’ busy last season too.",
      "",
      "Four clean sheets in five games – still the best record in the Premier League – is keeping Aaron Ramsdale on the bench. He bumped his PSxG up against Arsenal, though that stat won’t highlight his mistake in giving Arsenal back the ball prior to their late winner.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced five shots more than any other goalkeeper.",
      "",
      "Darlow has replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form has given Daniel Farke a decision to make when Perri becomes available again next weekend.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth are buzzing with their latest keeper plundered from the Chelsea stockpile, with Petrovic keeping clean sheets in half of his six appearances so far. All the more impressive when you consider that Bournemouth sold almost their entire defence.",
      "",
      "Leno is bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign. Villa scoring three from an xG of 1.11 has hurt the German here, but there is very little he could have done to prevent any of those goals.",
      "",
      "Only one keeper has saved a higher percentage of the shots he’s faced than Raya’s 83.3%. Gary Neville would still prefer someone bigger.",
      "",
      "Perhaps this metric really is a nonsense because Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. At Chelsea, he looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has played half of City’s games in which he has done exactly what the algorithm would expect him to.",
      "",
      "It was handy while his side had forgotten how to score goals that Martinez was slowly making amends with Villa fans after a summer in which he flirted hard with Manchester United. For reasons unknown, the Red Devils failed to make a move.",
      "",
      "The England No.1 has conceded five goals in five games – exactly the number the stats suggest he ought to have. Though Pickford is also one of two keepers to keep out a penalty this season.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award needs to be on his game this term with only Burnley allowing more shots on target than Forest, all while Big John breathes down his neck.",
      "",
      "The Liverpool keeper enhanced his standing in this metric at Palace – not that it did Liverpool much good.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct. There is a keeper at the club who might do a job.",
      "",
      "Tables are fun, aren’t they? And we’ve got loads of them, based on all the metrics you could possibly need. Create your own too, between any dates or on a specific date. Enjoy yourself here.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, so why is he still masquerading as such?",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they almost certainly have if we accept the Bees need some patience while a remodelled team settles under a new manager. Defeats – both 3-1 – at Forest and Fulham cost Kelleher here, with the Cottagers scoring three from an xG of 1.0. But saving Bruno Fernandes’ penalty certainly helps.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and, despite playing one game fewer than the ever-presents, no keeper has faced a higher PSxG (9.3) than the Dane. Hermansen has not convinced anyone at the London Stadium, but he’s way down the Hammers’ list of problems.",
      "",
      "Being humped 5-0 at Arsenal has done for the £16million new boy here. In his other two appearances, Perri kept clean sheets against Everton and Newcastle. But five was two more than Arsenal ought to have scored at the Emirates, say the stats. Does he come straight back in upon his return from injury?",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 is especially damning.",

      "Let me tell you something you already know: VAR has institutionalised ignorance and stupidity whilst selling itself as informed and clever. If you somehow didn’t realise that, Saturday’s Brentford v Manchester United game must surely have proved it to you.",
      "But what is VAR really? More than just an extra rule to obey, it has altered the very fabric of the game and installed a dark cloak of fear after every goal is scored, as they scour the footage desperately trying to find a reason to disallow it. And they often find something which ‘proves’ there was a miniscule offside, invisible to the naked eye, that could only be discerned in slow motion. The striker gained no advantage, but nonetheless it’s ruled out. Even though the offside rule was invented to stop a player gaining advantage by being ahead of the ball, not to find a boot ahead of the ball by an inch which doesn’t gain an advantage and can’t even be seen with the naked eye.",
      "Great moments are spoiled by its presence, like when Fulham scored a great headed goal at Aston Villa. Even though it wasn’t disallowed, there was still a wait while it was assessed and that markedly reduces what should have been a great moment. It almost feels like you’ve got to ask if you’re allowed to score. Why do we even allow this intrusion? The rest of football gets by without it; why do the top leagues have to endure a patently flawed system?",
      "It’s put perversion at the game’s core, not fairness. In fact it has clearly made the game less fair. As we typically saw at Brentford, it took three minutes to decide Nathan Collins had not stopped a goalscoring opportunity by pulling Bryan Mbeumo eight yards from goal but nonetheless that it was enough for a penalty yet not enough to qualify as a goalscoring opportunity, so it wasn’t a red card, even though it was a goalscoring opportunity. If that doesn’t illustrate the pathetic nonsense of the system to you, nothing will.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, not the most emotionally stable player at the best of times, was left to think about the enormity of the task ahead. The weight of the occasion was ignored, Fernandes was broken on the back of ‘getting it right’.",
      "MAILBOX: Amorim is done, Bruno was ‘awful’ and Man Utd are ‘trash’ but what about the ‘two VAR shockers’?",
      "A system designed to help officials has made them palpably worse. Of course it has. They actually look smaller, neutered and pathetic. A weedy Walter on a field of Dennis the Menaces.",
      "I actually feel sorrow for them through my rage. What are they even for now? It looks like they don’t even know. If the guidance is to go with the on-field decision where possible, that doesn’t happen because ‘going with the on-field decision’ means the referee’s performance is being judged in real time, which in turn makes them paranoid they’ll get something wrong, which means they will, which will then make VAR intervene. On Saturday they took five minutes to decide the referee was right in the first place.",
      "It was said that it would fix blatant mistakes, but Sunderland were awarded a dubious free-kick which led to a goal (after the inevitable scrutiny for a miniscule offside). Forest have every reason to think that free-kick should not have been allowed. VAR failed to legitimise contentious decisions and left everyone feeling cheated. Exactly the opposite of what is supposed to happen.",
      "Time and again they won’t rule on things that happen in a phase before a goal but will rule on the goal, thus compounding their inadequacy. Get a free-kick unfairly but when that leads to a goal, it is ruled offside by a knee. Everyone hates it. Dissatisfaction is absolute.",
      "Decisions to correct mistakes are declared to be out of the remit of VAR, as if one phase of football can be divorced from the next. Yet things in their remit are called wrongly or take forever or are against the spirit of the game. And what is handball now? It used to be simple. But now they can’t decide and unfair decisions are made all the time. People have got so used to the confusion that have even stopped questioning it.",
      "That explosion of emotion when a goal is scored has been ruined, the groan of despair has replaced it. And people thought this was a good idea. Every round of games is dominated by terrible VAR and refereeing decisions. The overall standard has obviously dropped with the introduction of VAR. The stats will tell you more decisions are called right, but that’s only because they’ve defined what is correct. The offside knee decision can be called correct but it’s a bad decision.",
      "We’ve lost the soul and heart of football and turned it into a fussy, pathetic and often just as incorrect sport. At Brentford we saw how their actions can affect the result. VAR is altering the table, it’s become that pernicious. And as we see sweating referees wandering the pitch waiting to be told in his ear what to do as the players cool down and risk tearing a muscle, is there a more heinous, tragic and impotent sight in football?",
      "There was nothing wrong with football when various idiots insisted it be introduced. Unquestioningly it’s made the game worse but the money in football is almost entirely from TV and they bloody love it. Football as content provider rather than sport is the new normal. Stay tuned for more of the same coming right up after the break.",
      "We usually hide the Crystal Palace fan at the bottom of the Mailbox but the Eagles deserve top billing.",
      "One Sir Jim Ratcliffe quote helps explain why Ruben Amorim is still at Man Utd. Maresca and Liverpool messed up but Arsenal, Palace and Sunderland impressed.",
      "Arsenal are now favourites and best placed to win the Premier League. There, we said it. They have the fixture list and the best squad in England.",
      "Arsenal beat Newcastle United but a man who thinks Mikel Arteta is The Deluded One still has to have a dig.",
      "F365’s ‘goals from open play’ table highlights the creativity of Arsenal’s title rivals while the Gunners continue to rely on set-pieces for two-thirds of their goals…",
      "While Man Utd are this bad, they can’t afford a goalkeeper to be letting in more than he should. Ruben Amorim needs a stopper like Sunderland’s…"

      "",
      "I had largely fallen out of love with football but the decision of my 10-year-old son to start supporting Man Utd has dragged me back in. Suffice it to say, it has been miserable watching him suffer. All he has known is this dross.",
      "What is striking is how, no matter what Utd try, they fail. They have tried a Fergie mould (Moyes), a legend of the game (Van Gaal), the winning bastard (Mourinho), the good vibes guy (Solskjaer), methodical tacticians (Rangnick and Ten Hag) and now young hotshot (Amorim). And they’ve also thrown literal billions of pounds at it. But nothing seems to work.",
      "It is, of course, reminiscent of Liverpool’s fall from grace in the 90s and their long years in the wilderness. It’s not quite the same and less money was involved but still the parallel is reasonable. No matter what Liverpool tried it just didn’t seem to work. More than that they seemed “unlucky”. How else to explain Gerrard’s slip in 2015 that ended up giving away the one decent chance they’d had at the title in 25 years? The poor man had only delivered a rousing speech to his teammates admonishing them specifically not to let their title lead slip. He meant it figuratively but the universe took it literally and threw him on his arse. It was sheer banter just like it is now with Utd. No matter who they buy, no matter how well they play (it happens occasionally), they still fall on their arse. They seem, as it were, “cursed”.",
      "For Liverpool, though, that curse was lifted and I think often about how that happened.",
      "There was, of course, Fenway taking over and introducing sabermetrics that resulted in a wonderful recruitment programme. A well-run club is no doubt important but that does not lift curses. For that you need a shaman. And so, Liverpool hired one.",
      "Jurgen Klopp was the most remarkable football figure I had ever seen. Tall, loud, a grin like a madman, an exuberance like a bear high on honey, he dominated every room or stadium he walked into. I realise now that when he famously forced the Liverpool team to salute the fans after a miserable draw against West Brom early in his tenure he was actually performing an exorcism. He was grabbing the club by the scruff of the neck and shaking out all the trauma, all the scars and all the suffering so they could start again. He transfused belief into the players and the fans through sheer personality. While other managers were devising gameplans he was performing rituals. The success came later but that West Brom game was when the magic started.",
      "And that now is what Man Utd need. They don’t need a tactician or an organiser. They need a shaman like Klopp. They need a talismanic figure who can root out the negativity that has infected the club to its core and instil in everyone the belief needed to grow and return to success. They need someone who can perform spiritual surgery on their very soul.",
      "Unfortunately, these people are in short supply. You don’t learn this stuff on your UEFA Pro Licence course and Klopp himself is out of the question even though he’s exactly what Utd need. My head tells me Glasner should be appointed when Amorim is given the boot but another name draws my attention.",
      "Gareth Southgate is not Klopp. He is as uninspiring a prospect now as he was when he somehow got the England job. And yet, he did work out (sort of). England got to two major finals and a World cup semi. He did something right even though that something didn’t appear to be tactical or organisational. Rather, he helped move England past something. They won a knockout penalty shootout. More than that, the players seemed…happy? They played with a freedom and verve, liberated seemingly from the psychological dungeon the national team had been locked in for several decades themselves. He even seemed “lucky”, with England apparently receiving favourable draws in tournaments.",
      "In other words, despite not having anything like Klopp’s charisma or presence, Southgate dragged his team out of a psychological hole – a bigger one perhaps even than that inhabited by either Liverpool or Man Utd.",
      "So, maybe, just maybe, despite every indication to the contrary, Southgate is exactly what Utd need right now.",

      "In both wins so far this season, captain Fernandes has scored for the Red Devils.",

      "And his role at United could potentially see him look to the exit, as though he’s having some success in a deeper role than he’s used to – owing to Amorim’s system playing No.10s like wingers and therefore shoving Fernandes further back – he could be playing far better.",

United’s defence would look more secure as a back-four of [Noussair] Mazraoui, [Matthijs] de Ligt, [Leny] Yoro, [Luke] Shaw, shielded by two from [Kobbie] Mainoo/[Manuel] Ugarte/Casemiro, Bruno restored to his preferred 10, flanked by [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Matheus] Cunha serving [Benjamin] Sesko. But Amorim is too stubborn to change.’",

      "Another defeat for Manchester United, more inevitable and raucous debate about whether Ruben Amorim is the right man for the job.",
      "The noise from outside the club is growing, but within the Old Trafford halls of power, the United bosses remain steadfastly patient with the Portuguese head coach. Albeit with mounting frustration on all sides at the team's inconsistency.",
      "Amorim himself has repeated his assertion that he is not concerned about the possibility of being sacked, but he knows results have to improve significantly - and quickly - if he is to stay in the job.",
      "Despite reports to the contrary, sources are adamant the bosses are not lining up a list of replacements. The club, under its new INEOS stewardship, is determined to take a long-term view in all the decisions it takes - about player recruitment, facilities and the coaching staff - and so will not make any knee-jerk reaction to individual defeats.",
      "The trouble for Amorim is that results have been persistently poor since he took over, and the optimism-inducing win over Chelsea has been followed up with a chastening 3-1 defeat against Brentford. United have taken 34 points from his 33 games in charge, and have yet to muster back-to-back wins in his 11 months at the helm.",
      "United are not actively looking for their next manager. Nevertheless, every football club has contingency plans in place should they lose the head coach, in whatever circumstances, and it would be naive to think United will not have specific targets in mind if, for example, Amorim chose to resign.",
      "He said in August following the Carabao Cup humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town that \"sometimes I want to quit\". But he also said at the time \"sometimes I want to stay for 20 years\".",
      "At Old Trafford and Carrington, there are no murmurings for managerial change. But ultimately, it comes down to the decision of one man: Sir Jim. And his current levels of patience will not sustain indefinitely.",
      "Meanwhile, the club legends are lining up to voice their dismay - Wayne Rooney says he has \"no faith\" that Amorim can turn things around. Gary Neville says for the first time, he is worried the players are \"really doubting the system\".",
      "Crystal Palace are proving that Amorim's chosen formation can be successful. Oliver Glasner has used a consistent 3-4-2-1 shape, and has delivered the FA Cup and Community Shield already, with this team having just beaten the champions.",
      "Palace's achievements are an example of how it could work for United, but also a reminder of how poorly the team is doing by comparison. Palace are flying high in third spot in the Premier League. United are 14th.",
      "It is still very early in the season, we are only six league matches in. But Amorim desperately needs his system to start paying dividends. And there is growing doubt about some of his decision-making.",
      "Against Brentford when United were chasing the game, the head coach changed his back five, in either personnel or position, six times. Mason Mount only came on in the 81st minute, but he played two different positions in what was left of the match - No 10 and left wing-back - a move that Neville called \"unforgivable\".",
      "No timescale has been set for Amorim to get it right. There is no deadline in terms of games, or set target in terms of wins. And yet there is a growing sense that United's next game - Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday - has the feeling of being a must-win for the home side.",
      "With the international break straight afterwards and a two-week gap in club football, if that one were to end badly, then the clamour for Amorim's removal would only grow, and Ratcliffe's determination to stick with his man would be severely tested.",
      "Ruben Amorim is incredibly honest but also accurate when he reflects on and analyses his Manchester United side before and after games.",
      "So with the lack of European and Carabao Cup football, it is truly puzzling why United aren't able to address those flaws and show consistency with a full week to prepare on the training ground.",
      "Even more so, after they showed such grit and determination to beat Chelsea the weekend before only for it to evaporate at Brentford.",
      "The struggle for momentum pre-dates Amorim. United have not won back-to-back Premier League games in the same season since May 2024.",
      "The mental block in the squad is a problem he has inherited and one he continues to try to address.",
      "He has spoken about how he hoped the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo would alleviate that burden. But, despite some positive moments, it seems those old scars remain.",
      "Amorim has not yet shown the body of work at United that shows the required consistency is on the way. He would be the first to acknowledge that.",
      "Since his appointment, Amorim has picked up only 34 points in 33 Premier League games, a truly staggering statistic that nobody can hide from.",
      "One wonders how long the United leadership will allow this form to continue when you consider Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, was only given nine games last season before he was sacked.",

      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It shows how difficult it was with Gary Neville going from being adamant it was a penalty to being torn when he sees it again.",

      "\"One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in, then they have a four'. But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through [them], at times, would be on.\"",
      "Andrews, in his first season as a senior head coach, demonstrated the value in adaptability on Saturday, while Amorim finished the game with Mbeumo and Mason Mount as his wing-backs.",
      "Defeat at Brentford means that is exactly where United will start the month after finishing last season 15th in the table despite a spend of more than £200m over the summer on a new strikeforce, who failed to impress on their first outing together at Brentford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko did manage to score his first United goal, though there was little spark between himself, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There's got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager's idea has got to land very quickly with the players,\" Neville, the former United captain, said at the time.",
      "United's decision-makers are behind Amorim, but another defeat when Sunderland go to Old Trafford next week would ramp up the pressure on the head coach over the international break.",
      "However, Amorim, who has reportedly offered his job up on more than one occasion, says fears about potentially being sacked do not enter his mind.",
      "\"I'm always comfortable with the job,\" Amorim told BBC Sport. \"I've proved that already. I'm not concerned, that is not my decision. I will do the best I can in every minute that I'm here. I'm never concerned for my job, I'm not that kind of guy.\"",
      "Amorim got a message of backing after the Manchester derby defeat. You wonder how many more set-backs he can survive before patience runs thin.",
      "Results are the only thing that can save Amorim and he knows that. His record in the league stands at nine victories in 33 games. That is a win percentage of 27.3 per cent, lower than any other to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson by some distance.",
      "United have made a habit of starting games at a fast pace this season, certainly against Arsenal, Fulham, Burnley and Chelsea. Amorim wants his team to get off to a good start because he knows what happens when they don't.",
      "Each league game this season in which United have conceded the first goal, they have lost.",
      "The pressure cooker of Old Trafford has been too much for most players to sign for the club over the last decade and Amorim is trying to find a way to build confidence in the way his team plays.",
      "He has enjoyed some success with this, at least in United's home games, but at Brentford, there was no sign of the electric start that overcame Chelsea. Without the crowd, the players struggle to cope.",
      "This is reflected by their current eight-game winless run away from home in the league. The last one came in March at Leicester, who were relegated a month later.",
      "Before that, it was at Fulham at the end of January. United were hardly convincing in that game either. Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike just got them over the line.",
      "The mental fragility - and inability to cope without the support of Old Trafford - is a huge hindrance to Amorim's bid to bring consistency back to United.",
      "\"It's like ups and downs,\" said Amorim, when asked about this latest setback.",
      "\"When you win, you feel that everything and that the momentum is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "\"I cannot tell you more than I say every time I lose the game. Sometimes you see one team that performs really well and you see improvements, and then sometimes you have some games that you don't see the improvement that gives you the confidence to say that Manchester United is going to get back.",
      "\"It's always the same conversation.\"",
      "Amorim has been in the job for 10 months and is yet to win consecutive games in the league. Momentum feels extremely distant right now."

      "Bruno Fernandes had a penalty saved as Manchester United fell to a 3-1 defeat at Brentford to put the spotlight back on Ruben Amorim as his search for back-to-back league wins continues.",
      "United were 2-1 down as Fernandes waited more than four minutes to take his second-half spot-kick which was eventually saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after VAR checked if Nathan Collins should have been sent off for denying Bryan Mbeumo a goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson's decision to book Collins was upheld, without him being sent to the monitor, despite the Brentford defender making no clear attempt to play the ball when pulling his former team-mate back by the shoulder.",
      "Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball.\n\n\nIn all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.",
      "United only have themselves to blame for the result, their third defeat in a four-game winless run at Brentford, that was sealed when Mathias Jensen struck a superb third goal in stoppage-time. All the momentum of the win over Chelsea had vanished.",
      "Brentford were two goals up after 20 minutes thanks to Igor Thaigo's first-half double and, although Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit six minutes later, United were never convincing in their fight-back.",
      "Fernandes' second failure from the spot this season ultimately cost United, who are now winless in their last eight away league games and back in the bottom half as Brentford climb above them thanks to a richly deserved three points.",
      "Brentford Kelleher (7), Kayode (8), Collins (7) Van den Berg (7), Hickey (7), Henderson (8), Yarmoliuk (8), Ouattara (7), Damsgaard (7), Schade (8), Thiago (9). \n\n\nSubs: Lewis-Potter (6), Henry (6), Onyeka (6), Janelt (6), Jensen (7).\n\n\nMan Utd: Bayindir (6), De Ligt (5), Maguire (5), Shaw (5), Dalot (4), Ugarte (5), Fernandes (4), Dorgu (5),  Mbeumo (5), Sesko (6), Cunha (5).\n\n\nSubs:  Mainoo (6), Yoro (5), Mount (5), ZIrkzee (5).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Igor Thiago.",
      "Amorim disagreed with the decision not to send off Collins but said his team should have done more to manage the game after Fernandes failed to convert his penalty.",
      "\"They told me Bryan was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled,\" Amorim said in his post-match press conference.",
      "He added: \"Sometimes the decisions are not in your favour. We have the capacity to calm down the game. We didn't do that today.\"",
      "Former Premier League official Mike Dean, speaking on Soccer Saturday, was in agreement: \"For me, it is a red card.\"",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three at the back system, but head coach Keith Andrews kept his midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were outnumbered and overrun by Brentford.",
      "Asked if he felt it was an area to target, Andrews said: \"It's the natural way you prepare for games. You try and create overloads. One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in then they have a four.",
      "\"But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through, at times, would be on. And I felt, going back to it, the players did that with real courage and conviction.\"",
      "On goalscorer Thiago, Andrews added: \"He's getting real rhythm in his game now and confidence in his game. He's shown exactly why the football club brought him here. He's such a powerful player. Very positive individual and very selfless.\"",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Old Trafford. They came to Brentford in search of the club's first back-to-back league wins under Amorim, but Thiago scored twice in the first 20 minutes before the United players had woken up.",
      "Harry Maguire was culpable for the opener as Jordan Henderson's long ball over the top caught him napping. Thiago was all alone when he hammered in the opener. The whole stadium thought he was offside, only for replays to show Maguire was slow off the mark.",
      "United, losers in every league game in which they have trailed this season, were unable to cope with Brentford, who terrorised their visitors from set-pieces. Altay Bayindir made two fine saves from Henderson and then Collins but was at fault for Thiago's second.",
      "The Brentford striker just had to fire in from close-range after Kevin Schade's cross was spilled by Bayindir in the six-yard box. Thiago needed just six touches to score his two goals, which takes him to five in seven games this season.",
      "This was the first time Amorim had started United's £207m front three of Mbeumo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha but the first impression was not a positive one. Their lack of desire to help in midfield left the pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte exposed.",
      "Sesko did manage to break his United duck in his fourth start for the club as Patrick Dorgu's hopeful, looping cross eventually found him. It took three goes to beat Kelleher from close-range, the former Liverpool keeper pulling off a couple of fine saves.",
      "Brentford taking their foot off the gas gave United encouragement, though they lacked punch. When the spot-kick was awarded it felt like the piece of luck that Amorim needed to turn his troubled tenure around, but Fernandes let him down.",
      "There was no response from United as Brentford took further encouragement before adding a deserved third in stoppage-time through substitute Jensen. His swerving shot finished centrally to make Bayindir look foolish. He was not the only one.",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",
