      "Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi could lose his job after their early exit from the Champions League(Image: Jean-Francois Monier/AFP)",
      "Roberto De Zerbi is said to be at risk of being sacked by Marseille in the wake of their early exit from the Champions League - just weeks after being touted as a contender for the Manchester United job.",
      "The former Brighton chief, 46, joined the French giants back in the summer of 2024 and his stock remains high in the Premier League off the back of his impressive stint with the Seagulls. However, De Zerbi is in 'great danger' of the sack after failing to get Marseille through the league phase of the Champions League.",
      "RMC Sport claim that talks are even underway with a view to announcing the Italian's departure, such is the anger over Marseille's chastening 3-0 defeat by Club Brugge on Wednesday night; a result which ended the club's hopes of reaching the play-off round.",
      "While it remains to be seen if Marseille will pull the trigger, the club's sporting director, Medhi Benatia, pulled no punches with his words post-match, though he seemed to direct his ire at the players rather than De Zerbi.",
      "He said: \"I hope that the players are aware that tonight is a professional foul. I've lost games in my career, I've rarely felt that sense of shame, being able to concede six goals in two games. I want it to have consequences on the rest of the season.\"",
      "Michael Carrick has impressed since stepping in at United but may not land the head coach job permanently(Image: (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images))",
      "If De Zerbi is removed from his post by Marseille then it could create an intriguing scenario for the powerbrokers at Manchester United, who are expected to appoint their new long-term head coach in the summer.",
      "After the sacking of Ruben Amorim, Michael Carrick was handed the reins on a contract until the end of the season and has impressed in his first two weeks in the role, beating both Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "De Zerbi won plenty of admirers during his time in the Premier League with Brighton(Image: Getty Images)",
      "However, it's expected United will seek a different coach to replace Amorim permanently, with numerous reports claiming De Zerbi is of interest to the Old Trafford hierarchy.",
      "And availability could play a factor if United do decide to act on their admiration for a coach who built up an impressive body of work at Brighton before moving overseas.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United were reportedly targeting Mohamed Kader Meite(Image: Photo by DAMIEN MEYER / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United are poised to miss out on two transfer targets to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal. United have been quiet in the January transfer window, with the club preferring to wait until the summer, when a new long-term manager will be appointed, to move - and their approach has seen two players taken off the market.",
      "United spent £200million to change their front line over the summer, with Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha arriving. But the dismissal of Ruben Amorim earlier this month - and the positive impact made by Michael Carrick - has prompted the club's hierarchy to bide their time on further business.",
      "The Red Devils want to overhaul their midfield next but will wait until the summer transfer window, when there will be some clarity over the identity of the next long-term manager. That decision to hold fire has seen two potential targets snapped up by the same club.",
      "The Guardian have reported that United are among the European clubs interested in Rennes striker Kader Meite. They even contacted the 18-year-old's representatives to explore a possible move.",
      "Mirror Man Utd - FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "But those efforts have all been in vain, with Al-Hilal swooping for the young talent. After seeing their €23million (£19.9m) offer rejected by Rennes earlier month, L'Equipe reports that Al-Hilal have now struck a deal for €30m (£26m) plus €3m (£2.6m) in bonuses for Meite, who has three goals and two assists in 19 appearances this season.",
      "The move is a significant one, given Saudi Pro League clubs have generally tended to target high-profile players coming towards the end of their careers previously. But there has been a shift inside the league, with clubs now trying to recruit younger up-and-coming stars who will retain, or increase, their value.",
      "There is more bad news from Al-Hilal for United, too, with Fabrizio Romano saying that the club are now in the final stages of agreeing a new contract for Ruben Neves. The midfielder has been linked with a move to United this month due to the fact that his current contract is set to expire at the end of the season.",
      "Ruben Neves had been linked with a move to Manchester United(Image: (Photo by Jose Manuel Alvarez Rey/Getty Images))",
      "The 28-year-old midfielder joined Al-Hilal from Wolves in 2023 and has 17 goals and 30 assists in 113 games for the club. He has attracted some interest, with Real Madrid also said to be exploring a deal, but it now appears as though the Portugal international will stay in Saudi Arabia.",
      "With Neves about to be off the market, United have shortlisted Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson as targets for the summer, with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of the season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "It's Fulham up next for the Red Devils on Sunday, before deadline day looms into view on Monday. Plenty of business is expected up and down the top-flight before then as clubs look to get their squads in order before the final push towards the end of the season.",
      "It's no different at Old Trafford, where incomings and arrivals have been in short supply so far this month. One thing we do know for certain is that Casemiro will not be a United player next term after his exit was confirmed last week.",

      "Palmer is likely staying put(Image: Photo by Carl Recine - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "The focus for United is instead on bringing in a world class defensive midfielder to replace the outgoing Casemiro. Adam Wharton, Elliot Anderson and Carlos Baleba are good Premier League options but all come with a massive price tag. Further, it's previously been reported that Anderson would prefer a move to Manchester City.",

      "Jude Bellingham and Jadon Sancho are great examples of youngsters who've ended up thriving in the Bundesliga, which is renowned for its physical demands.",
      "The bid for Noonan is reportedly £1.5m and all that's left to complete is personal terms and the 17-year-old's approval. Celtic are also huge admirers of Noonan but have also missed out despite putting a bid in for him.",

    "body": [
      "Man Utd have been told to suspend contract talks with midfielder Kobbie Mainoo. (Image: Carl Recine, Getty Images)",
      "Ex-Manchester United forward Louis Saha has called on the club to postpone contract negotiations with Kobbie Mainoo and, for the time being, focus on giving him more playing time after regaining his place in the XI under Michael Carrick. The 20-year-old's Old Trafford future appeared uncertain during the opening half of the season, as he battled to secure regular first-team football under ex-manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese head coach suggested Mainoo was competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a spot in their midfield - sparking whispers about a potential January departure. Following Amorim's exit and his restored role under Carrick, Mainoo has demonstrated his ability, delivering impressive displays in Premier League wins against Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Questions persist regarding the academy product's long-term prospects, though, despite holding a contract at Old Trafford until 2027, with suggestions that United are eager to commence discussions about enhanced terms and an extended deal. Yet Saha believes the emphasis should remain firmly on football matters.",
      "Saha told gambling.com: \"No, no, no, I think this is like good talk for the media and his agent and all that, to him. What he has to do is score more goals, assist more, play well and progress. That's it.",
      "\"Whatever, like that, people talk about contracts and stuff like this, you know, it's not good for him.",
      "\"He's only a young player who, yes, maybe played for England and has a World Cup to look forward to. He has to improve. That's it.",
      "\"Why are they thinking about contract extension, moving away, looking at McTominay's career or whatever? It's wrong.",
      "\"Just play, just play, just play, improve every day. It's two games, that's not enough. He needs to score maybe 10 goals, and then become the main man in midfield with Casemiro - and then people will give him the contract he wants. That's it.",
      "\"He doesn't need anyone else to speak about this extension, and think about this now. It's just about focusing on this game. He hasn't played for many months. He was on the bench.",
      "\"Now it's time for consistency. Get 15 games under his belt, bring him to the World Cup and see how it goes.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has been given more of a chance since the departure of Ruben Amorim.(Image: James Gill - Danehouse, Getty Images)",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "There's optimism that following a shaky beginning to the campaign under United's previous manager, the dugout switch can finally unlock Mainoo's full potential once more, as he's demonstrated previously. When Saha was questioned whether Mainoo's treatment was harsh or warranted, he said: \"It was a bit of both because, obviously, Amorim had different plans. So on those plans, it needed a bit of a different type of player in midfield.",
      "\"That doesn't mean at all that Kobbie Mainoo was not a good player. It's just that he wasn't fitting the style of Amorim, so that's why it's like, okay, fair to him.",
      "\"He's the manager, he decided to challenge the player and make him improve in a certain way to actually bring something else to his game. Because maybe Amorim was really fixed on that, really focused on that piece.",
      "\"I think maybe in some games he was wrong, in some others he was not. Some, as I said, we definitely needed more legs or more confidence, more, let's say, capacity to break down the opposition. It was not the case.",
      "\"We were too slow and, now, because of a different type of game and rhythm, we managed to get Mainoo and other players in that kind of frame where those guys are playing without the need to run around like a chicken without a head.",
      "\"So it's a different type of mentality, and every manager learns; they are still learning. Even [Sir] Alex Ferguson - at his age, in his prime, was still learning some games where, okay, I made these mistakes.",
      "\"I think Amorim will see a few things that he could have done better, and a few he did really well. Michael Carrick will make mistakes as well, and Kobbie Mainoo could be less of the focal point, because he's going to be in a team that's working.",
      "\"The strikers play their part, the midfielders play their part, and the defenders. Like, I see Maguire and Martinez; it's the core that needs to be very strong, not just one player. That was maybe the kind of mistake that has been made",
      "\"You know, the kind of foundation where a team provides the challenge, and more than players provide challenges. If there were no Bruno Fernandes, or if he's not performing, you're dead. That was the problem for United. It's over. The team needs to be working together, having an advantage physically, mentally and technically.\"",

      "Barcelona have an option to buy for £26m come the end of the campaign. And given his form, the Catalans look likely to do that. Rashford has notched nine goals and provided 12 assists in 31 appearances in all competitions - a record that includes a strike in Barcelona’s 4-1 win against Copenhagen in the Champions League.",

      "“For me it takes a little bit of learning to get used to because you can’t let them rest on the ball. Whoever is closest to the ball always has to put pressure. So it’s a little bit different to what I’d done before. But this is the style of defence we play and when it works it’s really good.”",
      "Flick has also given his verdict on Rashford’s performances in Spain and appears to be a big fan. He said: “I’m very happy with Marcus Rashford. Speed. Finishing. Control. He has amazing quality, really.”",

      "Speaking before the Copenhagen game, Flick pointed to Rashford as an example to the club’s younger players in the wake of Dro Fernandez’s controversial move to Paris Saint-Germain. He said: \"Marcus' performances have been really good until now, so we have to manage it, but it's [sporting director] Deco's job do things for next season.",

      "Maguire is now 32. Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reluctant to hand Maguire a new deal, and believes the likes of Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven can be developed into having a long-standing centre back partnership.",
      "While United still have the experience of Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt to lean on. But Maguire still has a lot of backing and support from senior figures at United. The England international has proved in recent games he is still one of the best defenders in the Premier League.",
      "While his knowledge and experience of being at United since 2019 has seen him become a defensive mentor to the likes of Yoro and Heaven. Interim manager Michael Carrick has not been consulted, when it comes to Maguire's contract situation.",

      "Wayne Rooney has opened up on his son Kai's initial reaction after making his Old Trafford bow for the Manchester United Under-18s. Kai, 16, joined United's academy aged 11 in 2020 and is on track to follow his father into the first team.",
      "The youngster featured for Darren Fletcher's Under-18s team in the FA Youth Cup clash with Derby County last week, entering as a substitute during the 2-1 fourth round triumph. It represented Kai's long-awaited debut at United's famous home ground, nearly nine years after his dad played at the Theatre of Dreams for the final time, though he's already played for the Under-18s in less illustrious surroundings.",
      "Wayne and his wife Coleen observed from the stands, despite Kai previously forbidding the former United and England skipper from watching his matches. Coleen has previously said Kai was determined from an early age there was little point in Rooney attending his youth team games.",
      "This was because of the fear that supporters would mob the former England star for signatures, which prevented him from actually viewing his son's performances. But there was no risk of that at Old Trafford, where he sat alongside Michael Carrick - the interim manager of United's first team - in the directors' box.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Speaking afterwards on his BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show, the England legend revealed the opening four words Kai uttered to him during the journey home from making his debut at the famous ground were: \"The pitch was massive.\"",
      "Rooney then dispelled the myth that the Old Trafford pitch is genuinely larger than at other Premier League stadiums. \"Steven Gerrard always used to say to me how big the Old Trafford pitch is, which it actually isn't because it's the same maximum size as a lot of grounds in the Premier League. But the surroundings make it feel bigger,\" he said.",
      "Discussing his paternal pride, the 40-year-old continued: \"Kai got moved up to the Under-18s squad for the Youth Cup and it was great to see him come on. It brought back memories of when I played in the Youth Cup for Everton. It was a proud moment and I'm delighted for him. Hopefully he continues that and he can have a good run with the team.\"",
      "Wayne and Coleen Rooney were at Old Trafford to watch son Kai in action(Image: James Gill - Danehouse, Getty Images)",
      "Kai was just 15 when he played his first minutes with United's Under-18s in August 2025. As it happens, the match came against Everton, where his father began his career and enjoyed a second spell after leaving United.",
      "He has featured sporadically for the side in the intervening months with an injury setback limiting his involvement. He has consistently caught the eye when playing, despite being one the youngest players in the squad after being fast-tracked up the ranks.",
      "Wayne and Coleen are parents to three other boys - Klay, Kit and Cass. Klay is also progressing through United's youth ranks, whilst Cass is treading his dad's path at Everton's academy, though Kit has already 'retired' rather than pursuing a career in football.",

      "Ryan Giggs' domestic abuse accusations led to him being overlooked for the Premier League's Hall of Fame(Image: Jan Kruger/Getty Images)",
      "The Premier League backed out of plans to make Ryan Giggs one of the first Hall of Fame members as he faced trial for domestic abuse.",
      "Alan Shearer was its first member and the original plan was to induct him alongside the 52-year-old Manchester United legend. Giggs held the record of scoring in every Premier League season until he retired and he has won the competition more than any player in history.",
      "The Telegraph reports that Giggs was due to be among the inaugural inductees, before it was delayed in 2020 by the Covid pandemic, and by the time it resumed the Welshman was facing domestic abuse charges and subsequently left off the list with Thierry Henry instead among the first two entrants.",
      "Giggs was found not guilty of coercive or controlling behaviour in July 2023 after his ex-girlfriend declined to give evidence in a retrial. He had always denied the charges and said at the time he was “deeply relieved”.",
      "Chris Daw KC, who represented Giggs, told Manchester Crown Court: “The position is that he has always been innocent of these charges and there have been very many lies told about him.”",
      "It has been two and a half years since his accuser withdrew her evidence and there is pressure to bring Giggs back into the conversation. Some have cited how individuals with criminal history have still been inducted into the Hall of Fame - and not doing so with Giggs represents double standards.",
      "Eric Cantona was previously convicted over assault, while Tony Adams was jailed for drink driving. John Terry, banned for four matches by the Football Association for racism, and Rio Ferdinand, banned for eight months for missing a drugs test, are both in the Hall of Fame.",
      "Giggs previously didn't appear bothered by his omission. He has told the Daily Mail: “It’s not something that I really think about. It’s been brought up a couple of times, and only then do I think about it. [The Hall of Fame] isn’t something you start in football to be in.”",

      "Napoli became one of the tournament's biggest casualties on a dramatic Champions League evening. The Italian outfit, despite enjoying home comforts against Liam Rosenior's side, finished 30th in the final standings while their visitors secured sixth place.",
      "McTominay and Manchester United loanee Rasmus Hojlund were unable to prevent a 3-2 loss in Naples. Chelsea's Enzo Fernandez broke the deadlock but the hosts hit back through Antonio Vergara and Hojlund before the break.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The Italian outlet awarded McTominay a player rating of six. The midfielder's \"mettle\" earned recognition but he was criticised for several turnovers in the middle of the park.",
      "However, Il Napolista acknowledged that McTominay carried a menace in attack, \"to the point of scaring [Chelsea goalkeeper Robert] Sanchez\". It still wasn't enough for Antonio Conte's team.",

      "However, the current Serie A MVP failed to trouble the scorers and could not deliver the crucial goals for Napoli on the night.",
      "That rating was equalled by Essere Partnopei, who similarly commended McTominay's drive in the middle of the park. The United academy product was \"very active as always\" and \" plays a lot of good balls\" but did not stop his team from crashing out of the Champions League.",

      "Roy Keane has been discussing Michael Carrick's chances of keeping the Manchester United manager job permanently(Image: (Photo by Michael Regan - The FA/The FA via Getty Images))",
      "Roy Keane has changed his mind on Michael Carrick, making clear he is now open to the idea of the interim head coach being handed the job on a permanent basis, after an impressive start to life at Manchester United.",
      "The early signs are positive, with impressive performances and results against Manchester City and Arsenal, with a suggestion that there is much more to come. While it remains to be seen what can be done in the remaining matches of the season, Keane has seemingly changed his tune on the interim boss after just two matches.",
      "Speaking on Stick To Football, he said: \"I hope they give it [the permanent job] to him. I hope they give it to him in the summer.\"",
      "That was challenged by Gary Neville, who responded: \"You said the other day, Roy...\" seemingly about to bring up that Keane was previously against that suggestion. Keane interrupted and responded: \"I don't think it's the right decision, good luck with it.",
      "\"Yeah, but, I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go 'listen, good luck to him', but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud [Van Nistelrooy], he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.",
      "\"But just cause you're doing well at United, it doesn't mean he'll do well at another club. He's got the players back, it's all been sliding doors moments. Great for him, and he's took advantage of it.\"",
      "While it isn't a total U-turn from Keane, who is still unconvinced on the move as a whole, it is a change of tune in believing that the job should be handed to Carrick. The 54-year-old has been vocal about the situation surrounding the interim role at United, raising some eyebrows when he aimed a dig at Carrick's wife in a previous podcast episode.",
      "Michael Carrick has impressed with two wins in two at Manchester United(Image: (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images))",
      "That seemingly brought to light a previous feud surrounding the pair, but full focus for the current caretaker manager has been on the job at hand at Old Trafford. While it may have required some convincing, victories against both Man City and Arsenal certainly help Carrick's case to be the permanent hire for the head coach role.",
      "It's not just the results, but the performances too, which have shown the right mix of gritty determination with a cutting edge in attack. It may still be early for many to judge the former midfielder on the small sample size so far, but there may be a better idea of how his team are really performing when they take on Fulham at the weekend.",
      "Carrick isn't getting carried away, however, nor is he likely to be coaxed into talking about the possibility of staying on as permanent head coach. \"I think it's more about the feeling that this gives us, really, as a group,\" he said after the victory over Arsenal at the weekend.",
      "\"And the players and as a club, and certainly the supporters. That’s my concern - how that can bring us together and lift us, in a real positive manner. I'm not getting all carried away, we've got some bigger games coming up, because the next game is always the bigger game.",
      "\"So we're not getting carried away. We've got really important things coming up and we need to keep improving. Two massive games, there's a lot of emotion, a lot of energy and a lot of confidence that you can take but we’ve got to be humble and understand how we’ve got these results. That's really important moving forward.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford celebrating with team-mate Raphinha(Image: Alex Caparros - UEFA, UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "While Manchester United look to get themselves back into the Champions League with their league performances, they already have a representative in this year's edition in the form of Marcus Rashford. Academy graduate Rashford is currently on loan at Barcelona - with a potential permanent transfer in the summer - and he found the net once more on Wednesday evening.",
      "Rashford was given roughly 20 minutes as a substitute and grabbed Barca's fourth goal as they overturned a deficit to secure a 4-1 win against FC Copenhagen in their final league phase fixture. The result was vital in securing their direct passage to the round of 16, avoiding an extra play-off round, with either Monaco, Qarabag, Paris Saint-Germain or Newcastle United awaiting them.",
      "Viktor Dadason put Copenhagen ahead early on at Camp Nou and it was a lead they maintained until half-time. However, second-half strikes from Robert Lewandowski, Lamine Yamal and Raphinha sent things back in Barca's favour before Rashford came off the bench to beat Copenhagen goalkeeper Dominik Kotarski with a late free-kick.",
      "\"We try to bring our best performances in the competition and we try to win,\" Rashford said following the victory. \"So I think this is the aim for a club like Barca and we have this mentality to win all the games that we can, so we'll do our best to do this.\"",
      "Rashford's strike marked his fifth Champions League goal of the campaign, putting him level with Fermin Lopez as Barcelona's joint-leading scorer in the competition this season. His performance caught the eye of the Spanish press following the match, with the round of 16 potentially providing him a chance to impress against familiar opposition.",
      "In Marca, Fernando Carnerero suggested this Barcelona display might not be enough for victory against stronger sides when the competition heats up in the knockout rounds. This was nothing to do with Rashford, though, with the writer's concerns centred mainly on the first-half showing before the Englishman made his impact.",
      "\"Barca continues to achieve its season objectives with a steady hand, though not without some struggles,\" Carnerero wrote. \"While some concerns remain, such as the excessive number of goals conceded, their attacking prowess minimizes this problem and gets them out of many tight spots.",
      "Barcelona players celebrating Rashford's goal(Image: LLUIS GENE, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"In the Champions League group stage, the first goal was to reach the top eight – to avoid playing two extra matches in the packed February schedule – and they achieved this after defeating Copenhagen with much more effort than expected, as the score was a surprising 0-1 at halftime. They went all out in the second half and it paid off thanks to goals from Lewandowski, Lamine, Raphinha, and Rashford. This may not always be the case in later rounds and against tougher opponents.\"",
      "Laura Aparicio described Rashford's free-kick as \"spectacular\" in Mundo Deportivo. Yet, the comeback triumph was primarily down to \"The talent and brilliance of Lamine [Yamal], who carried the team on his shoulders.\"",
      "MD also gave player ratings for Barcelona's squad, including those like Rashford who featured for only part of the game. The England international earned the label 'sniper' after converting that crucial late free-kick.",
      "\"His fifth Champions League goal made him Barca's joint European top scorer with Fermín,\" Xavier Munoz noted. \"He achieved it with a stunning free kick, the fourth for the club since Messi's departure. The crossbar denied him another brace.\"",
      "Lionel Messi got a mention in Santi Gimenez's analysis for AS as well. \"Barca continued their search for goals and Rashford managed to break the curse of direct free-kick goals since Messi left, scoring [to make it] 4-1 in that way,\" the assessment stated.",
      "Indeed, this marked the first occasion any Barcelona player had netted a direct free-kick in the Champions League since 2019, when Messi found the net in the opening leg of their semi-final clash with Liverpool, while only a handful have achieved the feat in any competition. Also writing in AS, Sergi de Juan highlighted that the Catalan giants had attempted 50 free-kicks between those two successful strikes.",
      "Lionel Messi celebrating scoring against Liverpool in 2019(Image: Anadolu, Getty Images)",
      "\"Marcus Rashford achieved against Copenhagen what seemed impossible at Barcelona since Leo Messi's departure: scoring a free kick,\" he penned. \"The English striker had already proven himself a specialist in this type of play at Manchester United, but he hadn't yet had the opportunity to score one for the Catalan club.",
      "\"He finally did so in the last Champions League group stage match, drawing the foul himself. He curled the free kick over the wall to the near post, deceiving the goalkeeper.\"",
      "Sport highlighted Rashford's double against Newcastle in September when discussing what lies in wait for Barcelona. \"Real Madrid will be worn down for two weeks (in the play-offs), while Barça can rest while awaiting the round of 16,\" journalist Ferran Correas noted.",

      "Cole Palmer celebrates scoring at Old Trafford",
      "Cole Palmer couldn't hide his anger on his last visit to Old Trafford. Returning to a stadium he used to frequent as a young Manchester United supporter, he endured a miserable 20 minutes before a recurrence of a groin injury that has wrecked his season for club and country.",
      "Palmer pointed to the problematic groin when he became the third Chelsea player to be substituted in a disastrous opening to the match last September. He grabbed his heavy jacket to shield himself from the torrential rain and trudged down the touchline towards the tunnel.",
      "The 23-year-old might well hope for a happier return at some point in the future. Born in the United hotbed of Wythenshawe, Palmer's allegiances to the red side of Manchester have never been a secret. A photo of him wearing the 2010/11 home kit often surfaces on social media.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The question is whether he will ever get to wear the red of United again. There are people who grew up with Palmer who believe he will want to make that happen at some point in his career.",
      "Speaking in January of this year, he talked about the enjoyment he gets from going back to Old Trafford and the memories it stirs in him. Plenty of professional footballers cast their loyalties aside once the sport becomes their job, but it seems Palmer still has a soft spot for his boyhood club.",
      "That has never affected his professionalism at Chelsea. He has scored four goals against United for the Blues and is tied down at Stamford Bridge on a contract that lasts until 2033.",
      "Cole Palmer had a difficult time of it on his last return to Old Trafford(Image: (Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images))",
      "A return to Manchester is almost impossible to see at the moment, but that doesn't mean it should be written off for good. Circumstances would need to align, but if they did, Palmer would likely jump at the chance. A few months after signing for Chelsea, the uncomplicated Mancunian was talking about the difficulty of life in the capital.",
      "“London is different to Manchester, in terms of how big it is, and off the pitch doing stuff on my own, it’s difficult,\" he said while on England duty.",
      "He is nearly three years on from that now. He returns home to see friends and family regularly, but his frustration this season stems from those fitness issues. He has played just twice in eight Champions League fixtures and has started just 10 of 23 Premier League games, completing 90 minutes on just three occasions. His progress has stalled, and his place in England's World Cup squad is vulnerable.",
      "Chelsea's new head coach, Liam Rosenior, this week played down reports linking Palmer with a move to Old Trafford and said he had no reason to seek guarantees he wouldn't be sold.",
      "\"There's no reason for assurance. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere. There's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation. That's where I'm at,\" he said.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. I've had numerous conversations with him. Our thoughts are on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him. He loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player. You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth. There's no point in having a discussion about it.",
      "\"It's simple. Cole is an incredible player. I'm not surprised at the timing. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there are people unsettled. It's not true. Cole's here, he's very happy and I can't wait to see him back on the pitch.\"",
      "Palmer is simply not going to be going anywhere this summer. A move to United is something he would be open to at some stage, but there are clear roadblocks to that.",
      "His lengthy Chelsea contract, for starters, and his status as someone who is seen as untouchable at Stamford Bridge. This season might be heading towards being a write-off, but he has plenty of credit in the bank. There is also the issue of whether United would want him or could afford him.",
      "Cole Palmer in a Manchester United shirt as a child",
      "As a left-footed attacker, there is no room for him at his boyhood club. Patrick Dorgu, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo can all play off the right, while Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha are options at No. 10. United's priority lies in midfield, and if they strengthen the attack, it will be on the left wing, a position Palmer is unsuited to.",
      "There is no doubt that Palmer returning to Manchester to sign for United would be one of the biggest transfers in Premier League history. It would turn heads and be a serious coup. Director of football Jason Wilcox knows Palmer from their time together at the Manchester City academy.",
      "There would also be a romanticism to it. Palmer grew up idolising Wayne Rooney. He was so devoted to United that he would sometimes wear club kit to training with the City academy, just to remind himself of his loyalties as much as anything.",
      "If anything, maybe United missed their chance back then. Academy coach Colin Little told the Talk of the Devils podcast last year that Palmer was close to moving across town at the age of 16, only to stick with City. His struggles to nail down a spot in the first team at the Etihad led to his £42.5million switch to Chelsea in the summer of 2023.",
      "He has lit up the Premier League since then and is regularly considered one that got away for Manchester City. Maybe he's one that got away for Manchester United as well. One of their own who was born down the red, but whose professional journey so far has taken in the Etihad and Stamford Bridge, but not Old Trafford.",
      "That's not going to change this summer. But that doesn't mean it will never happen. There might come a time in the next few years when Palmer sees himself back in red.",

      "Senne Lammens comes to clear another corner against Arsenal",
      "Senne Lammens has doubtless never experienced anything quite like what he did at the Emirates on Sunday. The viral picture that did the rounds earlier this week, showing him surrounded by players from both sides, does a good job of explaining the test for goalkeepers against Arsenal.",
      "It was clear the Gunners fancied their chances of getting at an inexperienced goalkeeper at this level. Time and again, they crowded him out, blocked his path to the ball and looked to stick deliveries right into his six-yard box. It was a tactic that had worked against the last two Manchester United goalkeepers they have faced.",
      "Andre Onana was unconvincing in a Premier League defeat at the Emirates last season, and Altay Bayindir was found flapping at Old Trafford on the opening day of this season.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "In contrast, Lammens looked unflappable. The trust his defenders have quickly developed in him was made clear by Harry Maguire's Instagram post on Monday. The image showed Lammens surrounded by at least 13 players and included the captain 'Come on Senne Lammens punch another one clear for us\".",
      "It was a calm and composed performance from a young goalkeeper developing a reputation for just those traits. Lammens is just 23, which is no age for a first-choice goalkeeper, and is also relatively inexperienced. He made just 68 appearances in Belgium's top division before signing for United for £18.2million this summer.",
      "That was a battle won by the club and the scouting department, particularly goalkeeping talent spotter Tony Coton, who liked the look of Lammens. It was a gamble to sign a goalkeeper from Belgium and throw him straight in at Old Trafford, but he has had a good season and has the longevity that Emiliano Martinez doesn't. The Argentine was the man that Ruben Amorim wanted in goal.",
      "Lammens was so composed on debut that he was serenaded with chants of 'Are you Schemichel in disguise?'. His work with the ball at his feet has been risk-free and he is commanding in his box. There have been none of the jitters that accompanied the sight of Bayindir competing for a high ball.",
      "Senne Lammens has impressed since joining(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He also exudes calm to those in front of him, unlike Onana. Lammens is an organised goalkeeper capable of making good decisions. With Onana, you were never quite sure what was going to happen next, and that kind of uncertainty can spread to a defence.",
      "As you would expect from any young goalkeeper, Lammens hasn't been faultless, but his errors haven't been as glaring as those committed by Onana and Bayindir. He didn't have a great game in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth and could have done better with Everton's goal in their win at Old Trafford. Compared to what came before, these are minor quibbles.",
      "In fact, the best thing you can say about Lammens is that nobody is really talking about him, and for a goalkeeper, that is a good position to be in. If your goalkeeper is attracting a lot of attention, it is rarely good news.",
      "Lammens' name was prominent again on Thursday morning, but for his goalscoring rather than his goalkeeping. Anatoliy Trubin's dramatic header for Benfica against Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday was a stunning moment, and Lammens knows how it feels to score against the Spanish giants, albeit at a slightly different level.",
      "He did just that for Club Brugge against Real Madrid's youngsters in the UEFA Youth League back in 2019. His header secured a point in a 2-2 draw. He has already been up for a corner for United this season, adding to the chaos at Tottenham when Matthijs de Ligt got an injury-time equaliser.",
      "Maybe one day Lammens can follow in the footsteps of Peter Schmeichel by scoring for United. For now, just trying to get close to the standards he set in goal for the club is enough.",

      "Harry Maguire and Matheus Cunha celebrate the Brazilian's winner at Arsenal(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Manchester United bosses are yet to decide on what to do about Harry Maguire - with club chiefs understood to be split over the future of the veteran centre-back.",
      "Maguire, now 32, will become a free agent in June, and has not been offered a contract extension to remain at Old Trafford. He is allowed to open talks with other clubs - and his representatives from 'Triple S Management' have been in dialogue with some from across Europe..",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is reluctant to hand Maguire a new deal. Instead, he believes young duo Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven can develop into a long-term partnership, while United also have Lisandro Martinez and Matthijs de Ligt to lean on - a duo still in the mid 20s but whom boast a wealth of experience.",
      "However, England international Maguire still boasts a lot of backing and support from senior figures at United. And he has proved in recent games that when fit and focused, he is still one of the best defenders in the Premier League.",
      "Behind the scenes, his knowledge and experience of being at United since his £80million switch from Leicester City in 2019, has seen him become a defensive mentor to the likes of Yoro and Heaven.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Interim boss Michael Carrick has not been consulted on the subject of Maguire, when it comes to his contract situation. However, Carrick has let it be known Maguire is still valued, and remains an integral part of the team's future.",
      "It's understood Maguire is reluctant to move abroad and uproot his young family. He knows his best chances of winning more England caps in the future will be improved if he remains at Old Trafford. And he is willing to accept a reduction of his £200,000-a-week wages.",
      "Co-owner Ratcliffe lacks experience when it comes to running a football club, and there are serious questions around whether he understands the bigger picture when it comes to some of United's senior players.",
      "Brazilian midfielder Casemiro has already announce he will leave in the summer, and there's a chance skipper Bruno Fernandes could do the same. United already have a problem when it comes to leaders among the club's playing contingent, and losing the aformentioned duo and Maguire would further expose the problem.",
      "United are in rebuilding mode but defence is not one of the priorities. And if Maguire is still capable of being a colossus in the biggest games, like he has been in the recent wins over Manchester City and Arsenal, it would make no sense to let him walk out of the door.",
      "There's no doubt Maguire has had tough times during his Old Trafford career, frozen out by managers looking for something else - and of course being stripped of the captaincy by Erik ten Hag.",
      "But he has shown remarkable character and resilience to come back fighting and prove those who doubted him wrong. Ultimately he outlasted both Ten Hag and Ruben Amorim.",

      "Roy Keane has been against Michael Carrick getting the Manchester United job permanently(Image: Stick to Football)",
      "Roy Keane has had a change of heart regarding Michael Carrick, now suggesting he would support the interim head coach being given the role permanently at Manchester United, following an encouraging start to his tenure.",
      "The 44-year-old was brought in mid-season to guide the club through the remainder of the campaign, after Ruben Amorim's spell at United came to an abrupt conclusion.",
      "With the Premier League standings still fluid, there's a feeling that European qualification remains achievable if Carrick can navigate the team successfully.",
      "The initial indications are promising, with strong displays and results against Manchester City and Arsenal, hinting that there's plenty more potential to be unlocked.",
      "Whilst the outcome of the remaining fixtures is yet to be determined, Keane appears to have altered his stance on the interim manager after merely two matches.",
      "During an appearance on Stick To Football, he stated: \"I hope they give it [the permanent job] to him. I hope they give it to him in the summer.\"",
      "Gary Neville questioned this position, replying: \"You said the other day, Roy...\" seemingly preparing to reference Keane's previous opposition to the idea.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Keane cut him off and responded: \"I don't think it's the right decision, good luck with it.",
      "\"Yeah, but I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go 'listen, good luck to him', but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be.\"",
      "\"I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud [Van Nistelrooy], he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.",
      "\"But just cause you're doing well at United, it doesn't mean he'll do well at another club.",
      "\"He's got the players back, it's all been sliding doors moments. Great for him, and he's took advantage of it.\"",
      "While this isn't a complete reversal from Keane, who remains sceptical about the move overall, it does represent a shift in his stance towards Carrick taking on the role.",
      "Michael Carrick has impressed with two wins in two at Manchester United(Image: (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images))",
      "The 54-year-old has been outspoken about the interim situation at United, causing a stir when he made a jibe at Carrick's wife in a previous podcast episode.",
      "That appeared to highlight a past dispute between the two, but the interim boss has kept his attention firmly on matters at Old Trafford.",
      "Whilst it may have taken some persuading, wins against both Man City and Arsenal have certainly strengthened Carrick's credentials for the permanent manager's position.",
      "It's not merely the results, but the displays as well, which have demonstrated the proper balance of resolute spirit alongside attacking sharpness.",
      "Though it might still be premature for many to assess the former midfielder on such limited evidence thus far, a clearer picture of his team's true capabilities may emerge when they face Fulham this weekend.",
      "Carrick isn't letting it go to his head, though, and he's unlikely to be drawn into speculation about remaining as permanent manager any time soon, telling his side to stay \"humble\" as they look to push on.",

      "Manchester United will not move for Cole Palmer, the Chelsea and England star, this summer for two key reasons.",
      "Firstly, and simply, United bosses know that Palmer, a boyhood supporter of the club, is out of the club's price range this summer.",
      "And secondly, an attacking midfielder is not on the club's list of priorities when it comes to strengthening the side.",
      "United invested almost £135million in the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo last summer, while also spending big on a new No.9 in Benjamin Sesko. With Amad making rapid progress too, they aren't short of options in attacking positions, and believe other areas need greater attention this off-season.",

      "Chido Obi retains huge potential.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Chido Obi took selfies with young Manchester United fans at Old Trafford last week. The striker scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory after dropping down to play in the FA Youth Cup against Derby.",
      "The teenager made his first Under-18 appearance in an on-record fixture for 11 months. United fastracked Obi after his arrival from Arsenal, and he made seven first-team appearances in the second half of last season, so it was interesting to see him be handed a start in a competition for U18s.",
      "On the surface, it may seem like Obi has regressed, given he dropped down to play U18 football again, but his inclusion in the team to face Derby was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "The Youth Cup is for players who are under 18 on August 31 of the current campaign. Obi celebrated his 18th birthday in November, making him eligible for the competition for a successive season.",
      "Ultimately, there are two factors at play when United decide which academy fixtures a young player should feature in. The first, and most important, is whether it's best for the player to partake in that game. Will they learn from the experience? Will it aid their development? Those conversations take place among coaches.",
      "The second consideration is the wider context. Will the team have a better chance of winning with said player? How will the team members complement each other? Is the team strong enough to compete?",
      "United academy sources have maintained the development of individuals is more important than results, but football is about winning at the end of the day. And United want their young players to win.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Obi pictured after playing in the Youth Cup last week.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "It's a balancing act for staff to decide which academy players should feature in specific competitions across the age groups, and it was decided that Obi should start against Derby. How much he learned from the experience is debatable, but he scored the decisive goal, which vindicated the decision.",
      "The prestige of the Youth Cup was a factor in the decision to start Obi. United have won the competition more than any other club, and it's the pinnacle of academy football, which everyone wants to win.",
      "Obi fired the U18s to the final four of the Youth Cup last season, scoring seven goals in just four matches, but he was marked out of the semi-finals by eventual winners Aston Villa.",
      "Fletcher hopes his side can reach the final - and win it. The prospect of Obi and JJ Gabriel playing together in the competition is exciting, but there was a moment against Derby when they got in each other's way.",
      "It will be interesting if Obi is involved with the U18s when they play Oxford in the next round of the Youth Cup. On paper, Gabriel alone could provide United with enough quality to progress to the quarter-finals.",
      "It certainly won't do Obi any harm to help the U18s lift the Youth Cup this season, but his involvement does spark discussion about his development and what to expect in the next few years.",
      "Obi played 52 minutes for the first-team against Fulham in the proper FA Cup in March last year. That was his first taste of playing in front of a full capacity at Old Trafford, but there were just over 2,000 fans within the ground to watch the youngsters take on Derby in the Youth Cup.",
      "Obi and Gabriel are a force to be reckoned with in the Youth Cup.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The truth is that Obi still needs time to develop. He was overexposed to senior football last term due to injuries, and staff agreed he needed to learn away from the spotlight in this campaign.",
      "That might have been a hard pill to swallow for Obi, considering he became the youngest player to start a Premier League game for United against Brentford before excelling during the post-season tour.",
      "Obi scored twice against Hong Kong, looking better than Rasmus Hojlund. The same comment had been made when Obi replaced Hojlund in the FA Cup defeat to Fulham a few months before that trip.",
      "The youngster started against Leeds in Stockholm - Hojlund was named on the bench - in the opening pre-season friendly of the summer, but only started one game during the United States tour.",
      "Since then, Obi has exclusively played in academy fixtures, and his only senior squad appearance came against Wolves, when the Premier League's worst side visited Old Trafford at the end of last month.",
      "United fans were desperate to see more of Obi in the first-team after some encouraging, albeit green, performances, however, he has predominantly played for the U21s this term.",
      "Obi has been challenged by senior opposition for the U21s, playing in the National League Cup and EFL Trophy, two competitions which pit academy players against senior teams. United academy coaches love those competitions because there is no place to hide against senior players.",
      "Obi pictured during the USA tour last summer.",
      "The 18-year-old has continued to score, netting seven in 19 games, but his output has slightly dipped after a freakish first campaign at the club, and there is still more to work on.",
      "Obi's decision-making and last ball in the final third need improvement, as does his work rate out of possession. United have felt academy fixtures are the best place for him to develop those aspects of his game.",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "Chido Obi of Manchester United (Image: 2025 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "\"I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come. That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Binnion continued: \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals. And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games.",
      "\"If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do. The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",
      "Obi hopes to return to the first-team by the end of the season. He's in safe hands to achieve that aim.",

The former England assistant became part of Carrick's backroom staff with United winning their last two games against bitter rivals Manchester City and table-toppers Arsenal.",
      "The latter victory was secured in dramatic fashion with United continuing to attack even after Mikel Merino's 82nd minute equaliser with Matheus Cunha smashing home a late winner. While many would have basked in the glory of such a big victory, though, Holland was already looking ahead.",
      "According to BBC Sport, he and Carrick went through clips from that seismic triumph with a source quoted in the report stating that \"football is his life.\" That was in order to come up with a plan for this weekend's Premier League clash against Fulham.",
      "The source added: \"Whether it's Champions League, thoughts on players or something else, he has a hell of a brain when it comes to football detail.\" The following day, Holland and other members of United's coaching team were in at Carrington to further prepare for the impending visit of Marco Silva's side to Old Trafford.",

      "BBC Sport have also claimed he is a man of few words and is someone that is difficult to read. Another source has been quoted in their report stating: \"You never knew whether he was quietly content or silently raging,\" admitted a source who has worked with him.",
      "Though that often makes him hard to read, the impact of that is shown when the 55-year-old does speak with it then more likely those he is speaking to listen and take on board his words.",
      "And he has already been receiving high praise with former United and England captain Wayne Rooney seemingly predicting that would be the case when his arrival was confirmed.",
      "Speaking on BBC Sport's The Wayne Rooney Show, he said: \"I think Steve Holland's a really good appointment, as well. I worked with him with England and, tactically, he's very good. So yeah, we're all in hope, as well.\"",

The clarification satisfied Wright, who declared he would accept being dull if they still captured a first league crown in nearly 22 years.",

      "The Premier League withdrew their plans regarding Ryan Giggs and the Hall of Fame(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The Premier League withdrew plans to make Ryan Giggs one of the inaugural Hall of Fame inductees when he was facing trial over domestic abuse charges, which were later dropped. Alan Shearer became its first member and the initial proposal was to induct him alongside the 52-year-old Manchester United icon.",
      "Giggs held the distinction of netting in every Premier League campaign until his retirement and has claimed the title more times than any player in the competition's history.",
      "The Telegraph reveals that Giggs was scheduled to be amongst the founding inductees, before delays caused by the Covid pandemic in 2020. When the programme resumed, the Welshman was confronting domestic abuse allegations and was consequently omitted from the list, with Thierry Henry instead joining the first entrants.",
      "Giggs was cleared of coercive or controlling behaviour in July 2023 after his former partner refused to provide testimony in a retrial. He had consistently rejected the allegations and expressed being \"deeply relieved\" at the time.",
      "Chris Daw KC, who acted for Giggs, informed Manchester Crown Court: \"The position is that he has always been innocent of these charges and there have been very many lies told about him.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "It has been two-and-a-half years since his accuser withdrew her testimony and there is mounting pressure to reintroduce Giggs into discussions, reports the Mirror. Some have highlighted how individuals with criminal backgrounds have still gained admission to the Hall of Fame - and failing to do so with Giggs constitutes double standards.",
      "Eric Cantona was previously found guilty of assault, whilst Tony Adams served time for drink driving. John Terry, handed a four-match ban by the Football Association for racism, and Rio Ferdinand, suspended for eight months after failing to attend a drugs test, are both Hall of Fame members.",
      "Giggs has previously appeared untroubled by his exclusion. He told the Daily Mail: \"It's not something that I really think about. It's been brought up a couple of times, and only then do I think about it.",
      "\"[The Hall of Fame] isn't something you start in football to be in.\"",
      "Hall of Fame inductees are chosen through a combination of public voting, a shortlist compiled by a panel and final selections made by existing inductees. Eden Hazard and Gary Neville have recently gained entry.",
      "Ryan Giggs won 13 Premier League titles with Manchester United(Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Reach PLC contacted the Premier League for comment and, without addressing Giggs specifically, they stated: \"The Premier League Hall of Fame shortlist is selected at the discretion of the Premier League in consultation with members of the Premier League Awards Panel.",
      "\"The final inductees each year are determined by the existing members of the Hall of Fame. The shortlist is reviewed on an annual basis with a number of factors taken into account including previous shortlist voting data, eras, player positions and achievements.",

      "Manchester United celebrate Matheus Cunha's goal against Arsenal",
      "Manchester United continued their dream start under Michael Carrick as they secured back-to-back wins against the Premier League's top two with a famous victory at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "It felt like United had weathered the early storm from Arsenal when the hosts took the lead. It was a sloppy goal to concede and Lisandro Martinez got the final touch as he battled Jurrien Timber in his six-yard box.",
      "But United's response was excellent and they capitalised on an Arsenal defensive blunder to level. Martin Zubimendi's pass handed the chance to Bryan Mbeumo and he rounded David Raya to score.",
      "Carrick's side then took the lead with a stunning goal early in the second half. Dorgu teed the chance up for himself with some clever control and unleashed a stunning volley that hit the bar and went in. Mikel Merino looked like he had secured a draw for Arsenal only for Matheus Cunha to score almost immediately.",
      "Here's the MEN player ratings.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Senne Lammens: Good saves from Zubimendi and Saka and mostly dealt well with the aerial bombardment. Crowded out for the equaliser. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Dealt well with Trossard and looks a little more comfortable at right-back. The kind of solid and unfussy game he has needed. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Surely worth a new contract if this form continues. Looked the best centre-back on the pitch, which really is saying something. 9",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Should have been stronger against Timber for Arsenal's opening goal. One good block on Rice but Gyokeres troubled him. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended really well against Saka and stayed aware throughout. Arsenal used clever moment down that flank but Shaw was never exposed. 8",
      "Casemiro: Big contribution in his own box from set-pieces and used the ball well. Another reminder that he can still cut it at the highest level. 7",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Felt that United got a foothold in the game when they got the ball to Mainoo more often. Growing in confidence under Carrick and got the late assist. 8",
      "Amad: Took in-swinging corners and got his deliveries spot on. One poor choice on the break in the first half but kept at it. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Curious game. Sloppy with a couple of passes but also had moments where he looked really dangerous and led well when in front. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Weak defensive header in the build-up to the first goal but boy did he make amends. An incredible goal to put United ahead and maintain his own momentum. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Now scored against Liverpool, City and Arsenal. Took his goal really well and was a threat with his movement and clever runs. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Took up some good positions and again looked bright off the bench. Brilliant, brilliant goal. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Little time to make an impact. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Late sub. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Yoro, Heaven, Malacia, Ugarte, Mount",

      "Matheus Cunha celebrates scoring for Manchester United at Arsenal",
      "Michael Carrick stood motionless on the Emirates touchline. Hands behind his smart black jacket, dressed to kill like a Manchester United manager should be. Inside, his stomach must have been churning.",
      "He raised his left arm to try to wave his team forward, but his right arm never moved. He looked like the calmest man inside a stadium that had long since lost its head.",
      "A couple of minutes earlier, Casemiro had grabbed the back of Matheus Cunha's shirt and slammed him into the turf in sheer delight. That wasn't even to celebrate the forward's stunning goal, but to mark him winning a free-kick from an Arsenal corner. The emotions were everywhere, from a United side finding its mojo again to an Arsenal team that just can't take control of this title race.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Everywhere apart from the away technical area, that is. United's coaches poured out to appeal for a late free-kick as they defended another Arsenal cross. The unflappable Carrick barely flinched.",
      "When the full-time whistle blew, Carrick clenched his left fist and twice subtly punched the air next to him. There was a low-key embrace with his staff and a handshake with Mikel Arteta. For the 44-year-old Carrick, this is just what Manchester United do.",
      "As auditions go, this couldn't have got off to a better start. Carrick has guided United to wins against the Premier League's top two when a month ago they had looked like a team devoid of confidence and lacking enjoyment. This win against Arsenal was the kind of dramatic away-day success the very best United teams produce.",
      "They have had some moments to savour in the FA Cup here in recent years, but they hadn't won a league match at the Emirates since December 2017. That was the day of David de Gea's 14 saves and Jesse Lingard's double in a 3-1 victory under Jose Mourinho.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim had tried and failed to win a league fixture here. Carrick had at least some experience of success. He was among Solskjaer's staff for an FA Cup fourth-round win on a Friday night in January seven years ago.",
      "A lot had changed since then. Arsenal have gradually built to a point where their 22-year title drought could end in the next five months. United have cycled through a succession of failed managers and are back on another short-term appointment in Carrick. Short-term for now, at least.",
      "The feelings of de ja vu are pretty hard to escape right now. Carrick has delivered exactly the kind of uplift Solskjaer brought in December 2018, both in mood and performance. He has to be in the frame to get the job permanently after these victories. Any more of this and it may prove impossible to overlook him.",
      "This was a different kind of win, as well. They started the derby well last weekend and built the confidence that comes from seeing a game plan work on the pitch.",
      "At the Emirates, they began on the back foot. They faced a flurry of early set-pieces and Senne Lammens turned over a header from Martin Zubimendi at point-blank range. Set-pieces had seemed Arsenal's likeliest route to goal, but it felt like United had weathered the storm when they went behind.",
      "Patrick Dorgu failed to deal with Piero Hincapie's cross, Bukayo Saka found a pass to Martin Odegaard and his mis-hit shot was sliced into his own net by Lisandro Martinez. You feared for United at that point, but the response was exceptional before and after half-time.",
      "Bruno Fernandes almost capitalised on a defensive error from William Saliba before Bryan Mbeumo punished Zubimendi. The Spaniard's pass back towards his goal only succeeded in playing in United's false nine and he rounded David Raya before finishing.",
      "Arsenal had been shooting themselves in the foot, but they were powerless to stop the goal that gave United the lead. Dorgu manipulated a bouncing ball into a more promising position and then sent a 20-yard rocket fizzing past Raya, the ball hitting the underside of the bar and bouncing into the roof of the net to give the strike the kind of aesthetic it deserved.",
      "Dorgu's renaissance over the last five weeks has been one of the stories of United's season. He had struggled in the first half here, not only with Arsenal's goal but against Saka, who got far more joy against him than he did the excellent Luke Shaw. But Dorgu's future surely belongs further forward if his recent contributions in the final third are anything to go by.",
      "Arsenal piled the pressure on in search of an equaliser and looked to have rescued a point when Mikel Merino bundled a corner over the line, but United again responded almost immediately. Kobbie Mainoo poked a clever pass to Matheus Cunha, who bent a stunning shot from distance into the corner of the net.",
      "As the majority of the Emirates emptied, United's players gathered in front of a delirious away end at full-time. Casemiro handed his shirt to a fan, and Carrick was serenaded several times. By the time Cunha and the immense Harry Maguire finished their TV interviews, it was still full. There was time for one final flurry of fist pumps after a breathtaking victory.",

      "Ruben Amorim once walked over to observe some of an academy match at Carrington, but he did not make the effort to properly watch a youth game during his one-and-a-half-year tenure.",
      "Rooney sat alongside Carrick in the directors' box at Old Trafford to watch the U18s because his son, Kai, made an appearance from the bench. And United's all-time top goalscorer believes it's important to have first-team representation at academy fixtures to show support to youngsters.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",

Even on Saturday, they were all [first-team staff] at the Under-16 game as well before they travelled to London [to face Arsenal]. It has been missing. I have been quite vocal on this.",
      "\"It has been missing in the last few years. It is great to see that coming back into the club. When we had a Sunday game, after training, we used to finish training and go and watch the academy games.",
      "\"That was the norm. That is what I have known at Manchester United. With my two lads in the academy, I haven’t seen that. It was a bit disappointing. The lift it gives to the players, and the players’ parents, seeing the first team manager there. That is how the club should be run.\"",
      "Amorim's lack of support for the academy did not go unnoticed, and fans questioned his faith in young players. Toward the end of Amorim's tenure, he made headlines when he suggested Harry Amass was \"struggling\" on loan in the Championship and pointed to Chido Obi not starting every U21 game.",

      "Patrick Dorgu then fired United ahead, but Mikel Merino looked to have rescued a valuable point for the Gunners when he bundled the ball home from close-range.",
      "But Matheus Cunha had other ideas, as his stunner three minutes from time secured his side all three points. Following the game, Carrick held talks with Ratcliffe, but when put on the spot about what was discussed, he gave very little away except revealing his boss was a very happy man.",
      "“No, not much as you would expect, I think,” he told Viaplay. “There’s a lot of happy bodies around the camp today and he’s delighted as well. So it was nice to see him.”",
      "Peter Schmeichel then put the United boss on the spot by asking him if he had asked if he could come into his office today, to which a laughing Carrick replied: “No, not yet, Peter. I think it is nice when you can have that feeling with a big win like this, you know, coming away from home.",

      "Chido Obi scored against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The definition of an embarrassment of riches: more options or resources than one knows what to do with. Darren Fletcher had that when Manchester United played in the FA Youth Cup on Friday night.",
      "It almost felt unfair for JJ Gabriel and Chido Obi to start together against Derby County. They are both special talents who can hold their own against senior professionals, never mind fellow teenagers.",
      "Kai Rooney was on the bench. Wayne Rooney's son is that prolific in front of goal that he scored 56 goals in one season when he was 11. His father was in the stands, sitting alongside Michael Carrick, to watch.",
      "Carrick attended to show further support for the academy after watching the Under-21s in action on Tuesday. Carrick spoke about the importance of the Youth Cup and said that he was \"excited\" to attend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Steve Holland and Jonny Evans were also spotted in the directors' box. Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is understood to have welcomed the presence of the first-team staff at youth games again. Ruben Amorim did not show a similar interest during his one-and-a-half tenure in Manchester.",
      "Rooney tried to avoid attention when he arrived at Old Trafford, but a hood did not succeed in disguising his identity from a few excited supporters outside the ground, who stopped him for photographs.",
      "It was a big story that Rooney's son was on the bench at Old Trafford, nine years after his final game at the ground. Kai has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right wing. Left-footed, coming in off the right side.\"",
      "The warning signs were there for Derby. Gabriel danced down the left side - his balance is impressive - and played a delightful cross into the box. The 16-year-old was soon down that flank again, cutting inside and getting a shot away, only to be denied by Derby goalkeeper Cristiano Dzialuk.",
      "Gabriel looked dangerous from the start.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "Obi didn't want his younger peer to steal the show and attempted a shot of his own from the edge of the box. A few minutes later, he was denied by the outstretched legs of Dzialuk.",
      "The striker made seven Premier League appearances last season and starred during the post-season tour, but he's exclusively played in academy fixtures because coaches felt he still needs to develop.",
      "It's bound to have been difficult for Obi to drop down after getting a taste of playing in front of a full-capacity Old Trafford, however, anyone who has watched him play for the U21s this season will agree with the decision to move him down, as he still has parts of his game to improve.",
      "Obi's final ball, decision-making and work rate out of possession could be better. Nonetheless, he is a lethal striker at youth level, particularly at U18 level. Obi has rarely played U18 football since his arrival, but United want to win the Youth Cup and his inclusion in the team was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "Fletcher has returned to manage the U18s after briefly serving as caretaker. The 41-year-old was offered a role in Carrick's backroom staff, but felt it was the best choice for his career to return to the U18s.",
      "Fletcher was just as enthusiastic as he was in games against Burnley in the Premier League and Brighton in the FA Cup, shouting instructions to Gabriel and reminding Bendito Mantato of his defensive duties. \"Bendi, come on!\" Fletcher screamed when Derby made a promising counter-attack.",
      "Mantato had a great game against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The word before the game was that Derby needed to be respected and that proved to be the case. Despite the talent on the pitch for United, the away side looked capable of landing a blow.",
      "United goalkeeper Cameron Bryne-Hughes became busier as the match progressed. Fletcher grew increasingly agitated on the touchline. The game wasn't going according to the script, which was perfectly summed up by Gabriel and Obi getting in each other's way around Derby's box.",
      "There was audible anticipation in the stands when Gabriel was sent over the top with 10 minutes remaining, but Derby captain Rio Canoville recovered brilliantly to thwart the danger. Then Mantato, the standout performer in a red shirt, missed a huge chance with seconds of normal time remaining.",
      "Fletcher may have said to continue to 'huff and puff and blow their house down' when he prepared his team for extra-time. James Overy and Kai Rooney were introduced from the bench. Overy had an immediate impact by playing a cross into the box that led to the dreadlock being broken in the 101st minute.",
      "A demoralised Derby conceded again two minutes later, their resolve finally giving way. Obi scored the goal he'd been desperate for, and celebrated with a knee slide in front of the 2,000 fans.",
      "There were chants of 'Rooney, Rooney' when Kai Rooney was brought on from the bench. Derby set up a nervy end to the game by scoring to make it 2-1 late in extra-time, but it was ultimately United's strength in depth, their embarrassment of riches, that proved to be the difference on the night.",

      "Solskjaer and Carrick contended for the interim job this season.(Image: 2021 Alex Livesey - Danehouse)",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed that he has spoken to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since beating him to the Manchester United interim job. Carrick, Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy were considered to take charge of United for the remainder of the campaign, but Carrick landed the role.",
      "United sources described Carrick as 'impressive' throughout the interview process, and he made a dream start to his interim role by overseeing a stunning victory against Manchester City last weekend.",
      "Solskjaer has been out of work since being sacked by Besiktas in August. The Norwegian was responsible for Besiktas crashing out of Europe and was axed after just seven months in charge.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick got a first taste of coaching as part of Jose Mourinho's backroom staff and he was retained when Solskjaer took over. Carrick has remained in touch with Solskjaer since working with him during that spell.",
      "When asked whether he'd spoken to Solskjaer, Carrick said: \"Yeah, I spoke to him. I'm close, we've been through a lot together, so he's been fully supportive and as you'd expect. He's some man and I respect him an awful lot. He wished us all the best and he was happy that we got the right result.\"",
      "Discussing whether he would pick Solskjaer's brains, he responded: \"I think friendships, you have conversations, I've got a lot of friends in places that I can kind of pick on if I need to be. I'm not one who bothers a lot of people, to be honest. But he's certainly there if ever I need him.\"",
      "Carrick served as United caretaker after Solskjaer was sacked in November 2021. He left the position with an undefeated record, which included a 3-2 victory against Arsenal, but he does not believe that previous encounter against Mikel Arteta is relevant ahead of this weekend's clash against the Gunners.",
      "Carrick after beating Arsenal in November 2021.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "\"I'll be honest with you, I think the confidence I'm taking going into the game is what we've seen since I've been here between me and my staff in terms of the game itself, training, how the boys have gone about it. Games from three or four years ago. It's done. It's in the past,\" he said.",
      "\"So as much as the experience kind of helps you in certain moments, I think it's a totally different game on Sunday and two teams going into it, looking forward to it in good shape.\"",
      "Speaking about United's game plan at the Emirates on Sunday, Carrick said: \"I think it's just playing to what we feel the game needs, really.",
      "\"It's never the same. Even if you come in half time and you've had a good performance for 45 minutes, I'm never one that likes to say same again because it's never, ever the same again. You've got to build on it. So it won't be kind of copy and paste.",
      "\"I think there's new elements that need to come into it. We need to be ready, we need to be at our best. And if we are our best and we're there, we feel we've got a good chance.\"",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Gary Neville admits he is “absolutely startled” after Michael Carrick won his opening two games as interim Manchester United manager.",
      "Carrick has been placed in charge until the end of the season after United sacked Ruben Amorim.",
      "Youth coach and former Red Devils midfielder Darren Fletcher oversaw two matches – a Premier League draw at Burnley and an FA Cup defeat at home to Brighton – between Amorim’s dismissal and Carrick’s appointment.",
      "Carrick has done an outstanding job so far, winning both of his first two fixtures against the Premier League’s top two, Manchester City and Arsenal.",

      "READ: Why big Champions League night containing zero Man United was actually all about Man United",
      "This business enabled Man Utd to invest £230m on signings last summer, and they are well-placed to be in a position to spend even more in this summer’s window as cash will come in via the sales of Rashford and Hojlund, while they could also benefit from Mason Greenwood’s sell-on clause and Champions League qualification.",

      "Earlier this week, The Daily Mail reporter Nathan Salt explained why Maguire is ‘increasingly unlikely’ to remain at Man Utd despite Carrick’s admiration of the England international.",
      "“He’s played well in the past two games – winning the man-of-the-match award at Arsenal – but it feels increasingly unlikely,” Salt said.",
      "“United have had ample opportunity to get Maguire on to fresh terms but there appears to be limited willingness at this stage to do so with his contract now around five months from expiry.",
      "“Carrick is a fan of Maguire but senior United figures are keen to see next season’s minutes go to Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, two young players that United believe will be the bedrock of the backline for years to come.”",
      "The Athletic’s Andy Mitten has since added that ‘Maguire’s future will likely boil down to money and the length of the contract being offered’, while he ‘needs to be playing every week and United’s view is that if he’s doing that, the case for a new contract is a much stronger one’.",
      "But the reality is that Maguire is unlikely to retain his current importance for much longer.",
      "Like Carrick, Maguire has benefited from circumstance, returning to fitness and form at a time when Man Utd are on a rare upswing and while Matthijs de Ligt is unavailable.",
      "Maguire has been really good for Man Utd in their last two games, but he is still unlikely to be ahead of De Ligt in the pecking order once Carrick (or his successor) has a fully fit squad, while Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are also there to replace him.",
      "Had Casemiro signed a cut-price extension to remain at Man Utd, his wage would still have been among the highest in the squad and it would have been difficult to justify when he would have been a bit-part player behind Carlos Baleba and/or Elliot Anderson next season.",
      "And with INEOS setting a precedent regarding how they will handle ageing players and their expiring contracts, it should be expected that Maguire follows Casemiro out of the door for a new adventure with his head held high.",

      "Runners-up Arsenal had five players – Sol Campbell, Ashley Cole, Robert Pires, Patrick Vieira and Henry – make the XI, while a couple of stars for third-placed Newcastle in Kieron Dyer and Alan Shearer were voted in.",

      "It is safe to assume that woke nonsense kept Eric Cantona out of the 1995/96 Team of the Year. Or perhaps a strikeforce of Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer, whose respective 25 and 31-goal seasons almost demanded room be made for them.",
      "Beyond the Frenchman it is difficult to see who else might have made it in for the champions. No-one but Cantona scored more than 11 goals, while he also boasted the most assists with ten. Peter Schmeichel definitely had a shout but was pipped by two things: David James of Liverpool; and the normalisation of his own brilliance.",
      "In the end it was only Gary Neville who made the grade at the end of his first full Premier League season, no thanks to Marco Boogers.",

      "It is likely that Liverpool suffered for the European exploits of Nottingham Forest, with Ray Clemence especially unfortunate to miss out to Peter Shilton in the 1978/79 PFA Team of the Year.",
      "Clemence kept 28 clean sheets and conceded an absurd 16 goals in 42 First Division games. Shilton lifted the literal European Cup. Clemence was never out-jumped by Diego Maradona. Swings and roundabouts.",
      "Phil Neal, Graeme Souness and Terry McDermott could make particularly strong cases against their omissions but in the end it was FWA Footballer of the Year Kenny Dalglish who flew the flag alone for Liverpool.",

      "A dramatic Champions League night that had six of English football’s biggest clubs in action has raised one vital question: what does all this mean for Manchester United?",
      "Elsewhere in United Land, the Mirror produce two equally compelling arguments for why United actually might be about to sign Cole Palmer and why they might not, while there’s bad news for one of the club’s former ‘stars’.",
      "",
      "Fascinating to note that, after a night when six of England’s biggest clubs were all in simultaneous action with meaningful consequences that there is a distinct reduction in the amount of pure bullsh*t washing up on the shores of tabloid bay.",
      "These are, of course, therefore the worst of all mornings for Mediawatch because pure bullsh*t is very much our bread and butter. Not literally.",
      "So it will be Mediawatch at its most fussy and pedantic today, we fear, starting as we mean to go on with some nitpicking at The Sun.",
      "Dramatic Champions League finale sees FIVE English sides straight into last 16… and they could face each other next.",
      "Well, no they can’t. By definition none of the eight teams skipping straight into the last 16 can face each other next because they are the seeded teams for said last 16.",

      "Unfortunately the last actual update on that was Liam Rosenior saying ‘LOL no’ (we’re paraphrasing, obviously; just imagine ‘LOL no’ but about 873 per cent more LinkedIn) and that’s no use at all.",

But qualifying for the Champions League would make it much easier to quieten the noise around other clubs trying to get him.",

      "“Players like Palmer sometimes want to move on and experience something else. Maybe he’s bored or unhappy with the system at Chelsea – he hasn’t seemed himself this season.",
      "“I’d however like to see him stay there because they’ve put a lot of faith in him when other clubs didn’t. There comes a point where he should ask himself: ‘Chelsea have helped me a lot, can I help them before I potentially leave and go somewhere else?'”",

      "“If you’re talking about signing a top midfield player to sit in Manchester United’s midfield, the range of cost is clearly £80-100m, which has with it £20m of amortisation cost per annum,” Borson told Football Insider.",
      "“It’s one step forward cutting yourself off from a very high cost of an older player, but Casemiro has to be replaced and there’s lots of risk with all of these acquisitions.",
      "“Manchester United in particular have recruited in midfield many players where it hasn’t worked, and then you’re stuck with a very high cost that’s very hard to move. I mean, Ugarte is a perfect example. Again, you just have to see how it pans out.”",

      "Fortunately for them, to be liable for the £35million fee, Elliott would have to play 10 Premier League games. Unfortunately for Elliott, that leaves him out in the cold. Even worse, the single minute he played for Liverpool off the bench at Newcastle in August means he cannot play for another European club this season.",
      "MLS has been mentioned as a potential option, but Elliott might prefer to return to Liverpool and get his head down there. Of course, Liverpool had planned without Elliott and budgeted for the money they expected to bank from Villa. So the Reds are little more motivated than Villa to find a player-centred solution.",

      "It seems Pep realised City’s mistake early on, but it was a season and a half before Phillips escaped on loan to West Ham. Where he fared no better than he did at City. Worse, arguably.",
      "There were some flickers of life in a season-long loan at Ipswich last term but not enough to tempt anyone to take a punt last summer. Guardiola gave Phillips a seven-minute cameo at Huddersfield Town in the Carabao Cup – his first appearance in a City shirt for 645 days – perhaps just to remind everyone of his existence, but it doesn’t seem to have done the trick.",
      "Wolves have been credited with an interest and at this point, if Phillips is intent on salvaging his career, the 30-year-old just needs to get away and play somewhere, almost anywhere.",

      "With all six English teams in this season’s Champions League reaching the knockout stages – and five of the six finishing in the top eight to proceed directly to the last 16 – it now looks certain England will once again receive a bonus spot in next year’s competition.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay some price down the line when teams inevitably start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer over their major rivals, all of whom have now started losing teams from their own equations while England power on with a full quota.",
      "With English teams securing five of the eight automatic spots in the last 16 of the Champions League via first, third, fourth, sixth and eighth-place finishes, England have pocketed a huge haul of final-position bonus points to further extend their lead here. Even play-off-bound Newcastle have added plenty more points to the kitty for finishing 12th.",
      "Aston Villa will add another big chunk when the Europa League stage concludes on Thursday, with Nottingham Forest heading to the play-offs there. Crystal Palace are in the Conference League play-offs. With all nine teams still standing, England are going to be scooping up plenty more points for a good while yet. It would already be a huge shock if one of those extra Champions League places doesn’t once again come the Premier League’s way.",

      "Every time we update the mood rankings we are reminded of a near universal truth: the default state of the football fan is misery, with the occasional split-second of happiness that makes it all worthwhile.",
      "Not every fan, not every club, and not all the time. But at any given time, most fans of most clubs? Not that happy with it all tbh.",
      "The Daily Telegraph recently concluded that only four Premier League fanbases are currently happy, and it’s hard to argue. Sunderland, Leeds, Villa and Brentford are the four, and even in those places it’s only a broad consensus rather than unanimous and undiluted joy; if you don’t believe us, approach a Villa fan and say the words ‘Sky Six’ or ‘Red Cartel’.",
      "Point of order: the current giddiness at Manchester United is an erratic and volatile mood swing and not (yet) actual happiness.",
      "Anyway. Here are the latest dooms and glooms and occasional tiny rays of sunlight. December’s positions in brackets, with the full reasonings here.",
      "",
      "In a way, you have to admire it. Having turned their 2024/25 season into an absurd and inexplicably successful high-wire act in which absolutely everything relied on winning the Europa League, they’ve doubled down in 25/26 and tried the same thing but this time with the Champions League, and while playing some of the most eye-bleedingly unwatchable football ever inflicted on supporters.",
      "There’s even the added jeopardy this season that tumbling grimly towards the relegation zone might end up with them tumbling directly into it. Spurs are free-climbing and thus free-falling this year without last season’s safety net of having three of the very worst Premier League teams ever always there below them ready to cushion the fall.",
      "Thomas Frank has become a walking embodiment of beleaguered as the sheer extent to which he is horrifyingly out of his depth gets more and more exposed with each passing game (in which he refuses to attempt any kind of passing game). He continues to imagine positives can be taken from defeats against West Ham or Bournemouth or draws against Burnley as if he were still at Brentford. He really seems unable or unwilling to accept the rules of engagement have changed.",
      "He’s also developed the infuriating accountability-dodging habit of pointing out that Spurs finished 17th last season as if this were the benchmark rather than the specific aberration he was brought in to ensure never, ever happened again, a disastrous domestic campaign so unthinkably and unrepeatably bad that it quite understandably got the previous manager the sack despite ending this club’s desperate yearning for silverware after 17 long and banter-addled years.",
      "There has also been a decisive shift from fans over the last couple of games. Spurs games have, obviously, been riddled with boos and jeers all season. It has been, not unreasonably, pointed out that aiming this stuff at the players is unhelpful. Tensions between some players and match-going fans have been palpable.",
      "That’s slightly shifted in recent weeks, and not in a good way for the manager. The fans are making it far clearer where precisely their anger is aimed. It is now being laser-targeted at a manager who surely cannot possibly survive a February that contains league matches against both Manchester clubs, Newcastle and Arsenal; a month that seems certain to leave them even closer to the bottom three and calamity than they already are.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace have become quite the philosophical poser, which we’re sure will be of huge comfort to their fans as they watch everything that had been built over the last 18 months come crashing down around their feet.",
      "But the inevitable question posed by Palace’s story in recent years is still a good one, and not as easily answered as might initially seem the case.",
      "And the question is this. Should Palace’s astonishing rise and fall over the last two years ends, as now seems alarmingly possible, with relegation is that better or worse than the previous decade spent trudging along finishing 12th every year (or near enough) and getting 47 points (or near enough)?",
      "Instinctively, you feel the drama of the last two years must be better. Look at those shots of fans at Wembley on FA Cup final day. That was the best day in Palace’s history, a day many couldn’t know they would ever live to see. Any price would be worth paying.",
      "But the price has proved spectacularly high. We all know by now that the smaller teams aren’t allowed nice things – certainly not for long anyway.",
      "Yet the sheer speed and scale of what has been taken away from Palace is still enough to make anyone’s head spin. It’s only eight months since Wembley, and Palace have lost or imminently will lose their best player, their best goalscorer, their captain, their manager, their Europa League place, their hopes, their dreams, their future.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta might even leave for Nottingham Forest, of all clubs. Adam Wharton will be the next to look at possible exit ramps.",
      "It’s a bit f*cking much, isn’t it? Especially when all you get in return is a used Brennan Johnson and a go at the Conference League.",
      "We are very much now at the time of the season where it’s the teams falling like a stone into relegation trouble that you fear for most, much more than those who’ve been moulded by the darkness all season.",
      "Especially when those teams – your Nottingham Forests, your Leeds Uniteds, and now even the West Hams of this world – are starting to show signs of life.",
      "There are few such signs at Palace, who are now without a win of any kind in any competition against anyone since beating Shelbourne in the Conference League back in December 11.",
      "The 11 games since then have included drawing at home to Finland’s KuPS, who needed that point to scrape into the top 24 of UEFA’s third-tier competition, becoming the first top-flight team ever knocked out of the FA Cup by one from the sixth tier and, most embarrassing and damaging of all, losing to Dr Tottenham in what now turns out to have been a really quite important relegation six-pointer.",
      "For it is Spurs, whose infamous generosity has been accepted by so many others in recent weeks, who join Palace as being the team spinning desperately out of control towards disaster. But even at their current levels of ridiculousness, there still feels like more Spurs can do to pull out of the tailspin. They just, for reasons we haven’t yet quite fathomed, don’t really want to do any of them.",
      "Palace’s growing crisis feels even more existential. This is a club now gripped by paralysis, where even if it acts, then what? Spurs are being severely punished for failure; if they sort themselves out they can still be fine. Palace are being severely punished for success. That’s a far harder puzzle to solve.",
      "It really wasn’t that long ago that we still thought even the loss of Oliver Glasner, which was always inevitable somewhere pretty soon down the line, need not be a catastrophe if handled right. It no longer feels like that’s the case.",
      "Even if Palace get the next appointment spot on, that manager can’t build on what Glasner achieved because everything Glasner has achieved is already being ripped down before he even officially departs.",
      "And that departure also now seems certain to come before its appointed time in the summer, with Glasner now cutting an increasingly frustrated and dejected figure.",
      "Dragging things out surely can’t be doing either him or Palace any good, but right now it just seems hard to imagine what will.",
      "",
      "Funny old effort from Burnley this season, really. They’ve not disgraced themselves but the sheer lack of attention they’re getting for having no league wins since October shows a) how low the bar now is for promoted teams and also b) just how bad, for how long Wolves were.",
      "The thing with Burnley is that they are far more competitive in individual games than they are across the season as a whole. There appears almost no chance they stay up, but they also just never get humiliated. They’ve only lost by more than two goals twice all season and not at all since September.",
      "And while they don’t ever win matches they have in recent weeks taken to drawing quite a lot of them, and against high-profile teams. Their last three games have all been against Big Six opposition, and they haven’t lost a single one.",
      "Now sure, the quality of those Big Six sides ranges from mediocre to actual fellow relegation candidates, but the point stands. Things have never felt so bleak and forlorn that it’s looked like Scott Parker was about to get the chop. There appears an acceptance that he’s doing as well as anyone could and is still the very ideal sort of chap to try and get them back up again next year.",
      "And it’s hard to argue with any of that. Even when they were losing seven games in a row in the run-up to Christmas, it was never nightmarish. Four of those defeats were by a single goal, and of the three two-goal defeats one was against Arsenal, which is fair enough, another against a Chelsea side who only made the points safe in the 88th minute and the third a daft 3-1 at Brentford in a game that had been goalless at 80 minutes.",
      "If they’re going to do anything beyond continuing on the current vaguely dignified yet nevertheless fate-accepting path to relegation, then it does feel like the time is now. Their next three games are against Sunderland, West Ham and Crystal Palace and you’d think they really are going to have to give some thought to actually winning at least one or two of those.",
      "",
      "It will never be great when your situation ‘improves’ to eight points from 23 games. But improve it has, and at the very least that little spurt of six points from four games including an actual, real-life Premier League win means Derby’s all-time 11-point nadir should be negotiated with time to spare.",
      "Rob Edwards has come in and done a decent job in absurdly grim circumstances but the anger and despair at the way an established Premier League club has been brought so very low by boardroom mismanagement on an epic scale remains real and righteous.",
      "It’s a grim mess with the grimmer reality that the real work comes in the summer and next season. The recent efforts on the field offer some hope, but the struggles of last season’s relegated clubs to get straight back up and the fact Wolves’ last relegation from the Premier League saw them tumble straight down to League One before fighting their way back are a reminder that this can all absolutely get worse before it gets better. If, indeed, get better it does.",
      "",
      "Few clearer examples of just how much misery there is around the Premier League at this time than the fact West Ham somehow managed to remain outside our bottom three last time out and do so again now.",
      "Slightly misleading, of course, because for quite a long spell between the two updates they would definitely have been lower than they land in either; a ranking list directly after the 3-0 defeat at Wolves might somehow have seen them defy mathematics altogether and slip below 20th.",
      "But two wins in a row have, as two wins in a row are wont to do, improved things ever so slightly. West Ham will never not enjoy a late win over Tottenham, and it does feel like one of the most significant results anywhere in the league this season.",
      "It offered renewed hope to a club where it appeared to have faded and died, and parlaying that into an even more impressive win against Sunderland the following weekend has at least kept the Hammers in the mix – as well as dragging other clubs back into their grief hole. Tottenham obviously, but also Palace, are more miserable than they were (which was already quite miserable) as a direct consequence of West Ham being ever so slightly less so.",
      "Which again seems to emphasise the point that miserable is the default position of the football fan; one set of fans being a bit less miserable than before has, if anything, increased the league’s overall misery quota.",
      "Or it might all just be because it’s January, and f*ck January to be honest.",
      "",
      "Caveats and mitigation exist, but it’s just a remarkably poor season, really. From title winners in May to transfer-window winners in August to scrapping desperately and by no means yet certainly for a Champions League spot in January.",
      "With history’s most fraudulent unbeaten run over after a late defeat at Bournemouth, Liverpool find themselves once more outside the top five and with absolutely no real cause for complaint.",
      "They are simply nowhere near the levels of last season despite spending vast sums in the summer. Arne Slot already looks like he’s on the way out, and this time the timing for Xabi Alonso to come in looks absolutely perfect.",
      "But that means another fresh start for Liverpool and, while his club-legend status and obvious quality means it will be one that starts with bountiful optimism it’s still a wild state of affairs on the back of a title win and summer spend that was supposed to herald the coming of a new era of dominance.",
      "",
      "Earlier in the season it was Aston Villa annoying us because we couldn’t work out if they were good or sh*t and now it is Newcastle.",
      "Villa, to their enormous credit, have had the decency to provide a definitive answer and that’s all we ask.",
      "Every time we think we’re just about ready to declare for Newcastle one way or the other, they throw us for a loop again.",
      "Going into the November international break on the back of defeats at West Ham and Brentford had us ready to declare crisis. Then they beat Man City and spangled Everton and we thought ‘okay, maybe they’re not bad actually’.",
      "Then they didn’t even managed to beat Spurs and lost at Sunderland and a pre-Carrick Man United when that was still a mortifying thing to happen to anyone. Fine, they are bad, we thought. Good to know.",
      "Then they won their next three games in a row, and winning three games in a row in this league is enough to drag almost anyone into a halfway acceptable league position. ‘Okay,’ we thought, ‘maybe they’re good after all’.",
      "Then they drew at Wolves and lost meekly to Villa who, as we’ve said, have stopped p*ssing us all about in this manner.",
      "They’re now ninth in the league, but that means nothing because in a couple of weeks they could be sixth or 14th given how volatile the mid-table gang are.",
      "We should in theory have some kind of better idea after the next month or so, in which Newcastle face Liverpool and Brentford and Tottenham and Man City. But you know what? Bet we don’t.",
      "So whatever their own fans think of it all, one thing we can say for certain is that Newcastle are p*ssing us off this season. And that’s what really matters.",
      "",
      "Seven points from their last three games have significantly improved their survival chances even if there was some FA Cup unpleasantness along the way.",
      "A curious season for Forest still has a wide array of possible outcomes, from ‘complete disaster’ to ‘European glory’ via – and this one is much the most likely – ‘wasted opportunity’. They might go down but probably won’t. They might win the Europa League but probably won’t.",
      "They probably will end up in the bottom six and thinking they’ve fumbled the chance to do something rather more lasting and substantial with last season’s apparent breakthrough.",
      "We will all have a clearer idea in a few weeks’ time after they’ve played relegation rivals Palace, Leeds and Wolves as well as the Europa League play-offs.",
      "",
      "Pop quiz, no cheating. How many of Brighton’s last 10 Premier League games have they won? Wrong. Wrong again. It’s one. One game. Against Burnley. At home.",
      "We genuinely have no idea how that’s true given whenever we’ve watched them they seem to be broadly and predictably competent. But true it is. At the start of that run they were fifth, which is fine because literally everyone apart from Wolves has had a go at being fifth this season.",
      "But back then they were only two points behind Villa and now they are 12th and – this is the crucial bit – they’ve achieved this without anyone really noticing. And, perhaps even more impressively, without any particularly tangible change in their football.",
      "The fact that right in the middle of this run they also went and beat Man United really quite impressively in the FA Cup is also good.",
      "",
      "They’re at it again, aren’t they? Absolute scamps. After a couple of months of Champions League form, Andoni Iraola’s incorrigibly streaky gang of imps then did a couple of months of relegation form.",
      "They just can’t help themselves. This is what they’ve been like ever since Andoni Iraola rocked up and pinched Gary O’Neil’s birthright and there is no sign of it stopping. They’ve now taken seven points from their last three games against Spurs, Brighton and Liverpool, and will no doubt win five of their next six games before failing to win any of the next eight after that.",
      "It’s a great bit, honestly, but while the absolute commitment to it is exemplary and admirable, we do wonder if it’s just becoming a bit cliché. Just talking about Bournemouth being streaky has certainly become passe, but unavoidably so. Bournemouth being Bournemouthy has become as much a feature of Premier League life as Spurs being Spursy. No point fighting it, we suppose.",
      "We remain intrigued to see how much of this is a Bournemouth thing and how much an Iraola thing, and await their and his next move with interest given the wide array of big Barclays jobs likely to be up for grabs this summer.",
      "",
      "Mid-table here, mid-table there, mid-table everywhere. Have the chance to do the funniest thing possible at Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "",
      "There’s an extremely strong chance it works out wonderfully well in the end and a very strong chance it does even more than that. There’s a small but very real chance this ends up being Arsenal’s greatest ever season, with domestic and European glory and Spurs crying all the way to the Championship. The quadruple is on; quintuple if you include that Spurs relegation bit.",
      "So why don’t Arsenal fans seem to be having any fun? We’re not going to go as far as miserable here, but they are definitely sh*tting pre-emptive bricks about what happens if things don’t all work out in the end.",
      "We know and they know – and they know we know – that if they don’t win the league this year they are going to get absolutely slaughtered. There will be almost no feasible defence this time to the cruel bottle-job taunts that will rain down upon them from all directions. The fear is palpable, entirely understandable, but also in danger of becoming rather self-fulfilling. The nervousness at the Emirates for the visit of Manchester United on Sunday was positively bleeding out of the screen even for those of us watching on TV. No wonder it was felt by the players actually there trying not to think of the B word.",
      "Given the position in which Arsenal and everyone else now find themselves, there really are only two possible ways for this season to end. Either Arsenal fans will be absolutely unbearable towards everyone else, or everyone else will be absolutely unbearable towards Arsenal fans. And in both scenarios righteously so, and for a really quite extended period of time.",
      "Arsenal fans still hope and expect the former, but the fear of the latter is real and growing.",
      "",
      "Funny thing about Man City this season: they an also win the quadruple. Doesn’t feel like it, though, does it? And not just because nobody ever wins the quadruple – not the proper one anyway.",
      "Yet City are currently (if narrowly) the bookies’ favourites ahead of Arsenal in both the Carabao and FA Cup. They are second in the league scenting blood in the water, and the Champions League’s absolute refusal to be interesting means that even another stuttering campaign there cannot eliminate them before the knockouts.",
      "So… it’s all going pretty well. But we repeat: it simply doesn’t feel like it. There is a growing understanding that while the precise timing of Pep Guardiola’s departure remains unconfirmed the day is certainly approaching, and that brings inevitable uncertainty.",
      "Especially as this is simply not the most convincing Man City side, especially with Erling Haaland in one of those weird mid-season funks he gets when he just stops scoring until someone performs the necessary system updates.",
      "It’s now just one goal (a penalty as well, if you’re the sort of person that bothers) in nine for the big man, including a 45-minute blank in a 10-1 FA Cup win over Exeter.",
      "They may still be in touch with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League, but it’s not been via their trademark unstoppable run because that petered out over a month ago now.",
      "Since winning eight straight games in November and December it’s been three wins (one of them the aforementioned sorting out of Exeter) in their last eight games heading into a Champions League game against Galatasaray they must win to avoid the play-offs and then a trip to catastrophe-addicted Tottenham that even at the best of times would carry far less certainty for City than it would any broadly equivalent side.",
      "",
      "Home form has started to go the way one always fears home form might at a new stadium, with no win at the Hill Dickinson since giving Nottingham Forest what for back in early December.",
      "But the away form has stepped up with a couple of fine away wins in the midlands on their two most recent away days keeping them safely in the mid-table pack and well clear of any of the unpleasantness other teams are allowing themselves to be sucked into down below them.",
      "It’s not quite been as fun a season as we’d hoped it might be for Everton, but it’s fine. They aren’t going to have to chew their fingernails down to the quick, and that’s something not to be sniffed at. We’re very much at the time of the season where for a great many clubs having nothing real to play for is actually a lot less stressful than having everything to play for.",
      "",
      "No longer a football club, not really, and it’s a damning indictment on everyone else that they’re still able to do quite well at actual football despite this. Imagine what they might do if they were confident enough in their approach to, say, hire or retain a manager who might answer back occasionally. Or sign a player over 23 years old because he improves the playing squad rather than the balance sheet.",
      "Given how far down the list of priorities the creation of a functional, rounded football squad is at Chelsea and how no manager ever lasts more than 18 months, it’s pretty extraordinary that they’re able to compete at all.",
      "And then you remember just how much money they’ve spent on their player-trading business and then slap yourself around the face and head for saying their ability to compete on the pitch is extraordinary.",
      "But it kind of is, though. Absurd club and still, in so many ways, far more of an all-that’s-wrong-with-the-modern-game outfit than Man City. Say what you like about City and their methods – or even Chelsea in the Abramovich days – but at least they’ve always also tried to build the best possible football team under the best possible manager.",
      "It feels like a ridiculously low bar because it is. Yet it is one BlueCo Chelsea have never cleared, will never clear, and show no real interest in clearing.",
      "",
      "In truly unprecedented scenes, a shambolic and spluttering Manchester United have sacked a fool of a coach who knew neither the club nor Our League, appointed a beloved former player as interim manager, won a couple of games rather impressively, and are thus possessed with the absolute certainty they are once again about to dominate English football for a good couple of decades.",
      "Okay, much of the exaggeration here is ours, and there is simply no denying that both the performances and victories United have achieved under Michael Carrick’s watchful if still for now temporary eye have been enormously impressive.",
      "There need be no caveats applied to anyone who turns up at any misfiring football club and immediately masterminds wins over Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "That some relatively simple and really quite obvious quick fixes (pick Harry Maguire, pick Kobbie Mainoo, choose a formation that suits the players you have available) have been so transformative says a lot more about the previous manager than the current one, but it’s still undeniably and uncomplicatedly impressive.",
      "We can all also, of course, enjoy the sight of some (and it was only some) Arsenal fans lashing out on social media about Man United responding to their win at the Emirates like they’d won the Champions League.",
      "We’re sorry, Arsenal fans, that sounds like celebration policing. You hate that.",
      "So while we’re not about to deny any Man United fan their elation at what’s gone off in the last couple of weeks, we still worry for them. It just feels like they’ve set off down another familiar path that leads them right back where they started.",
      "Carrick is going to be given the permanent job after a few more wins – having sorted out the best two teams in the country the upcoming and infamously light fixture list is inevitably more straightforward – and we all know what will happen after that.",

      "Which was a double blow for Brentford specifically, of course. Immediately after we dropped them down the mood rankings a place or six they went off and won five of their next six games in all competitions and briefly even popped up in the top five, as pretty much everyone other than Wolves appears to have done at some point this season.",
      "The only team they didn’t beat in that run? Thomas Bloody Frank’s Silly Spurs again, which is a mild pisser but no more than that, all told. Brentford under Keith Andrews remain, even after a couple of defeats to drop them back into the mid-table gang, conspicuously better than Tottenham under Thomas Frank, and if you can’t enjoy that then you don’t have blood in your veins.",

      "Some low-level huffing and puffing after a 1-1 draw away at Everton serve as yet another reminder that almost no glass is ever quite as half-full as it might be, but we’re still putting Leeds firmly among the small group of clubs whose current general mood can be summed up as ‘Broadly Very Happy, Thank You Very Much’.",
      "Fifteen points from their last 10 Premier League games have lifted them clear of the relegation zone and now within touching distance of those tumbling out the back of the mid-table clog. No reason at all to think Leeds won’t be fully paid-up members of that mid-table clog within the next week or three.",
      "We do understand the slight frustration, as well. For all that the 15-point return from those 10 games (after managing only 11 from the first 13) has changed the whole dynamic of Leeds’ season it does also feel like the very, very least their vastly improved performances across those games have deserved.",
      "But even that is, in its own frustrating way, a positive. Leeds are playing very decent and effective football that has got them out of immediate relegation peril, and all without any sense yet that they’ve peaked or are merely on some unsustainable run of good fortune or freakish results.",
      "They have achieved, over what is now a pretty lengthy period of time, very decent, solid mid-table Premier League results because they have played like a very decent, solid mid-table Premier League team.",
      "",
      "In many ways, Villa are the clearest example of all that the default setting of the football fan is pessimism and misery. They are second in the table, level on points with Manchester City and only four points behind an Arsenal side that has spent the entire season looking like it’s about to decisively run away with the league and then not quite doing that.",
      "With Europa League glory still looking an entirely plausible outcome as well, it is by any sane measure an astonishing effort from Unai Emery and the lads. And we’re not saying Villa fans aren’t happy. They are happy. Obviously, they’re happy.",
      "But… gah, we might be wrong here but we just don’t think they’re as happy as they should be. We don’t think they’re enjoying it all as much as they should do. We’re just hearing far too much bleating about Sky Sixes and Red Cartels and not being allowed to just spend even more money they don’t actually have chasing their dreams.",
      "It’s not unfair that clubs with more money are allowed to spend (and in most cases it’s actually ‘waste’ anyway, so don’t worry) more money than clubs who have less money. If anything, that’s fairer than the alternative.",
      "Anyway, hopefully winning the league will cheer them up a bit.",
      "",
      "Things have dropped off a bit since the highs of the derby win over Newcastle that arrived just before the last mood update and inevitably had Sunderland riding at their absolute highest.",
      "But even that dropping-off can be framed however you want to do it; one win in seven games since Newcastle is also only two defeats in seven games since Newcastle.",
      "They’re still comfily flitting about in mid-table without a relegation care in the world, they’re still the best promoted side we’ve seen in quite some time and they are, since Sunday, the proud and last remaining owners of an unbeaten home record in this season’s Premier League.",
      "We’re going to say with some confidence that even the most bullish Sunderland fan wasn’t predicting that back in August.",
      "We reckon there are maybe four Premier League fanbases genuinely happy with life at this time, and we’re really starting to think that Sunderland, as the team with least to stress about over the months ahead, might for now be the most content of the lot.",
      "For most of the fans who are currently happy there remains the fear that this season could still go horribly wrong. That doesn’t really apply to Sunderland, even if they do eventually lose a home game.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes should know better than anyone that the idea Arsenal ‘could be the worst team to win the Premier League’ is nonsense.",
      "Four players in, five players out for Xabi Alonso *when* he replaces Arne Slot at Anfield ranked from never gonna happen to a certainty.",

      "Former Man Utd midfielder Nicky Butt has revealed that he “feels sorry” for Matheus Cunha after he came off the bench to score the winner against Arsenal in a 3-2 victory.",
      "The Red Devils came from a goal down to lead 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday before Mikel Merino levelled the scores up with only six minutes left on the clock.",
      "However, just three minutes later, Man Utd substitute Cunha picked up the ball and dribbled to the edge of the box before unleashing an unstoppable winner past David Raya.",
      "Cunha, who joined Man Utd from Wolves in a £62.5m deal in the summer, has contributed five goals and two assists in 20 Premier League appearances this season.",
      "The Brazilian also started as a substitute against Man City the week before and both Butt and Paul Scholes insist that Cunha will not be happy about his role, although Patrick Dorgu’s injury is likely to mean he starts their next match against Fulham.",
      "Speaking about Dorgu’s impact under interim boss Michael Carrick, Scholes said on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast: “He was brought in as a wing-back because that was Amorim’s system, but going back to when we were playing, wide players actually would help your full-back, and United have started doing that.",
      "READ: Odegaard binned by Arsenal as Man Utd duo leave in summer exodus of 10 POTY winners",
      "“Against Saka, who is their best attacker by a million miles, it was like playing against two left-backs at times because he was working back, but he’s scoring goals as well.",
      "“I don’t see him there as a left winger full-time, Michael’s obviously seen something in him that he likes because he’s left Cunha out for him, and what a player he is.”",
      "Butt interrupted: “Cunha’s giving you an option off the bench and I do feel a bit sorry.”",
      "Before Scholes added: “He won’t be happy with that, no chance, he won’t be happy with that sentence.”",
      "And  Butt continued: “If you look when Darren [Fletcher] was in charge and he’s looking at his bench, he’s got no one to come on. You’ve got the young lads which is okay, they’re good players but when it’s going bad you need proper pros in that team who can come on the pitch, stick their chest out and go against people.",
      "“He might find himself in a bad position now, Cunha, thinking, ‘I’m a really good sub to bring on, I carry the ball up the pitch, I get the fouls, kill the clock when we’re winning and I can score goals’, he could end up being a super sub.",
      "“Also with the Cunha situation, I think Mbeumo has been brilliant as a nine. I think he’s done that job really, really well. He’s a handful, he’s powerful, he’s quick, you’re thinking Cunha might see himself on the bench for a good few weeks now.”",
      "Self-proclaimed “above average” Premier League footballer Jamie O’Hara would be a shoo-in for Prick of the Week if we still gave out that award…",
      "Man Utd were once successful because of the likes of Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. If they are to be again, it will be in spite of them…",
      "Every single Manchester United in the Mailbox has picked Lisandro Martinez in his spat with the Class of 92.",
      "We begin with Eberechi Eze’s rarely-seen wife but move on to Lisandro Martinez being given some advice by an old man.",
      "Lisandro Martinez responded to Butt and Scholes’ entirely baseless criticism and *he’s* the one who needs to “f***ing grow up”? Lads, he’s made you look like a couple of…",
      "Nicky Butt has told Lisandro Martinez to “f***ing grow up” after the Manchester United defender hit back at the pundit for mocking him on his podcast."

      "Arne Slot has talked about Liverpool's issues against low blocks and they are not the only Premier League side struggling to break down deep-lying opponents; Between the Lines digs into the data to reveal the teams with the best and worst numbers",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Wednesday 28 January 2026 15:50, UK",
      "Low blocks are a hot topic in the Premier League.",
      "The term refers to a defending team sitting deep in a compact shape to protect their goal and restrict space in central areas, making it difficult for their opponent to create chances.",
      "Which teams come up against low blocks most frequently? And which teams are most and least effective when it comes to playing against them? Between the Lines digs into the numbers.",
      "Arne Slot was told to stop talking about low blocks by Steven Gerrard after Liverpool's Champions League win over Marseille.",
      "The data supports Slot's comments on low blocks.",
      "This season, Liverpool have a higher percentage of build-up phases of play against compact defences than any team in the Premier League, at 26 per cent.",
      "Arsenal are second, at 24 per cent, with Nottingham Forest and Newcastle third and fourth, on 23 and 22 per cent respectively.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Leeds have the lowest percentage of build-up phases against low blocks this season, at 14 per cent, just below Crystal Palace and Burnley at 15 per cent.",
      "Slot has bemoaned facing more low blocks than last season this term as Liverpool's opponents set up to frustrate them.",
      "Again, the data backs him up.",
      "Only Everton have experienced a bigger increase to the percentage of build-up phases against deep opposition this season.",
      "While Liverpool and Everton are facing low blocks more frequently, Manchester City are facing them less frequently.",
      "In fact, Pep Guardiola's side have the biggest negative differential among ever-present Premier League clubs this term, their percentage dropping from the highest in the Premier League last season at 27 per cent, to 21 per cent this term, putting them fifth.",
      "The dip reflects changes to the way they are attacking, as well as how teams are defending against them, with Guardiola having put more emphasis on directness this season.",
      "Aston Villa rank as by far the most effective team against low blocks.",
      "Helped by a succession of strikes from outside the box this season, Unai Emery's side have racked up 19 goals from phases of play against deep defences since the start of last term.",
      "It is three more than any other side has managed in the same timeframe, with Manchester City next on 16. Newcastle have also enjoyed some success, scoring 15 goals against low blocks.",
      "Excluding relegated and promoted sides, Brentford have scored the fewest goals against low blocks, with three.",
      "Aston Villa and Brentford also come out top and bottom respectively when factoring the number of times Premier League teams have come up against opponents in a low block.",
      "For context, Aston Villa's 19 goals since the start of last season have come from 1,717 build-up phases against compact defences, giving them an average considerably higher than any other Premier League side at 1.11 goals per 100 phases.",
      "Manchester City's 16 goals, meanwhile, have come from a far higher number of build-up phases against low blocks, at 2,676, giving them a much lower average of 0.60 per 100 phases.",
      "While Newcastle and Manchester United rank closest to Newcastle for goals per 100 build-up phases against deep defences, Liverpool and Arsenal sit closer to Brentford.",
      "Arsenal's issues become even clearer when looking at shot numbers.",
      "While Liverpool do at least get a decent amount of shots off against low blocks, their average of 9.9 per 100 phases of play putting them fourth among ever-present Premier League sides in the last two seasons, Mikel Arteta's side average the second-fewest, at just 7.8 shots per 100 phases of play.",
      "The data also suggests Chelsea struggle against low blocks, averaging only fractionally more shots than Arsenal at 8.1.",
      "Arsenal's lack of threat against low blocks was most recently apparent during Sunday's 3-2 loss to Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium, when the Gunners struggled to open up their opponent's defensive structure in open play.",
      "In contrast to Arsenal, Manchester United have averaged considerably more shots against low blocks than any other Premier League side since the start of last season, at 12.9 per 100 phases of play, showing they fare better at breaking them down.",
      "Why are so many Premier League strikers struggling this season? Last week's edition looked at the declining number of goals being scored by forwards and the reasons behind the trend.",

      "Cole Palmer is contracted at Chelsea until 2033; recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United; Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet has expressed a preference for joining Chelsea",
      "Wednesday 28 January 2026 07:38, UK",
      "Chelsea consider Cole Palmer \"untouchable\" amid links with Manchester United.",
      "Palmer is contracted until 2033 and is seen as a key player in the club's future.",
      "Recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United in order to return to the north west, but Chelsea believe the player is happy at Stamford Bridge - as does head coach Liam Rosenior.",
      "Asked if Palmer is 'untouchable' and happy at the club, Rosenior replied: \"Yes and yes. It's simple.",
      "\"Cole's an incredible player like [Moises Caicedo] sitting next to me and many players in the group.",
      "\"I'm not surprised at the timing [of the rumours]. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there's people are [looking to] unsettle. It's not true. Cole's here, he's very happy and I can't wait to see him on the pitch.",
      "\"There's no reason for an assurance [from Chelsea's directors]. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere, there's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation, that's where I'm at.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. We've had numerous conversations with him on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him - because he loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player.",
      "\"You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth, there's not point having any discussion about it.\"",
      "Palmer's season has been hampered by injuries to his groin, toe and, most recently, thigh which caused him to miss Sunday's victory at Crystal Palace, but he returned to training on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League fixture at Napoli.",
      "The 23-year-old has not provided an assist in the Premier League this season, scoring four goals in 12 league appearances, having netted 15 in 46 last term and providing 11 assists.",
      "Palmer joined Chelsea from Manchester City in a £40m deal in 2023, and has scored 41 goals and made 20 assists across his 81 league appearances for the Blues.",
      "Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet has expressed a preference for joining Chelsea despite interest from multiple teams.",
      "Talks are ongoing between Rennes and Chelsea about a deal for the 20-year-old French centre back.",
      "Ideally, Rennes want to keep him until the summer and it is proving to be a difficult deal to complete, especially in January.",
      "Clubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool are reported to be interested in buying the player in the summer.",
      "Rennes want €65m (£56m) but Chelsea have so far been reluctant to match the asking price.",
      "Chelsea have recalled centre back Aaron Anselmino from his loan at Borussia Dortrmund but it is not certain he will stay at Chelsea for the rest of the season.",
      "Chelsea had five centre backs in their squad for their win at Crystal Palace on Sunday and they have AFCON winner Mamadou Sarr on loan at sister club Strasbourg. Two other Chelsea centre backs are out injured at the moment - Levi Colwill and Tosin Adarabioyo.",
      "Other January centre back target options for Chelsea include Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi and Como's Jacobo Ramon.",
      "Senesi, 28, is out of contract this summer but Bournemouth would be extremely reluctant to let him leave this month. He is set to have the option of moving to some of the biggest clubs in Europe in the summer.",
      "Jacquet is highly rated by new Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior and played for Rennes when they beat Rosenior's Strasbourg side 4-1 in Ligue 1 in November.",
      "Axel Disasi is expected to leave Chelsea before the January transfer window closes.",
      "Multiple clubs are interested in England, Germany, France and Italy, with West Ham an option. Fiorentina are considering a move for Disasi, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "Disasi had previously been surplus to requirements under Enzo Maresca, but has been training with the first team since the arrival of Liam Rosenior.",
      "Raheem Sterling and Chelsea are close to finding a solution in the next few days which will end the long-drawn-out stand-off between club and player.",
      "Sterling has not played for Chelsea since May 2024 even though he has remained one of the club's best-paid players, earning a reported £325,000 a week.",
      "He spent last season on loan at Arsenal but he has been training away from the first-team squad since last summer when a move away could not be agreed during the window.",
      "Chelsea are now in talks with Sterling and his representatives and a solution is expected to be found before the window closes on Monday evening.",
      "He has 18 months left on a contract which could cost Chelsea £25 million if he was to stay until it runs out in the summer of 2027.",
      "Sterling does not want another loan deal so either a permanent deal will have to be arranged in the next few days or a compromise agreement reached whereby he would become a free agent.",
      "Either way, it is expected he will no longer be a Chelsea player after Monday - although he would be well within his rights to stay until his contract runs out.",
      "Sterling signed a five-year deal when Chelsea signed him from Manchester City in a £50 million deal in the summer of 2022.",
      "The deal was done just two months after Chelsea had been bought by new American owners and during a window when co-owner Todd Boehly was acting as the club's interim sporting director.",
      "Filip Jorgensen is expected to remain at Chelsea in this window.",
      "Chelsea's second-choice goalkeeper has been the subject of interest this month from clubs in England, Germany and Turkey, who are keen to offer him more regular football, but Chelsea are reluctant to let the Dane leave before next Monday's deadline.",
      "Chelsea signed Jorgensen from Villarreal for £20.7m in July 2024.",
      "Jorgensen played 24 times for Chelsea last season, predominantly in cup competitions, and was key to their Conference League success, but has been limited to just eight appearances this season.",
      "Jorgensen suffered an injury against Pafos last week and was not pictured at Chelsea training on Tuesday morning.",

      "Gary Neville is \"blown away\" by Manchester United's transformation under the management of Michael Carrick.",
      "United backed up a derby win over Manchester City with a 3-2 success at Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday in Carrick's second game in charge.",
      "Those results have transformed the mood following Ruben Amorim's sacking and Neville is confident United - who are up to fourth in the table - will finish in the Champions League qualifying spots.",
      "\"There are a number of things that have changed, the intensity, the compactness, the aggression of the defending, their willingness to get behind the ball together and be difficult to beat and dig in when you're in difficult moments of the game. And there was more of that [at Arsenal] than there was against City.",
      "\"I thought they played better football against City, but they were always going to have to dig in [at the Emirates Stadium] more. In that first 25 minutes when they didn't have a lot of ball, they didn't really lose too many chances.",
      "\"They controlled the game without the ball. And then they just started to play a little bit.",
      "\"But the big thing for me is that they've got a threat up front. They've got a group of players who are talented up front, who are also getting back and helping their defenders, who are digging in.\"",
      "Neville believes United's system shift away from Amorim's back-three preference to a 4-2-3-1 has boosted the team. He says Carrick has restored the \"magic\" to the team - and they are able to realise their potential to achieve a high finish in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's definitely instilled a simplicity to it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, that I like about it,\" said Neville.",
      "\"It's my favourite system. We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. It's been a huge turn.",
      "\"It's still not a point to get carried away but certainly a point to suggest now that Manchester United have got an unbelievable opportunity, from where they were before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point. It's a remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"And Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's being said to them, and we don't know what's being said to them in that training ground, but they are responding like they weren't before.",
      "\"Why? We'll always speculate, Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking, 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused, as we all are in terms of the flip, but the magic has returned in the last week.",
      "\"The magic seems to have returned to the club momentarily, the feeling of how to play with the aggression, with the risk, with the great goals, with the attacking of speed, the counter-attack. It feels right.",
      "\"And I think one thing that this last week has told us, no matter where it leads to, is that is the way Manchester United have to play, because it's just felt right watching them.",
      "\"Now that might not lead to Champions League football this season, it might be that they go and get beat by Fulham next week. Who knows what's going to happen? I don't think they will by the way, I think they'll finish in the Champions League [qualification places] now.",
      "\"But that's why a number of players that commentate on Manchester United have been so angry in this last five or six weeks, because of the likes of Everton, Wolves, West Ham, Bournemouth, Burnley and Leeds, six teams that have been really struggling apart from Leeds maybe, and only five points were picked up in those games again out of the 18.",
      "\"And in a lot of those games where Manchester United had opportunities to go into the top four. We're like, 'go on', and they didn't, and now they've done it because I genuinely believe there is a feeling that they are better than what they've shown.",
      "\"And they've proved it in these last two games, they have really proved that they can get compact, they can stay together, be aggressive in their shape, can spring out of that shape and play good football and counter-attack and hurt teams, and they can score great goals and get bodies in the box.",
      "\"It's been thrilling to watch these last two matches, it really has, and it's a remarkable turnaround.\"",

      "Monday 26 January 2026 22:08, UK",
      "Heading a football \"likely\" contributed to the brain injury which was a factor in the death of former Scotland defender Gordon McQueen, a coroner has found.",
      "McQueen - who was capped for Scotland 30 times between 1974 and 1981, and played for both Manchester United and Leeds during a 16-year career - died at his home in North Yorkshire in June 2023, aged 70.",
      "The cause of death was pneumonia as he had become frail and bed-bound for months, the inquest in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, heard earlier this month.",
      "That frailty was due to a combination of vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), coroner Jon Heath said.",
      "The coroner gave a narrative conclusion on Monday, finding that McQueen died from pneumonia as a consequence of mixed vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "He said: \"It is likely that repetitive head impacts sustained by heading the ball while playing football contributed to the CTE.\"",
      "McQueen's TV presenter daughter Hayley McQueen was in court to hear the findings.",
      "When giving evidence at his inquest earlier this month, she was asked by her barrister Michael Rawlinson KC if her father had discussed whether anything in his past history was behind his dementia.",
      "She said: \"He said 'heading a football for all those years probably hasn't helped'.\"",
      "McQueen said her dad was relatively injury-free during his career but did suffer some concussions, adding: \"They would just head back out and play.\"",
      "She also recalled how, when she was young, he would come home from training with Manchester United and lie down in a darkened room with a headache.",
      "She described how her father was very healthy and active - both in sport and with his family - during his playing days and after he retired.",
      "But she said the family began to notice changes in his personality after his 60th birthday.",
      "McQueen said her father had always been very sociable and outgoing, but became more withdrawn.",
      "She said that although her father was a central defender, he was well known for scoring goals from set-pieces, usually with his head.",
      "He came to prominence in England following his move to Leeds from St Mirren in 1972, helping the Yorkshire club to league title success in 1973-74 and playing a key role in their run to the European Cup final in 1975.",
      "McQueen then joined Leeds's arch-rivals Manchester United in 1978 and went on to win the FA Cup in 1983.",
      "Injury robbed him of a World Cup appearance in 1978 after he had been included in Scotland's squad having made his senior debut in 1974 against Belgium.",
      "After retiring as a player, McQueen had a brief spell as Airdrie manager and coach at former club St Mirren, and spent five years as coach at Middlesbrough under Bryan Robson until 2001.",
      "The inquest heard how McQueen's family donated his brain, after his death, to Professor Willie Stewart - a consultant neuropathologist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, who has conducted extensive research into brain injury in footballers and rugby players.",
      "Prof Stewart told the inquest he found evidence of CTE - a brain disorder linked to repeated head impacts - and vascular dementia.",
      "Prof Stewart agreed with Mr Rawlinson, for the McQueen family, when he asked whether the CTE \"more than minimally, negligibly or trivially\" contributed to the death and that \"heading the ball\" contributed to the CTE.",
      "The professor said the only evidence available was McQueen's \"high exposure\" to heading a football."

      "Michael Carrick has got off to the dream start as head coach of Manchester United until the end of the season; But are wins against Man City and Premier League leaders Arsenal enough to justify a premature permanent appointment?",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 17:29, UK",
      "Manchester United fans should not get carried away with Michael Carrick. But why not?",
      "So far, Carrick has shown you do not need to \"suffer\" to win football matches; instead, he's proved football is a simple game.",
      "But the dilemma now is whether he merits the permanent role, or, despite an apparent turnaround at Old Trafford, United should still bite the bullet and stick to their original plan to appoint a different permanent Ruben Amorim successor.",
      "Some fans have made up their minds and the players are rejuvenated but Roy Keane and Gary Neville remain cautious.",
      "Keane says United need a manager \"who you feel can get them winning league titles\", while before the derby day win and the victory at league leaders Arsenal, Neville said there \"cannot be any consideration\" that Carrick takes the job.",
      "However, the football United fans have been exposed to against Man City and Arsenal, the two sides at the top of the Premier League, cannot be taken for granted.",
      "As Carrick celebrated Patrick Dorgu's zinger to make it 2-1 at Arsenal, Neville said the stand-in United boss had put his hands up like the \"messiah\". What United have been exposed to in just two games is what they have been waiting for and prophesied about for over a decade.",
      "The football taught by Carrick works because, rather than treating the game like an exact science, he has allowed it to become an art of self-expression.",
      "Players playing to their strengths with the added pinch of nostalgia has been the recipe for Carrick's early success, with the squad no longer demanded to follow an elaborate instruction manual that never really makes clear what the final product would be.",
      "Carrick's United are direct, front-foot and have thus far been the perfect advert of \"United DNA\", averaging more fast breaks than any other team in the league.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo leads the line because he's made the most runs in behind per 90 in the Premier League this season. Bruno Fernandes is back in his favoured No 10 position as he remains one of the league's most potent chance creators. Dorgu has remained as a wide player because of his consistent displays high up the pitch.",
      "With very little time on the training pitch after taking on his team mid-season, there have been very few complaints from Carrick about his current situation. Why would there be? He's been given a free hit at Old Trafford, just as he was given one in 2021, following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. As he did then, reinstalling fundamentals has become a stroke of genius.",
      "In truth, it's all the makings of what United would hope to see in the first two games of any new permanent manager. Perhaps if it wasn't Carrick, perhaps if it was someone new in the dugout, there'd be a unanimous acceptance that he should be the next man in charge. Unfortunately, United have been here before.",
      "In December 2018, a harrowing 3-1 defeat at Liverpool meant that Jose Mourinho's time at United was called to a close.",
      "United was described as toxic as Old Trafford soured under Mourinho, who grew grumpy in the role and was losing favour amongst the playing squad. Solskjaer came in and had an opportunity to stamp his mark and did so in style.",
      "A 5-1 victory at Cardiff set Solskjaer and United on a trail of 12 matches without defeat in the Premier League. With positivity flowing through the place, the change in style to something more akin to the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "As we've seen under Carrick, there's something about a side fearless in transition that United fans love to watch.",
      "After winning 14 of his 19 interim matches, including an incredible comeback win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, Solskjaer was named United's permanent manager in March 2019. Solskjaer's interim efforts propelled United's top-four chances at the time.",
      "However, after United appointed Solskjaer, everyone returned from the honeymoon and to a dose of realism that Solskjaer was an inexperienced manager whose positive energy outweighed his proficiency in the role. United quickly crashed and burned that season, winning just two of their last eight, missing out on the top four.",
      "Throughout Solskjaer's three years in charge, a similar pattern sustained. United would go on to finish third and second under Solskjaer, but notoriously couldn't get over the line to achieve material success.",
      "United fans look back at their time under Solskjaer, perhaps as fondly as any time since Ferguson's retirement in 2013, but there was ultimately nothing tangible gained under the manager who made United simply \"feel good\".",
      "Under Solskjaer, United were a nearly team, reaching multiple semi-finals in all the cup competitions before a Europa League final in 2021 ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Villarreal.",
      "David de Gea's missed penalty is viewed by many as the true sliding doors moment that led to Solskjaer's ultimate demise in the role but the reality was that United were serial losers when push came to shove.",
      "There's an underlying resistance to repeat the same mistake with Carrick. When United opted to appoint Solskjaer permanently, the regime at the time, in the same breath, lost the chance to appoint Zinedine Zidane and Mauricio Pochettino, who at that time were the outstanding rumoured candidates.",
      "Should United appoint Carrick permanently, they will miss out on tapping into the thriving economy of available managers to do what they have tried in the past.",
      "There's no reason to suggest Carrick would be the same or worse than Solskjaer, but after years of experimenting, the next decision on United manager feels like the most significant one yet.",
      "It could be the difference between returning to a side worthy of the name and reputation or remaining in a cycle of failure.",
      "On current evidence, Carrick would be an astute appointment. But if United want to do something new, however well Carrick does, he shouldn't be among the future candidates. Fans will get carried away, as fans are allowed to. INEOS, though, have another era-defining decision to make.",
