      "A disappointing draw at West Ham has reminded Manchester United of the realities of playing in the Premier League. However, the mood in the camp remains bright despite the club failing to win under Michael Carrick for the first time.",
      "The Red Devils remain undefeated in five games under the interim manager. That's after Benjamin Sesko came off the bench to convert a calculated equaliser at the London Stadium on Tuesday.",
      "United remain fourth in the league after fifth-place Chelsea also gave up two valuable points in a 2-2 draw at home to Leeds. However, Carrick's men channelled the never-say-die attitude of their forebears to earn a result and keep alive the longest active undefeated streak in England's top flight.",

      "United have received unfortunate news as talk turns toward Marcus Rashford's future and whether Barcelona will buy the player outright. The update being that Barca would consider purchasing the player, but only if his fee is reduced.",
      "To many, the £26million clause included in the Englishman's deal was already enough of a bargain. Rashford may be 28 years old, but his return of 10 goals and 13 assists in 34 games for them is evidence enough that he justifies the figure.",
      "United fans will be pleased to see Sport report a deal \"won't be possible\" on those terms. As such, it may be that United have to return to the drawing board this summer and hope to find more suitors if Rashford is indeed intent on leaving.",
      "Alternatively, speculation is growing that there could be a future for the forward at Old Trafford after all. Interim boss Carrick has made it clear he wants Rashford back at his parent club, and their past connection could prove crucial.",
      "A recent complication to proceedings is Rashford's knee injury, which rules him out of action for the foreseeable future. The Englishman will be in a race to return to full fitness before the summer to ensure he'll make the United shop window.",
      "Following on from his heroics at the London Stadium in midweek, Sesko has earned a fresh wave of praise from his superiors. Carrick entrusted the summer signing with getting something out of the game after a Tomas Soucek goal put West Ham ahead, and Sesko duly delivered with a deft volley at the near post.",
      "Michael Carrick was delighted with Benjamin Sesko's contribution against West Ham(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt/Getty Images)",
      "Despite a sluggish start to his United career, Sesko now has five goals in his last six outings for United. They've been largely crucial ones, too, scoring in the 3-2 win over Fulham, as well as bagging a brace in the 2-2 disappointment against Burnley.",
      "The manager made clear how impressed he was with the whole squad's efforts despite dropping two points in east London. And Sesko was one of the substitutes he singled out for praise following his equaliser.",
      "\"Leny [Yoro]’s come on and made a big difference for us tonight in big moments, and then Ben scored again,\" he said after the game. \"Ben’s doing a lot work. He's in a good place, he's ready to kick on, it's just managing the balance.",

      "\"We could have changed things a little bit earlier. That's obviously the decision we're always trying to make and we were actually having a bit of a spell in the game at that point where we thought we might come back into it, but when Ben came on the pitch he made a big difference.\"",
      "Sesko reciprocates that faith from his manager with no small amount of self-belief. Speaking after the game, the Slovenian said he and his team-mates are \"living for each other\" in their battle to tie down a top-four finish and qualify for next term's Champions League.",
      "\"We are living for each other,\" he told MUTV. \"We are doing everything to win the games, to secure the Champions League spot because we believe that we have the team for it.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"We have the quality, and yeah, we're going to fight towards it. Unfortunately, the game was like it was. We have to now look forward to the next game and try to win it.\"",
      "He went on to say it's \"a great feeling\" knowing he's able to help the team in clutch moments. And fans will be looking forward to witnessing more examples of what he produced at the London Stadium.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has come under fire for his comments on immigration",
      "Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club (MUMSC) have issued a statement following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's controversial remarks about immigration, in which he claimed the UK has been 'colonised'. During an interview about British politics, Ratcliffe argued the government needed to make 'difficult' decisions - the same type of choices he says his Ineos regime has already made at Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking to Sky News, the United co-owner said: \"If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular, and show some courage.",
      "\"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.\"",
      "Ratcliffe's divisive remarks prompted MUMSC to post on X (formerly Twitter) with a statement in response. The statement emphasises United's identity as a diverse, global club and urges leadership that brings people together rather than creating division.",
      "It read: \"We are deeply concerned by remarks describing the UK as having been 'colonised' by immigrants, and by positive references to political figures whose rhetoric on immigration and minority communities has long been divisive.",
      "\"The term 'colonised' is not neutral. It echoes the language frequently used in far-right narratives that frame migrants as invaders and demographic threats. Such rhetoric has real-world consequences.",
      "\"The UK has experienced sustained increases in hate crimes in recent years, including rises in Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, racially motivated attacks and hostility toward migrants and people of colour.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed the UK has been 'colonised by immigrants'(Image: Sky News)",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"Public discourse shapes public behaviour. When influential figures adopt language that mirrors extremist talking points, it risks legitimising prejudice and deepening division.",
      "\"Manchester United is a global club built on diversity - on players, staff and supporters from every background, faith and ethnicity. The strength of our club, and of our country, lies in that diversity.",
      "\"Debate on immigration policy is legitimate. But it must be conducted responsibly, without language that alienates communities or reinforces narratives associated with intolerance.",
      "\"We stand with all communities who reject racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and hatred in all its forms, and we call for leadership that unites rather than divides.\"",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe claims his 'unpopular' decisions have improved Manchester United's fortunes(Image: UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has claimed he became \"very unpopular\" at Manchester United for making the \"right\" decisions.",
      "Ratcliffe, 73, has made a number of high-profile calls at Old Trafford since he acquired a 27.7 per cent stake in United in December 2023 and assumed full control of the football operations in the following February.",
      "Among the changes Ratcliffe has made include axing more than 250 jobs to save an estimated £40million, ending the tradition for paid ambassadorial roles for former players, and ordering a return to office for all staff.",
      "There has also been a major overhaul of the club's executive team, with Omar Berrada coming in as Chief Executive (CEO) and Jason Wilcox as the Technical Director. Dan Ashworth did arrive as Sporting Director but he departed his role after less than five months in it.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "United have spent more than £400m on transfers since Ratcliffe arrived. That hasn't led to much success on the pitch so far, although the Reds did win the FA Cup in 2024 and reach the Europa League final in 2025.",
      "They initially kept Erik ten Hag after winning the FA Cup before later sacking him and costing the club around £21.4m in compensation. The Reds then appointed Ruben Amorim but axed him last month with Michael Carrick coming in as his replacement until the end of the season.",
      "Ratcliffe has received some criticism from United fans and others alike during his first two years at United, but the INEOS chief has now defended the \"difficult\" but \"right\" decisions he has made.",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Ratcliffe continued: \"Well, I've been very unpopular at Manchester United because we've made lots of changes. But for the better, in my view. And I think we're beginning to see some evidence in the football club that that's beginning to pay off.\"",
      "Before mentioning United, Ratcliffe had claimed that Britain has been \"colonised\" by immigrants, who are draining resources from the state. The Reds part-owner opened up on why he believes Britain faces profound political, social and economic challenges.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's tenure at Manchester United has been rocky(Image: Crystal Pix/MB Media, Getty Images)",
      "In a warning to the UK, Ratcliffe said: \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?\"",
      "Ratcliffe's United missed the chance on securing a fifth straight win as they were held to a 1-1 draw against West Ham on Tuesday. The Reds, however, were heading for a defeat up until Benjamin Sesko scored a stoppage-time equaliser after Tomas Soucek had given the Hammers the lead.",

      "Manchester United part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is facing backlash after claiming that the UK has been 'colonised by immigrants'. Ratcliffe, owner of petrochemicals conglomerate INEOS, also suggested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer was 'too nice' and revealed that he recently met Reform leader Nigel Farage, who he described as an 'intelligent man' with 'good intentions'.",
      "\"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" Ratcliffe, 73, told Sky News. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money. The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?\"",
      "The billionaire, who splits his time between Monaco and his waterside mansion in Hampshire, then inaccurately added: \"I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.\"",
      "It's estimated by the Office for National Statistics that the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. In 2000, the UK population was estimated to be 58.9 million.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Ratcliffe's comments sparked a wave of backlash, with one person on X saying: \"Says the man who resides in Monaco. Hypocrite.\" Another added: \"What a disgusting man.\" A third posted: \"Only eight of Man Utd's squad are English. The guy is an idiot.\"",
      "Ged Grebby, chief executive of 'Show Racism the Red Card', said that Sir Jim was 'perpetuating myths' about immigration.",
      "He told the Mirror: \"I couldn't agree more with the people who have commented on the hypocrisy of these remarks, coming from a man who lives in Monaco as a tax exile.",
      "\"And then there is the ignorance of his views on immigration. Analysis shows that the vast majority of immigrants are young people who work and contribute to the economy because they want to make a better life for themselves.",
      "\"So his views on that are nonsense. He is perpetuating the myths about immigration; you just have to look at the NHS and social services to see how much immigrants contribute to the UK economy.",
      "\"It is frustrating; for 'Show Racism the Red Card', manchester-united-fc>Manchester United are one of the best clubs. Yet we have the owner making cheap remarks like this.",
      "\"I know that Sir Alex Ferguson would say the exact opposite, he knows how much immigrants have contributed to life here. Unison is doing important work on migrant labour as they have contributed to a big increase in their membership.\"",
      "BACK THE MIRROR!  Ensure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search",
      "Discussing Starmer's suitability for UK Prime Minister, Ratcliffe continued: \"I don't know whether it's just the apparatus that hasn't allowed Keir to do it or, or he's maybe too nice - I mean, Keir is a nice man.",
      "\"I like him, but it's a tough job and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track, because at the moment I don't think the economy is in a good state.\"",
      "The United chief said of Farage: \"I think Nigel is an intelligent man, and, I think he's got good intentions. But in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir Starmer. I think it needs somebody who's prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out.\"",
      "Also in the interview, which took place at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, Ratcliffe described himself as 'very unpopular' in his role at United. Since acquiring a minority stake in the Premier League giants in February 2024, and taking control of the club's footballing operations through INEOS - which also owns French side Nice - he's sacked two managers, hired two sporting directors and implemented various cost-cutting measures.",
      "In two years at Old Trafford, Ratcliffe is understood to have culled around 450 jobs. \"I've been very unpopular at United because we've made lots of changes,\" he explained.",
      "\"But for the better, in my view. And I think we're beginning to see some evidence in the football club that that's beginning to pay off. But you've got all the same issues with the country.",
      "\"If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular, and show some courage.\""

      "Barcelona are reportedly keen on making Marcus Rashford's move a permanent one. However, they're hoping to negotiate down his transfer fee, likely to the chagrin of Manchester United.",
      "Despite the £26million purchase clause in Rashford's loan deal already seeming like a steal, Barca are looking to pay even less for the forward. However, Sport has noted this 'won't be possible' due to United's firm position on the matter.",
      "Rashford, 28, has been a revelation at the Camp Nou, exceeding expectations after his difficult spell at Old Trafford. He's netted 10 goals and provided 13 assists in 34 appearances for Barcelona, including nine direct goal contributions in just eight Champions League matches.",
      "Given his consistent use of Rashford, it's no surprise manager Hansi Flick seems to favour the England international. The attacker has started 20 times under the German this season and has only missed out once when named in a matchday squad.",

      "\"We always look at goals, final passes, but as a coach he can give us much more,\" he recently told reporters. \"That's what I want to see. I'm very happy with him; he's giving us what we ask of him, but he has even more potential.\"",
      "Hansi Flick appears content with Rashford's returns at Barca(Image: Guillermo Martinez/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Raphinha's injury problems have worked in Rashford's favour, making them more dependent on the Englishman's contributions. That said, Rashford has certainly delivered when given the opportunity.",
      "It's a win-win situation for United. Should Barcelona choose not to activate their purchase option, his time in Spain has demonstrated the quality Rashford still possesses at the highest level, which is bound to attract interest from other clubs.",
      "Michael Carrick reportedly wants to bring Rashford back to Old Trafford(Image: Getty)",
      "United might actually prefer that scenario, as they would likely be able to command a higher transfer fee for the player. Then there's the third possibility of him returning to Old Trafford, despite reports suggesting he's eager to close that chapter of his career.",
      "Recent reports have emerged that interim United manager Michael Carrick wants his former team-mate back at the club. Should he be given the job on a permanent basis, retaining Rashford could become a higher priority.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Beyond that, Rashford himself might be more tempted to come back under a manager he previously played alongside. Carrick has received acclaim for his man-management abilities as well as his tactical approach, and Rashford's relationship with the club might not be beyond repair with Carrick at the helm.",
      "Regardless, the likelihood of United agreeing to Barcelona's demands and reducing their asking price appears slim. That said, there could be other options the two clubs might consider, such as Barcelona including one of their own players as part of the deal.",
      "In any case, a recent knee injury suffered in the recent win over Mallorca might affect the plans of both clubs. Rashford will be sidelined for the immediate future and could face a race against time to prove his worth before a decision must be made on his next steps.",

      "Benjamin Sesko earned Man Utd a late, late point at West Ham",
      "The wait for Manchester United goes on. But at least they salvaged a point with Benjamin Sesko’s 96th minute leveller which was straight out of the Fergie time play book.",
      "It broke West Ham hearts and could not actually provide the fifth straight win which United have waited so long for. No-one went home happy. However, West Ham are showing signs of life and fight even if they could not see this one out for the precious three points they needed.",
      "They did, however, stop United winning five games in a row for the first time in two years on a rollercoaster night of emotions. The long-suffering travelling United fans have seen such an improvement under Carrick and he has put in one hell of an audition to get the job on a permanent basis.",
      "But this was also about West Ham scrapping and fighting as Nuno Espirito Santo has really begun to give the fans hope. They had to weather long spells of United pressure but West Ham refused to buckle on a grey, misty night at the London Stadium.",

      "United went close after 22 minutes when Bruno Fernandes ’ 22nd minute corner found Luke Shaw in the box and the United defender’s shot was cleared off the line by Aaron Wan-Bissaka.",
      "It felt like this game was going nowhere. It was drab, uneventful and you can bet England boss Thomas Tuchel probably felt like he had wasted a night as he was sat up in the stands.",
      "But, at long last, West Ham are showing signs of fight and their opening goal was testament to teamwork. Jarrod Bowen was so clever as the West Ham captain battled and held off Shaw to create space for Tomas Soucek to ping the ball forward.",
      "Tomas Soucek thought he has scored the winner for West Ham(Image: West Ham United FC/West Ham United FC via Getty Images)",
      "Bowen scampered down the right wing, sent over a low cross and there was Soucek in the six yard box to turn the ball home from close range in the 50th minute.",
      "That brought the stadium to life and even the mood in the place has changed because the home fans can sense fresh optimism and genuine hope for survival.",
      "There was another big reason for West Ham fans to celebrate after Casemiro headed in what looked to be an equaliser but it was ruled out by VAR as the United midfielder was clearly offside.",
      "United threw on a raft of substitutes - including Sesko - as they fought desperately for a leveller and Joshua Zirkzee came as close as anyone as he glanced just wide. That had Carrick on his toes on the touchline.",
      "Seven minutes of added time were ticking down when United launched yet another attack - and this time it finally worked. Then just when it looked as if West Ham would get the points, Bryan Mbeumo’s ball was turned in with a looping shot from Sesko.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Benjamin Sesko salvaged a draw at the death(Image: James Fearn/Getty Images)",
      "Benjamin Sesko's 96th-minute equaliser broke West Ham hearts and rescued a 1-1 draw for Manchester United. Tomas Soucek's second-half strike looked to have made the difference, and a victory would've taken Nuno Espirito Santo's men within three goals of escaping the relegation zone.",
      "But Sesko, having come off the bench, came up with a magnificent finish to convert Bryan Mbeumo's cross and salvage a point. Michael Carrick had returned to his former club looking to make it five wins in a row, but despite the draw, he got some more late joy to keep the Red Devils in the top four.",
      "Here are five talking points from the London Stadium.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "If you missed the opening 45 minutes, you didn't miss much. Pedestrian football from both sides meant that chances were few and far between, with Senne Lammens having the most work to do of the goalkeepers when he palmed away a decent effort from the in-form Crysencio Summerville.",
      "The visitors went closest, though, as Aaron Wan-Bissaka blocked Luke Shaw's effort on the line after another well-worked corner routine by Carrick's side. They had more of the possession but rarely kept it in the final third, allowing West Ham to constantly get bodies back.",
      "To illustrate the lack of goalmouth action, the teams only generated a combined 0.28 expected goals. It was comfortably the worst half of Carrick's short reign up to that point.",
      "BACK THE MIRROR! Ensure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search",
      "Michael Carrick had some thinking to do at the break(Image: Ian Kington/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "But was this about to be an even worse half for Carrick? After Luke Shaw hesistated and allowed on a punt forward to bounce, Jarrod Bowen won the ball and laid it off to Soucek.",
      "The Czech had time and space to give it back to Bowen, who burst away down the right flank as claret shirts flooded the box. After a low cross, Soucek was there to tap home, completing a lovely move with his team-mate and finally giving those inside the London Stadium a reason to make some noise.",
      "It was Soucek's third goal against the Red Devils, having also netted at Old Trafford last season. The midfielder's strike also makes him the highest-scoring Czech player in Premier League history, surpassing Patrick Berger.",
      "Tomas Soucek combined with Jarrod Bowen to score(Image: West Ham United FC/West Ham United FC via Getty Images)",
      "The Red Devils responded well to West Ham's opener and looked to be level just after the hour mark. Kobbie Mainoo produced a superb cross to find Casemiro charging into the penalty area and he coolly headed home past Mads Hermansen, edging in front of Wan-Bissaka.",
      "But from Casemiro's reaction, he knew what was coming. A VAR check confirmed the offside and remained 1-0 going into the closing stages.",
      "Casemiro looked to have equalised with a header(Image: Izzy Poles - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "By no means an outcast under Ruben Amorim, Harry Maguire's return from injury coincided with Carrick's appointment and has given him a new lease of life. Imperious for much of the last five games, there was a moment of worry in the first half when the 32-year-old went into a tackle and came out clutching his hamstring.",
      "Maguire was able to continue until being subbed in the 68th minute alongside Matheus Cunha, who'd been ineffective, and he was seen talking to staff. Leny Yoro and Benjamin Sesko were sent on while Nuno also made a change, as Callum Wilson replaced Valentin Castellanos.",
      "Harry Maguire was feeling his hamstring in the first half(Image: James Fearn/Getty Images)",
      "After coming up with the winner against Fulham two games ago, Sesko was the Red Devils' saviour again - and this time in style. As Carrick threw the kitchen sink at it, West Ham had multiple chances to finish the game off.",
      "And the Irons were left to rue their careless finishing when Sesko met Mbeumo's cross at the near post and found the top right-hand corner. Carrick's winning run is over but the honeymoon period might just continue in nearly a fortnight's time at Everton.",

The 'United Strand' was hoping that his 493-day challenge would finally come to an end on Tuesday evening, with just one win remaining on the Red Devils' part.",
      "That's given United had achieved wins over Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham Hotspur on-the-bounce ahead of their trip to the London Stadium to face West Ham United. However, as they were held to a 1-1 draw by the Hammers in the capital, the viral sensation's tally reset, and he will now rely on United going another five matches without a loss or a draw.",
      "The 'United Strand, real name Frank Ilett, was left with egg on his face as he took part in an event on live stream platform Kick for the match, his ever-growing hair sitting on the shoulders of a retro Red Devils shirt. After a goalless first-half, Tomas Soucek looked to have crushed the hopes and dreams of the social media star 50 minutes into the match, putting West Ham 1-0 up on home soil.",
      "An incredibly cagey final 40 plus stoppage time then played out, as the weight of the result grew heavier than the luscious locks upon his head. While Benjamin Sesko levelled the match six minutes into stoppage time, it was a case of too little, too late for United, who walked away from the London Stadium sharing the points with the Hammers.",
      "While the result will have felt like a win to United fans watching around the world, given just how far out of the fixture the Red Devils were, it will have came as a crushing blow to Ilett, who will now have to wait until at least March 20 to book his trip to the barbers.",
      "Furthermore, United will have to secure victory over Everton, Crystal Palace, Newcastle United, Aston Villa and Bournemouth to allow the 'United Strand' to finally shave his head. It marks another long 38 day wait for Ilett, who may see his challenge draw to a close on day 531 if he is lucky.",

The England international will be 33 when his existing agreement expires this summer, as he approaches the latter stages of his career.",
      "Given that he's understood to currently earn approximately £180,000-per-week in wages, United may seek to reduce his salary as they attempt to reach an arrangement with him. The club will also need to negotiate with his representatives regarding the duration of his new deal.",
      "The England international has proved integral to Carrick's system at Old Trafford and now looks set to have his tenure prolonged following his impressive displays in recent weeks. The Daily Mail report Maguire's representatives held discussions with AC Milan in January, though the player wishes to remain and appears likely to pen new terms.",
      "Maguire has featured in every one of Carrick's matches since taking charge of United last month, partnering alongside Lisandro Martinez in victories over Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham.",
      "Should Maguire finalise a new agreement with his club of seven years, it would represent a remarkable turnaround from the situation he encountered just a number of years ago, having been relieved of his captaincy by Erik ten Hag before drifting in and out of Ruben Amorim's starting XI.",
      "Maguire's situation differs from that of team-mate Casemiro, who has confirmed he will leave Manchester United when his contract runs out this summer. The Brazilian holding midfielder has flourished at the Theatre of Dreams since joining from Real Madrid in 2022, clocking up 149 appearances in the heart of the engine room.",

      "Benjamin Sesko is starting to make an impact at Manchester United",
      "Darren Fletcher's time in charge of Manchester United might only have lasted two games and a little over a week, but for Benjamin Sesko, it could prove to have been a pivotal few days in his Old Trafford career.",
      "The Slovenian had struggled at times under Ruben Amorim. Although his unflappable nature ensured he never got too down on himself, a return of just two goals in 17 games under the Portuguese head coach marked a slow start after a £73million move from RB Leipzig in the summer.",
      "Sesko didn't score in any of United's final nine games under Amorim and looked like he was struggling for confidence. The appointment of Fletcher was an immediate remedy to that and although he hasn't started yet for Michael Carrick, he has maintained that momentum by coming off the bench to score crucial goals against Fulham and West Ham.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "On his first day as caretaker head coach, Fletcher pulled Sesko aside for a one-on-one chat. He showed him videos of his movement and things he was doing well, telling him the goals would come if he kept that up. But he also explained United's pursuit of him.",
      "Although he was closely monitored by Arsenal before they pivoted to Viktor Gyokeres, United had also been keeping tabs on Sesko, ever since his breakthrough at Red Bull Salzburg. As the club's former technical director, Fletcher was well placed to tell Sesko how long United had been tracking him and what they liked about him. It put a spring in his step.",
      "As a confidence-building tool, it paid immediate dividends. Sesko scored twice in Fletcher's first game in charge against Burnley and then found the net again in the FA Cup third-round defeat to Brighton. In 245 minutes of football since Amorim was sacked, he has scored five goals at a rate of one every 49 minutes.",
      "Sesko gets a hug from Michael Carrick after his late winner against Fulham",
      "Sesko has been restricted to the role of impact sub under Carrick, but he is playing it to perfection. At 22, there is plenty of room for development, and he is benefiting from a change in approach at Carrington over the past five or six weeks.",
      "While Amorim's coaching focused heavily on team sessions, there is more room for individual work now, with sessions shorter, allowing for one-on-one work at the end of them. Sesko is regularly involved in that and Carrick has been pleased with what he has seen, with the view that he has improved since the turn of the year. Part of former academy coach Travis Binnion's role is to work on individual player development and he is having an impact on Sesko.",
      "The striker is also big on helping himself. He is described as \"super dedicated\" at the training ground and arrives first every day with Diogo Dalot, who has become his closest confidante in the squad. Upon arrival at Carrington, the pair will always spend 45 minutes in the hyperbaric chamber, which helps muscles recover.",
      "A sign of that desire to do the right things in terms of preparation comes from Sesko's decision over which house to buy. He lived in the city centre when he first signed for the club and took his time before moving into his own property, because he wanted a house that would aid his performance, with facilities like a pool, sauna and ice bath built in. He now has that in Cheshire's 'golden triangle' for footballers.",
      "This approach to performance is why Amorim labelled him a \"control freak\" in November. It came at a time when there were questions over Sesko's form and the comment was the Portuguese's typically blunt way of communicating. It wasn't meant as a criticism, but it could have been interpreted that way.",
      "Sesko delivered his best performance for United against Burnley under Darren Fletcher",
      "It didn't unsettle Sesko, however. Club insiders aren't even sure if he saw the comments, such is his desire to shut himself away from the outside noise. He isn't a big social media user; he usually just posts after a game and then disconnects to avoid getting bogged down by criticism or carried away by praise.",
      "Throughout his time at Old Trafford and the ups and downs that have already accompanied his embryonic career at the club, he has remained consistent with his approach and personality. A source described it as his \"super strength\", such is the noise around United and the ease with which players can become distracted.",
      "Rather than scrolling through social media apps, Sesko is an avid reader. He is described as an intelligent young man who reads books on performance culture. One of his favourites is The Let Them Theory, which helps readers stop letting other people's opinions and judgements impact their lives.",
      "It sounds like it should be required reading for every new United signing.",

      "Despite scoring an injury-time winner against Fulham, Benjamin Sesko missed out on starting against Tottenham, but that was logical with a view to starting Sesko against West Ham.",
      "It seemed Carrick would put his arm around Sesko before the Spurs game and explain that he would be his man a few days later against West Ham. United were set to play two games in four days, and Sesko deserved a reward for a string of strong performances. Starting him at the London Stadium made sense.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "However, Carrick picked an unchanged team for a third game in a row, sticking by the striker-less attack of Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. The 44-year-old thought 'why change something if it's not broken', but every game is different and West Ham's shape was difficult to penetrate.",
      "Amad, Mbeumo and Cunha were hardly involved in the first half. Amad was the worst performer of the trio, and he was the obvious candidate to hook at the interval to introduce Sesko to the game.",
      "Carrick wanted to give his starting XI more time and waited until the 69th minute to introduce Sesko, though. The Slovenian international sat on the bench without a coat - the only substitute to do so - from the beginning of the second half, but had to wait 24 minutes to get onto the pitch.",
      "It was a surprise that it took so long for Sesko to be introduced. Casemiro played a lofted pass to Bruno Fernandes before the hour mark, the kind of ball only a striker can bring down, and perhaps that was the final straw.",
      "Sesko's spectacular finish in added time was vindication of the pre-game opinion that he should have started. The goal gets better every time you watch. The technique for the volley was exquisite.",
      "Carrick heaped praise on Sesko, saying: \"It's an unbelievable finish from the angle to generate that, to get it on target, to finish it. It's some goal from him. He's capable of that, Ben.",
      "\"He's done it over time. It's not that he's just suddenly burst on the scene. He's been doing it, he's proven that he can score goals as well. He's been doing it in training for us as well.",
      "\"It's not surprising, to be honest. I think that's what he does, it's what he's good at. But certainly to actually do it and to feel it. He did it with the last one [against Tottenham], tonight, a little bit different with the emotion of the game, but certainly important and a big moment for him and us.\"",
      "Sesko scores against West Ham.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "One of the arguments for Sesko to start against West Ham was that he deserved a reward for his goals, as it would have been demoralising if he'd continued to score from the bench, only to be overlooked again.",
      "Sesko cannot be overlooked when United play Everton at the Hill Dickinson Stadium on February 23. He has genuine momentum - five goals in six games - and will be miffed there is no game to play this weekend.",
      "United have a 13-day break between games after crashing out of the FA Cup at the first hurdle against Brighton. That break does not do Sesko, who will be chomping at the bit to start, any favours, but he's been in such strong form that it might not make a difference.",
      "Which forward moves to the bench to make way for Sesko will be the debate in the build-up to Everton, although it should be a choice between Cunha and Amad, given Mbeumo is the leading goalscorer.",
      "Amad stayed on the pitch at the London Stadium, while Cunha was replaced by Sesko, but Amad's overhit pass to the backpost as United chased an equaliser summed up his performance.",
      "You have to nitpick to make a case to move either Cunha or Amad to the bench. Having said that, the latter hasn't been at his best, failing to record a goal involvement since he returned from AFCON.",
      "In the same games, Cunha recorded an assist against Manchester City and scored against Arsenal and Fulham. The Brazilian's goal at the Emirates sealed a special victory. The numbers and eye test suggest Amad should lose his place in the team to Sesko, who has made himself impossible to ignore.",

      "Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick shares a word with Benjamin Sesko(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick's return to Manchester United has been an overwhelming success so far. Even taking into account the draw against West Ham on Tuesday night, the Reds remain in a much better place than they were under Ruben Amorim's leadership.",
      "It is hard to know how United would have performed if Amorim had been in charge, maybe they would have nicked a point at the London Stadium. But the general consensus has been that United would not have beaten all of Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham or Tottenham Hotspur beforehand so Carrick's impressive impact on this squad is rightfully being recognised.",
      "Thanks to this, it has been difficult for anyone, either inside or outside the squad, to question Carrick's approach to the job or the team selections he has made. He has subscribed to the mantra of 'if it's not broke, don't fix it.'",

      "The trip to West Ham saw the Reds pick the same team for the third successive fixture and the only time Carrick has altered the starting line-up has been due to injury. But on Tuesday night, it was a substitute who ensured the unbeaten run remained intact.",
      "Benjamin Sesko scored arguably one of United's goals of the season with his intuitive flick at the near post rescuing a point for the Reds. This is not the first time that Sesko has managed to score important goals for the club since Amorim was replaced.",
      "He now has four goals in his last five Premier League matches and has a respectable seven goals in 23 United appearances, with only Bryan Mbeumo having scored more than him this season.",
      "Due to United's early exits in the Carabao and FA Cups, coupled with no European football this season, opportunities for Carrick to rotate the squad are limited. The absence of football outside the Premier League also means the Reds have an empty weekend this week.",
      "But once United return to action a week on Monday, Carrick could have an awkward conversation to come with Sesko if he does not start for the trip to Everton. Currently, the Slovenian is earning himself the tag of 'super sub' but ask any player and they will tell you they do not want to earn a reputation for being good enough solely off the bench.",
      "Ensure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as a Preferred Source in your Google search settings",
      "Sesko even made his pitch to start more often in his post-match interview with MUTV. \"I think everyone wanted it, everyone was trying to win the game, to score, to fight for each other,\" he explained.",
      "\"Unfortunately that didn't happen, but at least we got a draw, which is important in the end. I felt amazing because at least I know that, once again, I could help the team by trying to secure at least one point.\"",
      "At some stage, Carrick will be unable to ignore the impact Sesko is making off the bench and will need to look at starting the forward. The only question then would be who drops out.",
      "The obvious answer would be to move Mbeumo out to the right and put Amad onto the bench. While the Ivorian is a good threat for United, it would not harm him to have a spell out of the team to give Sesko a chance. Whatever Carrick decides to do, it is at least progress to see United giving their head coach positive selection dilemmas.",

      "Senne Lammens believes Benjamin Sesko knows \"how important\" he is to Manchester United, whether he's included in the starting team or not. Sesko came off the bench to score in added time to rescue a point against West Ham at the London Stadium on Tuesday night.",
      "Michael Carrick introduced Sesko to the game in the 69th minute. The 44-year-old was set to taste the first defeat since his interim appointment, but Sesko produced a wonderful finish to salvage a draw.",
      "Carrick has named Sesko on the bench for each of his five games in charge. The Slovenian international scored an injury-time match-winner in the 3-2 win against Fulham and produced the goods again in the final minutes against West Ham, which ensured Carrick remains undefeated.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Sesko made a slow start after signing from RB Leipzig for £66.4m, and £7.3m in add-ons, but the forward now has momentum after scoring five goals in his last six appearances for United.",
      "Lammens spoke to a handful of Manchester-based correspondents as he left the London Stadium. He was asked about how Sesko has responded to being named on the bench and said: \"Honestly, he's been like he's always been the whole season, even if he's starting or not starting.",
      "\"I think he knows how important he is for us, even when he's not starting. Like today and against Fulham, because in the end, when we need a goal, we can always count on him.",
      "\"So that's why he was important today. I think he did his job well, but I'm sure if he starts, he'll also do his job. It's nice to be able to count on him in both occasions.\"",
      "Sesko demonstrated impressive technique with his goal(Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "Speaking after the draw, Sesko said he was \"happy\" to secure a point but disappointed not to have won the game. Lammens admitted he had \"mixed feelings\" about the result as well.",
      "\"Still a bit disappointed and felt like we didn't really play the way we should have, especially in the first half, we didn't create as much. I think we needed to be more sharp with the ball,\" he said.",
      "\"We needed to create more. Of course, when you score in the end and still get a point, it's always a bit better, but still, the overall feeling is a bit disappointing for us.\"",
      "When asked whether playing two games in four days was a reason for the flatter performance, Lammens said: \"It could be a bit of both. I think they're always a hard side to play against, especially in here. We have difficulties at home as well against them, so it's always difficult coming here.\"",
      "He added: \"They know what they have to do, how they defend us. A low block is always difficult to play against. And then, like I said, we have to be at our best and sharp to be able to create chances against them. We weren't that sharp today, like we've been the last couple of weeks.",
      "\"So I think it's a bit of everything. Also, not being able to or... Because the last game was three days ago, you can't put excuses on it. Because they also had a game two or three days ago.",
      "\"But still, like you said, we've been used to playing one game a week. It's a little bit in the legs, I think. But if we want to be a team playing for the top, then we can't use that as an excuse.",
      "\"So we need to learn from this, because we'll play against a team like West Ham did today. For more games in the future, so we need to be able to play against them and create chances.\"",
      "Senne Lammens made a save to deny Callum Wilson.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Lammens made a strong save to deny Crysencio Summerville in the first half, and produced an excellent stop to prevent Callum Wilson from scoring when he was one-on-one in the final minutes.",
      "The 23-year-old has not made headlines during Carrick's unbeaten run as interim, but he's been quietly one of the most important players in the dressing room, just as he has since making his debut in October.",
      "\"I think the way Michael took over against City, especially when he only had two or three days to prepare us [was impressive],\" he reflected. \"Just one of his strong suits as well, being clear about what he wants, communication. So we knew what we had to do. The plan was clear.",
      "\"So we executed them against the first two games against City and Arsenal... It's a bit different because it's a different kind of game today, for example. We don't really have to make the game ourselves.",
      "\"It's more of being able to be compact and play from the counter and creating chances. That's one of our strong suits. So we know against those teams we can do good. But then against Fulham and against Tottenham at home, we had to play more of our game. I think we did that.",
      "\"Not always the prettiest, but the result was always there, which is the most important thing, which we haven't really done all season. Get those results or get those streaks going, like four wins in a row.",
      "\"So, yeah, we felt really good getting those wins in. Today was a little bit disappointing because we wanted to continue that. Now as well, being two weeks without a game, you want to go in that period with a good feeling.",
      "\"It's a little bit less bad because we scored at the end, but still not the best feeling. But I think the first five games with him as a coach, we can be happy with and looking forward to the rest.\"",
      "With eight minutes remaining, Carrick replaced Diogo Dalot with Joshua Zirkzee. Lammens spoke about the importance of gambling when trailing in a match, saying: \"Yeah, I think you always have to be, if you're down in the end, you always have to be a little bit of a gambling team.",
      "\"That's why we also made those substitutions. And that's my job as well, like you said, to help the team out a little bit at the end, to make that save so we can be able to still score a goal and get that point. So I'm happy I could help my team as well today.\"",
      "Lammens will continue to help United for the remainder of the season. He is having an excellent debut campaign.",

      "Gabriel was sent-off for a clash with West Brom's Harry French during the second half and if the decision stands he is expected to be banned for the FA Youth Cup fifth-round tie with Oxford United next Wednesday night.",

      "The referee's report from Tuesday's game referenced Gabriel being sent-off for the use of an elbow, but the footage from the game suggests a tussle with French but there is no obvious use of the elbow.

      "Ratcliffe spoke to Sky News.(Image: © 2024 Bloomberg Finance LP)",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has claimed the United Kingdom has been \"colonised\" by immigrants. In an interview about politics in Britain, Ratcliffe suggested the government needed to make \"difficult\" decisions, which he claimed his Ineos regime had made at Old Trafford.",
      "Ratcliffe has become a polarising figure in Manchester since he acquired a minority stake at United in February 2024. The British billionaire oversaw mass redundancies at United, cut costs across all departments, and increased match ticket prices for Premier League games to £66, with no concessions.",
      "United fans have continued to protest against the majority owners, the Glazers, but Ratcliffe has also been the target of protests. Ratcliffe is responsible for running United's football operations.",

      "Speaking to Sky News to discuss politics in Britain, Ratcliffe said: \"I've seen quite a bit of this at the football club. If you do difficult things, which we felt that we had to do at Manchester United.",
      "\"We felt like they were the right things to do. But you do become very unpopular for a while. Well, I've been very unpopular at Manchester United because we've made lots of changes.",
      "\"But for the better, in my view. And I think we're beginning to see some evidence in the football club that that's beginning to pay off. But you've got all the same issues with the country.",
      "\"If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular, and show some courage.\"",
      "Ratcliffe has lobbied the Labour government for support for the Old Trafford regeneration project. The Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, was invited into the directors' box to watch United play Arsenal in 2024.",
      "However, Ratcliffe has suggested that Starmer may not be the right man for the job, criticising immigration levels in Britain and suggesting the economy is in a poor state.",
      "Discussing immigration, Ratcliffe said: \"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money.",
      "\"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.\"",
      "The Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. The UK population was estimated at 58.9 million in 2000.",
      "Ratcliffe continued: \"I don't know whether it's just the apparatus that hasn't allowed Keir to do it or, or he's maybe too nice - I mean, Keir is a nice man. I like him, but it's a tough job and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track, because at the moment I don't think the economy is in a good state.\"",
      "The 73-year-old revealed he had recently met Nigel Farage, the Reform leader, saying: \"I think Nigel is an intelligent man, and, I think he's got good intentions. But in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir Starmer. I think it needs somebody who's prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out.\"",
      "Ahead of the general election in 2024, Ratcliffe criticised the Conservative Party and threw his support behind Starmer to become prime minister. \"I like Keir. I think he’ll do a very sensible job,\" he said.",

      "Benjamin Sesko scored a brilliant equaliser for United at West Ham",
      "Michael Carrick believes Benjamin Sesko is ready to go to another level after praising the impact he made in rescuing a point for Manchester United at West Ham. The 22-year-old is yet to start any of Carrick's five games in charge but scored a decisive injury-time goal for the second time in three games, with his instinctive finish in the 96th minute securing a point after Tomas Soucek had opened the scoring.",
      "Sesko has two goals in 61 minutes of football under Carrick and has five goals in his last six games, only two of which have been starts, and despite his lack of action he looks in a rich vein of form at the moment.",
      "The £73million striker was unfortunate not to start at the London Stadium and Carrick admitted he could have brought him on earlier than the 69th minute, with United in need of a focal point to their attack, but when he did come on he proved to be worth the wait.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "\"It's always the balance. I think the boys have done fantastically well who have played as well,\" said Carrick. \"That's the importance of the whole group and importance of the squad and I've said it to them after every game.",
      "\"Leny’s come on and made a big difference for us tonight in big moments and then Ben scored again. Ben’s doing a lot work. He's in a good place, he's ready to kick on, it's just managing the balance.",
      "\"We could have changed things a little bit earlier. That's obviously the decision we're always trying to make and we were actually having a bit of a spell in the game at that point where we thought we might come back into it, but when Ben came on the pitch he made a big difference.\"",

      "Sesko took his goal brilliantly, producing a clever finish to make Bryan Mbeumo's cross look better than it was and loop the ball over Hammers goalkeeper Mads Hermansen.",
      "Carrick has referenced the quality of his finishing in training and is delighted with the steps the young striker is taking in his first season at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It's an unbelievable finish from the angle to generate that, to get it on target, to finish it,\" he said. \"It's some goal from him. He's capable of that, Ben. He's done it over time. It's not that he's just suddenly burst on the scene.",
      "\"He's been doing it, he's proven that he can score goals as well. He's been doing it in training for us as well. It's not surprising, to be honest. I think that's what he does, it's what he's good at. But certainly to actually do it and to feel it. He did it with the last one [against Tottenham], tonight, a little bit different with the emotion of the game, but certainly important and a big moment for him and us.\"",
      "Carrick opted to keep faith with the same team that had beaten Fulham and Tottenham, but a fluid attack failed to fire in the capital, although that flexibility was helpful in the end as he threw players on to try and make the difference.",
      "\"There's a little bit on different games as well as situations in games and how you want to attack, where the space is or what the game looks like,\" he said. \"We probably didn't quite get the balance right, if we're honest, for the first part of the game",
      "\"Which happens, teams are allowed to stop you from scoring, but we kept going and mixed things up, and because we have got that flexibility, I think it certainly helps to find different solutions.\"",

      "United don't have a game this week because they are already out of the FA Cup after losing in the third-round to Brighton at Old Trafford, but rather than using the time to have a training camp abroad or a lucrative mid-season friendly, Carrick will focus on getting players back fit and taking stock of the previous five games, which have produced four wins and a draw.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "\"Staying in Manchester. I think it's a chance to refresh a little bit,\" he said. \"A few boys have knocks and niggles and a few strains that we can kind of clean up as you would expect at this stage of the season.",
      "\"Then obviously do some good work. I think that they do need a little bit of a breather and kind of digest where we're at, really, after this period of time. Take a deep breath, learn from it, clear the head and come back stronger again.",
      "\"It’s a strange one, 13 days, but we'll definitely use it and make the most of that.\"",
      "United had been expected to use the absence of European football this season to play mid-season friendlies, with Saudi Arabia long mooted as a potential destination. A 40-game season will mean a significant drop in revenues and United could earn significant sums from heading to the Middle East.",

      "Ruben Amorim confirmed it was a likely occurrence while he was in charge, and Carrick suggested talks were still underway internally to decide on the best course of action earlier this month.",
      "This was the first window of opportunity to go abroad, but United will get two more over the FA Cup fifth-round weekend in March and the quarter-finals at the start of April.",
      "But it is understood the chances of United jetting off to play friendlies abroad are now receding, although no final decision has been made.",
      "Carrick has delivered a significant upturn in form and despite the draw at West Ham, United remain fourth and in pole position to secure a return to the Champions League next season. With that prize in sight, consideration is being given to shelving the idea of playing friendlies abroad to focus on domestic duties.",

      "Manchester United missed the chance to go third in the Premier League as Michael Carrick's winning start to life as head coach came to an end with a 1-1 draw at West Ham.",
      "It had been a flat and uninspiring first half but the game changed after the break when Tomas Soucek opened the scoring, touching home a Jarrod Bowen cross after some poor Luke Shaw defending.",

      "Senne Lammens: Smart first-half save from Crysencio Summerville and couldn't do a lot with the goal, but the odd shaky moment when he was pressured with the ball at his feet. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Booked for a foul on Summerville and struggled to handle the winger all night. Looked nervous as a result and almost played his team into trouble in the first half. 5",
      "Harry Maguire: Looked to be struggling with a knock at times but stood up well defensively and won plenty of duels again. 7",
      "Lisandro Martinez: A night when United needed more of his line-breaking passes. Could have done more to stop the cross coming in for the goal. 6",
      "Luke Shaw: Bowen a difficult opponent but he played Shaw like a fiddle for the goal. Let a long ball bounce and then exploit the space when the full-back gambles on the next tackle. 4",
      "Ensure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as a Preferred Source in your Google search settings",
      "Casemiro: Unlucky with the disallowed goal after a good header. One of the better performers. Read the game well and combative in his second start in four days. 7",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Classy on the ball but didn't cover himself in glory for the goal. Blame on Shaw but Mainoo had Soucek's run covered and then let him get the first touch. 6",
      "Amad: Feels like he's been running out of steam and this game proved it. Saw plenty of the ball but didn't do enough to cause West Ham problems. 5",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Well below his usual standards on a night when United needed some of his usual magic. Just couldn't make things happen. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha: Dropped deep to try and get on the ball and make things happen but too often it left United without a focal point. Interchanging with Fernandes didn't work. 6",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Stationed out on the left for the first three-quarters of the game and the role didn't do him any favours. Never really involved. 5",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Tenacious against Castellanos in one duel. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Should have been introduced a lot earlier and produced a brilliant finish to earn a point. 7",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Little time to make an impact but nearly scored before Sesko did. 6",

      "Kobbie Mainoo has been brilliant since returning to the Manchester United team",
      "It is set to be the year of the midfield at Manchester United. If 2025 was all about revamping the attack, the focus this summer is going to fall on the centre of the pitch. United will target two new midfielders this summer, with one tasked with replacing Casemiro, who will leave at the end of the season when his contract expires.",
      "Manuel Ugarte is also likely to move on and there is every chance the midfield options available to whoever the head coach is at the start of the 2026/27 season will look a lot different to now.",
      "But six weeks ago, there was a fear that the entire midfield might need to be rebuilt. Bruno Fernandes had thrust his own future back into the news and Kobbie Mainoo's chances of playing under Ruben Amorim looked as distant as ever.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Fernandes now looks happy and settled again and Champions League football would surely convince the club captain to stay on, while no player has had a bigger transformation under Michael Carrick than Mainoo.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "The academy graduate is not only back in the team, but looking like the player who enjoyed a spectacular breakthrough in the second half of the 2023/24 season. For all the talk of United signing a £100million midfielder this summer, Mainoo's recent form is a reminder they might already have one on their hands. He was the best player on the pitch in Saturday's win against Tottenham.",
      "“There's definitely more to come from him, and that's just the age he's at, the stage he's at in his career. He’s just starting out, essentially,\" Carrick said after watching Mainoo run the show.",
      "“He’s got so much experience under his belt of big occasions, big games, and pressurised situations. That's going to help him develop and playing next to Case, and learning off him, things that he's probably not even realising he's picking up, just playing next to him as well as the other players around him.",
      "“I think that's just part of his journey to learn and develop. As I said, I'm really conscious that he's come in, he's played the four games, and he's found his rhythm. Young players will have times when they're up, and then they might have a little dip, that's not all of a sudden, he's good, or he's a poor player. Kobbie is what he is.",
      "“Managing that's really important, especially for younger players, and understanding that. So he's done fantastic at the moment. He's having a really big impact on games and we'll keep working with him and helping him, try and keep improving him as well as we go.”",
      "The irony of that is that Mainoo is actually one of the lowest-paid players in the squad, as he is still on the contract he signed as a 17-year-old in February 2023. His return to the starting XI has again triggered bonuses, but that still leaves him short of many of his teammates.",
      "Now that he is back in the fold, there is a desire to fix that. United never had any intention of letting their prized academy graduate leave and now they will show him how much he is valued by opening talks over a new deal, with the hope they can be concluded by the end of the season.",
      "That would be a significant boost ahead of the summer. On this form, Mainoo is one of the first names on the teamsheet, and with Fernandes as the starting No.10, there is only one spot left to fill in the strongest team. It is easy to imagine someone like Elliot Anderson coming in and finishing off that midfield trio.",
      "Whatever business United end up doing this summer, securing a new contract for Mainoo might be the best of it. He is the poster boy for the academy in recent years, as well as a brilliant footballer when shown the faith that Carrick has given him in recent weeks.",
      "He is also only 20 and there is clearly more to come, as Carrick explained on Saturday. This is a player who started the European Championship final at 18, and he should be part of United's midfield for years to come. Giving him a contract that reflects that status is now crucial.",
      "Mainoo has just over a year left on his existing deal, with the option of another 12 months, but United know he needs a new contract. If that is signed and sealed before the summer, then it will be one significant piece of business completed before the window opens.",

      "Carrick has engineered an impressive turnaround at Old Trafford and United are now firmly in the box seat in the race for Champions League football next season. The 44-year-old's impressive start since being appointed head coach until the end of the season is also putting him in contention to get the job on a long-term basis.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Fernandes gave the impression he would be happy to see Carrick stay on after the win against Spurs. It extended the former midfielder's record in the job to six wins and a draw from seven games, having stood in as caretaker for three matches in November 2021 after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked.",
      "During that run, Fernandes told Carrick that he thought he would make a great manager. Now back at Old Trafford, he is proving that prophecy right. United are conducting what they describe as a \"thorough process\" to appoint their next head coach and although Carrick is refusing to get carried away, he is putting himself in the frame.",
      "Asked about Fernandes' comments ahead of the trip to West Ham, he insisted there was more to achieve this season before any thoughts turn to staying on.",

      "Carrick is repeating his mantra of not getting carried away by the start he is enjoying at Old Trafford. He engineered a similar upturn in form when he was appointed Middlesbrough boss in October 2022, winning 16 of his first 23 games, but his side fell short in the play-offs.",
      "Despite his cool persona, Carrick is trying to enjoy the highs of winning and ride the emotion that comes with those successes, but he knows there is more to do if United are to return to the Champions League next season.",
      "\"It's a really easy thing to say, and listen, part of it, you've got to enjoy the buzz of winning. That's what we're in it for,\" he said.",
      "\"You've got to manage the highs of it and you've got to enjoy initially the feeling of winning a game. You can't just be flat-lined the whole time, but certainly going into the next game, you've got to then regroup and prepare again for what's next.",
      "\"You definitely take the confidence and the feeling from the games that you've had knowing you can go into the next game with a little bit more feel-good factor about it, but I guess the big challenge is knowing what's got you there and all the hard work and the preparation and then what it takes to win a game of football at this level is tough, so never assuming the next one's just going to be alright.",
      "\"But you've still got to allow yourself to feel the little bits and waves of emotion with it. It’s all a little bit boring and pointless if you didn't really to be honest, winning games is what we're all striving for.\"",

      "Luke Shaw believes Michael Carrick's understanding of Manchester United has been crucial to improving results. United claimed their fourth successive Premier League win against Tottenham last weekend.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes got on the scoresheet. Spurs made a promising start to the match, but Cristian Romero's sending off in the 29th minute saw the game swing in United's favour.",
      "United are in fourth position in the Premier League, five points clear of Liverpool in sixth. Carrick has made a huge impact since his appointment as interim head coach last month, winning all of his games so far, and Shaw provided insight into the changes he's made when he spoke after beating Tottenham.",

      "Speaking to talkSPORT, Shaw said: \"He's made lots of difference. But for me, the biggest one is he knows the club, and he knows exactly what's needed to win football matches, to make everyone happy and to enjoy what we're doing.",
      "\"He's, of course, won a lot when he was here as a player. So he understands the club, and I think that's the biggest thing for me. He knows how to get the best out of the players, and he's really doing that.",
      "\"Of course, winning football matches is always going to make everyone feel better, and the confidence is at a real high. We can't take our foot off the pedal. We just have to keep going and keep pushing each other.\"",
      "When asked whether it was Carrick's understanding of how United should play that had made the difference, Shaw responded: \"No, everything, it's everything. Of course, the culture is extremely important, and day in, day out, how we are as a team, how the mentality is, how the focus is.",
      "\"How we push each other day in, day out, that's one thing Carrick has brought it, and I think everyone's just really enjoying themselves at the moment. You see how important not just the starting XI are, it's the ones that are coming off the bench as well, making an impact.",
      "\"Even when we score in the celebrations, it's not just the players on the pitch. It's the ones on the bench that are running around and celebrating, too. And I think that shows a real togetherness.",
      "\"And I think when we're together like that, it's a real strong bond, and we go out on the pitch and we all fight for each other and everyone's really together, and of course it always helps.\"",
      "Shaw added that the team's attention will quickly turn to facing West Ham in London on Tuesday night. The Irons have struggled this season, but they have won three of their last four league matches. West Ham are three points adrift of safety.",

      "Michael Carrick congratulates Kobbie Mainoo as he comes off during Manchester United's 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur(Image: Mike Morese/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "It is hard to believe that Kobbie Mainoo could have been on his way out of Old Trafford last month. Mainoo attempted to force an exit to gain more minutes but his plea fell on deaf ears. The 20-year-old had to knuckle down and hope for a change in fortunes. Fortunately, that change came in January.",
      "Amorim's outburst at Leeds would be the final nail in the coffin for him as he was sacked less than 24 hours later. The following week, Michael Carrick was appointed. United have since gone on to win four games in a row with Mainoo starting all of them.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Remarkably, Mainoo has shown few signs of rustiness upon his return to the starting line-up and has become a crucial player for the Reds. While his individual performances have rightly been heralded, Carrick's message post-Tottenham suggests United need to be careful with their transfer business in the summer to keep the momentum going with Mainoo.",
      "\"That's going to help him develop, learn the game and playing next to Case, and learning off him, things that he's probably not even realising he's picking up,\" Carrick said. \"Just playing next to him as well as the other players around him - I think that's just part of his journey to learn and develop.\"",
      "It is easy to forget that Mainoo is still one of the youngest players in the squad. He has enjoyed more exposure with United and England than most players could even dream of, but he is still in the development stage of his career. That is why United need to be very careful in the next summer transfer window as they look to overhaul their midfield.",
      "Casemiro will be departing the club at the end of his contract. While that is the right decision for all involved, it does mean United are losing someone who Carrick believes is mentoring Mainoo without the youngster even knowing it. The direct replacement for Casemiro will be a much younger player with a high ceiling.",
      "Brighton's Carlos Baleba has been on the United radar since last summer and remains on it despite a difficult campaign to date. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson are also highly rated by those at Old Trafford. But those players do not boast a wealth of experience playing at the highest level, and Mainoo needs a mentor to help him reach his full potential.",
      "If United do sign one of Baleba, Wharton or Anderson to strengthen their midfield, they also need to add a more experienced head who they and Mainoo can learn from.",
      "The risk with allowing Casemiro to leave was the fact there are few midfielders with his experience - not only in the Premier League but in European football. It still remains the right call to allow the Brazilian to depart but Carrick has reminded United just how important it is to not completely sacrifice experience as they rebuild their midfield this summer.",

We did it once, it didn't work out, but this one was the most important.\"",
      "When asked to clarify whether it was Michael Carrick, or a member of the backroom staff who practised the routine in training, Mbeumo said: \"It was Jonny Evans who was coming to me and the guys.\"",
      "Carrick also highlighted Kaita Hasegawa's role in the corner routine during his post-match press conference. Hasegawa is an important member of the first-team analyst team.",

      "Carrick's family moment",
      "Anyone who has kept a close eye on Carrick during matches will have noticed his calm demeanour. He rarely shows emotion and stays remarkably composed, but there is a release when United score.",
      "Carrick passionately fist-pumped when Mbeumo fired United into the lead at the end of the first half, and he turned around on the touchline to look at his family celebrating in the directors' box.",
      "The 44-year-old has season tickets at Old Trafford with his family, meaning he attended a few games before his appointment, but his wife and children now have a better view in the directors' box.",
      "Carrick's son Jacey was spotted in the away end at Arsenal last month. Carrick has spoken about how much United means to him. He was raised in Newcastle and spent time in London with West Ham and Tottenham, but he has spent his most cherished years in Manchester.",
      "There may be more special years to come at Old Trafford for Carrick. It's still too early to say whether he should be given the job on a permanent basis, but he couldn't have made a better start.",
      "Casemiro enjoyed the goal",
      "Casemiro was so chuffed with Fernandes' late goal to wrap up the victory that he attempted to persuade Senne Lammens to celebrate with the team in the corner by the Stretford End.",
      "Casemiro shared a warm embrace with Lisandro Martinez before waving his hands to gesture to Lammens to join in with his teammates. The goalkeeper briefly thought about it, jogging to the halfway line, but decided to resist the temptation.",
      "Lammens is sensible and level-headed. He knew the job wasn't done yet and didn't want to get ahead of himself by joining in with the celebrations. Andre Onana, his predecessor, did not have that perspective.",
      "The unsung analyst",
      "United are the strongest team from set-pieces this season, having recorded the highest number of goals scored per 100 set-plays. Arsenal have earned a reputation as being prolific from set-pieces, but United have a better record from fewer of them, and they scored from a beautiful routine against Spurs.",
      "Fernandes played the corner short to Mainoo, who found Mbeumo in the box. There was still plenty for the Cameroon international to do - and his finish into the bottom right corner was sublime.",
      "Carlos Fernandes looked after set-pieces when Ruben Amorim was in charge. Fernandes came onto the touchline every time United won a set-piece, but Carrick's backroom staff remained seated.",
      "It's understood set-pieces are a collective responsibility among the current coaching staff, however, perhaps Kaita Hasgawa deserves another mention for doing important work behind the scenes.",
      "Amorim namedropped Hasgawa as someone who deserved praise for improving set-pieces and helping to tactically prepare for the opponent. Hasegawa's position has not been described as senior, but he was recruited from Everton after seven years in Merseyside, and is thought to play an important role.",
      "Hasgawa sat with the analyst team beside the press box against Tottenham. The analysts would have taken great satisfaction from another set-piece goal, especially after a corner routine that was so well-worked.",
      "Stretford End jeers",
      "The Romero red card changed the complexion of the game. The contest had flowed well and Tottenham looked dangerous, but Romero could have no complaints when Michael Oliver showed him a straight red.",
      "The challenge on Casemiro was reckless and the Brazilian looked in a world of pain when he slumped to the turf. Thomas Frank tried to reason with the fourth official, but had no serious case to overturn it.",
      "The Stretford End chanted Casemiro's name while he received treatment, but their attention turned to Romero as he returned to the dressing room. \"Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio,\" fans taunted as Romero walked off.",
      "Romero slammed Tottenham's board for their lack of investment when the January transfer window closed, but the Spurs captain only had himself to blame for his side's defeat.",
      "The classy Munich tributes",
      "It was the 68th anniversary of the Munich Air Disaster on Friday. United held a memorial service at Old Trafford, and there were further tributes from fans in the Stretford End before the Totttenham game.",
      "United fans unfurled a \"Busby Babes\" banner in the upper tier of the stand, which was followed by a \"we'll never die\" banner being unfurled in the lower tier. Carrick laid a wreath on the pitch alongside Frank.",
      "The players wore black armbands, and Fernandes wore a special captain's armband to pay tribute to the tragedy. Most wouldn't have seen the Munich clock attached to Fernandes' arm. \"Stand up for the Busby Babes,\" was aired in the first half, and thousands of supporters rose to their feet.",
      "United show their class with their tributes each year to the Munich Air Disaster. Fernandes attended the memorial service on the day before the game, and the armband he wore was a nice touch.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Six clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and could make another change.",
      "The pressure has eased on West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo while Eddie Howe pushed Thomas Frank over the edge as he took his own step back, while duff results on Wednesday night have pushed Oliver Glasner, Fabian Hurzeler and Sean Dyche closer to the brink as the relegation fight becomes a battle royale.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom really could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",
      "Rankings based on the latest best prices available at Oddschecker.com…",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 13 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford didn’t dampen spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Nine wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 2024/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from three games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "A sticky run has brought that talk to an end. There’s obviously no shame in not managing to stick around as unlikely title challengers for longer, but some frustration at the manner in which their charge has been halted. Home defeats to Everton and Brentford, given the fortress Villa Park had become, is a bit of a limp end to a game old fight.",
      "But they’re still very much on course for another crack at the Champions League with an eight-point lead over an unconvincing Liverpool in sixth, and they’ve also qualified unfussily for the last 16 of a very winnable Europa League. It’s all still an astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… okay? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Lost four in a row after that, but did leave Nottingham Forest with a funny 0-0 draw after their hosts rained down 35 unsuccessful shots at Jose Sa’s goal. Should now beat Derby’s infamous 11-point record – they have nine points with a near guarantee of at least three more to come because they still have a game against Spurs in their locker – and after that Edwards’ primary role has always been about what happens next season rather than this.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season and Villa now sorted out home, away and in the Carabao, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances.",
      "Completing the double over a Newcastle side that also chucked them all the money for Wissa is magnificent. That Brentford now sit cosily in Europe-adjacent upper mid-table, 10 points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures, even more so.",
      "",
      "Remained powerfully unsackable even in the depths of one of those long forlorn runs of relegation form that Bournemouth have oft indulged in under Iraola. And now they’re back doing the other thing they do after dramatic 3-2 wins over Spurs and Liverpool and victory over Wolves and Everton.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, then, but with relegation a distant memory after the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer he remains firmly in credit and back in contention for all the many ridiculous Big Six jobs that are or will be available during the summer.",
      "Has ruled himself out of Spurs contention as he has apparently set his sights higher. Ergo, an intelligent man.",
      "",
      "It was quite a 2025 for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, 2026 has seen another huge swing in Nuno’s fortunes. For neither the first nor last time, Tottenham came to the rescue. The momentum from a job-saving win at Spurs was parlayed into an even more impressive win over Sunderland and, despite the horrific late gut-punch, there was enough about the defeat at Chelsea to suggest the Hammers can at least drag some of the other stupid teams into the equation.",
      "Nuno and West Ham essentially relegated Burnley with a win at Turf Moor and suddenly, it’s not all so negative at the London Stadium where the delicious prospect grows of not only securing survival for themselves but relegating Tottenham in the process.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other team pulls the trigger.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin; getting slapped silly a second time by Arsenal suggests maybe not.",
      "February is a huge month for Leeds and Farke in the league. Smashing Nottingham Forest in a proper blood-and-thunder six-pointer was huge and they are clearly more upwardly mobile right now than other teams around them in the table.",
      "Almost certainly not going down, and that is almost certainly enough for Farke.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa had Howe once again under fire before a tame surrender at Liverpool.",
      "The home defeat to Brentford confirms Newcastle’s slump back into mid-table and had Howe under some notable pressure before Dr Tottenham turned up with the usual cure.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the last international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "A fine run after the November international break pulled Silva back from the brink and Fulham clear of the relegation scrap, but they’ve now lost four of their last five in the Premier League.",
      "And with Spurs needing a manager, maybe some people think he will walk. We would strongly urge against it, but the lure of even a big club as tarnished as Spurs can be significant.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth.",
      "An impressive win over Newcastle eased the pressure, but that ludicrous conclusion to the Man City game puts Slot firmly back in the spotlight. A win at Sunderland in a midweek round where the mounting chaos on and off the pitch in the relegation fight has taken much of the focus was most welcome.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down. Palace are currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They have only one win in their last 14 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "A big storyline this season has been teams carelessly succumbing to The Drift and slipping out the back of the big mid-table gang and into real trouble.",
      "Bournemouth have done it but turned it round. Tottenham have done it and are still in deep sh*t. Palace have done it and are also still in bother despite beating Brighton who are suddenly on a 13-game Premier League run where their only win was against Burnley at home.",
      "Their next three league games are against high-flying Brentford, a six-pointer against Forest, and table-toppers Arsenal. Hmm.",
      "",
      "Has done as much as could reasonably be expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "Victory at Brentford gave Forest and Dyche a bit of breathing space despite West Ham’s recent improvements, but it does look like we’ve got a big ol’ multi-team battle to avoid one relegation spot and that is going to make everyone twitchy. Losing at Leeds a day before West Ham beat Burnley is not the best weekend.",
      "Drawing 0-0 at home to Wolves in a game where you have 35 fruitless pot shots on goal is enough to drive anyone to distraction, and the very obvious sounds of fan frustration aren’t what anyone wants to hear when their fate lies in the hands of Mr Marinakis.",
      "Thomas Frank is no longer manager of Tottenham Hotspur; but who will replace him in the job?",
      "Step one on the guide to how to be a football manager must say don’t keep talking about your club’s biggest rivals being really good.",
      "Former Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson reckons Spurs need a Harry Redknapp-style appointment if they go down the interim boss route.",
      "Tottenham parted ways with Thomas Frank after a dramatic decision was taken at half‑time of their bruising defeat to Newcastle United.",
      "Haircuts that are not happening, manager sackings that are happening. It’s been a frantic old morning in the rollercoaster world of football in big 2026.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has revealed four potential managers who could succeed Thomas Frank at Tottenham after his sacking on Wednesday."

      "Good lord, you lot need to crack a smile once in a while.",

      "The headline reads like someone’s died: ‘Man Utd fan’s viral haircut challenge is exposing modern society’s hollowness.’ Really?",
      "The gist seems to be: Frank is an attention-grabbing shill who’s made a quick quid off Manchester United’s general ineptitude, and that this is some heinous crime that debases “proper” football fans. Then there’s the sneering bit about the people who enjoy it being the kind who “openly admit they haven’t read a book in years.” For what it’s worth, I think it’s harmless fun and I’ve just finished reading Ulysses.",
      "And the “Big Business is ruining something that could have been spontaneous” handwringing doesn’t really hold up when the piece is published on sites owned by a major media group. If you’re happy to take their money, maybe ease off the moral panic about someone else cashing in on a viral gag.",
      "Football is light entertainment. It’s pantomime. That’s why it’s fun. It’s a distraction from work, kids, and our partners complaining the washing isn’t done right. Who cares if a silly man made a silly buck off the silliest big club in the country being spectacularly rubbish?",

      "Football fans don’t normally look through things with the clearest of eyes considering the primal nature it brings out in all of us, so the calls for Slot to be sacked are not surprising despite still being absolutely premature.",
      "The wonder Slot performed last season was always heightened by the fact that he signed no one after taking the reins and won the league with the same squad as he inherited from Klopp (Chiesa doesn’t count, we know that).",
      "Fast forward to this season after a huge summer outlay and people are using the reverse argument – tons spent and doing worse. Surely a sackable offense. But people are (conveniently when you’re an opposition supporter) forgetting he took in around 250m from player sales from Diaz, Nunez, Quansah, Kelleher etc and also lost another 100mil plus in market value in Trent and the tragic death of Jota.",
      "Slot replaced each loss with the exception of Diaz so by my count they have a smaller core squad than they did at the start of last season. Add to that fact the injuries they’ve had:",
      "Salah gone at AFCON.",
      "Isak has played total 400 or so minutes and is on his 3rd spell out",
      "Right-back slot is cursed for injuries by Trent leaving sort of like when Voldemort was refused the defence against the dark arts job at Hogwarts.",
      "Then Macca, Ekitike, Gakpo and Allison have all had their spells on the sidelines.",
      "Also I don’t believe in any conspiracies but Liverpool’s luck this season with decisions is something that makes me wonder about unseen forces like Jedi power. Look at some of the games they’ve dropped points in:",
      "Palace – this is the game that started the rot after the great start. Palace score from a corner that was never a corner for their first. I get it, it was hard for the ref to see so let’s just chalk it off as bad luck. Palace then score the winner with the clock at 96:59 when there was 6 mins added time – how in **** was that possible. But yea OK just one of those days where both the opposition goals shouldn’t have stood.",
      "Utd – second game after Palace and their opening goal should never have happened as Macca had a head injury and ended up needing 4 stitches but yea just bad luck the ref never blew like he’s meant to. Just one of those days. Liverpool proceed to be far better for the rest of the game missing sitters and slab head wins it against the run of play.",
      "Brentford – very next game in the league and Brentford get given the most dubious penalty ive ever seen. The one where literally no Brentford player was looking for it and the VAR had to guess whether or not a foul by VVD was on the penalty box line, which of course they guessed it was. Brentford win by 1.",
      "Guess what game comes two matches after? The loss to City. We all know pool were being out played but we all know VVD had a perfectly good goal disallowed to level it.",
      "And sure let’s go straight to the game at the wknd against City where Guehi should have seen red….or at least very possibly could have.",
      "Point is when it is ‘could’ and not absolutely ‘should’ – these have went the oppositions way 100% of the time this season and more often than not decided the outcome.",
      "Lastly – individual errors. For all the rotten luck with ref calls and injuries, Liverpool have made some insane individual errors this season. Earlier it was Konate and Kerkez, both of whom have kind of cut that out (especially Kerkez who has been great lately). But VVD and Allison are weighing in with their own as well. Whats more, they get punished with a goal it seems on every single error. They get away with nothing",
      "My point is – none of the above is Slot’s fault. Maybe the individual errors if an argument is to be made that his tactics are putting players in bad spots but I don’t personally buy it. The performances lately have deserved far more point than they have received. Slot can’t force Ekitike to stop missing headers, although he can stop playing Gakpo who is a level of useless I don’t think I’ve ever seen before in a red shirt.",
      "Oh yea – opposition score with their first chance of the game pretty much 100% of the time.",
      "God I hope the new manager bounce is now over for Chelsea and Utd.\nPatricio Del Toro (I’ve half typed out this ranty email about 3 times this season but I can’t bottle it up any longer, please God, Arsenal, beat City to the league)",
      "",
      "…While I’m completely in agreement that Slot hasn’t done well enough this season I’m unsure if a lot of the recent criticism stacks up.",
      "1. Playing your best midfielder as a defender shows you don’t care about results. Despite being a bit hyperbolic – I’m sure no manager doesn’t care about results – it’s not mad to see a CM playing at fullback. City and Arsenal have both done it to great effect in recent seasons. Trent was in many ways more of a midfielder for us than a pure defender and having someone with a similar range of passing and licence to drift infield makes a lot of sense tactically, especially when our first two choices at RB are out.",
      "2. Moving away from focus on Salah is a mistake. He’s 33 and we have to move on from him some time. Surely now is the time to start putting that in place? Just waiting until he leaves and then hoping to somehow replace a top 5 PL player of all time isn’t exactly a better option, surely? That will have been agreed across the whole leadership group, not as Slot selling bullshit to the board.",
      "3. Slot doesn’t trust youth. This is basically because he’s sold Morton, Quansah and Elliott and isn’t starting Rio despite Gakpo’s form.\nMorton is doing well for the team in 3rd in Ligue Un, but he’s not realistically going to start ahead of Grav or Macca and didn’t want to stay to be on the bench at his age Elliott isn’t going to be ahead of Sbo or Wirtz and also wanted the opportunity for game time and Quansah wasn’t going to be ahead of Ibou or VVD and also wanted game time – he was replaced by Leoni who looked great before doing his knee and would doubtless have played more this season had he been fit.",
      "I get that everyone wants Rio to play more, with people saying he should be coming in when we’re leading comfortably – the issue is that has barely happened this season. When he’s started he’s been ok but he’s just turned 17 and isn’t going to be running games at that age.",
      "4. He only won the league because of Klopp. The obvious question is why didn’t Klopp win the league the season he left then? Slot changed the tactics around the positioning of Grav and Salah which allowed them to both have their best seasons for us while also making us a lot more solid at the back than we had been for a while. Of the 41 goals we conceded (same as Klopp’s last season) 9 were in the final four games after we’d won the league. Before then we were on for our best season since 21/22.",
      "We haven’t been good enough this season for a number of reasons (fitness, second balls, set pieces, integration of new players as a start) and I expect that Slot will go at the end of the season, but some of the statements have been more driven by dislike of him as a person (because results are bad) than anything else.\nTom, Andover (watch us lose to Sunderland in the 95th minute this time)",

      "A modern TV broadcasters camera will record at 50fps (frames per second) which means there 0.02 seconds between each image the camera catches. In that time a premier league player travelling at 8 or 9 metres per second could travel about 16cm. This means that if the camera is paused just one frame too late, (and remember there are 50 frames each second so this is probably preety likely) the resulting position of the player could be up to 16cm out of his true position when the ball was played. That is far more than the distance of one kneecap",
      "I’m not suggesting we should expect perfection but rather that, if imperfection isnt actually guaranteed we ought to do away with VAR for offside decisions and go back to trusting/shouting at the linesman. There is just as much speculation about decisions as there was before but in the meantime, it ruins the flow of the game and we are objectively not getting a better spectacle. It isn’t producing more scientifically accurate decisions and it’s just shit. I do believe we should keep the hawkeye technology for goalline decisions and VAR can hang around too to check serious fouls and stuff but it hasn’t improved the enjoyment of the game in any way and at the end of the day, this is an entertainment industry. So please F365, start a serious campaign to remove this inaccurate stain from our game.",

      "The following is a rundown of the clubs a Premier League coach faced last before losing their job, and the respective managers who were in charge of them. Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",
      "On the rare occasion a manager left his post after winning, we will take into account their most recent defeat; we only want results so damaging that the manager in question had to go soon after. To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester, will be used. Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",
      "",
      "From Ron Atkinson, who induced the first managerial sacking in Premier League history when Chelsea axed Ian Porterfield after a 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa in February 1993, to Daniel Farke, who helped force Manchester United’s hand when Ruben Amorim finally spoke himself out of a job in January 2026, 60 different coaches have proven to be the last straw for one Premier League manager.",

      "United‘s unbeaten run looked to be coming to an end as they toiled against the in-form Hammers but Sesko scored an incredible flick to level in the 96th minute.",
      "After the game, interim boss Carrick suggested Sesko was a player who always showed he was capable of scoring goals like that.",
      "“It’s an unbelievable finish from the angle to generate that, to get it on target, to finish it, it’s some goal from him,” Carrick said.",
      "“He’s capable of that, Ben, he’s done it all the time, it’s not that he’s just suddenly burst on the scene, he’s proven that he can score goals as well.",
      "“He’s been doing it in training for us as well, so it’s not surprising.",
      "“It’s what he does, it’s what he’s good at, but certainly to actually do it and to feel it, as I said, the last one would have done him the world of good, the winner.",
      "“Tonight, a little bit different with the emotion of the game, but certainly important and a big moment for him and us.”",
      "Sesko started the game from the bench, as he has done for 10 of his 21 league appearances this year, and when asked if that goal earned the Slovenian a starting spot, Carrick kept his cards close to his chest but did suggest he was “ready to kick on.”",
      "“The boys have done fantastically well, who have played as well, so that’s the importance of the whole group and the importance of the squad,” Carrick said.",

      "“So there’s a balance, but certainly when he came on the pitch, he made a big difference.”",
      "Sesko himself said he was happy with the goal but explained that a lack of intensity may be behind why United failed to win the game.",
      "“I’m happy with my finish, but yeah, I’m not so happy with the draw, because I know we deserve the win, because we were fighting.",

      "In perhaps the most Sacked In The Morning a manager has ever been, Nuno was officially relieved of his duties at about quarter past midnight on September 9.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Brentford, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 22 with three more games each.",
      "Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Fulham were only selected once more – on the March midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (26 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £21.8m in 2024/25",
      "=2nd) Newcastle and Spurs (25 games) – worth around £20.9m",

      "But for all the damage he caused at Manchester United, nothing Amorim did was half as bad as the sackable offence that is Michael Carrick allowing the tiresome haircut grift to persist.",
      "At least the Portuguese never even vaguely teased achieving that seemingly gargantuan feat of stitching together five consecutive wins of association football with a squad assembled at an absurd expense. The most Amorim ever mustered was three; Carrick surpassed that within 24 days of an appointment which can no longer ever be made permanent beyond the end of the season.",
      "After dispatching Manchester City and Arsenal, overcoming Fulham and staring at the clown car crash that is Spurs while driving past at the wheel on his way to a fourth consecutive victory, Carrick has come unstuck at that least adhesive of obstacles: West Ham at the London Stadium.",
      "That is unfair on Nuno Espirito Santo’s rapidly improving team, whose non-coincidental transformation since the arrival of Paco Jemez had another victory snatched away in the fifth minute of a slightly ridiculous stoppage time.",
      "West Ham had defended a well-earned lead with relative ease, barely conceding a single chance of note after Tomas Soucek’s opener in the 50th minute.",
      "Casemiro had a goal disallowed from an exceptional Mainoo cross for a marginal offside, but Manchester United were otherwise entirely familiarly bereft of inspiration against a low block.",
      "Then mild carnage ensued as the hosts decided they might as well try and exploit some of the swathes of space left behind by an increasingly desperate team.",
      "Callum Wilson led two breaks and should have scored from at least one. Adama Traore had a chance to end things on the counter. Joshua Zirkzee almost scored from a Bruno Fernandes cross. Benjamin Sesko very much did, expertly diverting a Bryan Mbeumo delivery into the only corner of the net Mads Hermansen would have been unable to reach in time.",
      "It was a game played on West Ham’s terms, but also on the condition that Manchester United could introduce more than £100m worth of strikers from the bench to have the desired impact, because up to that point they had tried nothing and were all out of ideas.",
      "That in itself is one of the more basic ticks against Carrick’s name: when chasing a result he shifted to three at the back, but only swapped one of his centre-halves – due to injury – and brought on two strikers, one for a full-back.",
      "The worst performance he has ever overseen as a break-glass-and-phone-Fergie-in-case-of-emergency Manchester United manager still delivered a point.",
      "The bar against which he is judged remains painfully low, but this was an entirely fine point away at a team which has discovered a blueprint more than capable of securing survival.",
      "This West Ham side will not go down playing like this, especially while Nottingham Forest and Spurs display clear symptoms of post-Ange stress disorder by wedding themselves so inexorably to the Australian’s failing successors.",
      "The Hammers, of all teams, will not subscribe to the Too Good To Go Down school of thought even with Jarrod Bowen, Mateus Fernandes and Crysencio Summerville in their ranks. But when they are in direct competition for positions with teams Too Bad To Stay Up, it is difficult to envisage a fall into the Championship.",
      "Had they held on it would not have been undeserved, but Manchester United’s equaliser came on merit too.",

      "But it’s not the only pig-headed foolishness to engulf the Premier League this season. It’s one of precisely five pig-headed foolishnesses to engulf the Premier League this season.",
      "And these are they.",
      "",
      "The numbers are hilariously stark.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo started none of Manchester United’s first 21 Premier League games this season, of which they won only eight.",
      "He has started all four of Manchester United’s last four Premier League games, of which they have won all four.",
      "Mainoo has already played more Premier League minutes this season for Michael Carrick than he did for Ruben Amorim. The longest appearance with which he was trusted by the former boss was a whole second half against Burnley in August when he replaced the injured Mason Mount at the break.",
      "Other than that, he subsisted on cameos. Thirteen minutes here. Seven minutes there. Twenty-four minutes against Brentford if he was lucky.",
      "It never really made a lot of sense, especially as a) United’s results were frequently cack and b) their midfield was a notable point of weakness with Manuel Ugarte struggling and Casemiro still often playing from (an admittedly impressive) memory.",
      "Had Amorim not gone up in flames and torched himself out of the Man United job, it’s likely Mainoo wouldn’t even be at United right now. He’d be off on loan somewhere in Serie A or Ligue 1 or some other such indignity.",
      "Instead, he’s been perhaps the key ingredient in Michael Carrick’s astonishing straightforward United revolution in which his masterplan has, distilled to its essence, involved picking his best available players in their best positions.",
      "It always sounds like a back-handed compliment when put like that, but it really isn’t. The fact what Carrick has done looks simple and obvious isn’t his fault; he deserves credit for spotting that overcomplication was the problem here and seeking to remedy it.",
      "But watching Mainoo get better with every passing post-Amorim game, to the point on Saturday lunchtime when he was effortlessly running the game against an admittedly awful and self-sabotaging Spurs, it was impossible not to feel that all of it just damns Amorim entirely.",
      "United fans should at least be grateful that Amorim huffed his way out of the job before it was all too late. Thomas Tuchel probably feels similarly.",
      "",
      "In a rare moment of foresight, we saw this one coming. The way Forest ended last season. The way Mr Marinakis spent the summer bristling with main character energy over the European competition saga and the Morgan Gibbs-White saga and winning out in both those sagas always spelled trouble for Nuno.",
      "Anything other than a fast start to the season was going to see Mr Marinakis search once again for that unmatchable high of being front and centre in everything.",
      "An opening-day win over Brentford sent entirely misleading signals about both teams’ trajectories, but it mattered not. The die had been cast over the closing months of 24/25 and the summer, despite Nuno signing a new contract in June.",
      "Two winless games and further disgruntlement and disagreement over transfer dealings and more was all it took. Nuno didn’t survive the first interlull of the season, and was replaced by Ange Postecoglou in Mr Marinakis’ second refusal to accept the objective reality of the world around him.",
      "He does score some points for at least wising up to that one pretty quick-smart and taking his Dycheball medicine.",
      "But it could all still end in relegation and has already led to a needless squandering of so much progress, momentum and goodwill built up last season.",
      "",
      "We’re tempted to include Frank himself and the media here, because while Spurs fans have been noisily sh*tting themselves for several weeks now it really does only now seem to have hit home with some that this is a club on its arse and facing a very real relegation battle for which it seems ill-suited and entirely unprepared.",
      "Matt Law in today’s Telegraph has breathlessly declared that if Spurs don’t beat Newcastle tonight they might ‘soon’ have to accept relegation is a realistic prospect. If by ‘soon’ he in fact means several weeks ago, perhaps during a window in which it is possible to procure more players for a squad ravaged by injuries and its own stupidity, then he’s absolutely bang on.",
      "Spurs have won two Premier League games since October. We really aren’t at all sure how the reality that has been clear for so long is only now sneaking up on Frank’s adoring media fanboys.",
      "He’s also spent at least the last two months talking complete and utter bollocks about windmills and encouraging performances and saying things like “if you keep the ball out of the net then you have a better chance of winning” to nods of appreciation from the waiting press pack.",
      "We don’t know how he’s fooled them, but we have a better idea about how he’s fooled the new broom at Spurs. Because the people now in day-to-day charge of a post-Levy Spurs appear to be – and we don’t wish to be unkind here – idiots, nepo-babies and fools.",
      "They had their wallets thoroughly inspected by Fabio Paratici, who was supposed to be staying on at Spurs for the rest of the January transfer window (no further signings) before starting his new job at Fiorentina (five further signings).",
      "We’ve already seen this season that on-field results can be truly catastrophic without bothering big-club suits, as long as you’re willing to accept your place and not speak out. Neither Ruben Amorim nor Enzo Maresca can have too many complaints about being cast out by United and Chelsea, but the offences that ultimately did for them were incredibly small and twatty.",
      "Frank has cast an increasingly foolish figure this season, frequently not on top of his brief in press conferences at all, failing to spot he was using an Arsenal-branded coffee cup at Bournemouth and, yes, just saying increasingly stupid things.",
      "But he’s smart enough never to criticise the fragile egos of the clown-car operation now in charge of this football club.",
      "The extraordinary thing isn’t that Spurs could very possibly get relegated; the extraordinary thing is that they’ve done absolutely nothing to address a prospect that has grown alarmingly more real with every passing game.",
      "We’ve stopped even calling Spurs games El Sackicos now. We don’t even think defeat to Newcastle tonight would be enough. Nor would defeat to Arsenal in their next league game.",
      "We’re not even certain that dropping into the bottom three itself – a prospect that is now just three games away – would do it.",
      "We feel like we’re taking crazy pills.",
      "",
      "Can Dominik Szoboszlai play right-back? Yes. Should Dominik Szoboszlai play right-back? Ideally no.",
      "He’s an excellent footballer and, like many excellent footballers, he is capable of doing a serviceable job in an unfamiliar position.",
      "But it’s become far too much of a go-to option for an increasingly unmoored Arne Slot in an increasingly strife-addled Liverpool season.",
      "There’s a real sense here of Slot trying to bottle lightning, trying to recapture something that has been lost.",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold was brilliant at being a right-back-cum-playmaker so it’s understandable for Slot to try and recreate that magic by putting another supremely talented playmaker there.",
      "But it really isn’t that simple. If it was, then everyone would do it.",
      "The situation came to a head, of course, on Sunday. But this has all been brewing up for some time now.",
      "Slot’s hand has been forced slightly by a shortage of available options, but crowbarring a very capable attacking midfielder into the right-back role has been a double victory for silliness, lessening Liverpool’s attacking capabilities while increasing defensive vulnerability.",
      "Sure, being right-back doesn’t stop him treating 30-yard free-kicks as penalties and that’s all well and good until he’s caught out of position to play everyone onside for an equaliser before brainlessly getting himself suspended to prevent a goal that was never going to matter.",
      "He has at least turned a few more people against VAR, so it wasn’t a complete waste. But playing him at right-back absolutely is.",
      "",
      "Palace were right to put their foot down at the end of the summer transfer window and tell Liverpool ‘Sorry, time’s up’ when they came knocking late for Guehi having been distracted for far too long by the shinier if far less necessary Alexander Isak.",
      "Palace’s mistake was in then burying their heads in the sane for the next four months and acting surprised when Glasner was pissed off at the lack of support he and his team were receiving from above.",
      "There are limits to what Palace can do. They were never going to keep Glasner forever any more than they were going to be able to keep Guehi. But for reasons inside and outside their control they have let a once-in-a-lifetime breakthrough season shatter into nothingness, and that all feels a bit unnecessary and careless.",
      "Maybe signing Brennan Johnson and Jorgen Strand Larsen with their three Premier League goals for fellow relegation battlers will solve everything in the end. But we have some doubts.",
      "Would Mauricio Pochettino risk infuriating Donald Trump? Could Ange Postecoglou return to north London? Or will Sam Allardyce or Enzo Maresca rescue Spurs?",
      "Haircuts that are not happening, manager sackings that are happening. It’s been a frantic old morning in the rollercoaster world of football in big 2026.",
      "The Thomas Frank era is over but the former Brentford boss is not the only person to blame for the mess the club is in.",
      "Thomas Frank has now been sacked by Tottenham after poor performance and loss of support; will the same thing happen to Keir Starmer?",
      "This is the season of Premier League bosses being told they’re ‘getting sacked in the morning’. Thomas Frank has bucked the recent trend at Spurs.",
      "At least Ruben Amorim never even vaguely teased he might string together five wins. Michael Carrick should be ashamed for taking Manchester United close"

      "It has been almost exactly three years since Manchester United wanted it known that they were adopting a ‘no dickheads policy’ as a consequence, we can only assume, of something Richard Arnold saw on LinkedIn.",
      "Generally, if you have to spell out such a mandate, you’ve already got a problem. And United certainly did. On the basis of it taking one to know one, the Red Devils should have seen them coming a mile off and, this far down the road, there ought not to be a dickhead in sight.",
      "For the most part, United have weeded them out. The tricky part was not swerving the temptation to recruit more dickheads, but dealing with the dickheads already in their midst.",
      "Defining a dickhead is tricky indeed. Many of those who bang on about dickheads in a professional sport or corporate environment tend to be, well, dickheads.",
      "What Arnold probably encountered during his doomscroll was something inspired by ex-All Blacks mental skills coach Gilbert Enoka, who more than a decade ago characterised dickheads as “people who out themselves ahead of the team, people who think they’re entitled to things or expect the rules to be different for them, people operating deceitfully in the dark, or being unnecessarily loud about their work”.",
      "Enoka, by the way, was last seen working with England’s Ashes squad in Australia, seemingly proving you can’t help them all.",
      "Give Ruben Amorim his dues, though; the ex-United manager might struggle to recognise a functioning game plan but he could pin a dickhead and, if he achieved nothing else – he didn’t – at least last summer he made four of them another club’s problem, if only for a season.",
      "That isn’t to say that the United dressing room is a dickhead-free zone. And nor should it be. All of United’s greatest teams and many of their best-ever players had a bit of the dick about them. But these were dickheads who delivered. It is the dickheads that don’t deliver who must be dodged.",
      "Which brings us to Cristian Romero.",
      "Paul Scholes, like many whose dickhead era really began when he became a podcaster, would ‘love’ United to sign the Tottenham Hotspur captain, fresh off his red card at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "“Do you know what? I love him. I love watching him play football.",
      "“He’s pissed off at Spurs, isn’t he? He doesn’t want to be there. He’s having a go at the crowd, he’s having a go at the board, I think his head has checked out a little bit. But I would love him at Manchester United. I just love his character.”",
      "We love Romero too. He’s great, isn’t he? And what’s most great about him is that he’s Tottenham’s problem when – pardon us for mixing our performance cliches – he just can’t control his dickhead chimp.",
      "The door to that cage was ripped off its hinges on Saturday, when Romero was sent off less than half an hour into Spurs’ defeat to United. His timing, of the tackle and the act itself, was just awful for all involved.",
      "Romero, as Scholes alluded, spent much of the build-up to a big game for Spurs having a pop at his paymasters. You can question his channel of choice, but he made some very fair points. Indeed, in the 29 minutes the captain spent before them, the Spurs fans sang ‘Romero’s right, the board are sh*te’ to endorse his message.",
      "Then Romero completely undermined his own authority by acting the dickhead, putting his studs through Casemiro’s ankle to leave his manager even deeper in the sh*t. And Thomas Frank was already drowning in it.",
      "Frank went out to bat for his captain in the aftermath of a defeat that leaves Tottenham on the same points as relegation battlers. Maybe it’s only a battle if you acknowledge it. Spurs, last year, just chucked in the league season, correctly assuming everyone else was terrible enough that they need not bother. Alarmingly, this season they are actually trying, but so is everyone else.",
      "That doesn’t appear to be of great concern to Romero because, as Scholes points out, the captain has already checked out. Which is sure to have ramifications for Spurs and Frank. And it should when it comes to Romero’s options this summer.",
      "For the sake of whoever is their manager next season, United cannot be among those suitors, in part because of the reasons Scholes himself listed.",
      "The temptation is understandable. Romero is a very, very good central defender with a handy knack in both boxes. And, despite all the evidence to the contrary, Frank says his captain is a ‘young leader’ who will learn.",
      "He’s not catching on quick, though, is he? Romero will be 28 by the start of next season having been a senior pro for a decade, half of which has been spent at Spurs, with 250-plus appearances across Serie A and the Premier League. He has been a World Cup winner for four years and will go to the United States in June with a half-century of Argentina caps.",
      "The penny really ought to have dropped by now.",
      "United, often for the wrong reasons, by now have too much previous when it comes to waiting for expensive dickheads to reform, so they should recognise trouble when they see it in Romero.",
      "He is not a gamble United need to take. They already have one hot-headed Argentina centre-back and partners for Lisandro Martinez are not currently in short supply.",
      "From Romero’s perspective too, it is not a move that makes sense. If the scrutiny at Spurs is a driver in his dickishness, where might the spotlight at United lead him?",
      "Romero is also being linked with Atletico Madrid and, oh yes, that’s the stuff. Diego Simone and Atletico could be perfect for Romero. And if not, it will be even more spectacular still. We will find out what happens when an unstoppable dickhead meets an immovable dickhead.",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid have ‘decided’ to turn to Tottenham Hotspur star Cristian Romero, who is preferred over a ‘ruled out’ Liverpool man.",
      "Former Man Utd midfielder Nicky Butt insists that the Red Devils can win the Premier League next season amid their brilliant form under Michael Carrick.",
      "Scholes says he would ‘love’ Manchester United to sign a ‘p*ssed off’ Tottenham star who has ‘checked out’.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero is ‘hot-headed and impulsive’ – so who should Thomas Frank pass the armband on to? Richarlison…obviously.",
      "Manchester United continue to find beauty in simplicity under Michael Carrick, but Thomas Frank and Cristian Romero surely cannot carry on at Spurs.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur captain Cristian Romero will be banned for four matches after being sent off during his side’s 2-0 loss against Manchester United."

But it is nevertheless mad that another club managed to get itself in a sufficient pickle in the year of someone’s lord 2025 to hand the great man another chance at tweaking some Barclays noses and issuing gravel-throated proclamations about utter woke nonsense.",
      "",
      "Doing brilliant work once you’re in the job doesn’t mean you weren’t still lucky to get it. Carrick is the ultimate DNA appointment, whose undoubted effectiveness comes in large part due to his predecessor having whatever the opposite of club DNA is.",
      "Much of Carrick’s success has been built on righting the obvious wrongs Ruben Amorim was too stubborn to notice or correct. That’s not to knock the (for now) interim manager, but it’s increasingly clear with every passing moment that refusing to pick Kobbie Mainoo for reasons that were small and twatty should have been enough alone to have Amorim sacked and probably deemed in breach of contract for gross negligence.",
      "Carrick has done brilliantly, even if the real quiz comes if/when he’s handed the permanent job, but none of that alters the fact that United would not have looked at the former Middlesbrough manager twice were it not for his storied Old Trafford playing career.",
      "Indeed, we’re not sure any Premier League team outside his other crisis-addled former clubs West Ham and Spurs would have done so.",

      "Finds himself competing with Mikel Arteta and Regis Le Bris for manager of the year honours having lifted a relegation-tipped Brentford team that appeared to have lost everything in the summer to the European battle, sitting a single goal behind champions Liverpool after 25 games and a full 10 points clear of their former manager’s new squeeze.",
      "Andrews, clearly, has the right stuff and is doing a wonderful job. But the credentials with which he got that job remain staggeringly slight. Brentford deserve huge credit for the lemonade they have made from life’s lemons, but it really was a monumental gamble to entrust their Premier League survival to a man who had never managed a single game of senior football and had only even been a Premier League coach for a single season, working as Thomas Frank’s set-piece coach.",
      "Watching Tottenham play what is still we suppose technically association football this season, it occurs to us that set-piece coach might actually be Frank’s true calling. Maybe Andrews can give him a gig next year.",
      "",
      "Right-place-at-the-right-timing your way into the Brentford job is one thing, but parachuting yourself into the Chelsea job that way is quite another.",
      "Especially when, in the most modern football way imaginable, the right place to be to get fast-tracked into an elite Premier League job is in fact on the banks of the Rhine on the France-Germany border.",
      "We have reached a tipping point here, haven’t we? Club DNA was one thing. Knowing The Club was one thing. We’re now firmly in the territory of Multi-Club Football Group DNA, of nodding and going, ‘See, this guy just gets this Multi-Club Football Group’ despite your only permanent managerial gig before joining that shadowy organisation being the six months you spent not quite getting Hull City into the play-offs.",

      "It’s Eddie Howe vs Thomas Frank in El Sackico, while the visit of Leeds to Stamford Bridge offers the opportunity for an imperfect but stark comparison between Liam Rosenior and his predecessor.",
      "Meanwhile, Evangelos Marinakis will surely welcome a fourth Nottingham Forest boss should Sean Dyche lose to Wolves and will Kobbie Mainoo finally have a bad game? Almost certainly not.",
      "",
      "We wonder if defeat to a 15th-placed Tottenham side sliding into a relegation battle after two wins in 16 games might be enough for Eddie Howe to believe he is in fact not the right man for the job after insisting he would “step aside” if he believed that to be the case.",
      "Aston Villa and Liverpool are acceptable defeats, Brentford at St James’ Park less so; add that run of three losses to another one against Thomas Frank’s Tottenham and most of the remaining #HoweIn Toon fans would surely turn against a manager who undoubtedly has a difficult job in manoeuvring a shallow squad to compete on what was four fronts until last week, but is also definitely now failing to get anything close to the best out of the vast majority of his players.",
      "The tide Howe is fighting against has already swept Frank out to sea. Are there any Tottenham fans who still want him to manage their team? At some point soon they will stop feeling angry and start feeling sympathy for a man arguably the worst football club to be told ‘you’re out of your depth’ at: one that purports to be Big with neither the back catalogue of successes nor the player quality to make it so.",
      "",
      "Four wins from four in the Premier League, through to the Champions League last 16 after getting the better of one of the old-guard Chelsea managers, Cole Palmer back and breaking records, it’s going about as well as it could have done for Liam Rosenior. Even his negative, ineffective tactics in defeat to Arsenal in the Carabao Cup semi-final were reported by many as a masterstroke that wasn’t.",
      "Enzo Maresca will be among the critics looking at a run of Brentford, Crystal Palace, West Ham and Wolves and brushing off the winning as a par score – although Chelsea drew with Brentford and Palace under the Italian earlier in the season – and likely view upcoming clashes against Leeds and Burnley with similar disdain.",
      "Leeds are a vastly different proposition at home than they are away – Daniel Farke’s have picked up 22 of their 29 points at Elland Road this season – granting the Rosenior naysayers further opportunity to scoff should Chelsea beat them at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.",
      "But the 3-1 defeat to the Whites at the start of December was maybe the low point of Maresca’s reign. As Gary Neville said on a night when Maresca rang the changes to his cost, Chelsea were “beaten up” and looked to lack anything close to the “character” – maybe the Rosenior buzzword – that they’ve shown in spades under the new manager.",
      "A victory in which Chelsea display the new-found grit and determination so absent two months ago will offer opportunity for an imperfect but stark comparison between Rosenior and his predecessor.",
      "We’re backing that victory.",
      "",
      "A man who has somehow managed to carve out a niche for himself as one of the last remaining Premier League relegation-battle specialists is leading Nottingham Forest towards the drop after being sacked by Everton for doing the very same thing.",
      "Eight points from the last five games is a perfectly reasonable return in the dogfight but four defeats on the bounce before that and West Ham’s remarkable uptick in form has left Forest in a precarious position, three points above the relegation zone.",
      "Dyche is now facing the wrath of a group of fans, the majority of whom didn’t want him in the first place,  who didn’t take kindly to the stark difference in vibe felt between their football club and Leeds after Farke’s side brushed them aside last time out.",
      "Growing frustration will surely turn to all-out mutiny should they fail to beat rock-bottom Wolves at home on Wednesday and grant Evangelos Marinakis an opportunity to appoint his fourth permanent manager of the season which we fully expect him to grasp with both hands.",
      "",
      "We find ourselves agreeing with Owen Hargreaves more than most pundits these days – certainly the ones with a Manchester United bent -and couldn’t think of any specific retorts to his claim that he’s “never seen Mainoo have a bad game”.",
      "He got a tad carried away in then suggesting the 20-year-old is some sort of George Best regen, but we’re happy to excuse his excesses as we too often fail to avoid hyperbole when watching the Red Devils academy graduate glide across the pitch as he has done since Prince Carrick arrived to break him from the dungeon master’s chains.",
      "What a fool Ruben Amorim is. And our frustration in him denying Mainoo football will turn to fury if he’s ruined his chances of appearing for England at the World Cup. Here’s hoping his performances continue to be at a level where Thomas Tuchel – for all of his faith in the tried and tested players for England – has no choice but to select him.",
      "West Ham’s Mateus Fernandes will provide a decent test, but we fully expect Mainoo to stroll through the game as he has done with all others.",
      "",
      "Eric Ramsay has failed to revert the Baggies slide towards League One after replacing Ryan Mason at the helm at the start of last month. He’s failed to win any of his five games in charge, losing three of them to leave a football club which hasn’t been out of the top two divisions since 1993 circling the Championship drain.",
      "They’re now just one point above the relegation zone and face a Birmingham side making a push for the play-offs and consecutive promotions after three wins and a draw in their last six, featuring a victory over league-leaders Coventry City.",

      "“Well that’s exactly it, it’s having that succession plan ready now in terms of midfield, but you know I think that they’re actually pretty well-placed [to sign Anderson],” Wyness told Football Insider.",

But again, they’re stuck in this whole vice we talked about last week of the SCR formulas and the ability to spend, despite having the richest owners in the world. It’s all been rehearsed and talked about so much, and it seems so unfair.",
      "“But yes, they’ve got to find that midfield solution now. This is why clubs don’t like players moving in January. It does give them this period now to do the research and to get some time in.",

      "In an interview with Sky News's Ed Conway, Sir Jim Ratcliffe says Britain faces profound political, social and economic challenges, among them an unprecedented rise in immigration in recent years; Warning: Please be aware the language below could cause offence",
      "By Ed Conway, Sky News' economics and data editor",
      "Wednesday 11 February 2026 23:41, UK",
      "Britain has been \"colonised\" by immigrants, who are draining resources from the state, Manchester United part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has told Sky News.",
      "Ratcliffe, the founder of the INEOS chemicals group, warned Britain faces profound political, social and economic challenges, among them an unprecedented rise in immigration in recent years.",
      "\"You can't have an economy with nine-million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in,\" he said. \"I mean, the UK has been colonised. It's costing too much money.",
      "\"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it? I mean, the population of the UK was 58 million in 2020, now it's 70 million. That's 12 million people.\"",
      "However, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) estimates the population of the UK was 67 million in mid-2020 and 70 million in mid-2024. The UK population was estimated at 58.9 million in 2000.",
      "Ratcliffe - who is a resident of Monaco - also signalled Prime Minister Keir Starmer might not be the right person for the job, saying: \"I don't know whether it's just the apparatus that hasn't allowed Keir to do it or he's maybe too nice. I mean, Keir is a nice man.",
      "\"I like him, but it's a tough job and I think you have to do some difficult things with the UK to get it back on track, because at the moment I don't think the economy is in a good state.\"",
      "Ratcliffe said he had met recently with Nigel Farage, the leader of right-wing party Reform UK, saying: \"I think Nigel is an intelligent man and I think he's got good intentions.",
      "\"But in a way, you could say exactly the same about Keir Starmer. I think it needs somebody who's prepared to be unpopular for a period of time to get the big issues sorted out.\"",
      "Referring to his role at United, Ratcliffe added: \"I've seen quite a bit of this at the football club. If you do difficult things, which we felt that we had to do at Manchester United... we felt like they were the right things to do. But you do become very unpopular for a while.\"",
      "Ratcliffe continued: \"I've been very unpopular at Manchester United because we've made lots of changes. But for the better, in my view. I think we're beginning to see some evidence in the football club that that's beginning to pay off.",
      "\"But you've got all the same issues with the country. If you really want to deal with the major issues of immigration, with people opting to take benefits rather than working for a living, if you want to deal with that, then you're going to have to do some things which are unpopular and show some courage.\"",
      "Ratcliffe was talking on the fringes of the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, at which leaders from many of Europe's biggest economies, including France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Friedrich Merz, are meeting with industrialists to discuss the fate of its economy.",
      "The summit comes amid a spate of closures across the European chemicals sector, closures that indicate, in the INEOS founder's view, that the European chemicals sector is facing \"unsurvivable conditions\".",
      "The Prime Minister responded to Sky News' interview with Ratcliffe on X, calling his comments \"offensive and wrong\".",
      "Starmer added: \"Britain is a proud, tolerant and diverse country.",
      "\"Jim Ratcliffe should apologise.\"",
      "\"In addition to the inaccurate figures mentioned, it's worth reminding him that Manchester United has a diverse fanbase and plays in a city whose cultural history has been enriched by immigrants.",
      "\"This type of language and leadership has no place in English football and we believe most fans will feel the same.\"",
      "The Manchester United Muslim Supporters Club are also unhappy with Ratcliffe's interview, saying they are \"deeply concerned\" and warning his words could have \"real-world consequences\"."

      "Michael Carrick's unbeaten start to life as Man Utd head coach won't see the club accelerate their plans moving forward; Carrick has won four of his opening five games in charge; should United secure Champions League qualification, Carrick may become a frontrunner for the job",
      "Wednesday 11 February 2026 19:28, UK",
      "They may not have gotten the result they wanted against West Ham, but Manchester United remain unbeaten in Michael Carrick's five games in charge. Under his stewardship, the team has beaten Arsenal and Manchester City already.",
      "Nevertheless, the club's bosses will not accelerate their plans to appoint a new head coach, and Carrick is still not the favourite to be the next long-term boss at Old Trafford.",
      "To understand why, you need to drill down into the new, determined philosophy at the heart of the club.",
      "United will make no decision about the top job right now. As Gary Neville suggested, the hierarchy has begun the process of identifying possible targets. But it has been made clear to me they have not yet spoken to any candidates, and they will wait until the end of the season before progressing with an appointment.",
      "In Carrick (and in Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Trevor Binnion and Jonny Evans) the team is in very good hands, and so that has placated the bosses into feeling there is no rush to make the next decision.",
      "Yes, there is a growing clamour from some supporters - and some pundits - for Carrick to be given the job right now. He is handling the media consummately. The mood is high. The players are happy, and enjoy training. The team is performing very well. Results are well and truly on the up.",
      "But to commit to a long-term appointment now would go against everything that United are determined their operation should be: calm, considered, strategic. There will be no short-term fixes, and certainly no decisions as important as the next head coach, made on the limited evidence of just five games.",
      "The same resolute, methodical policy was there for all to see with United's January transfer activity. Despite Ruben Amorim bemoaning his injury problems, AFCON absentees and a lack of squad depth, not one single player was signed as \"cover\" in the January transfer window. And there were no new incomings either once Carrick took charge. United are keeping their powder dry - and their transfer kitty full - for a central midfield transfer onslaught in the summer. That's the plan, and they're sticking to it.",
      "Back to the head coach. Certainly, the bosses are delighted with the job Carrick is doing, and with the dynamic between the key members of his coaching staff. And if he continues to do well - and especially if he delivers Champions League football - he will certainly be one of the front runners come the summer. Such are the standards that he has set, and the impression that he has made that, even if he misses out on the job at Old Trafford, he can only have enhanced his reputation, and his chances of getting another Premier League manager's role, in the future.",
      "Ironically, if Carrick does deliver Champions League qualification over the final 12 games, he may inadvertently stiffen the competition he will face for the top job that. The United manager's role does not have the same appeal now that it had in the years immediately after Sir Alex Ferguson's departure. But United playing again in the top European club competition, with the big boost in the finances to boot? That may make the job much more attractive to some of the elite managers in world football.",
      "To that end, it's been made clear to me that United are determined to appoint someone who has the strength of character and experience to cope with all that is thrown at you as the main man at Old Trafford.",
      "The feeling among the hierarchy is that the job was too big for Amorim. He was surprised by the sheer noise which came with the role. That wasn't the case with his predecessor, Erik ten Hag, but there have been learnings from his tenure too. On both occasions, United felt they'd achieved a coup in recruiting the brightest manager in Europe of that particular era. Neither was a success at Manchester United.",
      "That sort of candidate is not on the wanted list this time. If it isn't Carrick, it is very likely to be one of the biggest names in world football - assuming United can persuade that man to join.",
      "The likes of Thomas Tuchel and Carlo Ancelotti have the wow factor, the stellar name, the track record of winning multiple major trophies. Carrick can't compete with them on that level, but he out-scores them both when it comes to knowing Old Trafford, and the \"Manchester United way\".",
      "Carrick will happily work within the current United structure, which isn't about to change. Might Tuchel or Ancelotti want more of a say in transfer dealings, for example, than Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada are prepared to give? We should not forget that United's recent managerial past includes some huge football names. Neither Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal were considered a success. That is a lingering memory.",
      "Carrick has made a sensational start to his time as Manchester United head coach. Whether he gets the chance to continue the role beyond the summer has much to do with how the team performs under his charge between now and May - but also on the basis of many, many more factors.",
      "Whatever happens, United's bosses will not make a quick decision.",

      "Michael Carrick has overseen victories in his first four games as Man Utd boss, rejuvenating the club after Ruben Amorim's exit; Ole Gunnar Solskjaer also made a winning start in 2018, with similarities between their approach to restore confidence and United's traditional style of play",
      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 21:42, UK",
      "It's four from four for Michael Carrick, Man Utd are rejuvenated and the similarities with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's instant impact in 2018 are striking.",
      "Carrick first had a taste of managing United as a caretaker following Solskjaer's exit in 2021 and any scepticism about his long-term suitability for the role is wedded to how it unravelled for the former super sub who couldn't sustain his stunning start.",
      "But Old Trafford is buzzing again and there's no doubt Carrick has recaptured that flow, feeling and freedom United enjoyed at the beginning of Solskjaer's tenure in 2018/19, when the Norwegian took the wheel.",
      "Goals are flying in, an unshackled No 10 is pulling the strings, and refound confidence is coursing through the team with a sense the traditional style of play at Man Utd has been reclaimed.",
      "Carrick's United have scored 10 in his four games in charge, having managed just one per game in Amorim's final four. That's shy of Solskjaer's total at the start of his interim spell but the calibre of opponent has been trickier and they could easily have had more, against City in particular.",
      "\"After the negative performances under Jose Mourinho, Solskjaer seemed to give his players a freedom to express themselves\" we wrote on these pages in 2018, when United thumped Cardiff 5-1 in Solskjaer's first game.",
      "The same sentiment applies to Carrick's United - a gameplan simplified yet, as he said himself, a team \"playing with purpose\".",
      "And the creator in chief? Back in 2018 it was Paul Pogba in the No 10. So often the scapegoat during the Mourinho era, who made headlines with a famously frosty training ground greeting with his manager, under Solskjaer Pogba was renewed.",
      "His four goal involvements in Solskjaer's first two games was as many as he'd managed in Mourinho's final 12 matches. His four goals across Solskjaer's games two and three were as many as he'd scored in Mourinho's final 20.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' output has been impressive throughout the season, especially given United's struggles under Amorim. But he too is now playing with added verve, restored to a No 10 role from a deeper position thanks to Carrick's tactical shake-up.",
      "It's four assists and a goal from four games under Carrick for Fernandes. \"Carrick came in with the right ideas, giving the players the responsibility and freedom on the pitch,\" was the United captain's assessment after adding the second to seal the win against Spurs on Saturday.",
      "That goal was from a fantastic Diogo Dalot cross but against City and at Arsenal United have also been excellent on the break. It has been high-energy, intense and end-to-end. A throwback, an echo of the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson - who managed and inspired both Solskjaer and Carrick.",
      "\"We've been conditioned to believe you cannot play like Manchester United play,\" Neville said after that derby triumph. \"That's what I've been told for the last three, four, five years, 'move on, you can't play that way anymore'.",
      "\"You've just watched 90 minutes of exactly what I think this club plays like when it's actually at its very best.\"",
      "In another nod to the grand traditions of the club, Solskjaer became the first United manager since Sir Matt Busby to win his first four in charge. Now in his permanent role, Carrick has repeated the streak.",
      "But what comes next?",
      "Solskjaer went on to win his first six Premier League games on the spin and with West Ham and Everton next, Carrick could emulate that. Matching Solskjaer's return of 14 wins from his first 19 really would be some going.",
      "But infamously, after signing his contract for the permanent post, Solskjaer oversaw just two wins out of the remaining 10 games that season.",
      "Roy Keane's recent comment that Carrick shouldn't be appointed even if he wins every game until the end of this campaign sparked debate but is a reflection of the scars from Solskjaer's appointment and how he proved not to be the answer in the long run.",
      "\"They need a bigger and better manager,\" said Keane after the victory at Arsenal. \"The size of the club and the challenges they face over the next few years, you want a manager who you feel can get them winning league titles.\"",
      "Solskjaer did go on to achieve two high league finishes and lost a Europa League final on penalties but couldn't attain the titles ultimately expected from the hierarchy after heavy transfer market investment in the squad.",
      "Carrick has made a similar start to Solskjaer but is a club which has experienced multiple false dawns since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement now seeing the foundations created for substantial long-term success?",
      "The arguments about whether Carrick can take the team to the next level will run through the final months of the season to the end of his current deal in the summer, when United will be weighing up their alternatives. But no doubt, Carrick has hit the ground running and raised expectations again at Old Trafford.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo's impressive return to the Manchester United team shows what Ruben Amorim was missing. Also in The Debrief: More Bruno Fernandes numbers, Bernardo Silva's influential display, Enzo Fernandez's 'new' position and Angel Gomes' debut",
      "Tuesday 10 February 2026 20:59, UK",
      "The questions about Kobbie Mainoo had become a running joke of press conferences under Ruben Amorim. It was clear that the former Manchester United boss was less than convinced that the young midfielder was worth all the fuss. But Amorim was wrong.",
      "Having not been trusted with a single Premier League start prior to Michael Carrick's arrival, Mainoo has been picked four times out of four under him and United have won the lot. Beat West Ham on Tuesday and a certain supporter can finally have his hair cut.",
      "The partnership with Casemiro, one that Amorim sensed was not feasible, has been impressive in of itself let alone the fact that the formation change has freed up Bruno Fernandes to flourish in his favoured position. Mainoo has slotted in there seamlessly.",
      "The youngster deserves credit for getting up to speed so quickly given that he had been so starved of minutes. The balance he brings the team is one thing, the boost it brings for fans to see an academy graduate is another. But fundamentally he is just a fine footballer.",
      "Against Tottenham, Mainoo completed 33 passes in the final third of the pitch, 12 more than he ever had in a Premier League game before. That was also the most by anyone on the pitch and the most by any player in the competition over the course of the weekend.",
      "Casemiro was not far behind, the pair described as \"a big part of controlling the team\" by Carrick. It helped that Spurs were down to 10 but when Carrick talked recently of liking \"the way Kobbie takes the ball\" and calling him \"a joy to watch\" it is easy to see why.",
      "\"Credit to him, he has come right in and found his rhythm, which is not easy after a period of time out. We know he can handle the ball and hopefully over time, I am sure he will keep improving. We have got to be patient and not expect too much from him all the time.\"",
      "Mainoo, still only 20 years old, was in danger of becoming a talent lost to United had the previous regime been allowed to continue much longer. Instead, Carrick has helped him to remind people of his quality. Perhaps he could have been useful to Amorim, after all.",
      "Regular readers of this column will know there is a risk of it becoming devoted to the boy Fernandes. But such are his statistical accomplishments, it is difficult to ignore the Portuguese playmaker. He was at it again in Manchester United's win over Tottenham.",
      "Fernandes scored United's second goal and had six shots from outside the box but his creative contribution stood out once more. Fernandes should have had another assist with his final kick of the game when the unmarked Benjamin Sesko misdirected his header.",
      "That was the sixth chance created by the United captain, the most of any player over the Premier League weekend. It is the third time this season that Fernandes has created six chances in a game. Rayan Cherki is the only other man to have done that even twice.",
      "Two of the three matches in which Fernandes has created that many chances have come under Carrick and that should be no surprise. He has been restored to his best position, playing in the fun part of the football pitch, making things happen for his team.",
      "In truth, even under Ruben Amorim, he was putting up spectacular numbers. He has created 74 chances this season when nobody else in the Premier League has brought up their half century yet. It is 200 United goal involvements in all competition for him now.",
      "Fernandes remains a polarising figure, routinely given the treatment by opposition supporters. Even some United fans speculate that he might be part of the problem rather than the solution given that his time at the club has coincided with their struggles.",
      "That talk should stop. Fernandes has been a victim of United's malaise. While their 16th-place finish last season was a little artificial given their resources, if he propels them into the Champions League, he has a persuasive case to be named as the player of the year.",
      "Pep Guardiola is rarely shy to laud his players but the smile beams a little wider where Bernardo Silva is concerned, the player whom he has picked more times than any other outfield player during his managerial career. He delivered again for him at Anfield.",
      "While Erling Haaland scored the winning goal in Manchester City's come-from-behind victory over Liverpool, Guardiola had been unimpressed with the big striker's efforts for much of the second half, gesticulating at him and wanting much better body language.",
      "\"I know it's an incredibly difficult task [for Haaland and Omar Marmoush against Ibrahima] Konate and [Virgil] van Dijk, to win those balls, but in the second half [they did] not even try,\" claimed Guardiola. \"That ball goes quick, it comes back quicker.\"",
      "It was Bernardo who drove City on to victory, not just with his equalising goal but his whole demeanour. While others were wilting, shoulders hunched and belief sapped, he sensed the moment. He was the inspiration to his teammates - and his own coach.",
      "\"Guided by our incredible player, one of the best players I ever trained, our captain Bernardo, we followed him. I follow him too. Because when a player always puts the team in front of himself and does things through example, everybody follows him.\"",
      "Bernardo completed more passes in the final third than anyone else on the pitch but, now playing in a deeper role, he has shown that the location of his work is less significant than his presence. Guardiola still wants his man out there setting standards.",
      "The City boss said recently that he would love Bernardo to stay and that whatever happens this season his legacy at the club is secure. But don't rule out more glory just yet. \"We will fight to the end,\" said Bernardo himself afterwards. He always does.",
      "With eight goals in 24 Premier League games this season, Enzo Fernandez is only one behind Joao Pedro as Chelsea's top scorer in the competition. But the Argentina international was moved to the left to accommodate Cole Palmer in the win at Wolves.",
      "At least that is what the team graphics showed. Liam Rosenior rejected that argument when discussing Fernandez's positioning in the press conference following the 3-1 victory in which Palmer scored a first-half hat trick. \"It's amazing,\" said Rosenior.",
      "\"Enzo is playing in exactly the same position he has been playing in probably 80 to 90 per cent of the season, which is in the left pocket. That is where he plays. Actually, he has got more freedom because we're interchanging a little bit more from our structure.\"",
      "\"Without the ball, he is on the left. That is probably why it looks different today because of the way Wolves play. He has not changed his position, to be honest. It looks that way, but his position in possession is the same.\" The touch map illustrates this point.",
      "It was Marc Cucurella who provided the assist for Chelsea's excellent third goal - a move that started with goalkeeper Robert Sanchez - and it was the left-back who offered width on that flank. No Chelsea player had more touches in the opposition box than Cucurella.",
      "Fernandez was free to roam into more central zones, having three shots of his own, including an ambitious rabona attempt that would have been the goal of the Premier League weekend. He had more final third entries than any other player on the pitch.",
      "With Pedro Neto staying wide on the right, Fernandez was often alongside Palmer, the pair operating in the pockets. While his duties shifted a little out of possession, on the ball it seems this might be the way for Rosenior to get his best players in the best areas.",
      "Angel Gomes' loan move to Wolves was a surprising one. The midfielder made four appearances for England as recently as 2024 and has an intriguing profile. Leaving Marseille for a team doomed to relegation from the Premier League raised eyebrows.",
      "But this is an opportunity to show what he can do in English football, a first Premier League start at the age of 25 after five substitute appearances for Manchester United in the competition as a teenager. It was a promising debut even in defeat against Chelsea.",
      "The quality of his work in possession was certainly an upgrade on those around him at Molineux. He was the only Wolves starter to win possession more times than he lost it. His passing accuracy was 94.3 per cent, while no other Wolves starter hit 90 per cent.",
      "But what was particularly impressive about the playmaker was that these numbers did not stem from him playing safe, he was progressive in his use of the ball too. Asking Rob Edwards about that in the press conference, he identified it as Gomes' key strength.",
      "\"That was the reason for him coming in. I think he can link, obviously, as a six and give us something in the build-up but once he gets turned and is facing up as well, hopefully then he has got more of a killer pass, maybe something that we have not quite had.",
      "\"You saw a little bit of that today, didn't you. He has got that nice sort of spinning one, where he is seeing those runs. He has got those forward passes in the locker and hopefully we will see a lot more of it now, the fitter and the more integrated he gets.\"",
      "Gomes went off with cramp late on, an indication that the physical challenge of the Premier League will be tough after four-and-a-half seasons in France. But his touch gave him time on the ball against tough opposition. Wolves will not be staying up. He just might.",

      "Gary Neville on Man Utd potentially appointing Michael Carrick: \"What United have said is they're not going to be bounced into, irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months, making an appointment. They're going to wait until the end of the season\"",
      "Monday 9 February 2026 15:10, UK",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United will not be \"bounced\" into making a decision to give Michael Carrick the manager's job after a run of great results.",
      "Carrick masterminded a fourth-straight United victory as his side secured a 2-0 Premier League triumph over 10-man Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "The win moved United to within three points of third-placed Aston Villa in the race for Champions League qualification.",
      "It also took Carrick's overall record as boss at Old Trafford to six wins in seven matches, including a three-game spell in 2021, but as the clamour builds in favour of giving him the job beyond the end of the season, Neville warned United will not be rushed into a decision.",
      "He told The Gary Neville Podcast: \"I made my position clear a few weeks ago and what I'm not going to do is repeat it every week, but what I did, I actually spoke to the club, because ultimately the club get asked all the time from journalists and broadcasters, what's the position of the club.",
      "\"It's a very difficult situation, you've got a massive movement now with what's happened towards giving Carrick the job, saying that really he should be considered.That's only going to build the more that he wins and the more that he gets closer to Champions League football.",
      "\"I asked the club what is the official position of the football club in terms of what you're saying publicly to everybody else. I have to say I thought their answer was pretty good. They said they've actually begun the process now, starting to look for another manager, which I thought right.",
      "\"That's good to hear because you need to plan for everything. They've started the process of speaking to and looking at other managers, building all the sorts of data and analysing who should be the next manager of the football club. But what they've said is they're not going to be bounced into - irrespective of wins or draws or losses on the pitch in this next couple of months - making an appointment. They're going to wait until towards the end of the season.",
      "\"If Michael then at that point makes himself available for the job, and I did actually say a couple of weeks ago, I wondered whether Michael actually would say no. He is that type of guy Michael, he's someone who would always work in the best interest of the football club. He may do that, or he might say no, I feel comfortable enough and I've built such a good relationship with the players, his coaching staff to put his name in the hat.",
      "\"At that point Michael Carrick, like in any other recruitment role in the country for any other business, would go into what would be a process versus the likes of Thomas Tuchel and all the others that are going to become available in the summer. I think that's fair.\"",
      "The arrival of Carrick has certainly lifted the mood at Old Trafford after United were winless in four and with only one victory in seven matches in all competitions before their former midfielder was hired following Ruben Amorim's exit at the start of January.",
      "And Neville was full of praise for the job his former team-mate has done in turning around Man Utd's fortunes, saying the position they are in now was unthinkable a few weeks ago.",
      "\"I can't believe where Manchester United are,\" Neville said.",
      "\"I watched them six out of those seven games before Ruben Amorim was sacked, and after that against Burnley when Darren Fletcher took over, it was terrible. It was really was shocking, and what Michael Carrick has done, he's rebuilt trust instantly and faith. The players, straightaway, are listening. They're trusting in what the message is and it's a complete about turn.",
      "\"He's done more than that, though, the results are excellent, the performances are fantastic and I like what I see. He's rebuilt faith in the system of play in the 4-4-1-1, and the way in which United should always play.",
      "\"Everything at the moment for United is looking really, really good.",
      "\"They do look like they really have got an incredible chance [of qualifying for the Champions League], because of the fact they haven't got the confusion, and the chaotic fixture list that some of the others have.",
      "\"You would think that they've got a massive chance now, with the way in which Carrick has set about the job of getting into the Champions League. It was unthinkable only four or five weeks ago, unthinkable.",
      "\"If they win another four or five games then they're almost emphatically in the Champions League, and that would be incredible.",
      "\"It'd be a great position to be in by the way [for appointing a new manager], if you think about where probably Jim Ratcliffe, Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox thought they were going to be maybe a few weeks ago.\"",
