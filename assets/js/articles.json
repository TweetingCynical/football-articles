      "Chelsea could still hold the key to Jadon Sancho's future, even after deciding to not to make the Manchester United winger's loan move permanent. The Blues opted to pay £5million to the Red Devils in order to avoid signing Sancho after being unable to come to terms with the 25-year-old.",
      "And as Chelsea look at alternatives to reinforce their options on the wing, one could yet impact the United ace. The west London side are among those looking to secure a deal for Borussia Dortmund star Jamie Gittens.",
      "The 20-year-old is already said to have agreed a seven-year deal with Enzo Maresca's team as they attempt to persuade Dortmund of the move. Chelsea have already tabled a bid of £29.5million as they rush to get a deal done in time for the Club World Cup; the first part of the transfer window closes on Tuesday.",
      "Gittens scored 12 goals and made five assists last term as he lit up the early parts of the Champions League by bagging four goals in the opening five matches. The ex-Manchester City youngster still has three years remaining on his contract and a £50m release clause however.",
      "Crucially, Dortmund will require a replacement if Gittens does depart. Sancho could prove to be an option to arrive for his third spell with the club.",
      "The England international arrived at Old Trafford from Dortmund in a £73m deal and returned to the Westfalenstadion on loan in January 2024 after falling out with Erik ten Hag. Sancho has little future at United.",
      "Dortmund have asked to be kept up to date on any developments over Sancho's future, per reports, and are one of a number of clubs around Europe interested in a deal. The player's salary could yet prove problematic for United getting the player off of their books however and another loan could yet be looked at.",
      "Sancho helped Chelsea win the UEFA Conference League and qualify for the Champions League as he made 45 appearances. But his five goals and 10 assists reflected a steady season rather than spectacular one.",
      "Any move from Dortmund would likely first require Gittens exit. The Bundesliga giants are also looking to sign Jobe Bellingham from Sunderland with a £31m deal said to be agreed.",
      "Sporting director Sebastian Kehl has admitted that Gittens has drawn interest. However, the former midfielder has also warned the club are looking to reduce their wage bill.",
      "He said: \"There’s definitely a market for him [Gittens]. He’s a very exciting player. We’ll be having discussions soon. If offers come in, we’ll have to deal with them.\"",
      "\"We want to reduce wages,\" Kehl added. \"That said, it’s possible we’ll continue with some of these players. But some may no longer be part of the BVB squad next season.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has already strengthened his squad with the capture of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and plenty more incomings and outgoings are expected. Despite their poor season, United do have money to spend with CEO Omar Berrada stating earlier this year: \"We speak to Ruben very frequently.",

      "Manchester United are set to earn a substantial transfer windfall thanks to former star Maxi Oyedele. The United academy graduate left the Red Devils a year ago for Legia Warsaw, having never played a senior game at Old Trafford.",
      "But he has starred in Poland, making 24 appearances in all competitions as Legia won the Polish Cup. That was their first major trophy since 2023, with Oyedele playing all 90 minutes of the final.",
      "Though he only joined last summer and has two years to run on his contract, the midfielder is attracting strong interest. Werder Bremen, PSV Eindhoven, Anderlecht, Club Brugge and a number of Championship sides are understood to be monitoring the 20-year-old.",
      "There is a release clause in his contract that means he is available for a tick over £5million this summer. There is a growing expectation at Legia that he will be departing the club after just one season.",
      "If he does indeed move on, it would bank United a healthy sum, which will go a way towards easing their concerns with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules. The Red Devils are hoping to be busy this summer and any fee received will be greatly appreciated.",
      "In a surprise move given he left just 12 months ago, United will benefit substantially from Oyedele's potential transfer. When they sold him last summer, United inserted various clauses into the deal.",
      "While they only sold him for a small fee, one of the clauses they inserted was a substantial sell-on clause to ensure future profit. That sell-on clause means that United are entitled to 40 per cent of any fee Legia receive for the midfielder.",
      "If he is sold for his release clause, it would see United bank just over £2m. That money would likely go straight into easing their PSR concerns, with a buy-back option also included in the original deal.",
      "A departure for Oyedele would come as somewhat of a surprise given his short time in Poland. Speaking in April, the youngster insisted he was happy with life in the capital city.",
      "“It’s just funny for my mum because she left Poland to come to England and make a life; I left England to go to Poland to start my journey,” Oyedele told The Guardian. “Legia was the biggest opportunity.",
      "\"I don’t even think I realised how big of an opportunity it was when I heard about it. I felt like this was the opportunity to play in Europe, the biggest team in Poland. It’s my nationality, so it’s close to the national team.",
      "\"It’s always a risk to leave it, but it just seemed like the best choice. I couldn’t afford to waste another year playing academy football. I could have stayed in England and continued my journey and who knows what would have happened.\""

      "Thomas Frank is keen on a Tottenham switch and wants the north Londoners to land Bryan Mbeumo ahead of Manchester United with Brentford demanding £60million for their forward.",
      "Mbeumo has just enjoyed his best season to date in front of goal and is set for a move as a result. The Bees have already turned down an offer from the Red Devils, who fell short of their valuation as they look to add more firepower.",
      "Now Frank, who has been able to aid Mbueumo's development from a Championship player to a 20-goal top flight star, wants the 25-year-old to follow him across London and has made that demand known to Tottenham.",
      "Even given the state of affairs at Old Trafford, players choosing Tottenham over Manchester has been rare. One man who did though was Gareth Bale when he chose to leave Southampton as a youngster. Both teams were keen on the Welshman, who would go on and become a global star.",
      "Bale later admitted a desire to play every week was a motive in him knocking back United, who were then the dominant force in England.",
      "He said on his Airwayz channel in 2023: \"I rejected Manchester United and went to Tottenham. At that time, United were the biggest team in the league, they were winning trophies, they had the biggest players, the best manager. The easiest decision would be to go to Man United and the biggest club. You always want to be at the biggest clubs but I took the approach that I wanted to be playing first-team football.\"",
      "Mbeumo is likely to be a starter whether he joins Tottenham or United, but Frank may lean on the fact that the north Londoners can offer Champions League football following their Europa League triumph.",
      "Frank has admitted that Mbeumo was likely to move on given the interest in him and Brentford's record of selling for big profits. “It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,” he said. “It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.”",
      "Tottenham have yet to make any major signings this summer and there is talk of Son Heung-min leaving the club after a decade of service. United meanwhile have already spent £62.5m to land Matheus Cunha from Wolves but bringing in more firepower is a priority.",

      "Neville, 50, faced this challenge during a live edition of The Overlap in 2022, alongside Roy Keane, Jamie Carragher, and host Kelly Cates. The only caveat was that he was banned from selecting any players that represented his boyhood club.",
      "Despite traditionally hailing Peter Schmeichel as the top-flight's finest keeper, Neville had to pivot to Liverpool's current number one Alisson to adhere to the no-United rule.",
      "His defence also included Liverpool's commanding leader Virgil van Dijk, which surprisingly drew jeers from the audience, prompting Neville to clarify: \"I don't think they heard that I can't pick United players!\"",
      "Neville's defensive lineup was bolstered by Chelsea stalwarts with Cesar Azpilicueta and Ashley Cole taking the full-back spots, while his former England colleague John Terry was chosen to pair up with Van Dijk at centre-back.",
      "Despite the calibre of his selections, the crowd's disapproval persisted, leading a bemused Neville to retort: \"Who the f*** do you want in?!\"",

      "Manchester United’s transfer strategy wouldn’t sit well with Jose Mourinho, judging by previous comments from the former Old Trafford boss. It’s clear for all to see that Ruben Amorim’s squad needs a major overhaul following a desperate season, which culminated in the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "United have already landed Matheus Cunha from Wolves, while talks are ongoing with Brentford about signing Bryan Mbeumo. Despite a savage round of cost-cutting off the pitch, United could spend big on it, having also been linked with Sporting CP striker Victor Gyokeres and Aston Villa keeper Emi Martinez, among numerous other players.",
      "United are looking to repair the damage done by a succession of expensive mistakes in the transfer market, with Amorim happy to move on the likes of Jadon Sancho, Antony, Rasmus Hojlund, Joshua Zirkzee and Andre Onana if possible and replace them with new blood.",
      "It’s an approach not dissimilar to the one employed by Pep Guardiola at Manchester City while Mourinho was in charge of United. Mourinho took a shot at Guardiola after City spent more than £200million on defenders in the summer of 2017 as part of a wider spending spree at the Etihad.",
      "United spent big too that summer, almost £150m, but Mourinho insisted they couldn’t compete with City’s perceived ability to replace one expensive signing with another. He told United's website at the time: \"You think the club can put here now £600million and let's buy six players of £100m? The club cannot do that.",
      "\"I cannot expect the club to do that, so it's not critical and you can see how the market is, especially with the top teams. But, you know, without taking any credit away from Manchester City and Pep and his staff and the players, they obviously have lots of credit in what they are doing.",
      "“But Pep arrives, he has the goalkeeper of England (Joe Hart), he doesn't like him so he buys the goalkeeper of Barcelona (Claudio Bravo), he doesn't like him so he buys another one (Ederson). Now he likes.",
      "\"He has [Pablo] Zabaleta and [Aleksandar] Kolarov - two very good players but more than 30 years old. He wants to replace, he doesn't replace with two, he replaces with three.",
      "\"One from Tottenham (Kyle Walker), one from Monaco (Benjamin Mendy) and one from Real Madrid (Danilo) as an example. Can we buy six or seven players at the same time? Can we invest £600-700m? No. So, it's difficult.",
      "\"I think the last years, the market is going in such a direction or you belong to one of these clubs where there is no limit and you just buy what you want and there is no limit, there is no financial fair play, there is nothing, you do what you want - or it's hard.\"",
      "Now, clubs are bound by financial restrictions, which means expensive signings are generally coupled with sales. That is sure to be the case at United this summer. Still, it’s unlikely Mourinho, whose win ratio was only marginally lower than Sir Alex Ferguson’s when he was sacked in December 2018, would approve of United’s current transfer strategy."

      "Manchester United face the prospect of missing out on Victor Osimhen and Moise Kean as they look to land a new striker this summer, but still face several hurdles.",
      "Adding more firepower is a priority for Ruben Amorim, who has not been able to rely on Joshua Zirkzee or Rasmus Hojlund - who is on Inter Milan's radar. Osimhen has previously been linked with a switch to the Premier League and continued to score goals for Galatasaray last year.",
      "He moved to Turkey on loan with Napoli deeming him surplus to requirements. An exit from the Italian champions is expected and after rejecting Al-Hilal a move back to Turkish soil with Galatasaray had been seen as his likely destination - only for Osimhen to seemingly now decide he WILL take the Saudi money after all.",
      "As such, he's expected to link up with Simone Inzaghi and his new side imminently, making him eligible to play in the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup.",
      "It appears as if Kean, now at Fiorentina, also has reservations over a possible move to Manchester. Despite his future in Florence being unclear he's not sold on the idea of heading to United after proving himself with 25 goals last term. There is a release clause in his contract which means he could head elsewhere for €52million (£43.8m), but Fiorentina are in negotiations to retain him. Tuttomercatoweb claim that United are the team who have consistently shown an interest in Kean.",
      "However the Red Devils failed to qualify for any European competition whilst Fiorentina are in the Europa Conference League for the fourth season in a row. A switch to Manchester would also not guarantee him regular playing time, which has proved crucial this term after several underwhelming spells elsewhere, including Everton.",
      "United have already landed Matheus Cunha, who proved to be a big hit at Wolves. He set the club back £62.5m but is not a No 9 who can lead the line and Amorim has just missed out on Liam Delap, who opted for Chelsea.",
      "It means a move for Viktor Gyokeres could be back on. The Sporting Lisbon frontman had been linked with a Manchester move given his connection with Amorim but looked to be apprehensive after they missed out on the Champions League.",
      "That stance appears to have softened and the Swede would be open to the move. He is likely to cost £60m, which is less than his release clause. Gyokeres has proved that he can regularly supply goals and his signing would be a major coup for the Red Devils.",

      "Jadon Sancho's goal in the Europa Conference League final was not enough to convince Chelsea he was worth £25million plus his not inconsiderable salary. Despite ending his time at Stamford Bridge with a European trophy, the 25-year-old was sent back to Manchester United by Enzo Maresca's side.",
      "When the Blues loaned Sancho from the Red Devils last summer, they did so on the premise that they would pay £25m to sign him permanently at the end of the campaign. When the deal was made, the only way Chelsea could renege on that deal was if they finished lower than 14th, or pay a £5m penalty clause to get out of the deal.",
      "After finishing fourth and winning the Conference League, Chelsea opted to pay the £5m to send Sancho back from whence he came. Now the Blues have been linked with other wide midfielders such as Borussia Dortmund's Jamie Gittens, Nico Williams of Athletic Bilbao and, ironically, Sancho's United team-mate Alejandro Garnacho, who has seemingly been banished by Ruben Amorim in the same way as Sancho was by Erik ten Hag.",
      "After the Conference League triumph, Maresca appeared to state that he wanted the winger to remain at Stamford Bridge. He said: \"We are going to sit with the club and decide what happens for next year.",
      "\"He's come here and got his career back on track. I still think there is more to come from him; I really do.\"",
      "Chelsea backed out of the deal, as Sancho would not compromise on the £300,000 per-week salary he earns at United. Such a wage would see Sancho earn more than £250k-a-week Chelsea captain Reece James (£250,000 per-week) and more than twice as much as midfield talisman Cole Palmer, who is understood to be on around £130,000 per-week.",
      "When Sancho's exit was confirmed, the former England international took to social media and wrote: \"Grateful for the experience. Big love to everyone at Chelsea who made me feel at home - teammates, staff and the fans. Wishing the club all the best moving forward. Truly grateful.\"",
      "As long as Sancho insists on his £300,000 per-week salary, potential suitors will likely be hard to come by. United's £62.5m capture of Matheus Cunha and the potential £55m arrival of Bryan Mbeumo pushes Sancho even further down the pecking order.",
      "In May, Bundesliga giants Bayer Leverkusen were reportedly willing to make an offer to United for Sancho. Unfortunately for the ex-Borussia Dortmund ace, Ten Hag's arrival will surely all but block any route to the BayArena.",
      "Sancho's contract at Old Trafford expires June 30 2026. This summer represents United's best opportunity to cash in on his services, even though there is next to no chance that they will recoup the £73m they paid to Dortmund in the summer of 2021.",
      "If a permanent move maintaining his salary is not possible this year, Sancho's next best option could be another loan spell, having already spent six months at Dortmund and a year at Stamford Bridge.",
      "However, with United looking to bolster their forward line, they will surely prefer a permanent transfer which guarantees them a fee and gets rid of Sancho from their wage-bill. It's another difficult situation for the ex-Manchester City academy star, who was tipped for great things when he first started catching the eye at Dortmund as a teenager, but whose career arguably hasn't reached the heights that many thought it would.",

      "Lisandro Martinez is making good progress in his recovery from a serious knee injury and Manchester United are hopeful he could be available early next season. Martinez needed surgery in February after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in a match against Crystal Palace, but he’s now on the road to recovery.",
      "The United defender was carried from the pitch in tears after sustaining the serious injury which ruled him out for the rest of the season. Martinez was a big miss for Ruben Amorim in the final three months of the campaign, as United limped to 15th place in the Premier League and lost the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "He was one of many injuries in defence for United and won’t be able to take a full part in pre-season when that comes around. However, the club have been encouraged by the progress the Argentina international has made, with tests confirming last week that he hasn’t got a tear in his meniscus.",
      "United are weary of rushing him back and will take a cautious approach to avoid aggravating the injury. But it is hoped he will be able to start an individual rehabilitation programme in the coming months, working individually on the grass during pre-season.",
      "The aim will be for Martinez to make his return as soon as possible in the 2025/26 season, when United’s team will look very different. Amorim is keen to overhaul his squad – and the club will listen to offers for any of their players – but the United boss is a fan of Martinez.",
      "\"If you let him, he can go play today without problem,\" Amorim said in March after Martinez was spotted cheering his team-mates on from the sidelines against Arsenal. \"Because he loves the club, he wants to help the team, he understands the context. Like I said, he's a great character, he's really important in the dressing room.\"",
      "The 27-year-old has also been praised for his leadership and encouragement by young midfielder Toby Collyer, who told the club website: “Licha is another name that’s massively helped me, in training every day, around the building, to express myself, giving me little tips on the pitch and helping me through games. He’s another one that’s really helped me.”",
      "Collyer also struggled with injuries, so spent lots of time with Martinez. “We saw each other every day in the physio room,” he added. “And even when we’re working in the gym, you have little moments where you can chat for a bit. It’s nice to have someone like him to get through it with.”",
      "Martinez is keen to return as soon as possible. After undergoing surgery he wrote on Instagram : \"Today, after going through several stormy days where I allowed myself to feel and accept my sadness, helplessness, insecurities, fears, and a deep emotional imbalance, I am reconnecting with my essence and my values, which help me see things from a kinder and more positive perspective.",
      "\"I feel immense gratitude for the incredible work and support of @manchesterunited, @afaseleccion, my family, friends, teammates, and everyone who took the time to send me a message of encouragement. The surgery went perfectly!! Now it’s time to give it my all, with heart and soul, in the rehabilitation process.\"",

The Argentine is being discussed as an alternative target to Liverpool winger Luis Diaz after the Premier League champions made it clear that the Colombian is still part of Arne Slot ’s plans when they were sounded out by Barcelona about their intentions for the 28-year-old.",
      "Al-Nassr have told former Kop favourite Sadio Mane that he can leave the club this summer - and want a top-class replacement. With Diaz now appearing set to stay at Anfield, the Saudis are now exploring the possibility of offering Garnacho the chance to link up again with his boyhood hero Cristiano Ronaldo.",

      "The Old Trafford club rejected a £40million bid from Napoli in January. But Amorim told the Madrid-born Argentina international to find a new club following a row in the aftermath of the Europa League Final defeat by Tottenham last month.",
      "Handing United their asking price will not be a problem for Al-Nassr - and the prospect of playing alongside Ronaldo would be a huge draw for Garnacho.",

      "They want the 40-year-old Portuguese’s future signed and sealed before cranking up their summer recruitment drive. Garnacho grew up idolising Ronaldo - and even risked the wrath of Argentine legend Lionel Messi when he first broke into his country’s senior squad as a teenager by name-checking the Portuguese as football’s greatest-ever player.",
      "United have already started splashing the cash with the £62.5million capture of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and will have to get close to that fee if they are to prise Bryan Mbeumo away from Brentford.",

There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for.\"",

Fellow right-back Nelson Semedo must have also been surprised when he was not called upon to replace his teammate in the right-back berth.",
      "Instead, Portugal boss Roberto Martinez deployed Paris Saint-Germain midfielder and former United transfer target Joao Neves at right-back. Usually, the talented 20-year-old is found at the heart of either Paris Saint-Germain's or Portugal's midfield.",

      "There are three guarantees in life: death, taxes and Manchester United attempting to fix their midfield in a summer transfer window.",
      "For the fourth summer running, United are once again in the market for a midfielder. Casemiro, Mason Mount and Manuel Ugarte have all arrived for big-money fees in each of the last three summers, but United's midfield remains a talking point.",
      "After a lengthy pursuit for Frenkie de Jong's signature went nowhere in 2022, United turned to Casemiro, signing him for an initial fee of £60million from Real Madrid. He was excellent in his first season at the club, developing an excellent partnership with fellow new recruit Christian Eriksen.",
      "The following summer, United wanted to add more energy to their midfield department and paid an initial fee of £55m to sign Mount from Chelsea. However, his first two seasons at the club were ravaged by injury issues.",
      "Following Casemiro's sharp downfall in 2023/24, United swooped for Ugarte last summer to add more steel and grit to their midfield pool. However, his struggles in possession mean that United are now on the hunt for yet another midfielder.",
      "Following the capture of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, the Brazilian is set to take up residency in the left-sided No.10 position, meaning Bruno Fernandes is poised to move into midfield on a permanent basis.",
      "Fernandes is just as influential operating deeper as he is further forward, often pulling the strings and scoring goals, but a debate is being had about who his ideal midfield partner should be.",
      "Eriksen will leave United when his contract expires at the end of this month, Casemiro could be sold, Ugarte has shown his limitations in possession, Mount is more effective as a No.10 in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system and Kobbie Mainoo's long-term position is yet to be established after stints as both a No.8 and a No.10 this season.",
      "Mainoo is a forward-thinking midfielder, renowned for trying to break the lines and get into advanced positions. It means he is not the ideal foil for Fernandes in the beating heart of United's engine room.",
      "Instead, United need to try and source a player who is equally comfortable defensively and progressing the ball. United have lacked ball-playing expertise at the base of their midfield for a while. Both Casemiro and Ugarte were recruited for their defensive attributes, which make them excellent destroyers, but they are not the best with the ball at their feet.",
      "United need to try and couple those two particular elements together this summer in their midfield hunt. It is understood a midfielder and a goalkeeper are being targeted alongside Bryan Mbeumo and a striker.",
      "Mbeumo, if United's ambitions fall into place, will become the club's second signing of the summer, following Cunha's £62.5m arrival from Wolves last weekend.",
      "United have taken an ambitious approach to strengthening their attack, targeting two of the Premier League's most attractive attackers. Between them, Cunha and Mbeumo have scored 56 league goals since the start of the 2023/24 season.",
      "United's recruitment has been of a scattergun nature in recent years, but it feels as though there is a welcome shift developing this summer. They need players who have Premier League experience that can come in and hit the ground running.",
      "It is why, in an ideal world, United should be attempting to sign a Premier League proven operator in their search for a midfielder. Brighton & Hove Albion star Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace are just two names that have been on the lips of a lot of United supporters, and either of them would significantly upgrade Amorim's midfield options.",
      "Baleba ticks a collection of boxes, with his defensive attributes and ability to progress the ball just two of his most eye-catching credentials. Wharton, too, is equally comfortable in and out of possession.",
      "The fact of the matter, however, is that both players, who are under contract until 2028 and 2029 respectively, are valued enormously by their clubs, meaning the challenge of signing either of them would be both tough and expensive.",
      "Brighton reportedly value Baleba at £100m and Palace view Wharton as an £80m player. United, regardless of how proactive they might be in the seller's market, are unlikely to match either of those demands.",
      "While their search to strengthen their attack has led them to obvious targets, United's search for a midfielder might not be as clear cut. This particular puzzle may require some solving."

      "If United successfully add Mbeumo to the addition of Cunha, the missing piece in their attacking jigsaw will be a striker. Signing a centre-forward has to be United's main focus this summer after finishing each of the last two Premier League campaigns with a negative goal difference.",
      "After missing out on top target Liam Delap to Chelsea, it remains to be seen in which direction United's search for a goal-getter will head in. However, links connecting the Reds with Sporting Lisbon goal machine Viktor Gyokeres have not gone away, and he remains increasingly likely to leave the Portuguese capital this summer.",
      "No stranger to Amorim after working together at Sporting, it is widely reported the Swede will be available for somewhere in the region of £60m this summer. With Chelsea having signed Delap, Arsenal chasing Benjamin Sesko's tail and Victor Osimhen still being linked with Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, United could find themselves in with a chance of having a clear run at the former Coventry City man.",
      "He has scored a whopping 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting, meaning he is one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe. Of those 97 goals, 54 were scored this season, meaning he would be a shoo-in to lead United's attack.",
      "Despite United's eagerness to get on the front foot with their recruitment this summer, it is still almost certain there will be more outgoings than incomings at Old Trafford between now and the September 1 deadline.",
      "United are planning for at least ten departures and several are expected to be from the attacking department. After allowing Marcus Rashford and Antony to head out on loan in January, the Reds now hope to offload them permanently.",
      "Alongside Jadon Sancho, Rashford and Antony have been identified as players United want to sell as a priority. Rashford is valued at £40m, Antony is available for around £32.5m and Sancho could attract a fee of around £25m after Chelsea pulled out of the obligation they were originally set to meet to sign him permanently.",
      "No member of that particular trio has a future at Old Trafford in a winger-less system, meaning it would be in everyone's best interests to go their separate ways this summer. Antony has created a market for himself after impressing out on loan at Real Betis, scoring nine goals and registering five assists, while Barcelona have declared their interest in Rashford.",
      "United also plan to offload Alejandro Garnacho after Amorim informed him that he is free to leave the club this summer. He was benched for the Europa League final and left out of the squad for United's final Premier League game of the season against Aston Villa.",
      "Napoli had a £40m bid turned down for Garnacho in January and United are expected to hold out for a higher fee. They could demand north of £50m for him.",
      "Elsewhere, Rasmus Hojlund is attracting interest from Inter Milan and United should attempt to offload him if an acceptable offer comes their way. The Dane regressed in his second season at Old Trafford, scoring just ten goals, and patience with him is wearing thin.",
      "United need to raise as much money as possible this summer via player sales to fund new additions, meaning getting Hojlund off the books could increase their chances of securing a replacement and potentially strengthen other areas of the squad.",
      "No.10/attacking midfield options: Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount, Bruno Fernandes, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Joshua Zirkzee (also a No.9 option).",
      "No.9 options: Viktor Gyokeres, Joshua Zirkzee, Chido Obi."

      "Manchester United could be in line for a surprise cash injection this summer thanks to former youngster Maxi Oyedele.",
      "According to Italian journalist and transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, Oyedele, who left United last summer to join Polish outfit Legia Warsaw, is attracting interest from a collection of clubs from across Europe.",
      "He has reported that Werder Bremen, PSV Eindhoven, Anderlecht, Club Brugge and two unnamed Championship clubs have all expressed interest in his signature after a promising debut season in Poland.",
      "It has been reported that Oyedele, 20, 'will leave' Legia this summer and is available via a release clause worth €6million (£5.05m at the current exchange rate). The defensive-midfielder made 24 appearances in his debut season at Legia, helping them win the Polish Cup for a 21st time.",
      "News of reported interest in his signature from elsewhere will be of interest to United. As a result of becoming more proactive in the seller's market last summer, the Reds inserted various clauses into a collection of outgoing deals, including the one that saw Oyedele move to Poland.",
      "According to Romano, the sell-on clause means United will inherit 40 per cent of the fee Legia bank from any potential sale of the midfielder. It means United, who were probably not anticipating Oyedele would develop at the speed he has, could bank just north of £2m.",
      "Oyedele, as proven with the current level of interest being expressed in his signature, enjoyed a strong first season in Poland. His achievements included making his debut for the national team at senior level and making five appearances in the Europa Conference League, including two quarter-final starts against Chelsea.",
      "As a result of United's smart thinking, any funds they bank via sell-on clauses they included in deals from previous windows will go towards assisting their efforts in the quest to remain compliant with the profit and sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "United's cross-city neighbours, Manchester City, have often been the masters of such scenarios in previous years, regularly offloading young talent with sell-on clauses attached to any future moves so they can receive money on the back of any future success.",
      "United also included a buy-back option in the deal that saw Oyedele move to Legia, meaning they covered all bases. Sell-on clauses were also included in other deals United completed last summer."

      "After missing out on United captain Bruno Fernandes, Al Hilal turned their attention to Osimhen to provide some star power ahead of the Club World Cup.

      "The summer transfer window has only been open for just over a week and already Manchester United have had to change course.",
      "After identifying Liam Delap as their top target to strengthen their attacking options, members of United's hierarchy must have breathed a collective sigh when they learnt of the England Under-21 international's decision to move to Chelsea.",
      "Delap, who scored 12 Premier League goals in his first and only season at Ipswich Town, was available via a £30million release clause, making him an attainable target. He held talks with a cluster of suitors, including United.",
      "As frustrating as it can be for a club to have their transfer blueprint shredded, the good news is that Delap has made his move to Stamford Bridge right at the very start of the summer, leaving United with plenty of time to explore alternative avenues.",
      "Furthermore, is missing out on Delap as big a 'blow' as some may claim it to be? He has just one season of top flight football under his belt and is still incredibly raw at the age of 22.",
      "After gambling on potential in 2023 with Rasmus Hojlund and again last summer with Joshua Zirkzee, United can ill-afford to take another risk on a striker this summer. They need a proven goalscorer who can come in and hit the ground running.",
      "Right now, a handful of names are frequently cropping up on repeat. The strikers in question are Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon and soon-to-be free agent Jonathan David.",
      "Of the Premier League's elite, United, Arsenal and Liverpool are the only three in desperate need of an out-and-out striker this summer now that Chelsea have signed Delap.",
      "Arsenal are prioritising a move for former United target and RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. The Slovakian netted 21 goals in Germany this season and he has emerged as the Gunners' preferred target to bolster the tip of their attack.",
      "Liverpool have loosely been linked with a crop of forwards, but their current priorities are to wrap up the signings of Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez and Bayer Leverkusen star Florian Wirtz.",
      "Meanwhile, despite Osimhen's move to Al-Hilal being on, off, on again and then finally off, Galatasaray are set to try their luck to re-sign the striker permanently after his productive loan spell in Turkey this season.",
      "With Arsenal, who have also been heavily linked with Gyokeres, occupied chasing Sesko, Osimhen at the centre of a saga and David being eyed by the likes of Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain, Gyokeres is shaping up to be the most accessible striker for United to chase.",
      "As soon as Ruben Amorim swapped Sporting for United last November, links connecting the Swede with Old Trafford were inevitable. Naturally, they have been persistent for months.",
      "But at a time where United desperately need a reliable goalscorer, there is a feeling developing that it may be inevitable the 27-year-old follows in in Amorim's footsteps.",
      "It is widely reported he will be available for a fee in the region of £60m this summer, which feels relatively respectable for a player that has plundered a whopping 97 goals in the last two seasons.",
      "He joined Sporting in July 2023 on the back of a prolific season with Coventry City. He was the best striker in England outside the Premier League in 2022/23 and he was linked with various Premier League clubs.",
      "However, after his agent had held talks with Amorim, it was decided Sporting was the best destination for Gyokeres to take the next step in his career. That theory has been reflected in his tally of 97 goals in 102 games.",
      "Fast, strong, aggressive and an excellent striker of the ball, Gyokeres ticks a lot of boxes. His goalscoring record in the last couple of years, for both club and country, has been astonishing and every striker ought to be judged on their record in front of goal.",
      "If United are to fulfil their mission of signing a prolific goalscorer this summer, they have no choice but to loosen the purse strings. They have already spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and a similar fee could soon be spent on Bryan Mbeumo, meaning sales will be key to funding any further new arrivals.",
      "However, failing to recruit a No.9 this summer is a non-negotiable. With Arsenal focusing on Sesko, Al-Hilal desperate to sign Osimhen and Liverpool currently focusing on other priorities, United might have a clear run at trying to attain a striker Amorim knows inside out."

      "United goalkeeper Andre Onana will also be involved for Cameroon, as will be Noussair Mazraoui (Morocco) and Amad (Ivory Coast).",
      "AFCON runs from December 21 to January 18 and clashes with a busy period in the Premier League with the hectic Christmas schedule often a defining point in the calendar.",
      "The FA Cup also starts in January for Premier League clubs and the winter transfer window will also open.",
      "Using this season's United fixture list as a guide, there were six matches during the period earmarked for AFCON this year plus two within days either side where players would be away if they advanced to the final.",
      "The date for clubs to release players is yet to be determined because the tournament falls outside FIFA window.",
      "But with the group stage running until December 31, it seems certain the quartet will miss at least four fixtures and up to seven or eight."

      "They are also targeting signings in the two attacking midfield roles of Amorim's 3-4-2-1 formation and have agreed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves.",
      "United are also keen to wrap up the signing of Bryan Mbeumo too, with the pair scoring a combined 37 goals this season.",
      "The Reds are also said to be keen to sign a new midfielder and a new wing-back but there are many United fans who feel as if they should be looking to strengthen their goalkeeping department.",
      "Andre Onana has failed to convince during his first two seasons at United following his £47million move from Inter Milan in 2023.",
      "He made an unconvincing start, recovered to end last season and start this season well, but mistakes have crept back into his game in recent months.",
      "It is likely he will remain United's number one this summer but there is an argument to be made that after two seasons the jury should be out on whether he is good enough to keep goal for United.",
      "And if reports in Italy are to be believed and Chelsea are close to agreeing an £18million package to sign AC Milan goalkeeper Mike Maignan, there may be some who question why United aren't shopping in that market at that price.",
      "The 29-year-old has proven himself to be one of the best goalkeepers in the world since moving to Milan and has won league titles in both France and Italy.",
      "His mentality impressed his former team-mate and former United forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is ironically now a senior adviser to the Milan board.",
      "When Maignan was a teenage goalkeeper coming through the ranks at PSG, he stood up to Ibrahimovic during a shooting session on the training ground.",

      "\"He was practising shooting and the ball was going past me at 400km an hour! Gianluigi Buffon, Julio Cesar, these guys wouldn’t have stopped those shots.",
      "\"He told me: ‘You’re a sh*t goalkeeper.’ For me, that wasn’t right. The next time, he came back but I stopped his shot. I had to respond: ‘You’re a sh*t attacker.’",
      "\"He just looked at me and didn’t say anything. Back in the changing room, he stopped me. He told me that it’s good, that he liked what I did and that he liked my personality.",

      "Fast forward to the present day and Maignan is France's number one and because he is out of contract at the San Siro at the end of next season, he is available at a discounted price this summer.",
      "Chelsea have identified they needed to strengthen their goalkeeping department and have spotted an opportunity to perhaps secure one of the biggest steals of this summer's transfer market.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres has been identified as a top target having impressed in Portugal for Sporting CP, but United might not have the funds to bring in the £60million-rated frontman this summer.",
      "It does mean that United may have to look for a cheaper alternative, and Dominic Calvert-Lewin is someone that has been linked, considering that he is going to be a free agent at the end of the June.",
      "However, United should avoid the temptation of moving for Calvert-Lewin due to his damning injury record and mixed form at Everton across the last couple of years.

      "However, the club is unlikely to find it this easy to complete a move for a centre-forward this summer. We all know that there is an abundance of No.10s in world football but there is now a severe lack of No.9s.",
      "This is by no means a new phenomenon - no club has ever wanted to let go a No.9 who knows where the back of the net is. These days, United cannot even use their wealth to sign the next best striker like they did with Dimitar Berbatov and Robin van Persie.",
      "Therefore, when a player like Victor Osimhen is as good as telling you to make a bid for him, United would be crazy to ignore that. Journalists Ben Jacobs and Fabrizio Romano both reported on Sunday evening that Osimhen has decided to reject a lucrative offer from Al Hilal this summer.",
      "Despite the Saudi Pro League club agreeing a £63m transfer with Napoli, Osimhen decided not to agree personal terms with the Middle East club. This rejection of Al Hilal is a huge signal that the striker wants to remain in Europe, competing at the highest level.",
      "If he was solely looking to make exceptional amounts of money, he would have accepted Al Hilal's offer. If Osimhen wanted move to Galatasaray, that deal could have been struck by now as the Turkish club have been trying desperately to convince him to make his stay permanent.",
      "Now, it is up to United to put forward an alternative to him. Beyond the two clubs mentioned above, there are a lack of options currently on the table for Osimhen.",
      "Yes, United cannot offer the Champions League but they can offer him the opportunity to play for one of the world's biggest clubs in the most competitive top league on the planet. Surely it is worth at least attempting to sign a player that has scored 37 goals this season."

      "After seeing an opening offer worth £55m turned down in midweek, discussions between the two clubs are understood to remain ongoing and an improved bid is expected to be made.",
      "Having already signed Cunha, who scored 17 goals across all competitions in 2024-25, the prospect of United adding Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals, to their attacking pool is exciting.",
      "United's attack was blunt for much of the 2024/25 campaign, so the fact they could start next season with two of the Premier League's most consistent recent goalscorers in their attack is extremely encouraging.",
      "Should Mbeumo join Cunha at Old Trafford, the general feeling is they will occupy the two No.10 positions. Cunha regularly operated as the left-sided No.10 in a 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, while Mbeumo has often drifted inside from the right flank at Brentford.",
      "United's switch to a 3-4-2-1 formation under Ruben Amorim last November means Cunha's transition to Old Trafford should be fairly seamless. He is a specialist in the No.10 role and the uniqueness of Amorim's formation means that he needs specialist operators to occupy key positions within it.",
      "Despite Cunha and potentially Mbeumo also offering United a sense of versatility, which chief executive Omar Berrada vowed the club would target this summer, Cunha's experience as a No.10 makes him a tailor-made fit for the role Amorim wants him to fill.",
      "And signing specialist players for specific positions is a route former United manager Jose Mourinho wanted to go down in the 2016 summer transfer window, while also acknowledging the importance of having players who could also play in different roles.",
      "\"We made a nucleus of four priorities, four positions, to give a certain balance to the squad,\" Mourinho said in July 2016. \"To give a certain push in terms of the qualities I need and want.",
      "\"As you know, the ones with more vision. I am more a manager that likes specialists rather than multi-functional players because I am clear in my approach.",
      "\"Multi-functional players – you need one or two if you have three central defenders injured. But, basically, I want specialists.\"",
      "United's early-window recruitment has given a clear indication that Amorim is after both specialists and a sprinkling of versatility. Multi-functional forwards have been missing from United's attacking ranks in recent years, making the addition of Cunha and the potential addition of Mbeumo extremely positive.",
      "However, Cunha, despite being capable of playing as a No.9, is, first and foremost, a specialist No.10, who will slot straight into the left-sided No.10 position. He is a maverick, capable of making something happen in the blink of an eye from that particular area of the pitch.",
      "The unique nature of Amorim's system means he will need specialist operators, hence why he was so determined to sign Patrick Dorgu back in January to operate at wing-back. He cannot rely on attempting to put square pegs in round holes."

      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha on the opening day of the window last Sunday, United have now set their sights on signing Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo. After seeing an opening offer worth £55million rejected, they are expected to go back in with a new and improved bid.",
      "United signed Cunha for £62.5m after activating his Wolves release clause and Brentford are expected to demand a similar fee for Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals this season. It means if they are successful in their efforts to sign Mbeumo, two attacking signings will set them back around £120m.",
      "After failing to qualify for next season's Champions League, United's transfer budget this summer is not as big as it would have been, putting even more pressure on the club to flex their muscles in the seller's market. Departures could reach double figures and United have identified a crop of players they want to move on as priorities.",
      "To complicate matters further and put more strain on United's finances, it should not be forgotten that the club owes £89m in transfer fees this summer for players they signed in previous windows, meaning the prospect of signing Mbeumo in addition to Cunha could see their spending eclipse the £200m mark after landing just two new arrivals, albeit those fees will likely be amortised across the length of their contracts.",
      "Speaking to Gary Neville for Sky back in March, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said: \"If you look at the players that we will buy this summer that we did not buy, in other words, we're paying for, that it is, we're buying Antony this summer. We're buying [Jadon] Sancho this summer, we're buying [Rasmus] Hojlund, we're buying Casemiro, we're buying [Andre] Onana.",
      "\"It's not a light switch. In your day [Neville's], you bought a player and that was it. I know that the bill we will pay this summer is £89m for players that have been signed previously. If we buy no players, we write a cheque for £89m this summer.\"",
      "It is not uncommon for clubs to pay transfer fees in instalments, covering several years, just as United are doing in Cunha's case, but the club has been guilty of paying over the odds in recent years, meaning they are still paying the price for underwhelming and failed signings.",
      "For example, if United sign Mbeumo for a fee in the region of £60m, their outgoings before sales will stand at around £210m, putting immense pressure on themselves to flex their muscles in the seller's market as quickly as possible.",
      "Mbeumo will almost certainly be United's final incoming before they can think about signing anyone else, with the club desperately in need of overseeing a collection of departures.",
      "United have prioritised the sales of Marcus Rashford, Sancho and Antony while Alejandro Garnacho has been informed he can leave at the right price. Rashford is valued at £40m, Sancho was originally expected to join Chelsea for around £25m and Antony is set to be available for around £32.5m.",
      "If United successfully offload those three for the valuations they have set, they will bank just under £100m, meaning their departures would cover the £89m they owe in transfer fees for previous signings. Napoli had a £40m bid for Garnacho knocked back in January, meaning United are likely to request upwards of £50m for him.",
      "However, until clubs come knocking in pursuit of the players United are actively trying to offload, incomings risk grinding to a halt.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim, like all coaches, will want the bulk of his business done early, meaning United will have to try and push sales through as quickly as they can. Without departures, there is only so much they will be able to do this summer."

      "At this stage, there are no signs that Onana would be leaving the club however a replacement or at least another goalkeeper who can challenge the Cameroon stopper would be desirable. On the surface, Martinez appears to be the ideal candidate to do just that.",
      "He has become one of the defining goalkeepers of his generation, helping Argentina to World Cup glory, and he's won the Yashin Trophy at the Ballon d'Or awards twice in consecutive years. However, what's being overlooked is that, perhaps, Martinez's best days are behind him.",
      "The Villa man, now 32, is unlikely to win the Yashin Trophy again this year and his performances are not much more consistent to that of Onana. In his (potential) last game for the West Midlands club, United fans saw first-hand the issues with Martinez - his rush to the head arguably a contributing factor in his team missing out on the Champions League.",
      "So, if not Martinez, who should United be looking at instead?",
      "Well, the search does not need to travel too far from Old Trafford.",
      "In Liverpool, Jordan Pickford has displayed huge loyalty to Everton, but you wonder if United would be able to test that resolve with an offer this summer. The former Sunderland man has occupied the only role tougher than that of United goalkeeper for a considerable period of time - England's No.1.",
      "After a shaky start, Pickford has grown into the role and clearly has the experience to handle the big occasion that would be thrust at him if he were to move to Old Trafford. Arguably, United would be able to negotiate a cheaper deal for Pickford, as Martinez has four years remaining on his contract, while the Everton shot-stopper has just two years remaining.",
      "Everton's move to Bramley Moore Docks could make things harder for United with Pickford, perhaps, keen to play at their new stadium. But, if United are going to invest their time trying to convince a goalkeeper to sign, then the 31-year-old England number one may make more sense than Martinez."

      "Manchester United have wasted no time in trying to make their mark on this summer's transfer window.",
      "After wrapping up the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves last Sunday, United are now attempting to secure the signature of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After discovering the Cameroonian is keen on a move to Old Trafford, United tabled an opening offer for the 25-year-old in midweek, understood to be worth £55million, but it was rejected. However, they are understood to remain in talks with the Bees and a revised offer is expected.",
      "Having signed Cunha for £62.5m, Brentford are expected to demand a similar fee for their talisman, who plundered 20 Premier League goals this season. He is an established top flight operator and United want to sign players who can come in and hit the ground running.",
      "It is understood United have recruited Cunha, 26, to operate in the left-sided No.10 position, meaning Mbeumo is being targeted with the expectation of operating from the right-sided No.10 position. United also remain determined to sign a striker to operate down the middle.",
      "Following Ruben Amorim's appointment last November, United immediately transitioned to a 3-4-2-1 system, meaning the two roles previously reserved for the wingers are now occupied by attacking-midfielders.",
      "As a result of United's plan to cut their cloth this summer, the sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony, who are all natural wingers, have been prioritised. Fellow winger Alejandro Garnacho has also been informed he can leave.",
      "The only winger who does have a future at United is Amad. He quickly got to grips with the responsibility of being a wing-back and flexed his muscles as a No.10, meaning he has a key part to play in Amorim's plans.",
      "But with United now attempting to add Mbeumo to their pool of attackers, the expectation is that Amad's long-term position could be at right wing-back. Mbeumo, however, is also capable of playing up front, meaning that could open up a window of opportunity for Amad to start in a more advanced role.",
      "Cunha, however, is a specialist No.10. That means Bruno Fernandes looks increasingly likely to be tasked with pulling the strings from the centre of midfield.",
      "But while he and Amad have alternative roles they may find themselves occupying in Amorim's first-choice XI, Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount do not necessarily have that same guarantee.",
      "Mainoo has struggled to nail down a place in the team this calendar year, regularly finding himself flittering between the centre of midfield and either of the two No.10 positions. His profile as a forward-thinking midfielder means the prospect of him partnering Fernandes in the centre of midfield risks leaving United vulnerable to opposition attacks.",
      "Injuries hindered Mainoo's chances of settling into any form of rhythm under Amorim, meaning many believe he has not yet had a fair opportunity to flex his muscles in a 3-4-2-1 system. Many believed Amorim's appointment would mark the beginning of a long-term midfield partnership with Manuel Ugarte.",
      "However, Cunha's arrival means Fernandes is almost certainly going to occupy one of the two No.8 positions. Ideally, he needs a defensive-minded operator next to him to allow him to play his natural game and advance into attacking positions.",
      "It means Mainoo is not guaranteed a regular starting berth next season, likewise Mount. Despite being signed from Chelsea two years ago to operate in a three-man midfield, he is much more effective in Amorim's system when occupying one of the two No.10 roles.",
      "He started the final four games of this season, including the Europa League final, as the left-sided No.10, highlighting where Amorim sees his long-term future. However, Cunha's arrival and the possibility of Mbeumo being added to the equation means he may not be a regular starter come August.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is another member of the current squad who is at his best when playing as a No.10. After failing to make his mark as a No.9, his performances improved once he was tasked with operating slightly deeper and linking the midfield with the attack.",
      "With all of that mind, United could find themselves with Cunha, Mbeumo, Fernandes, Mainoo, Mount, Zirkzee and Amad all pushing for starts in either of the two No.10 positions.",
      "Seven into two, of course, doesn't go, meaning Amorim and the United hierarchy may have to make some tough decisions. Only Fernandes and Amad have alternative roles where they could realistically remain guaranteed starters."

      "Manchester United have sealed one high profile transfer and are closing in on another.",
      "The arrival of Matheus Cunha from Wolves is already agreed and the Reds are working on a deal with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Those two signings would be a statement of intent so early in the summer and provide Ruben Amorim with a pair of proven Premier League players who can bring creativity, goals and versatility.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo scored 35 top flight goals between them last season and seem natural fits for the two number 10 positions in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 shape. The United chief made it clear last season that he wouldn't be switching systems and this summer offers the Reds a chance to recruit to suit.",
      "The arrival of Cunha and Mbeumo will have a knock on effect elsewhere in the squad.",
      "Bruno Fernandes could retreat to a central midfielder rather than operating in an advanced role. The Portugal international increasingly played in the deeper midfield role as the season progressed and has the capabilities to be a success in a dictating role.",
      "Amad would also seemingly lose his spot as a number 10 despite an impressive campaign last term. But the Ivory Coast international is capable of playing as a right wing back in Amorim's system while slotting in further forward should the need arise.",
      "The 22-year-old has proven he can play the role under Amorim, and his dribbling is an asset there. He can come inside to link play and offer an overload centrally or go down the outside on his right foot. That is the type of attacking threat Amorim wants from players in those positions.",
      "Diogo Dalot would be the natural competition for Amad and if the latter does amend his position then it frees Noussair Mazraoui up to be a centre back option. The 27-year-old played a number of positions during his debut campaign at Old Trafford but he does not offer the attacking input needed for a wing back role and slotting in as one of the back three would make the most sense.",
      "United are unlikely to cap their business at the arrival of Cunha and Mbeumo with a striker also on the shortlist. A move for Liam Delap failed after the 22-year-old opted to choose Chelsea but the Reds are likely to explore alternatives in the summer, albeit they will likely need to sell before they strengthen further.",
      "The addition of a centre forward would be bad news for Rasmus Hojlund, who struggled in his second campaign at United. The Dane, who is attracting interest from Inter Milan, had shown promise and potential in his debut season but regressed amid the pressure of leading the line.",
      "Still only 22, Hojlund could benefit from a more reduced role next term while offering industry and energy off the bench. He could become something of an impact player, called upon when attacking resources are required to offer another forward option. It's not what Hojlund will want, but it might be just what he needs."

It was a lot of money to finish in the bottom half but then they sorted themselves out.",

      "3) Moises Caicedo – £100m/€117.1m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThere is every chance Caicedo could jump to the top of this list soon, with around half of the £15m in add-ons a grovelling Chelsea had to offer described as easily achievable in some quarters. Liverpool had put together a £111m package but, much to some hilarious and entirely grown-up Proper Red fury, the Ecuadorean wasn’t interested.",

      "4) Paul Pogba – £93.2m/€110m (Juventus to Man Utd, August 2016)\nMan Utd never did figure out how to unlock Pogba, with the weary efforts of three different managers ultimately ending in frustration, viruses, haircuts and a second Old Trafford exit to join Juventus as a free agent.",
      "",
      "5) Jude Bellingham – £88.5m/€103m (Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid, June 2023)\nThe idea of a £100m bargain sounds particularly weird but Bellingham is as close as is possible. Real Madrid would be thrilled if add-ons taking the deal to £115m/€133.9m were activated over the course of a six-year contract for a 21-year-old with more than 300 senior career appearances who will probably break soon.",

      "6) Frenkie de Jong – £74.5m/€86m (Ajax to Barcelona, July 2019)\nGiven a choice also involving Paris Saint-Germain and both Manchester clubs, De Jong cashed in on his rising Ajax stock at the absolute peak to join Barcelona just as they started financially collapsing in on themselves. The Dutchman has been central to their revival.",

And while the club is no doubt wise to protect its wage structure, he would’ve been prefect for us. 18 year-old Antonio Cordero looks promising, but isn’t yet a first-team contributor, and that transfer has probably been quietly agreed weeks or months ago. It’s already starting to feel like last summer.\nChris C, Toon Army DC",

      "Trophies are great, but we need to stop trying to pretend that winning ones that Arsenal have played too well over consecutive seasons to compete for should be seen as a greater level of success!

      "But here’s the thing – I don’t care.  We did win a major trophy, we are in the champions league, we do have a young squad that can compete with some sensible additions and a more tactically astute manager, and we avoided the ETH trap of keeping the wrong guy for (understandable) emotional reasons.  Sonny came out and said that Ange ‘changed the trajectory of the club’ and by winning something that may well be true, and he’ll always be remembered fondly but this really is the best of both worlds.",
      "Now of course Daniel Levy is fully capable of clutching defeat from the jaws of victory by signing a another bunch of 18 year olds, but if we buy a proper 6 and at least one top notch forward plus a couple of depth pieces this really is an attractive squad to work with over the next few years.  If I was Frank or Poch I’d jump at the chance.\nPhil, London",

Tottenham did not lose those games because they were inferior to their opponents,you could see they gave up on the league and were  focusing on their cup performance. There was little interest in playing in the league.",

      "But now Hojlund has revealed that he is expecting to be part of Amorim’s side next season with his contract running until the summer of 2030.",

If the players haven’t got it, in their heart and in their heads, you can’t change that. If you look at last season, Man Utd shouldn’t be anywhere near that level again in my lifetime.”",

      "“I went through something similar when I was at Aberdeen – for a year I was absolutely horrendous and it really gets to you, you almost lose your power to run and you feel debilitated.",

He played 13 times for the Reds, was praised by Jurgen Klopp for his “big skills”, had seven spells on loan and eventually left in 2022. Maribor, to save you a Google.",
      "",
      "15 – Fran Merida (£2.2m, Barcelona to Arsenal in 2005)\n“An absolutely amazing player,” was the assessment Arsene Wenger once offered of Merida, who replaced fellow former Gunners prodigy Jermaine Pennant as the most expensive 15-year-old footballer in history. The Spaniard retired in 2024 in his mid-30s.",
      "",
      "16 – Pietro Pellegri (£17.5m, Genoa to Monaco in January 2018)\nThere is precious little separating Pellegri from fellow youthful Monaco recruit Willem Geubbels, who joined a few months later. Neither made an impact in the principality.",

      "18 – Leny Yoro (£52m, Lille to Man Utd in July 2024)\nMan Utd revelled in beating Real Madrid to “one of the most exciting young defenders in world football”, even if it did largely come down to which side was willing to spend the most money.",

      "29 – Diego Costa (£57m, Chelsea to Atletico Madrid in January 2018)\nZinedine Zidane was unmovable for almost two decades, but then Diego Costa won two Premier League titles in 20-goal seasons, was dumped by Antonio Conte over text, did not play for months and went AWOL, yet Chelsea still sold him back to Atletico for almost double what they initially paid, despite the striker turning 30 later that year and the Spanish side operating under a transfer ban. Todd Boehly could never.",
      "",
      "30 – Harry Kane (£100m, Spurs to Bayern Munich in August 2023)\nRaising the bar set by predecessor Casemiro by quite a way, Kane finally broke his Daniel Levy shackles with a 47-goal gap to Alan Shearer’s all-time Premier League record, so desperate was he to finally grab a couple of trophies.",
      "",
      "31 – Neymar (£86.3m, Paris Saint-Germain to Al-Hilal in August 2023)\nFor more than 23 years, Gabriel Batistuta reigned as the most expensive 31-year-old in football history; it was a simpler time. Then Saudi Arabia came along, changed the game and rescued a load of superclubs from their financial burdens, including even mega-rich PSG.",
      "",
      "32 – Riyad Mahrez (£30m, Manchester City to Al-Ahli in July 2023)\nYep. Not that Manchester City were desperate to offload Mahrez, but the Algerian had won everything on offer in England and earned his jaunt in the Middle East.",
      "",
      "33 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£99m, Real Madrid to Juventus in July 2018)\nFive trophies, 101 goals in 134 games and consecutive Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, but still a failure of a signing after being picked up to win the Champions League – or at least to stop scoring against Juventus in the Champions League – yet not being able to take them beyond the quarter-finals after being knocked out by Ajax, Lyon and Porto.",
      "",
      "34 – Yann Sommer (£8.3m, Borussia Monchengladbach to Bayern Munich in January 2023)\nA Sommer signing completed in January, with Manuel Neuer injured and out for some time it was decided by Bayern that they would shop locally for a short-term replacement. And that he was, joining Inter that August after winning the Bundesliga.",
      "",
      "35 – Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (£8.4m, Marseille to Al Qadsiah in July 2024)\nA 30-goal season with Marseille was slightly better than the campaign he spent playing irregularly and scoring even less often for Chelsea, with Aubameyang using that rediscovery of his goalscoring prowess to earn a Saudi pay day.",
      "",
      "36 – Cristiano Ronaldo (£12.9m, Juventus to Man Utd in August 2021)\nManchester City lurked, Man Utd panicked, Sir Alex Ferguson was mobilised and Rio Ferdinand crowed. And for a while Ronaldo scored. But then a non-sycophantic grown-up was appointed as his manager and toys were expelled from prams with the toadying help of Piers Morgan as the Portuguese prompted a Saudi revolution.",

      "Man Utd have been responsible for three of the 20 biggest signings ever involving defenders, while rejecting then buying another who is in the top ten twice.",
      "",
      "1) Harry Maguire – £80m/€97m (Leicester to Man Utd, August 2019)\nAfter vetoing a summer 2018 move for Maguire because of a reticence to pay a potential world-record fee for a defender, Man Utd paid a very much real world-record fee for a defender to sign the Leicester centre-half the following year. And it would probably take about a quarter of that to tempt them into selling now.",
      "",
      "2) Josko Gvardiol – £77m/€89m (Leipzig to Manchester City, August 2023)\nA standout World Cup for Croatia and another season of Bundesliga excellence – although Lionel Messi and Erling Haaland tried their utmost to ruin both respectively – finally earned Gvardiol his long-awaited Premier League move for less than the original world-record demands.",
      "",
      "3) Virgil van Dijk – £75m/€84m (Southampton to Liverpool, January 2018)\nThe benchmark was set by Van Dijk, who claimed “I can’t do anything about the price” before doing everything to justify it, helping Liverpool reach a Champions League final within his first few months, winning the lot by his fourth year and raking in awards and acclaim in equal measure.",
      "",
      "4) Wesley Fofana – £70m/€80.4m (Leicester to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt took three rejected Chelsea bids – worth £50m, £60m and finally £70m with add-ons included – before Leicester finally caved and accepted up to £75m for a defender with 57 top-flight career league appearances. Even before Fofana’s serious knee issues, it wasn’t exactly going to plan.",
      "",
      "5) Lucas Hernandez – £68m/€80m (Atletico Madrid to Bayern Munich, July 2019)\nBayern Munich’s record signing was a bit of a dud, reaching just over 100 games in four years but watching the entire 2020 Champions League final win from the bench and being sold at a considerable loss to PSG.",
      "",
      "6) Matthijs de Ligt – £67.8m/€75m (Ajax to Juventus, July 2019)\nWhen the vultures picked at the carcass of Ajax in 2019, De Jong and De Ligt were the parts deemed most succulent. Man Utd might have had their ridiculous reasons for turning the latter down before signing him years later, but Juventus were not put off by his father’s weight; after three underwhelming years they might wish they had been.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Dias – £65m/€71.6m (Benfica to Manchester City, September 2020)\nTwo days after Jamie Vardy scored a hat-trick in a 5-2 humbling of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola took his Etihad spending on defenders beyond £400m on one of the best of the lot.",
      "",
      "8) Matthijs de Ligt – £62m/€70m (Juventus to Bayern Munich, July 2022)\n“I was still really young. I went from a kid who did everything well at Ajax to a defender at Juventus, where every little thing I did wrong was seen by everybody,” De Ligt has said of his brief time in Turin, which he swapped for a role out of the spotlight as the “boss” of Bayern’s defence for a couple of years.",
      "",
      "9) Achraf Hakimi – £60m/€71m (Inter to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2021)\nAfter playing for Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Inter, Hakimi had enough of representing clubs with European pedigree and so rocked up in Paris to win a few domestic trophies and keep Kylian Mbappe company for a bit. Then Mbappe left and PSG won the sodding big one after Hakimi’s muted celebration kicked off a Champions League final dismantling of former club Inter.",
      "",
      "10) Joao Cancelo – £60m/€65m (Juventus to Manchester City, August 2019)\nSwapping places with Danilo, Cancelo went from bit-part player to one of the best in the league, then suddenly a Bayern Munich and Barcelona loanee and Saudi import, all within five ludicrous years.",
      "",
      "11) Aymeric Laporte – £57m/€65m (Athletic Bilbao to Manchester City, January 2018)\nAfter Manchester City balked at the numbers involved in procuring Van Dijk from Southampton, they simply switched them around and went for Laporte in a club-record move instead. It went less well but still OK.",
      "",
      "12) Marc Cucurella – £55m/€68m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2022)\nIt doesn’t feel as though the add-ons potentially taking this deal to £63m were activated in a dreadful couple of years for Cucurella the individual and the Chelsea collective. European Championship glory with Spain sparked a turnaround at club level.",
      "",
      "13) Leny Yoro – £52.1m/€61.8m (Lille to Man Utd, July 2024)\nAnother £7m in add-ons is built into a deal which saw Manchester United ‘outmanoeuvre’ Real Madrid and Liverpool by spending sums other clubs absolutely did not want to spend on an 18-year-old with 60 first-team career appearances.",
      "",
      "14) Benjamin Mendy – £52m/€57.5m (Monaco to Manchester City, July 2017)\nAn incredibly rare misstep for a Manchester City side which tends to spend such considerable sums well.",
      "",
      "15) David Luiz – £50m/€62.5m (Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain, June 2014)\nDomestic Quadruples were won in both his full seasons in Paris, before Chelsea bought the Brazilian straight back for £16m less.",
      "",
      "16) Dean Huijsen – £50m/€59.4m (Bournemouth to Real Madrid, June 2025)\nA ridiculous success story for Bournemouth, who plucked Huijsen from a panicking Juventus and flipped a huge profit on the Spanish centre-half within a single season when Real Madrid came calling.",
      "",
      "17) Benjamin White – £50m/€58m (Brighton to Arsenal, July 2021)\nArsenal started the bidding at £42m and had five offers turned down before acquiescing to Brighton’s initial demand for a guaranteed £50m, and all parties can be happy with their lot.",
      "",
      "18) John Stones – £50m/€57m (Everton to Manchester City, August 2016)\nReckon it might be safe to assume the £2.5m in add-ons have been achieved for a brilliant defender and apparently even better midfielder, even if various parts of him are made of glass.",
      "",
      "19) Kyle Walker £50m/€56.7m (Tottenham to Manchester City, July 2017)\nIt seemed preposterous at the time but the only absurd thing six years on is just how much Walker won as a trusted Guardiola lieutenant before both player and club sought something new.",
      "",
      "20) Lisandro Martinez – £48.3m/€57.3m (Ajax to Man Utd, July 2022)\nHe’s 5’9″ and Man Utd quite justifiably adore their short, World Cup-winning king.",

      "There’s encouragement from Europe for Arsenal and Manchester United fans, but Manchester City’s urgency is evident…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…\n20) Nico Williams – Athletic Bilbao to Arsenal\nOwing to Williams’ not-prohibitive release clause, this should be relatively simple if Arsenal really want to do it. But their interest is complicated by other costs that might be involved in signing the winger, for whom a new deal in Bilbao is not out of the question. This one seems to be getting further away, not closer. And it’s hard to ignore the spectre of Barca here.",
      "",
      "19) Hugo Ekitike – Eintracht Frankfurt to Chelsea\nLiverpool were linked with the France forward but Chelsea have made an approach to Eintracht Frankfurt. The Blues’ problem: the Germans want £85million and they have little motivation to dramatically lower that demand.",
      "",
      "18) Mohammed Kudus 🆕 – West Ham to Chelsea\nThere’s a lot of noise around Kudus in recent days, the most recent suggesting he’s been offered to Chelsea for £85million. Kind offer, but not one the Blues are likely to take West Ham up on without a hefty discount. Robert Sanchez could be a makeweight.",
      "",
      "17) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Napoli\nRuben Amorim has made it painfully clear that Garnacho has no future at Old Trafford, which is a problem when they are asking for £60million. Napoli will not pay that. We await the awkwardness of Garnacho returning to United for pre-season before the serious conversations start.",

      "",
      "16) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nArsenal seemed to be heavy favourites to land Gyokeres but the Gunners are faffing while they suss out which striker they can do a better deal for. Right now, it’s gone a little quiet between Arsenal and Gyokeres and there seems to be more noise around the other fella.",
      "",
      "15) 🔼 Emiliano Martinez – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nMartinez seems to have said his goodbyes to Villa and though he was linked with Barcelona, it seems the Catalans are pushing forward on a deal for Joan Garcia. There is renewed speculation of United’s intent to move for Martinez, for whom they made an offer in January, according to one report.",
      "👉 Martinez need not act the d*** if he’s Man Utd’s pick to replace oblivious Onana",
      "",
      "14) Viktor Gyokeres 🆕 – Sporting to Manchester United\nWith Arsenal yet to make a decision, there are plenty of reports that Gyokeres is open to a move to Old Trafford after all. Which may be a consequence of the queue at Sporting’s door being more sparse than many of us expected. But if United can get it done, it would be a step on the road to regaining some credibility.",
      "",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack.",
      "",
      "11) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to West Ham\nGiven Ramsdale’s habit of getting relegated, do West Ham really want to do this? Apparently so. Talks have taken place, with the Hammers set to be liable for £20million unless they can play on the fact Saints want the keeper’s £100k-a-wages off their books.",
      "",
      "10) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nApparently unmoved by the Champions League, Mbeumo has stated his preference for United over Newcastle, Arsenal and Spurs, but Brentford, not unreasonably, want a similar fee to that the Red Devils gave Wolves for Matheus Cunha. A first bid went in – £45million plus £10million – which was doomed to fail. A second ‘take-it-or-leave-it- offer is imminent.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThe Slovenia striker has overtaken Gyokeres as the favourite to fill the gaping chasm in the centre of Arsenal’s attack. After much deliberation, it seems the Gunners favour a deal with RB Leipzig over whatever they could get out of Sporting. Talk have taken place ‘in the last 48 hours’ and seem to be progressing nicely.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Mike Maignan – AC Milan to Chelsea\nChelsea have made it clear to Milan they are keen on the France keeper, but they won’t pay the £25million the Rossoneri want for a player entering the final year of his contract. Chelsea are said to be offering £10million for now, so there is some talking to be done. But whatever they pay up, it will be worth it.\n7) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool may have had one bid worth £109million turned down but the Reds have gone balls out for Wirtz and they won’t walk away over a few euros, especially when the player has matched their intent by stating he wants Anfield over the Allianz Arena. Once Wirtz gets international duty out of the way this weekend, we can expect some progress.",
      "👉 Five reasons why Florian Wirtz may not actually be a good signing for Liverpool",
      "6) 🔼 Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. Reports suggest there is no reason for Arsenal fans to panic, with agreements in place between all parties. We’ll see next week after the international break.\n5) 🔼 Rayan Cherki – Lyon to Manchester City\nCity got the easy part – they have agreed personal terms with Cherki – done early and have reportedly struck a deal with Lyon. City are in a hurry, so expect this to be one of three deals confirmed in the next week.",
      "",
      "4) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nWord is it’s happening. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Kepa – Chelsea to Arsenal\nYet another Chelsea cast-off wanted by the obsessed Mikel Arteta but £5m for a back-up keeper is not bad business and a deal is close.",
      "",
      "2) Tijjani Reijnders – AC Milan to Manchester City\nIt’s pretty much done, apparently. City have agreed a fee of £46million to sign the midfielder, with Milan hoping to net another £12.5million in add-ons. Reijnders and Rodri in midfield? City won’t be sh*t again next season.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Rayan Ait-Nouri – Wolves to Manchester City \nEveryone seems to be going with the line that a deal is done for what looks like a knockdown £33.7million fee. City want it done before next week and a medical is said to have passed by without issue."

      "According to reports, a ‘decision’ has been made on Alejandro Garnacho as he ‘will leave’ Premier League giants Manchester United this summer.",
      "Garnacho has endured a rough six months at Man Utd as he has butted heads with head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The winger was omitted from United’s squad for December’s Manchester derby as Amorim argued that his and Marcus Rashford’s attitude and performance in training were not good enough.",
      "Garnacho appeared to respond better to this setback and swiftly returned to the first team, while Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan in January.",
      "However, Garnacho was a bit-part player during the run-in and he only had a brief cameo off the bench in United’s 1-0 Europa League final defeat against Spurs.",
      "READ: Fernandes butchered in the Mailbox as ‘crying little weakling’ with Ange given fond farewell",
      "Garnacho hit out at Amorim and United’s dire season in an angry outburst after this match and it was revealed ahead of the final day of the Premier League season that he’s been told by the head coach to ‘find a new club’.",
      "There has clearly been a clash of personalities between Garnacho and Amorim, with a summer transfer the right outcome for all parties.",
      "While Garnacho has a lot of potential, his performances were poor during the 2024/25 season and he does not fit into Amorim’s system as he’s struggled in the No.10 role.",
      "Man Utd opened the door to Garnacho leaving in January as they looked to raise funds and he was pursued by Serie A giants Napoli as they tried to replace Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.",
      "This transfer did not go through, but they remain a contender to sign Garnacho, who has also been linked with Bayer Leverkusen following their appointment of former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "Premier League clubs have also been linked with Garnacho, with Chelsea among the contenders to sign him and Spurs mentioned as a left-field option.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has not named the Premier League teams who have ‘called’ for Garnacho, but he insists ‘three’ English sides are ‘very keen’.",
      "He tweeted: ‘Alejandro Garnacho will leave Man United, decision confirmed on player and club side — set to part ways.",
      "‘Understand staying in Premier League serious option with 3 clubs already very keen… after Bayer Leverkusen and Italian clubs calling.’",
      "Romano has also provided an update on Man Utd’s pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo. He explained: “Manchester United and Brentford were back in club-to-club talks for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "“After the first meeting, £45m plus £10m was rejected by Brentford. The clubs have been in contact again,” Romano said.",
      "“Let’s see when the official bid will come, but it’ll be closer to what the Bees want. Brentford started at £70m, but as always with negotiations, they can drop to something like what Man Utd paid for Matheus Cunha, £62.5m. Let’s see how the conversation will go.",
      "“Mbeumo wants to go to Man Utd, despite approaches from Newcastle, Arsenal and more clubs. He’s got an agreement with the club.”",
      "Chelsea reportedly ‘remain’ keen on the signing of a Manchester United forward, as they are looking to replace Jadon Sancho after deciding against signing him personally.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘desperately searching’ for a buyer for a flop signing, as they have been torn to pieces by former coach Rene Meulensteen, who labelled his signing “stupid ...",
      "Premier League runners-up Arsenal are now ‘advancing’ in their attempts to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig, according to widespread reports.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Liverpool have ‘agreed’ a deal to complete their second signing of the summer transfer window.",
      "Ex-Man Utd goalkeeper Ben Foster has hit out at Alejandro Garnacho’s behaviour this season and thinks his haircut in the Europa League final summed him up.",
      "Serie A champions Napoli are interested in signing Man Utd centre-back Lisandro Martinez this summer as well as Alejandro Garnacho, according to reports."

      "Some Ratcliffe decisions have been deemed unnecessary, but this programme appears to have served its purpose as Gyokeres would add to United’s positive start to this window.",
      "Gyokeres’ fine form has fuelled speculation linking him with several elite Premier League and European clubs, but Man Utd and Arsenal have been leading the pursuit for his signature.",
      "For a while, Arsenal appeared to be his most likely destination, but they have also been targeting RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko and recent reports have indicated that they are leaning towards signing the Slovenia international.",

      "Despite failing to live up to expectations at Old Trafford, Hojlund is still popular with clubs in Serie A, where his performances for Atalanta in 2022-23 caught Man Utd’s eye in the first place.",
      "The Denmark international has scored 14 goals in 62 games in the Premier League since he left Italy at the end of that season but it appears that some of the peninsula’s big hitters haven’t been put off by his inability to elevate himself beyond the quagmire of United’s recent form.",

      "The dynamic midfield player left Old Trafford in 2020 with a handful of Premier League appearances under his belt, joining Ligue 1 side Lille before being immediately loaned to Boavista.",
      "Gomes, who was part of the England team that won the Under-21 European Championship two years ago, has not yet been selected by senior boss Thomas Tuchel, who takes charge of his third game when the Three Lions face Andorra in a World Cup qualifier in Barcelona on Saturday.",
      "The midfielder allowed his contract at Lille to expire and his search for a new club could soon be over, according to Sami Mokbel and BBC Sport. A move to Marseille appears to be on the cards.",
      "“Discussions are said to be progressing positively, with the Ligue 1 side hopeful they can seal his transfer in the coming days,” reports Mokbel.",
      "“The deal would see Gomes, who is yet to feature for England under Thomas Tuchel, link up with former Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi and remain playing in France.”",
      "UPDATES ON MAN UTD FROM F365:\n👉 Man Utd making ‘best’ moves with £125m swoop already explained by Neville ‘policy’\n👉 Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Sancho, Antony bottom five, Ronaldo 7th; Mbeumo next?\n👉 Man Utd star Fernandes reveals Amorim asked him ‘not to go’ as huge Saudi move shot down",
      "Renowned for his controlled midfield play and an impact that belies his physical stature, Gomes was part of the team that took Lille from mid-table in 2021-22 back into the European places the following year.",
      "They finished in fourth place in 2023-24 and successfully negotiated the Champions League play-off rounds before qualifying in an impressive seventh from the new league phase.",
      "They were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund in the round of 16 but wins against Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Bologna, Sturm Graz and Feyenoord made it a campaign to remember. Gomes, whose last season with Lille was affected by injury, played in only two of those victories.",
      "Lille finished fifth in 2024-25 and had to settle for the Europa League next season but Gomes will continue in the Champions League if and when a switch to Marseille is finalised.",
      "The Londoner made his England debut from the bench against the Republic of Ireland in the Nations League in September and played the full 90 minutes in the next game against Finland at Wembley, Harry Kane’s 100th for his country.",
      "Gomes also started the reverse fixture in Helsinki in October before a late appearance as a substitute against Ireland in November.",
      "Before talks advanced with Marseille, Edmonton-born Gomes was linked with a possible return to Man Utd as well as with interest from Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United.",

      "And yet in none of the articles do Tottenham feature. Recent Europa League winners and therefore, hilariously, Champions League participants next season, and…..nothing. Not a thing.",
      "Levy is surely the only person on God’s green earth capable of taking all the exuberance of that night, and the bidding farewell of seventeen years of hurt, and turn it into…well, not quite sure really. A club in limbo? A club in purgatory waiting for the final sentencing – Levy growing like the Genie in Aladdin, great swirling dark clouds filled with acid rain, ready to flood the club once again in his mediocrity.",
      "I know, I know – chill out, but we’ve seen this film far too often to think otherwise.\nDan",
      "",
      "Farewell to a Spurs legend\nI think we all knew it was coming, but the news breaking still hurt:",
      "The Ange era is over at Spurs.",
      "Many fans were sick of him. Many in the media and from other clubs ridiculed him. But I’m very much one of the many Spurs fans who was inspired by Ange Postecoglou, who’s grateful for his time at the club, and who will genuinely miss him as the leader of the team.",
      "Modern football has hooked us all. Most of us caught the bug when we were young, and now we’re eternally afflicted.",
      "But as time has gone by, the clubs are changing – every day the clubs become more like modern commercial franchises, and the players often become more like celebrity megastars, rather than clubmen. This is all very normal, and not necessarily wrong, but sometimes it can make it less magnetic to be so invested in your team, and a group of players.",
      "After Poch, through no conscious choice, I found myself tuning out of Spurs a bit. Nothing major, just reading about them less often, fewer podcasts, watching fewer games. I cared less when we lost. I remember very little from the Mourinho Era, and nothing from Nuno.",
      "Conte piqued my interest, but like many, I was as jaded as he was by the end of his tenure.",
      "And then came Ange.",
      "(Largely) unheralded, ‘unproven’ at the top level. As Daniel Levy even put it “We tried bringing in winners, but now we’ve got Ange.”",
      "But he came with a vision of changing Spurs. He had no interested being a mercenary coming in for a quick buck, and jumping for a bigger job. He wasn’t aloof and above us. This was a man who was excited by the challenge: Taking an iconic club, who’s spent far too long away from success, and rewiring the whole culture and style of the club, to make us an exciting, winning football team again. In the modern world of football, having someone like this with a vision, and a passion – you couldn’t help but be swept up with it.",
      "An absolute breath of fresh air.",
      "You could see from the beginning, not only the fans loved ‘Angeball’ – the players loved it too. No longer were they told that they were ‘just Tottenham’. It was now “We’re Spurs, mate!” And the player played with a pride and vigour I hadn’t seen in years.",
      "After a beautiful first 10 games, what followed was 19 months of lunacy. A scattering of brief, glorious highs amidst a torrent of abject awful defeats. Crazy injuries, suspensions, shapeless formations, batterings. Following Spurs under Ange for 2 years probably aged me 10.",
      "But even still, it was exciting. Exciting to see a manager who trusted his vision, and a group of players who trusted that manager.",
      "MORE POSTECOGLOU SACK REACTION\n👉 England manager Thomas Tuchel speaks out after Tottenham’s ‘horrible’ Ange Postecoglou sacking\n👉 Five next move options for Ange Postecoglou post-Tottenham sack include Leeds United, Everton\n👉 Spurs face ‘player revolt’ over Ange sack as ‘so angry’ stars seek exit in aftermath of brutal decision",
      "Now let’s be fair: Ange wasn’t perfect. In January this year, many would say he should’ve been sacked with Spurs floundering in the league. Ange knew the writing on the wall, and he had to make a choice: If he pulled up his socks, and bet the house on recovering in the league, he probably could have got Spurs to a somewhat respectable 9th or 10th (remember, they could’ve finished as high as 14th on the final day). But Ange knew that would achieve nothing: He’d lose his job anyway, and more importantly, he’d have left no impact on Spurs – just another grey, forgettable season.",
      "So he went full rogue, threw the Premier League out the window and bet the house on doing the one thing that could change the entire mentality (and modern history) of Tottenham: Winning the Europa League.",
      "Ange gave Spurs fans and players one of the greatest experiences they’ll have in a lifetime of football. Arsenal fans can whinge about second tier trophies or whatever, but it doesn’t matter. Those players remember the feeling on the pitch, and those fans remember the parade, the confetti, the noise in Bilbao. Incredible.",
      "Ange leaves now with his head held high. He leaves with promises kept (He always wins things in his second season, mate) and have no doubt, he’ll rightly lap up all the credit for years to come on being the man who conquered the Spurs curse.",
      "Is it the right decision to move on? As an Ange fan, I have to say no. I think getting rid of Ange will send negative ripples through the team – he’s a leader to those players and they love him. He’s brought them the success he promised. It’s a huge challenge for whoever comes next.",
      "But what does the logical Spurs fan say? Maybe it is time. Maybe it’s even best for Ange – it might never have got better than this. Leave now as a hero, don’t wait and become the Villain.",
      "So who knows what lies ahead under Thomas Frank or whoever. I just hope my Spurs interest doesn’t wane again. It will take a serious contender to bring back the kind of excitement that Postecoglou did.",

So Bruno doesn’t want to go to Saudi Arabia and waste his life playing meaningless football in a joke league (look at how many goals Ronaldo is still scoring). Everyone else gets slated for moving there but god forbid Bruno doesn’t. I say fair play for not selling his soul.",
      "We don’t need the money – if you actually look how Utd finances work Big Jim was vastly overstating our position and, for now, can still afford to keep him. Especially if we sell some of the redundant homegrown players but even if not.",
      "Rashford had one good season. He was possibly the most selfish player in the league, and one worldie pass doesn’t change that. He isn’t wanted because he just isn’t that good, and his attitude stinks.",
      "As for Mount…how do you replace a player who is there week in, week out with a player who is never actually fit? Maybe BW wants us to play with 10 men and a permacrocked waste of money.",

      "",
      "The ‘crying little weakling’\nI know that I’m late to the subject on Bruno but I would just like to say this…the reason why people (football fans) don’t like Bruno and see him as an arm waving, selfish, whiny baby despite his great effort on the pitch, his consistency (compare availability with similar attacking midfielder like Odegard who seems to be injured all the time or Palmer who is talented but volatile), leadership skills- he does organize Man Utd’s play, defensive skills and clear motivation towards achieving victory for his team(his stats tell it all-he is truly world class) is simple.",
      "He is not handsome(appealing) enough to tempt most football fans.He does not appeal to football fans the way they would with other players in the same position, he displays a guilty face whenever he misses a chance or when he makes a mistake.",
      "He parades himself as the one responsible for any failure on the pitch that leads to defeat and seems almost about to cry (for  contrast-compare Vieira/Keane reaction to a mistake,they were either angry or keen on making amends-which is highly appealing to fans).",
      "Bruno is not stoic, he displays his feelings and weaknesses for everyone to see(compare this with other players-even Martin “amateur photographer” Odegard doesn’t display himself that much). This ultimately opens him to criticism,with fans seeing only a weak, guilty, whiny face.",
      "This coupled with inability to achieve victory for his team makes him a very ripe target because as much as we(football fans) may like to deny it, it is inescapable to admit that football is a cosmetic sport-we like the tough guy displays(Vieira, Keane-their manly fights), the electrifying displays(both Ronaldos, Henry-that goal against Liverpool, Hazard, Ribery), the man against all odds display(Wayne Rooney-that overhead kick, Vardy, Fabio cannavaro-a dwarf who rose above giants to claim victory), the stoic display(Tony Adams,Paolo Maldini and to a lesser extent Virgil).",
      "Bruno is ugly because he presents himself as a crying little weakling who is seeking our pity for his losses.\nJamo, Nairobi.",
      "",
      "I think he is a really bad player and a bully. He has bad technique gives the ball away more than any other midfielder in the league. He controls the game to make himself look good. He is a crybaby, cheats a lot with fouls.",
      "He is the reason united have done so badly. I thought he was a fake from the first day he arrived at united, he has really dragged them into the gutter. No united striker will score with Bruno in the team, he is supposed to be the creator but it’s something he simply can’t do he might get lucky once in a while but it’s all luck.",
      "United please sell him. Compare him to any player in his position and you will find he is the worst , hang on what is Bruno’s position\nDerrick",
      "",
      "I am happy they keeping Ferendes because he will not improve the team. He will score a few penalties and they will say he his world class.",
      "They are going to struggle for another season. Ha ha keep it up MU.\nMohan",

      "Totally agree. Should have been sold to Saudi league. He is stopping any youth development at Utd\nGordon",

      "Nem and shame\nFor a change of subject, I see in my news feed that Nemanja Matic is facing a 2 match ban in France for covering anti-homophobia messages on his shirt.",
      "And it turns out not only was he not alone, but others have previously done it too.",

Mazraoui (I’m sure he wasn’t the only player in the country) refused to wear Pride-supporting clothing on more than one occasion while at United and as a result the whole side didn’t either, presumably “in solidarity”.

      "Chelsea and Arsenal are responsible for three of the 20 most expensive goalkeeper signings in history each, with Liverpool sitting pretty.",
      "",
      "1) Kepa Arrizabalaga – £71.6m/€80m (Athletic Bilbao to Chelsea, August 2018)\nDespite never coming close to convincing at Stamford Bridge, the world’s most expensive keeper has racked up over 100 Premier League appearances and more clean sheets than Antti Niemi, who is actually 53. His best season as a Chelsea player was on loan at Bournemouth, mind. And now Arsenal might sign him for £5m.",
      "",
      "2) Alisson – £67m/€75m (Roma to Liverpool, July 2018)\n“Chelsea were changing their manager and not playing in the Champions League. I’ve also always admired Liverpool’s history. This is a club with five European Cups in their trophy cabinet. I really wanted to be part of that history,” said Alisson of his decision to join the Reds instead of the Blues in summer 2018. Having won it all at Anfield, it’s difficult to argue he chose wrong.",
      "",
      "3) Andre Onana – £43.9m/€51m (Inter to Man Utd, July 2023)\nTwelve months after joining Inter from Ajax as a free agent, Champions League finalist Onana reunited with Erik ten Hag as part of an Old Trafford revolution which has not quite gone to plan.",
      "",
      "4) Thibaut Courtois – £35m/€38.8m (Chelsea to Real Madrid, August 2018)\nThe desire of Courtois to leave Chelsea set in motion three of the four most expensive goalkeeper transfers in history. After starring in the 2018 World Cup, the Belgian forced a move to Real Madrid through and has 12 trophies to show for the subsequent seven years.",
      "",
      "5) Ederson – £34.7m/€40m (Benfica to Manchester City, June 2017)\nClaudio Bravo gave it a go but that went so well he lost his place mid-season to Willy Caballero, so Pep Guardiola went out and placed all his eggs in the basket of an uncapped 23-year-old with 74 top-flight career appearances. As it turns out: fair call.",
      "",
      "6) Gianluigi Buffon – £32.6m/€51.9m (Parma to Juventus, July 2001)\nFor almost 16 years, Buffon reigned as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper – and it took no little inflation and conversion nonsense to dethrone him. Juventus got their money’s worth in 22 trophies, a record number of Serie A clean sheets and a historic amount of Champions League bottling.",
      "",
      "7) Jasper Cillessen – £31.4m/€35m (Barcelona to Valencia, June 2019)\nValencia finished fourth in the two seasons before spending a small fortune on a 30-year-old keeper who played five La Liga games in three years with Barcelona; Los Che came 9th, 12th and 9th again before Cillessen left.",
      "",
      "8) Jordan Pickford – £30m/€34m (Sunderland to Everton, June 2017)\nThere was mild disbelief at the time and some remain unconvinced but Everton signed Pickford upon his relegation to the Championship with Sunderland and no individual has played a bigger role in ensuring the same fate has not befallen the Toffees since.",
      "",
      "9) Aaron Ramsdale – £30m/€35.5m (Sheffield United to Arsenal, August 2021)\nSuccessive Premier League relegations with Bournemouth and Sheffield United did not deter Arsenal, who planned to bleed Ramsdale in slowly before realising he’s rather good. But not as good as…",
      "",
      "10) David Raya – £27m/€31.9m (Brentford to Arsenal, July 2024)\nAn initial loan was only ever designed to circumvent PSR issues before eventually and inevitably being made permanent by Arsenal, who navigated some incredibly tiresome discourse around their goalkeepers and have been proven entirely right in making their ruthless upgrade.",
      "",
      "11) Alex Meret – £26.25m/€35m (Udinese to Napoli, July 2018)\nA Coppa Italia winner’s medal, saving from Paulo Dybala in the final shootout, and a Scudetto after fighting back from a rotational role to become regular starter again – that’s not a bad return.",
      "",
      "12) Giorgi Mamardashvili – £25m/€30m (Valencia to Liverpool, August 2024)\nWith a keen eye on the future, Liverpool signed Mamardashvili and lent him back to Valencia for one more campaign of seasoning before heading to Anfield to presumably challenge Alisson for the gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Manuel Neuer – £24.3m/€30m (Schalke to Bayern Munich, June 2011)\nBayern Munich supporters quite hilariously protested against the signing of Neuer over some daft grudge to do with Oliver Kahn. Twelve Bundesligas and a couple of Champions Leagues might have won them over by now.",
      "",
      "14) Francesco Toldo – £23.85m/€28.4m (Fiorentina to Inter, July 2001)\nThe prospect of following Buffon was reportedly one factor behind Toldo rejecting a move to Parma during the great Italian goalkeeper merry-go-round of 2001. I Gialloblu signed Sebastien Frey from Inter instead, leading Toldo straight into the arms of I Nerazzurri for the same fee Parma had previously agreed with Fiorentina, who replaced the outgoing Italy international with Arsenal champion and Liverpool legend Alex Manninger.",
      "",
      "15) Neto – £23.3m/€26m (Valencia to Barcelona, June 2019)\nAs part of the bloated Cillessen deal, Barcelona received Neto in exchange as back-up for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.",
      "",
      "16) Bernd Leno – £22.3m/€25m (Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal, June 2018)\nArsenal signing a German goalkeeper evoked all sorts of beautiful memories but Leno was neither mad nor Invincible. He replaced Petr Cech before himself being phased out for Ramsdale, as the circle of life between the Emirates sticks dictates.",
      "",
      "17) Edouard Mendy – £22m/€24m (Rennes to Chelsea, September 2020)\nHe came, he saw, he looked genuinely brilliant at times, he won the Champions League, Super Cup, Club World Cup, Africa Cup of Nations, Best FIFA Men’s Goalkeeper award and Champions League Goalkeeper of the Season award all within a few months of each other, he had some contractual disagreements, he lost his place, he left for Saudi Arabia. What a whirlwind.",
      "",
      "18) Pau Lopez – £21m/€23.5m (Real Betis to Roma, July 2019)\nWith not a single competitive appearance for Spurs in an all-fated 2016/17 loan under his arm, Lopez bounced back with a season at Real Betis impressive enough to catch the eye of Roma, who he left to join Marseille for about half of Roma’s initial outlay two and a half years later.",
      "",
      "19) Odysseas Vlachodimos – £20m/€23.7m (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, June 2024)\nThe most egregious PSR write-off in a summer full of them, Vlachodimos became the most expensive keeper in Newcastle history and had 45 minutes of a League Cup third-round win to show for his first season.",
      "",
      "20) Robert Sanchez – £20m/€23m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nWhile not the signing Chelsea most desperately wanted from Brighton, they nevertheless did not return empty-handed from their protracted Moises Caicedo negotiations as Sanchez headed to Stamford Bridge to provide competition for the No.1 entry on this list. Chelsea have obviously put him up for sale again.",

      "Chelsea reportedly ‘remain’ keen on the signing of a Manchester United forward, as they are looking to replace Jadon Sancho after deciding against signing him personally.",
      "Sancho was one of a few wingers in the Blues’ rotation last season. On loan at Stamford Bridge, he joined Noni Madueke and Pedro Neto in the group of wide men who played most often.",
      "Chelsea had an obligation to sign Sancho permanently from United for £25million this summer, but reneged on it for a fee of £5million, as they couldn’t come to an agreement on personal terms with the winger, who earns £250,000 per week at Old Trafford.",
      "As such, Caught Offside suggests they are looking to replace Sancho, and could do so with his United team-mate. Indeed, they state Chelsea ‘remain’ interested in Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "They were interested in his signing in the winter, and the potential of him being sold was advanced by Ruben Amorim reportedly telling him on United’s post-season tour: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "It’s believed the Red Devils are indeed willing to sell Garnacho, with Caught Offside stating he’ll cost €55million (£46.3m).",
      "The winger is said to be a ‘tempting option’ for Chelsea given he fits their philosophy of signing ‘elite young talents for their long-term project’.",
      "But, the Blues both have competition for Garnacho – with Napoli, AC Milan, Atletico Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen all after him – and are looking at another exciting forward themselves.",
      "They have been linked with Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens for some time, and it’s stated that they are still ‘looking closely’ at the 20-year-old.",

      "There is reportedly a race against time for the signing of Gittens at Chelsea. They play in the Club World Cup, which begins on June 15, and it was recently stated the Blues were in talks over a deal, and want to wrap it up before the tournament.",
      "It’s believed the Dortmund man is expected to attract bids of about £50million, with a release clause in his contract of a value around that.",
      "Whether Chelsea can get Gittens through the door for the Club World Cup will of course depend on if they can agree a deal with Dortmund, but there is a clear focus on the future, hence interest in two 20-year-olds, in him and Garnacho.",
      "Borussia Dortmund wide forward Jamie Gittens has reportedly ‘ignored’ interest from Arsenal to ‘pursue a move to Chelsea’.",
      "Chelsea are expected to return with an improved bid for Dortmund winger Jamie Gittens after reaching a contract agreement, according to reports.",

      "United have just completed their worst season in Premier League history. Never before have they finished as low as 15th in the table.",
      "Some players ended the season with credit in the bank, though they were largely the ones who were not actually representing United. Indeed, Antony headed out on loan to Real Betis for half the season, where he scored nine goals and assisted five.",

      "Indeed, it’s stated the club are ‘desperately searching for a buyer’ for the winger. Their preference is to offload him permanently, and United will ask for just £30million in order to do that.",
      "They have, though, refused to rule out a loan with an obligation to buy if no buyers come forward before the back end of the window, and it’s felt Betis have a ‘golden opportunity’ to land Antony on loan again after his first period there.",
      "Former United coach Meulensteen, who was Sir Alex Ferguson’s right-hand man, is in agreement that Antony should not return.",
      "“I wouldn’t bring Antony back because I’ve seen enough of him that he’s not cut out for the club and not good enough,” Meulensteen told Tipman Tips.",
      "“His performances are fuelled by his personality and are not for the good of the team, he’s selfish. You will never get your £80m back from Antony. I thought it was stupid business at the time when I heard it was happening.",
      "“I know that when they heard about the deal in Amsterdam, they were doing cartwheels. It shows again that players in those lower leagues, like Holland, are completely different. They’re playing very different styles, a slower tempo.",
      "“Teams like Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord are the best, so it’s easy for them to look good.",
      "“But coming into the Premier League is so much different. What is Antony’s return? How many goals and assists has he got? He’s probably got as many, if not more, in Spain than in England, that different kind of football is more ideal for him.”",
      "Another player United are willing to sell, Alejandro Garnacho, has not impressed Meulensteen.",
      "“Garnacho is the same as Antony. Yes, he’s a young boy but, personality-wise, some things are not right with him and he’s bad for the club. That shows in his performances and lack of consistency.",
      "“He’s a young player who has good value to him, so if they were to get offered any sort of money, they should cut their losses, because he isn’t going to live up to his potential at Old Trafford and that can free up some money to spend elsewhere.”",

      "Only four Premier League sides scored fewer goals than Man Utd in the season just gone with Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee coming in for lots of criticism, after the pair only scored seven goals between them.",
      "And Man Utd have made early moves in the transfer market to shake up their attack and give Amorim what he wants ahead of next season.",
      "Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Premier League rivals Wolves in a deal worth £62.5m after the Brazilian contributed 15 goals and six assists in the Premier League.",

      "That was rejected by the Bees as they reportedly look to hold out for closer to the fee that Man Utd paid Wolves for Cunha this summer.",

      "Neville said: “Man United need players who are going to come in and hit the ground running. United has become a very difficult place for new signings to operate in the last ten years.",
      "“Cunha and Mbeumo have obviously got Premier League experience. They’ve got plenty of games under their belt. [English football] is not new to them and actually they are the right type.",
      "“When I watch Manchester United wide players, they have to be able to get from box-to-box quickly. They have to be able to run, to travel with and without the ball. Mbeumo and, to be fair Cunha, can do that.",
      "“They can both run forward with real intent and purpose. A couple of two or three players who are going to leave, they are more ‘jinkers’. Players who, to be fair, play in smaller spaces.",

      "The ‘financial offer’ that the Red Devils are willing to make is €30m (£25m) and French side Monaco are ‘seriously considering’ the deal, ‘taking into account the current market situation and the interest from other clubs’.",

      "Heskey told Poker Scout: “Matheus Cunha had a fantastic season for Wolves, where the pressure was on at one point to stay up – he did well. He finds little pockets of space and is very intelligent. He has a great eye for goal and is the type of player that Manchester United need.",
      "“Bryan Mbuemo is probably the best winger in the league bar Mohamed Salah – that would be a great piece of business.",
      "“It goes to show the power that United still hold in the transfer window. To finish where they did in the league and win no trophies, the fact they can still beat clubs who finished in the Champions League to players is quite something.",
      "“There’s a case for them having to pay more to get these players through the door, but that pull is clearly still there. They’re a huge club that are currently going through problems, but they will always attract players. At this point, those players must be the right ones. Cunha and Mbuemo can hopefully be that for them.”",
      "Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres has now emerged as a possible target for Man Utd as he is willing to make the move to Old Trafford despite no European football.",
      "Heskey added: “Viktor Gyokeres would be a good signing for Manchester United. He has already played under Ruben Amorim and has played in England before. He has already shown that he can play in the system that Amorim prefers, he looks ideal.",
      "“His goal record this season was brilliant, he knows what the club means having played in England and he would fit well into Amorim’s system.”"

      "Man Utd and Lisandro Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since he underwent surgery four months ago; defender is on an individual programme as he works to return to fitness after being stretchered off against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in February",
      "Saturday 7 June 2025 17:24, UK",
      "Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez is aiming to return as early as possible next season as he makes good progress in his recovery from a cruciate ligament injury that has kept him out since early February.",
      "United and Martinez are understood to be satisfied with his rehabilitation since undergoing surgery four months ago and the latest tests carried out last week have confirmed that the 27-year-old has no tear in his meniscus.",
      "Neither Martinez nor United will take any unnecessary risks with integrating him back into the group and the player will not return until he is completely happy with his recovery and in peak physical condition.",
      "The Argentina international is on an individual programme over the summer break and will be working on the grass individually when the rest of the group are back for pre-season.",
      "Ruben Amorim, the United head coach, had been hugely impressed by Martinez before the injury, suffered in a 2-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford in the Premier League, and views the World Cup winner as a key pillar of his defence moving forward.",
      "Martinez is considered one of the group's leaders internally at Carrington and, in a summer when the club is moving swiftly to bolster a squad that finished 15th in the Premier League, having him back next season will come as a big boost.",
      "The defender is committed to United amid interest from clubs playing in next season's Champions League who are keeping a close eye on his recovery.",
      "United are pursuing a deal for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo having already secured the £62.5 transfer of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Martinez could feel like a new signing for Amorim when he is cleared fit.",
      "Martinez settled into Amorim's system quickly as the left-sided centre-back and was enjoying a good run of form before his injury, scoring crucial goals at Liverpool and Fulham in a run of six games when the team were unbeaten with him as a starter.",
      "The former Ajax defender is one of United's most progressive passers from deep and found more space to step forward and affect the game on the ball when the team shifted to a back three under the Portuguese.",
      "Amorim's approach plays to Martinez's strengths because the onus is on the defenders to build up play while the two No 8s are expected to play further up the pitch in a more box-to-box role rather than dropping deep to collect the ball from the back three.",
      "Across the 20 Premier League games Martinez played last season he was heavily relied on in possession, with the defender attempting and completing a higher volume of passes than any of his team-mates per 90 by some distance.",
      "With Amorim's system putting a greater emphasis on ball retention, there is an expectation he will lean on Martinez in that left centre-back position. His team-mates already do, with captain Bruno Fernandes the only other player taking more touches per 90.",
      "Martinez is not the quickest defender but reads the game well and that is helpful in Amorim's set-up with his defenders required to step up and intercept through balls - with Harry Maguire his only team-mate completing more per 90 in the league.",

      "Manchester United have admired Bryan Mbeumo for some time and feel he is a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system; United wanting to act quickly amid Alejandro Garnacho doubts; £60m-rated Mbeumo keen on move but Brentford not under pressure to sell",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 15:19, UK",
      "Manchester United have registered their initial interest with Brentford over signing Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Contact between the clubs has been established, but formal negotiations are yet to begin.",
      "Brentford are willing to listen to offers for the 25-year-old forward, who they value in excess of £60m.",
      "Mbeumo is a player United have admired for a while and he is seen as a good fit for Ruben Amorim's system.",
      "There is a feeling at Brentford that Mbeumo has earned the chance to move to a bigger club this summer if one meets his valuation.",
      "United have already agreed a deal to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for £62.5m.",
      "The transfer is subject to visa and registration, which is expected to be formally completed once the Brazil forward returns from international duty.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo scored 20 goals in the Premier League last season to help Brentford secure a top-half finish - only three players scored more.",
      "He also notched seven assists but should have registered more, clocking a league-topping 9.26 expected assists during the campaign - primarily from delivering a table-topping 202 crosses.",
      "Additionally, only two players covered more distance or attempted more sprints for the season, making him one of the hardest grafters in the league. He also provides serious pace - clocking the fourth-fastest speed at 36.63 km/h.",
      "Factoring in decisive goals or assists that changed the outcomes of games, his 27 goal contributions earned Brentford 22 points - equating to 40 per cent of the Bees' season tally.",
      "Club captain Bruno Fernandes has confirmed that he does not want to move to Saudi Arabia at this stage of his career.",
      "The feeling is he still has plenty to offer top level European football, with Fernandes revealing his wife and Ruben Amorim convinced him to stay.",
      "United faced a potential lucrative offer from Al Hilal, which could have been worth up to £100m. Fernandes has a contract until 2027 with the option of a further year.",
      "Lines of communication between United and Real Betis remain open over forward Antony, whose loan is up.",
      "United are expecting offers for the Brazilian following an impressive showing at Betis where he scored nine goals in 24 starts.",
      "Betis want to sign him but will find it difficult to meet United's asking price.",
      "Chelsea have communicated to Manchester United that they are not taking up the option to sign Jadon Sancho.",
      "Sancho was on loan at Chelsea last season - Chelsea had an obligation to buy him for £23m.But now, United will be owed £5m by Chelsea for not making the loan permanent",
      "Chelsea tried to negotiate new contract terms with Sancho so he could fit in with the club's wage structure, but a deal could not be reached. Sancho will now return to United.",
      "Meanwhile, there have been no formal offers yet for Garnacho. It's understood United would consider suitable bids.",
      "Chelsea and Napoli tried to sign him in January - both are still believed to be interested."

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 4 June 2025 18:39, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do.",
      "The summer transfer window will open again on Monday June 16 until Monday September 1 - with the deadline brought forward to 7pm this year"
