      "Manchester United are set to hold another round of talks to decide their next interim manager, with Michael Carrick edging closer to current favourite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. United have opted to appoint a caretaker for the remainder of the season before selecting a permanent replacement for Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils sacked Amorim on Monday following a run of just three wins in 11 games, but the decision was mainly down to a fallout with the club's director of football Jason Wilcox. Under-18 boss Darren Fletcher led the first team for Wednesday's deflating 2-2 draw away to Burnley and he'll remain in charge when United host Brighton in the FA Cup third round on Sunday.",
      "By then, Wilcox and United CEO Omar Berrada are expected to have interviewed both Carrick and Solskjaer face-to-face. The Guardian report that although Solskjaer is still the slight favourite, Carrick moved closer on Wednesday.",
      "Should Wilcox and Berrada choose Solskjaer, it's understood that Carrick would consider being his assistant once again. Carrick worked under Solskjaer when the Norwegian was in charge of the Red Devils from December 2018 to November 2021.",
      "The five-time Premier League winner was already part of United's first-team coaching setup when Solskjaer took over, initially on an interim basis, in the wake of Jose Mourinho's sacking. The duo were also team-mates at United for the 2006-07 season.",
      "\"They put Ryan [Giggs] in charge ten years ago, then Ole took charge and you go back to the old boys. Then you go for a new one, then you go for one more - it's almost like a cycle and a movie that we've all seen before and Groundhog Day.",
      "Who should Man Utd choose - Michael Carrick or Ole Gunnar Solskjaer? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "\"Look, what I do think, Ole is someone that absolutely loves the club. He knows the job, he's been in the job. The other names that are being mentioned, obviously, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "\"These are really fantastic people, I played with those guys for a lot of years, they love the club intensely. They get the club. But still they're going to come under a lot of pressure in the next four or five months if results don't go their way.",
      "\"So look, they have to be ready for that... Whoever's going to get it, out of those three that are being mentioned, I wish them all the best because it's a tough role.\"",

      "Scott McTominay appeared unusually dejected as Napoli were held to a draw by Hellas Verona on Wednesday evening. Yet Italian media were unanimous in declaring him the standout performer for Antonio Conte's side.",
      "The midfielder's remarkable Serie A journey since departing Manchester United in the summer of 2024 has been well-documented, with the 29-year-old claiming the league's MVP award last campaign after securing the title. He subsequently added the Italian Super Cup to his collection in late 2025.",
      "His Napoli team are battling to retain their crown this term but encountered a stumbling block at home on Wednesday against 19th-place Hellas Verona. The away side surged to a commanding 2-0 advantage before strikes from McTominay and Giovanni Di Lorenzo rescued a point.",
      "McTominay collected the Man of the Match honour following the final whistle, though his typically cheerful demeanour in Naples was replaced by visible frustration as he accepted the accolade. Nevertheless, Italian media outlets were in complete agreement that he provided the catalyst for Napoli's fightback, despite their failure to secure three points.",
      "The Scottish midfielder's 54th-minute strike ignited Napoli's resurgence on Wednesday, with La Gazzetta dello Sport praising him as the reason they claimed at least one point.",
      "McTominay received a 6.5/10 rating for his contribution to the stalemate and the outlet commented: \"He fights like a highlander even on the most difficult days. It was his goal that put Napoli back on their feet.\"",
      "He was also hailed as one of Napoli's three standout performers on the evening. They continued: \"The Azzurri's best were Di Lorenzo, [Leonardo] Spinazzola and McTominay. The visitors had few incompetencies.\"",
      "Conte's outfit lost crucial ground in their bid for back-to-back league crowns against Hellas Verona, with Corriere dello Sport branding the result as deflating.",
      "They stated: \"It was a disappointing performance from the Azzurri, but a source of pride for [Verona manager Paolo] Zanetti's team, who came close to a feat against a team that hasn't lost at home in over a year.\"",
      "Yet once more, it was McTominay who earned particular acclaim and secured a 7/10 rating for his outstanding display. They continued: \"McTominay was the driving force. In a first half where Napoli seemed to have lost their way, he was the last to surrender.",
      "\"His header was a manifesto of power and timing. Beyond the goal, he provided a physical presence that frightened Verona and reanimated a Maradona [stadium] frozen by the double disadvantage.\"",
      "The accolades for McTominay continued flowing, with Tuttosport also awarding him a 7/10 and heaping praise on him for nearly single-handedly rescuing Conte's team from defeat.",
      "\"The soul of the revolt,\" they penned. \"In the tactical desert of the first half, he was the only one who tried to shake his team-mates with fierce runs.",
      "\"The goal was a reward for his stubbornness: he towered above everyone and reopened a match that seemed cursed. Without his lungs and his charisma, it would have been a nightmare evening for Conte.\"",
      "Italian media were unanimous in their praise for McTominay on Wednesday night, with La Repubblica hailing him as the \"heart\" of Conte's squad and a true leader.",
      "\"Conte's Napoli saved themselves with nerves and with McTominay, avoiding a home collapse that would have opened a deep crisis,\" they reported. \"The Scotsman confirmed himself as the 'man of providence', capable of transforming crosses into hope.\"",
      "La Repubblica awarded McTominay a 6.5/10 for his performance, writing: \"He is the beating heart of a team that at times seems soulless. In the first half, he wandered in search of his position.",
      "\"But in the second half, it was he who provided the spark with an imperial header. It wasn't just the goal. It was the sense of leadership he conveyed to his team-mates when the match seemed already lost.\"",

      "Darren Fletcher showed Benjamin Sesko footage of his best moments and reassured the Manchester United star \"it is coming\" before he doubled his goalscoring tally at Burnley.",
      "The Slovenian had only scored twice prior to the clash at Turf Moor on Wednesday night but bagged a brace during the 2-2 draw. He looked far more confident as he led the United line in the first match of the post-Ruben Amorim era.",
      "Fletcher, who is in caretaker charge of the Red Devils, pulled Sesko to one side prior to the game and showed him highlights of the things he was doing right, claiming his team-mates also needed to do their bit and provide him with better service.",
      "Sesko was United's most expensive signing of the summer, joining for £70million from RB Leipzig, but his struggles in the months since have seen him singled out for criticism. But Fletcher now hopes that his exploits in front of goal can serve as a springboard.",
      "He said: \"I was so happy for him. I spoke to him yesterday and we presented a video showing his movement and showing his goals, just showing how it is coming and he needs to keep believing and the players need to get more service to him.",
      "\"He did that tonight and scored two great goals. A real positive night for Ben. He had other opportunities, a header, another snapshot. The team is disappointed with a point but in terms of a personal level hopefully he can kick on from that now.\"",
      "On Sesko, Fletcher added: \"He needed it massively. I spoke to him before the game and tried to reiterate what a good player he is and how much I've watched him over the years. We got the service in the box from him and it was great movement, made great runs and he took his two goals fantastically.\"",
      "United spent over £200m on their frontline, bringing in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo as well as Sesko. It has emerged that Amorim would've preferred to pursue Ollie Watkins ahead of the Slovenian, but ultimately missed out on the Aston Villa forward.",
      "It is understood that Watkins' proven track record in the Premier League was seen as a plus that Sesko didn't have. The 21-year-old has been cited as one of Europe's most exciting forwards and impressed in Leipzig, but by no means hit the ground running when he arrived in Manchester. In his opening weeks Amorim would regularly leave him on the bench before bringing him on for impact.",

      "Manchester United would be 'crazy' to appoint Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as boss until the end of the season, and should instead look to Roy Keane or Michael Carrick, according to Danny Murphy. The Red Devils are in search of a new boss after they dismissed Ruben Amorim earlier in the week.",
      "Former midfielder Darren Fletcher has been placed in a caretaker role at Old Trafford, with Solskjaer the frontrunner to take over until the end of the season. The club have been in talks with the Norwegian, in addition to Carrick, who is also available after being sacked by Middlesbrough earlier in the season.",
      "Solskjaer was previously in charge of United from 2018 until 2021. The Baby-faced Assassin replaced Jose Mourinho on an interim basis before impressing enough to land the role full-time.",
      "Match of the Day pundit Murphy has been left aghast that Solskjaer could be tasked with steering United in the right direction. The ex-Liverpool and Fulham midfielder believes there are better options.",
      "\"Well the Solskjaer one coming back is crazy,\" Murphy said. \"I mean Man United paid him to leave because he ultimately failed and now they're going to pay him to come back?",
      "\"I mean it seems ridiculous when you've got options like Michael Carrick, Fletch obviously is a decent coach and then you've got someone like [Roy] Keane, who the fans would love to come back. Ok, some people might think that might be chaotic but he's a leader.\"",
      "Stephen Warnock was somewhat in agreement. The former Liverpool and Blackburn defender is unsurprised United chiefs might want to wait until the summer given the candidates who could become available, but says he cannot comprehend a move for Solskjaer.",
      "\"I think there's a situation now where they obviously thought Amorim leaving the football club was the right decision. Now they know that there's options that are going to become available after the World Cup and there's going to be a decision on a handful of managers,\" he said.",
      "\"Who's going to be there? Tuchel, Ancelotti, Pochettino? There's going to be a lot available so I understand that waiting - I don't understand the Solskjaer one; I don't understand why you go back there.\"",

      "United are kicking the can down the road as far as a permanent appointment goes, so the man to succeed Darren Fletcher in the dugout will be another interim. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the favourite, although his ex-No2. and former team-mate Michael Carrick has also held talks with the Old Trafford hierarchy.",

Firstly, though, City are expected to complete Antoine Semenyo's arrival from Bournemouth by paying his £65m release clause.",

      "Antoine Semenyo arrived in Manchester just before 9am to undergo his Manchester City medical ahead of signing a long-term contract at the Etihad Stadium.The Ghana international sealed a fairytale ending to his Cherries career on Wednesday night by netting a 95th-minute winner against Tottenham.Bournemouth were successfully able to negotiate in the deal with City that Semenyo would be available for matches against Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham.Not only that but they've also secured a club-record sale worth an initial £62.5million which is slightly above Semenyo's release clause which was set at an initial £60m.That figure is greater than any of the offers the club received last summer - Manchester United and Tottenham both had bids rejected - and is payable over two year instalments.Additionally, the Cherries could receive an extra £1.5m in bonuses and have also wrangled a 10 per cent sell-on clause which will entitle them to a cut of future profit.",

      "But whatever he said to his Manchester United stars at half time - it almost worked.",
      "As job interviews go, this one couldn't have started much worse for interim boss Fletcher. United found themselves 1-0 down inside the opening 13 minutes to a Burnley side which hadn't won a game since October. But a stunning comeback after the break saw Benjamin Sesko score twice as United threatened to win a winnable game of football. The goals were Sesko's first ones in three months. And this fact alone makes Fletcher some sort of managerial genius!",
      "But Fletcher discovered that old habits can die hard, and was denied a winning start thanks to a thumping equaliser from Clarets substitute Jaidon Anthony.",
      "Speculation is mounting that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick will both return to take charge of the team until the end of the season. Travelling fans were chanting Solskjaer's name inside eight minutes.",
      "Fletcher had admitted taking charge of United, irrespective of how long for, had been 'beyond his wildest dreams'. The Scot had grown up at United, worked under the great Sir Alex Ferguson and played alongside some of the most illustrious names in the club's long history. But all of this counted for nothing on a freezing night at Turf Moor in January.",
      "It was time for Fletcher to show people he could sprinkle some stardust on a team without a sheen. There was a lot of problems to fix. But for the time being, this wasn't rocket science.",
      "All Fletcher had to do was put his players in a system that got the best out of them. So he reverted to a back four.",
      "But it took Fletcher little time to see United go behind, when Bashir Humphreys was allowed to escape the clutches of Casemiro. When he attempted a cross it deflected off the dithering Ayden Heaven, sending the ball looping into the far corner to put the Clarets ahead. Fletcher stood there shaking his head in disbelief.",
      "United were behind to a side which had gone 11 games without a win, and last tasted victory in October. What would Fergie do now? Perhaps Fletcher could have called him on his mobile to find out.",
      "He would have expected a serious response, but somehow the home side made it to the interval ahead. It felt like an equaliser had been coming, but Fletcher still had some serious talking to at half time. And whatever he said worked, because Sesko fired United level five minutes into the second half, before putting them ahead 10 minutes later.",
      "United were on full throttle and threatened a third through Bruno Fernandes, but his shot clipped Martin Dubravka's left hand post.",
      "But United have become masters at making life difficult for themselves. And six minutes after falling behind, Scott Parker's men drew level when Anthony twisted and turned inside the United box, before unleashing an unstoppable effort into the top corner.",

It remains to be seen whether any of the trio will look to force a move away from the club, but United may still look to offload their wages.",
      "The estimated wages of the trio adds up to around £13m, with academy graduate Mainoo the lowest paid at a reported £1m a year, while Ugarte is on an estimated £6.24m and Zirkzee on around £5.2m",

      "Manchester United's quest for Champions League football took another hit as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Burnley in Darren Fletcher's inaugural match at the helm.",
      "The Red Devils got off to a sluggish start and found themselves trailing after just 13 minutes when Casemiro was outfoxed by Bashir Humphreys' run and Ayden Heaven's feeble attempt to block the cross resulted in an own goal. However, Fletcher's team soon regained control, with two goals from Benjamin Sesko in the opening 15 minutes of the second half seemingly turning the tide. He expertly finished off a Bruno Fernandes pass and a Patrick Dorgu cross.",
      "Yet, inexplicably, United allowed the hosts back into the game. Despite posing little threat in the second half, Jaidon Anthony was given too much space by Lisandro Martinez to turn and curl in an equaliser.",
      "Here's how the players at Turf Moor were rated...",
      "Senne Lammens - 6",
      "His decision to try and anticipate Humphreys' cross wasn't the best, but he was helpless for the second goal. Showed good ball control.",
      "Diogo Dalot - 6",
      "Kept possession well and attempted to push forward in the second half, but failed to make a significant impact. United's narrow play didn't afford him much of the ball.",
      "Ayden Heaven - 5",
      "Turned his back on the cross that led to the own goal when he should have made himself bigger. Showed aggression on the ball at times.",
      "Lisandro Martinez - 5",
      "This was arguably his poorest performance since rejoining the starting line-up. Fired one wild shot and was far too passive against Anthony in the box, allowing the winger ample space to score the equaliser.",
      "Luke Shaw - 7",
      "Made a significant impact in the forward areas, linking well with Dorgu and making intelligent runs, both overlapping and underlapping.",
      "Manuel Ugarte - 6",
      "Advanced quite far up the pitch at times. Despite his two shots being off target, he had a solid game and showed better ball control.",
      "Casemiro - 4",
      "A pale imitation of his earlier season form. He simply watched as Humphreys ran past him for the first goal, was booked and often too slow to react.",
      "Bruno Fernandes - 7",
      "Delivered an excellent pass to set up Sesko's equaliser and was always eager to get on the ball. Showed his creative prowess.",
      "Patrick Dorgu - 7",
      "Currently playing in various positions. It was somewhat surprising to see him on the left, but he gave Kyle Walker a tough time and his cross for Sesko was spot on.",
      "Matheus Cunha - 6",
      "Less influential than in recent weeks. Struggled on the right in the first half and didn't improve much when moved centrally.",
      "Benjamin Sesko - 8",
      "His best performance for the club so far. Had numerous opportunities, held the ball up well, scored two fantastic goals and forced Martin Dúbravka into another good save with a fine header.",
      "Leny Yoro - 6",
      "Another change in central defence. Performed adequately.",
      "Mason Mount - 6",
      "Failed to match Fernandes' impact.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo - 6",

      "Benjamin Sesko scored twice for the Red Devils early in the second half and, in truth, should have won this game for the visitors, but Jaidon Anthony's fine 66th minute strike earned Burnley a share of the spoils.",
      "Sesko's double - two very impressive finishes - wiped out Burnley's opener from Bashir Humphreys inside the opening 13 minutes, his cross deflecting off Ayden Heaven and looping over Senne Lammens into the net. Fletcher would have been cursing his luck.",
      "Shea Lacey almost won it late in the day, a sumptuous 25-yarder hitting Martin Dubravka's crossbar. But in truth, United lacked the craft and quality required to win here, particularly when a 70 percent fit Bruno Fernandes had departed the scene on the hour mark.",
      "Here are five talking points from Turf Moor...",
      "One man who has been getting a fair bit of credit for his recent performances has been young centre-back Ayden Heaven.",
      "Despite the team’s recent inconsistencies, he has impressed at the heart of a defence shorn of Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire, with Lisandro Martinez easing his way back and Leny Yoro having been more out than in lately.",
      "But his role in Burnley ’s opener after 12 minutes deserves scrutiny because, frankly, it wasn’t good enough.",
      "It wasn’t that he hadn’t sensed the danger as the Clarets went down the left side. It’s that he was far too sluggish in getting himself over to it. He knew the run hadn’t been tracked, that Dalot was caught higher up. But he ambled out rather than sprinting and getting close. Had he done that, then he wouldn’t have suffered the misfortune of deflecting the cross into his own net.",
      "It was simple, basic defending. He didn’t do it and United were punished. To add to the ignominy, Heaven becomes the youngest United player to score a Premier League own goal, aged 19 years and 107 days.",
      "It was always going to happen wasn't it. The moment Ruben Amorim was out the door, that 3-4-3 formation he was wedded to was going with him. And so it did.",
      "But a return to a back four for one of Fergie's favourite sons didn't stop United from suffering a frustrating evening against a side who haven't won since October.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is Manchester United's best player. He is also still only at the club thanks to Ruben Amorim.",
      "Thankfully for United fans, the club's former head coach made clear to his captain last summer that he was crucial to his plans and shouldn't go to Saudi Arabia - at a time when the player felt the club hierarchy were happy to see him go.",
      "United remain over-reliant on their captain. He wasn't fully fit here, but just over 24 hours after being out at a coffee shop with Amorim's No.2 - in what by all accounts was a pretty sorrowful farewell - gave his caretaker boss 60 minutes and produced an outstanding slide-rule pass to get Sesko in behind to fire United level.",
      "Whoever is the next manager - be it permanent or interim - Fernandes remains the United player who is a top-level difference maker. But Amorim's exit and the spectre of Saudi means his long-term future is very much back under the microscope.",
      "Which is a big problem. Because when he isn't on the pitch, United lose their way.",
      "Which they did here. On the 60 minute mark, Fernandes was substituted. Six minutes later, Burnley were level.",
      "But that isn't strictly true. Yes, for the first 15 minutes of the second half, United had been dominant, scoring twice and going ahead. But the moment Fernandes departed the scene - having just hit the post - the team visibly shrunk. Suddenly, players didn't look comfortable taking possession and trying to dominate a game against the side in 19th place.",
      "And this didn't take time to happen. This happened within seconds. The home side were suddenly emboldened as United dropped closer to their own goal, the visitors were sloppy near their own box again - this time Lisandro Martinez not closing down the way he should - and Anthony curled an wonderful strike into the top corner.",
      "You have to wonder whether those United chiefs - who may or may not have been in the directors' box at Turf Moor - still think they can do without Fernandes. Because this period of this game, like the entirety of the dismal home draw with Wolves, highlighted that this team cannot.",
      "Manchester United's giant striker scored twice, should have had more and showed with his movement, speed and quick feet that he can be a real menace to opposing defences. His two finishes for his goals were brilliant. Both taken clinically, both finishes that oozed class.",
      "But they were by no means the only chances the former RB Leipzig hitman had. In fact he had more shots on target (7) than any other player has managed in a Premier League game this term. The problem was the standard of his shooting on those other chances - some of which weren't anything like as difficult as his second - left a hell of a lot to be desired.",
      "A little it more composure and he would have had his hat-trick.",

      "Ex-Manchester United captain Gary Neville says his old club are repeating the same errors Liverpool made before Jurgen Klopp arrived, with them caught in an endless loop of appointing and sacking managers. United showed Ruben Amorim the door earlier this week after the weekend's draw with rivals Leeds - and they are now searching for a new head coach at Old Trafford.",
      "Darren Fletcher has stepped in temporarily to oversee tonight's match against Burnley, while the Red Devils are reportedly in discussion with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick over possible comebacks to the hot-seat.",
      "Neville, who was mentioned in Amorim's parting blast at the club, says he wouldn't rule out Solskjaer getting the role permanently if he can revive United's fortunes, but the pundit drew a compelling parallel with United's bitter rivals Liverpool.",
      "\"You almost go through cycles whereby, and United have done this for 12 years now. They put Ryan [Giggs] in charge ten years ago, then Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] took charge and you go back to the old boys.",
      "\"Then you go for a new one, then you go for one more - it's almost like a cycle and a movie that we've all seen before and Groundhog Day.",
      "\"Look, what I do think, Ole is someone that absolutely loves the club. He knows the job, he's been in the job.",
      "\"The other names that are being mentioned, obviously, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy. These are really fantastic people, I played with those guys for a lot of years, they love the club intensely.",
      "\"They get the club. But still they're going to come under a lot of pressure in the next four or five months if results don't go their way. So look, they have to be ready for that... Whoever's going to get it, out of those three that are being mentioned, I wish them all the best because it's a tough role.\"",
      "Fletcher, who previously worked as first-team coach under former manager Erik ten Hag, has also held the role of technical director at United.",
      "This marks his first venture into management and, as a result, the Old Trafford giants are contemplating bringing in a more experienced interim boss until the end of the season, with Solskjaer and Carrick both in the frame.",
      "When asked about a potential return to United prior to Amorim's appointment as head coach, Solskjaer admitted during a Q&A at the Oslo Business Forum that he would answer the call if it came his way again.",
      "\"If the family [United] asks, I would say yes every day of the week,\" he said. \"It feels wrong to talk about jobs other people have, but I would say yes, of course.\"",

      "Darren Fletcher has been put in charge for Wednesday's trip to Burnley, the same day Solskjaer met with the club's top brass to discuss the role, as he did on Tuesday. Fellow ex-United player and club legend Michael Carrick did the same and it can't be ruled that the pair will team up, having worked together for the entirety of Solskjaer's three-year reign which ended in November 2021.",
      "Until he was appointed Besiktas manager last January, Solskjaer had been off the touchline since leaving Old Trafford. The former United striker, who made 366 appearances for the club, had previously been working for UEFA as a technical observer.",
      "But his time at Besiktas came to an end in August when the Turkish club failed to qualify for Conference League, losing to Lausanne-Sport - coincidentally owned by United's co-owners, INEOS - in the play-offs. Following his dismissal, Solskjaer didn't have plans to make an imminent to return to management.",
      "But as reported by the Sun, United's call has changed everything. Solskjaer, who recently relocated to Cheshire, is said to have told a confidant last week that he wasn't looking to get back into management any time soon.",
      "However, the 52-year-old is keen on the idea of returning to the United hot seat. Solskjaer and his wife, Silje, are living in Cheshire while their children remain back home in Norway. Their oldest son, Noah, plays for Stjordals-Blink while daughter Karna plays for Aalesunds.",
      "In 2014, Solskjaer confirmed that he'd be willing to return to United. \"If the family [United] asks, I would say yes every day of the week,\" he told a Q&A at the Oslo Business Forum. \"It feels wrong to talk about jobs that other people have now, but I would say yes, of course.\"",
      "After taking over from Jose Mourinho in December 2018, Solskjaer led the Red Devils to an incredible run of form.

      "As speculation mounts around a potential Old Trafford comeback for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, focus has shifted to the players who know the Norwegian from his previous spell in the dugout. One such player, Diogo Dalot, has already delivered a telling response to Solskjaer's private doubts and now has an opportunity to display his progress under recent managers.",
      "Dalot arrived at the club during summer 2018, during what would prove to be Jose Mourinho's final transfer window at the helm before his dismissal in December of that year. Mourinho's sacking led to Solskjaer's appointment, initially on a temporary basis, with Dalot seeing his opportunities limited.",
      "After securing the role permanently, Solskjaer received transfer backing and amongst his earliest decisions was spending £50million on new right-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka. This hardly demonstrated faith in Dalot, who subsequently spent more than one spell out through injury throughout the 2019/20 campaign and managed just four Premier League outings in his second United season.",
      "Sources at the time suggested Solskjaer's worry was that Dalot \"couldn't defend,\" with those comments later making it out into the open after being overheard. On one notable occasion, Solskjaer was willing to give Timothy Fosu-Mensah a first United start in three years rather than trust Dalot against Crystal Palace in July 2020.",
      "Dalot spent the 2020/21 season on loan at AC Milan, even facing his parent club United in the Europa League last 16. He never abandoned hope of reviving his Old Trafford prospects, though, despite celebrating Simon Kjaer's late equaliser for the Italian side in that European clash.",
      "The defender was primarily used as a substitute at the beginning of the 2021/22 campaign but earned starting opportunities after Solskjaer was dismissed and Ralf Rangnick assumed interim control. By the conclusion of that season, United were willing to entertain offers for Wan-Bissaka but not for Dalot, who had become a more valuable part of the squad.",
      "\"I feel like I'm a Man United player,\" the full-back said during United's pre-season tour of Australia that summer. \"But obviously work every single day to play. I wanna be ready for the manager, for the club, and every time he needs me I'm gonna be there.\"",
      "Erik ten Hag took over after Rangnick's interim spell, with the Dutch manager maintaining confidence in Dalot before fellow full-back Wan-Bissaka was sold to West Ham in 2024. Ruben Amorim was equally impressed by the defender, who made a 150th Premier League outing earlier this season.",
      "Sporadic doubts about Dalot's defensive capabilities have persisted, though not enough to seriously threaten his position in the side. That blend of defensive solidity and attacking threat seemed to impress Amorim, who was willing to deploy him on both flanks in his wing-back formation.",
      "Dalot's next challenge will come if, as has been suggested, Solskjaer makes his return to Old Trafford. He made a mere 10 Premier League starts under the Norwegian across nearly three years, including one campaign away on loan, yet he has made considerable progress since then and persuaded multiple United managers that he offers significant value as a full-back - or wing-back - on either side.",

United have held talks with Solskjaer and Michael Carrick about returning to Old Trafford, potentially in tandem until the end of the season.",

      "\"We know this window is an opportunity to reinforce the squad in an area where we have struggled to convert chances into goals, so we will try to use it.\"",

      "When Ruben Amorim offered up some mild criticism of Benjamin Sesko earlier this season, as the £73million striker tried to settle into life at Old Trafford, it again set alarm bells ringing amongst Manchester United officials. Amorim had wanted United to sign the more experienced Ollie Watkins, who also came with proven Premier League pedigree, rather than raid RB Leipzig for 22-year-old Sesko, who came with a glowing reputation from director of recruitment Christopher Vivell.",
      "When the Slovenian struggled in the first few months at United, Amorim admitted he was finding the search for form hard, suggested he was taking criticism to heart and said he was a \"control freak\". United officials were bemused by what he wanted to get from the comments.",
      "After his final game in charge at Leeds on Sunday, Amorim was offering a more nuanced view of the only natural striker in his squad, but the bare facts said it all: Sesko had just two goals in 17 appearances under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "He doubled that tally in 90 minutes under Darren Fletcher. Jason Wilcox looked sheepish in the stands all night, with his own role as director of football in the spotlight, but this was a good night for those who backed the decision to sign Sesko over Watkins.",
      "His two goals were superbly taken and he had eight shots in total. It was by some distance his best performance in a United shirt and it came a day after a heart-to-heart with Fletcher. The 41-year-old Scot sat the striker down at Carrington on Tuesday and boosted his confidence with a video that showed his strengths.",
      "He highlighted his movement and reassured him that he was on the right path. A day later he scored twice after making the right runs and getting on the same wavelength as his teammates.",
      "\"I sat down with him yesterday and showed him some videos of his movement and how the opportunities are going to come, to just keep believing, keep making the runs,\" said Fletcher. \"The rest of the team have to look for him more as well.",
      "\"Like with all strikers, once you get that first goal, it builds your confidence, and hopefully they start flooding in from there. I think everyone can see his qualities. I thought he was fantastic tonight. I thought he led the line really well and he maybe could have gone on and had a hat-trick as well.",

The 18-year-old came on with six minutes to go against Burnley and hit the crossbar with one superb strike before sending another shot from range fizzing just wide of the post.",
      "It was Lacey's second appearance for the first team and the first sign of the talent that has marked him out as one to watch within the academy. Fletcher showed faith in throwing him on as United chased a winner and the youngster almost delivered.",
      "\"I said to him, stay wide and go and do what you do, and he did that,\" said Fletcher. \"I know he's gonna make an impact. I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless, and he hit the crossbar, and he had another shot, so he had a really bright game.",
      "\"I'm pleased for him because there have been a lot of injuries in recent years, and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future. I've no doubts about that.\"",
      "Lacey's efforts were part of a much better attacking display from United, who had 30 shots against the Clarets. They hit the woodwork twice, had two cleared off the line and saw a Lisandro Martinez goal controversially disallowed for a foul.",
      "Fletcher had told his players to go out and entertain, and he was pleased to see United produce a much better attacking display.",

      "\"I think, as I said, it wasn't perfect, but there was lots of good things within that. I think if we look back on that game, barring probably the start and then after we went 2-1 up, I think the rest of the game is pretty much total domination and creating lots of chances.",

      "Manchester United drew 2-2 with Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday. Burnley drew first blood at Turf Moor, taking the lead thanks to a deflected strike which was marked as an own-goal from Ayden Heaven.",
      "Darren Fletcher did not look pleased, but United came out swinging at the start of the second half, and Benjamin Sesko scored twice in relatively quick succession to make it 2-1. However, Burnley drew level thanks to a great strike from Jaidon Anthony, which ensured the points were shared.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "The anti-Ratcliffe banner",
      "A banner reading 'Jim can't fix this' was unfurled before the game, implying Sir Jim Ratcliffe doesn't have what it takes to turn the club around. The banner was in response to a tumultuous week, which saw Ruben Amorim sacked, Fletcher hired as interim boss, and talks opened with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer over a possible return.",
      "Ratcliffe bemoaned the mistakes of the previous regime when he took control of football operations at Old Trafford, but the Ineos team have created a mess themselves. Omar Berrada oversaw the appointment of Amorim, a coach wedded to playing with five at the back, and Jason Wilcox interfered with the team's tactics, which is a red flag from a director of football.",
      "United sources insisted there had been no power struggle when Amorim's sacking was confirmed, but it was impossible to pull the wool over fans' eyes following his final press conference. Berrada and Wilcox were at Turf Moor and they were both spotted shaking their heads when Burnley opened the scoring. United fans have been shaking their heads at the pair in the last few days.",
      "Thumbs up for Sesko",
      "Sesko was unfortunate not to score in the first half when he sent an outstanding header goal-bound from the edge of the box. The header had to be perfect to have a chance of going in from that distance - and Sesko was just denied by a beautiful save from former United loanee Martin Dubravka.",
      "The Slovenia international looked in the mood from the first whistle, a stark contrast to last weekend against Leeds, and he received a big thumbs up from Fletcher when he equalised - the interim boss clearly knows how crucial Sesko could be in United's push for a European spot. Sesko's second goal was even better. The cross into the box was wonderful, but he still had plenty to do and finished with the kind of ruthlessness that fans doubted he had in his locker.",
      "Patrick Dorgu was responsible for the assist and sprinted to Sesko, who had a huge smile on his face as his teammates celebrated with him. Just last week, Sesko's teammates had their hands on their heads as he sent a potential match-winner wide of the post in the final 20 minutes against Leeds.",
      "Sesko scored as many Premier League goals against Burnley as he'd managed in his first four months in Manchester. Everyone is hoping Sesko's brace in Lancashire signals the beginning of a purple patch.",
      "Huge cheer for Lacey",
      "There was a huge cheer from the away section when Fletcher introduced Shea Lacey for Manuel Ugarte for the final seven minutes of the game. Amorim frustrated fans by regularly bringing on centre-backs in the closing stages of matches, so it was refreshing to see an attacking substitution instead.",
      "Amorim handed Lacey his debut at Villa Park last month. The 18-year-old's first appearance could have come sooner, though, as he'd been knocking on the door for months before his senior bow.",
      "Lacey showed what he can do when smacking the crossbar from the edge of the box just minutes after coming on at Turf Moor. The attacking change from Fletcher was inches away from being a masterstroke.",
      "Fletcher's classy arrival",
      "Fletcher arrived at Turf Moor dressed in a Paul Smith club suit, continuing the trend of former United players-turned caretaker managers wearing a suit and tie on the touchline. The outfit choice comes from playing under Sir Alex Ferguson, who believed United representatives should dress smartly.",
      "The 41-year-old asked Ferguson for his 'blessing' to manage United against Burnley, and he carried himself with class at the pre-match press conference, shaking the hands of journalists. Fletcher should have his head held high if Burnley is the only league game he oversees as interim boss. He behaved like a United manager should before and after the clash at Turf Moor - which counts for something.",
      "Solskjaer and Carrick chants",
      "It took just eight minutes for the away section to begin a rendition of 'you are my Solskjaer, my Ole Solskjaer', which felt like a seal of approval for the Norwegian's increasingly likely return. Solskjaer left on good terms in 2021, despite being booed after his final game in charge against Watford, and the club's press release announcing his sacking said: \"He will forever be welcome back.\"",
      "The 52-year-old will always be popular among fans due to his playing career, but some supporters have mixed feelings about a possible return. Those reservations are merited. The end of Solskjaer's tenure should not be forgotten, although there were positives from his stint.",
      "Carrick was part of Solskjaer's backroom staff, and he is also in contention for the job. The away fans gave Carrick their approval by signing: \"He's Carrick, you know, you'll never believe he's not Scholes.\"",
      "It remains to be seen who will be given the interim job for the remainder of the season.",

      "Manchester United suffered another setback in the race for Champions League football as they were held to a 2-2 draw at Burnley in Darren Fletcher's first game in charge. United started slowly and went behind after 13 minutes. Casemiro was caught out by Bashir Humphreys' run and Ayden Heaven's weak attempt at blocking the cross saw the ball loop in off the centre-back.",
      "Fletcher's side soon took control and two Benjamin Sesko goals in the first 15 minutes of the second half looked to have turned it around. He finished smartly from a Bruno Fernandes pass and Patrick Dorgu cross. Somehow, United let the hosts back into it. They had barely threatened in the second half when Lisandro Martinez let Jaidon Anthony turn and deliver a curling finish.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Turf Moor:",
      "Senne Lammens: Decision to try and read the cross from Humphreys not a good one but powerless with the second goal. Good with the ball at his feet. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot: Tidy in possession and tried to get forward in the second half, but didn't have much of an impact. United's narrow approach didn't get him much of the ball. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Turned away from the cross that saw the ball loop in off him, when he should have made himself bigger. Aggressive on the ball at times. 5",
      "Lisandro Martinez: His weakest game since his return to the side. One wild shot and way too passive against Anthony in the area, giving the winger too much space to equalise. 5",
      "Luke Shaw: Got forward well and had an impact in that area. Linked well with Dorgu and made some clever runs, both overlapping and underlapping. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte: Got quite far forward at times, and although his two shots at goal were wayward, he had a solid game and was better with the ball. 6",
      "Casemiro: A shadow of the player who had done so well earlier in the season. Just watched Humphreys run off him for the first goal, was booked and just too slow to react at times. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Picked a brilliant pass to create the equaliser for Sesko and wanted as much of the ball as he could get. Looked a creative force. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Playing everywhere at the moment. Something of a surprise to see him on the left but gave Kyle Walker a hard time and his cross was perfect for Sesko. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: Quieter than he has been in recent weeks. Struggled on the right in the first half and didn't improve much for being moved centrally. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko: His best game for the club. Had plenty of chances, held the ball up well, took his two goals brilliantly and forced Martin Dúbravka into another good save with a fine header. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Leny Yoro: Another centre-half change. Did fine. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Struggled to match the impact of Fernandes. 6",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Came on in a deep area and tried to get on the ball. 6",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: Couple of half chances but couldn't take them. 6",
      "Shea Lacey: So unlucky not to score with a brilliant piece of play. 7",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Maguire, Malacia, J. Fletcher",

      "Benjamin Sesko thinks it's time for Manchester United to \"stand up as a group\" following Ruben Amorim's sacking. United announced on Monday that Amorim had been sacked after 14 months in charge.",
      "Amorim departed amid rising tensions with the Old Trafford board. Darren Fletcher was in interim charge against Burnley on Wednesday night and was forced to settle for a point.",
      "Speaking about his brace, Sesko added: \"It’s important for the team that I can help them. It’s my job. It’s important to commit to the chances, as we were creating lots of chances. We just have to keep pushing in those situations.\"",
      "In a separate interview with the BBC, he said: \"It helps me with my confidence but also to be part of a team, which for me is the most important, to help the team in every single situation.",

Even more important now is I have more confidence than before. Now it's up to me and the team to keep pushing,\" he explained.",

      "On the eve of this game, Darren Fletcher admitted leading out a Manchester United team had been beyond his wildest dreams. Watching them draw 2-2 despite only allowing Burnley one shot on target was beyond his worst nightmares.",
      "Quite how United didn't win this game will haunt Fletcher in his dreams for a long time to come. Especially if it ends up being his only game in charge. They bossed Burnley and played some enterprising football at times. Benjamin Sesko scored twice in his best performance for the club, and 18-year-old Shea Lacey hit the bar late on with a stunning individual effort. They were among the 30 shots Fletcher's side had. Burnley managed seven but somehow escaped with a point.",
      "The manner of the two sloppy goals United conceded will infuriate Fletcher, who knows all about the standards expected at this club. Passive defending allowed the Clarets to carry out two successful raids on United's goal, while at the other end Martin Dubravka was busy and the woodwork was on Burnley's side as well.",
      "Whatever happens over the next few days, this will almost certainly be Fletcher's one and only Premier League game in charge. He will hand the reins on with United in seventh, but this felt like a missed opportunity to take a firmer grip in the race for European football, and ideally a spot in the Champions League.",
      "But then that is the story of United's last month. In the space of 35 days they have played five of the bottom six and won none of them. If the passports ended up staying in the draw next season, then the inquest won't take long to work out where it all went wrong.",
      "Those United fans in the Cricket Field Stand at Turf Moor will be desperate to get back to the continent and they felt like a barometer of the feeling around the club after a tumultuous week. As Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada took their seats in the directors' box they would have glanced at the away end to see a banner reading 'Jim Can't Fix This'. Sir Jim Ratcliffe's time in charge at Old Trafford has been messy and full of mistakes and it feels like the jury is ready to deliver its verdict.",
      "Ratcliffe has making up to do with those United fans who have lost faith in his ability to turn this club around. Right now, the only positive is that he isn't called Glazer, and even that is wearing thin.",
      "The 73-year-old has to get his next big decision right, but first he is opting for a dose of nostalgia. Fletcher and Jonny Evans were reunited in the dugout at Turf Moor and both got chants from the away end in the early stages. So did Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick, who are competing for the caretaker job until the end of the season.",
      "Solskjaer's song came first. Maybe the Norwegian benefits from having a couple of tunes that go down well in United away ends. He would have liked seeing Fletcher line this side up in a 4-2-3-1, a shape Solskjaer played regularly during his time in charge.",
      "He wouldn't have liked seeing another sloppy start. Burnley hadn't led a game since November 8, but they were ahead after 13 minutes. Casemiro was culpable for allowing Bashir Humphreys to run past him, before Ayden Heaven's closed body position saw him deflect the cross rather than block it, sending it spiralling over Senne Lammens and into the corner of the net.",
      "Fletcher shook his head in the technical area. He had demanded to see a United team in his image and that the fans could be proud of, but this was a passive start and Burnley were picking holes around a tired Casemiro.",
      "Fletcher's angst only increased when Lisandro Martinez had a goal ludicrously disallowed for a foul on Kyle Walker from a corner, despite both players grappling with each other, but it came at a time when his team were beginning to hit their stride.",
      "Matheus Cunha had a header cleared off the line and the best of Sesko's three shots on target before the break was an excellent header that forced Dubravka into an acrobatic save. Patrick Dorgu suffered the same fate as Cunha, dinking a finish over Dubravka after a slick team move, only to see his effort hacked away from under his own crossbar by Maxime Esteve.",
      "Dorgu had looked lively down the left, with Cunha starting on the right as Fletcher opted for natural wingers. They both played narrow, however, and United's attacks rarely stretched beyond the edges of the penalty box. Sesko was fed a diet of crosses from deep, connecting with deliveries from Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro, but in areas where it was difficult to score.",
      "It made the importance of getting the final ball right all the more important, so it's a good job Fernandes was back in the side. He showed supreme vision to thread a pass through a packed defence for the much-improved Sesko, who timed his run well and slammed a first-time finish home in front of the United fans.",
      "United had control of the game now. Fernandes drilled a half-volley against the post from an angle and Heaven somehow headed a corner wide from three yards. It looked a matter of time until they scored again and it was no surprise it was Sesko again. Dorgu's cross was superb but the striker's controlled right-footed volley was just as good.",
      "That should have been that, but Fletcher will know by now that nothing comes easy in this job. Burnley levelled out of nowhere, Lisandro Martinez too passive in allowing Jaidon Anthony time to turn and deliver a brilliant curling finish in the penalty area.",
      "Sesko tested Dubravka twice more as United sought the winner they deserved. Fletcher showed his faith in youth by sending Lacey on for Manuel Ugarte and nearly got his reward. The teenager smashed a shot against the bar and drilled another just wide, but it wasn't to be for his Under-18s boss.",

      "The potential appointment of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as interim manager at Manchester United could be good news for Kobbie Mainoo, with Solskjaer making his feelings clear on one of the club's transfer decisions since his own exit.",
      "United have held talks with the Norwegian about potentially taking over as interim boss until the end of the season. The club are on the lookout for a new manager after the sacking of Ruben Amorim earlier this week.",
      "Solskjaer is currently out of work after leaving Turkish side Besiktas in the summer. Any appointment at United will see him return to the place where he managed between November 2019 and November 2021.",
      "Midfielder Scott McTominay was a regular under the manager, but fell out of favour after his exit. He completed a move to Italian side Napoli in 2024 and has since gone from strength to strength.",
      "Speaking to the BBC back in May, Solskjaer said: \"Scott and Fred together, they were lads you would put your hat on every day to give 100%.",
      "\"How you can sell Scott is beyond me.\"",
      "McTominay’s situation at United somewhat mirrors the current one of Mainoo. Napoli have been linked with an interest in the England international in the current window, but the managerial situation could change things.",
      "Mainoo has struggled for game time under Amorim, but Solskjaer's stance on the sale of McTominay hints that he may be given more of a chance if the former striker is appointed as interim manager.",
      "If he is given more game time, then Mainoo will hope to show that he can get back to the levels that saw him play a crucial part in United's FA Cup win in 2024 and England's run to the Euros final the next summer. If so, he could potentially earn himself a recall to the England squad for the summer's World Cup.",
      "It's not just Mainoo who could benefit; in the same interview, Solskjaer was full of praise for defender Harry Maguire, who he brought to the club from Leicester City in 2019.",
      "\"For me, Harry has always been a leader and a fighter,\" he said. \"I was never in doubt when I signed him and he walked in the door he would be captain for us.\"",
      "Maguire has missed nine recent Premier League games through injury, but was back on the bench for Wednesday night’s 2-2 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor.",
      "In coming in until the end of the season, Solkjaer will be managing both players that he has previously worked with at United and ones that he hasn’t. That’s something that is likely to be a challenge.",
      "\"Look, recruitment is probably the most important thing in football,” he again said back in May. \"You need the structures right and you need to get the right people in.",
      "\"When you manage two, three, four or five different managers' players, it is hard to make it balance into a team you want to see. Everyone knows you need continuity and patience to get success, but not too many get it.\"",
      "He has, however, made his stance on United perfectly clear. \"Man United is my family and will always be part of me,\" he added.",
      "\"In football, you don't feel sorry for anyone because we are privileged, absolutely 100% privileged to be able to work in clubs like this.",
      "\"But for me, it is hard to watch because it is your family that is struggling. It is never easy at the weekend when you look at the table.\"",

      "The home side have played well, but United will be incredibly disappointed with their performance so far this evening. There are hundreds of empty seats at Turf Moor and United have not controlled the game.",
      "Fletcher been a near constant presence on the touchline and not hiding his emotions. Was a shake off the head when United conceded and now he’s baffled why that has been ruled out. Burnley wanted a foul before when they felt Cunha pushed Walker from the free-kick. The referee was probably looking for a reason to blow up from the corner and when Martinez vs Walker ended up with the latter on the floor, he had his chance.",
      "That shot was inches wide of the post. Dalot failed to get out quickly enough to block the strike.",
      "Martinez had the ball in the back of the net but he was deemed to have pushed Walker.",
      "Fernandes is back in the team tonight, which was a huge boost, but United are still lacking quality in the final third. Sesko sent a header over before and they are currently struggling to create against the Clarets.",
      "The United fans are in fine voice, despite this week's events and trailing 1-0 to Burnley.",
      "Dalot seemed to be suggesting Heaven’s body position wasn’t the best when defending that cross. Lammens maybe took a step off his line a little too early as well. But fault primarily has to lie with Casemiro, who was asleep when Humphreys ran past him. It’s sloppy from such an experienced player. No wonder Fletcher was shaking his head.",
      "Burnley have taken the lead as Humphreys' cross deflects off Heaven into the net. Fletcher looks stunned on the touchline.",
      "Casemiro was too passive in the build-up to that goal, but it was an unfortunate deflection off Heaven. The screens in the press box showed Wilcox shaking his head in the stands.",
      "United fans singing Solskjaer's name- that's the seal of approval from matchgoers.",

Surprise to see Dorgu on the left and Cunha on the right, don’t often see wingers playing on their ‘correct’ side these days. Would imagine that suits Dorgu more and maybe Fletcher wants his direct running to test out an ageing Kyle Walker, who has struggled against pacey wingers this season.",
      "Fletcher has started with a back four. Heaven and Martinez are the central defensive pairing. Dorgu has started on the left wing, with Cunha on the opposite flank.",

      "In the days since Ruben Amorim was sacked by Manchester United, Ineos appear to have been touring the circuit of ex-players as they look to finalise their plans for the remainder of the season. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick are among those with previous managerial experience approached to take on the temporary position.",
      "While Darren Fletcher has been handed the chance to be the interim head coach for now, there is a sense United want a more experienced manager in the dugout for the remainder of the campaign, particularly considering plenty is still to play for. But when it comes to the permanent managerial position, United links are scarce.",
      "Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner is being considered, having overseen an impressive managerial stint at Selhurst Park. His desire to play a 3-4-2-1 is not thought to play against him, albeit Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co. will hope he is more pragmatic than Amorim.",
      "Barcelona legend Xavi has been mentioned, as have the likes of Thomas Tuchel, Roberto De Zerbi and Julian Nagelsmann. But one name which should perhaps be given more thought is Kieran McKenna. McKenna built up his managerial credentials working alongside Jose Mourinho before being taken under the wing of Solskjaer.",
      "When the Norwegian was eventually fired, McKenna saw this as the perfect opportunity to fly the nest and launch his own managerial career. Ipswich Town was his first opportunity as he was tasked with the challenge of raising a fallen giant.",
      "Not only did he manage to accomplish this, McKenna oversaw back-to-back promotions as he led the Tractor Boys to the Premier League. Considering a lot of their squad was left over from the League One days, survival in the top flight was always going to be a tough task but Ipswich competed - more than what can be said for Leicester City and Southampton.",
      "While we have seen these monumental rises fall flat after one relegation - take Luton Town for example - McKenna has shown his impressive managerial credentials by fronting another promotion challenge straight away. Ipswich sit third in the Championship and will move into the top two should they win their game in hand.",
      "There is every possibility McKenna could add another promotion to his CV this season and if he does, why shouldn't United take a look at him? He fits the mould Ratcliffe has been pushing for at Old Trafford since arriving.",
      "McKenna is a young head coach, with plenty of potential to become even better. Not only that, but he has experience of working with younger players and making them better.",
      "Omari Hutchinson flourished under McKenna's guidance after leaving Chelsea while Liam Delap appeared lost after three disappointing loan spells at Stoke City, Preston North End and Hull City. McKenna saw the potential though and managed to tap into it before selling him to Chelsea.",
      "Also, unlike any of the other permanent managerial candidates, McKenna is fully aware of the scale of United and the scrutiny he will be under. You could argue Xavi has experienced similar but where the 39-year-old benefits over the former midfielder is his understanding of the Premier League and what it means to be in Carrington on a daily basis.",
      "Xavi won La Liga and the Copa del Rey but in a much less competitive league to the Premier League. In England, there are very few games where you can rotate because you are up against lesser opposition - would Xavi be able to cope with that?",
      "Perhaps the best option for United would be to pair McKenna up with his good friend Solskjaer and maybe even Carrick too to create a coalition of new ideas and experience to take the club forward. But McKenna should be the one leading the project.",
      "The jury is still out for Carrick as a head coach after his time at Middlesbrough and it is clear under Rob Edwards and Kim Hellberg now, Boro have improved since he left. Solskjaer meanwhile has struggled since leaving the Reds and his stint at Besiktas should rule him out of being the head coach again.",
      "But both men are more than competent coaches who could help McKenna as he attempts to adapt to one of the biggest jobs in club football. Ultimately, United have tried every single way of doing things for a return to the glory days. Why not try someone slightly less experienced but who has shown in his managerial career he has all the attributes a top-class coach needs?",

      "The Reds appointed Darren Fletcher as caretaker boss following Amorim's exit, with the ex-United and Scotland midfielder overseeing the 2-2 draw with Burnley in the top-flight on Wednesday.",
      "Amorim had spent 14 months as United head coach before his dismissal earlier this week, and there have already been a host of names linked with getting the job at Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "United are expected to hold talks with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick over taking the United job on an interim basis until the end of the season, but Fletcher has been asked to take charge of the FA Cup third-round tie against Brighton this weekend.",
      "Ex-United coach Meulensteen, who worked under the iconic Sir Alex Ferguson as his right-hand man, has been speaking about the Reds' decision to part ways with Amorim and explained why - with Fletcher being in interim charge - it should not take long to get the club back on track.",
      "\"I don't think now that it needs much to fix it, I really don't think it does,\" Meulensteen said on BBC Radio 5Live.",
      "\"You just need to put the players in the system that the players can play to their strengths and this could happen very, very, very quickly.",
      "\"The advantage of Darren Fletcher taking over as interim is two or three-fold. He knows the club.",
      "\"He's been under a very successful coach - so he knows what one looks like - and he's also been in a culture now which is not successful, so he knows what's wrong, what to fix in the short term.\"",

      "\"To lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do, but not in the circumstances I expected it to happy so that is something which doesn't sit quite easy with me. I have just got to think I have a job to do and I just have to lead the team [vs Burnley] and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could be precisely what Manchester United need right now, if Michael Carrick's previous evaluation is any indication. The Norwegian has been touted for a dramatic return to Old Trafford on an interim basis following Ruben Amorim's dismissal this week.",
      "In an official statement, United explained that the Amorim decision was taken to provide the club with the \"best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish\" during the season's second-half. Consequently, the board are now searching the market for an appropriate replacement, with several names emerging as contenders.",
      "While bookmakers have identified Oliver Glasner, Enzo Maresca and Gareth Southgate as proposed long-term appointments, reports suggest United could be considering bringing in a short-term, interim head coach before evaluating their options at the season's conclusion.",
      "Manchester United next manager LIVE - Solskjaer talks, Enrique latest, Glasner promise",
      "Carrick and Solskjaer have emerged as potential candidates for an interim role, given both men possess previous experience leading the club and maintain excellent relationships with Old Trafford's senior management.",
      "As such, the club are expected to meet with both individuals, to discuss a possible spell with United until the end of the 2025/2026 campaign. However, Carrick may well have inadvertently talked himself out of contention with a glowing appraisal of Solskjaer in the recent past.",
      "Speaking in 2019, the 44-year-old said about the Norwegian: \"Ole's got that personality that rubs off on everybody, he's so positive, he's so upbeat all the time. I think you can see that rubbing off on individuals, and that goes a long way to bringing the best out of the players.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Darren Fletcher is set to take the reins for United's Wednesday evening fixture against Burnley, as the club aims to maintain their impressive Premier League run. It's also believed that discussions will take place with the Scot regarding the possibility of him remaining in charge until the season concludes, while Ruud van Nistelrooy has apparently been overlooked by his former employers.",
      "According to The Mail, though the Dutchman was originally considered for the position, he has now fallen out of the frame. It comes despite Van Nistelrooy demonstrating his capabilities in October 2024 following Erik ten Hag's dismissal.",
      "Van Nistelrooy served as interim manager for four fixtures before Amorim's arrival in November, securing three victories and one draw before departing to manage Leicester City. His spell in the Midlands proved far less successful last term, with the Foxes ultimately dropping into the Championship and parting company with the 49-year-old by mutual agreement in June.",
      "If Solskjaer were to be named United's manager for the remainder of the campaign, the club could find itself in capable hands. The 52-year-old held the position at the club from 2018 to 2021, guiding United to sixth, third and second-place finishes in the Premier League.",
      "Despite not securing any trophies across all competitions, his efforts in the league outshone those of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Ten Hag.",

      "One potential candidate is PSG boss Enrique after reports emerged that the Spaniard doesn't wish to extend his contract with the French giants.",
      "However, after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked as United boss in November 2021, Enrique, then Spain boss, was quick to shut down any links to United's vacant managerial position. Reports had linked him with the club at the time.",
      "Recent reports had claimed Enrique could leave the Parisian club in the summer with his contract expiring amid a reported desire for a fresh challenge. If true, this would position the 55-year-old as being available in June.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "And in a further blow, reports he could leave the French capital have already been shot down by club chiefs. Speaking to Canal+ about the rumours on Tuesday, PSG sporting director Luis Campos simply replied: \"100% fake news.\"",
      "Enrique has been a huge success at PSG. He has won two league titles, the Coupe de France on two occasions and the Champions League in 2025.",
      "His European Cup triumph is his second as manager after he won it in charge of Barcelona in 2015. He also picked up two La Liga titles with the Catalan giants.",

      "PSG started the new year with a 2-1 win over city rivals Paris FC . Speaking after the game, Enrique claimed he was looking forward to winning more silverware in Paris.",
      "\"We came back to the Parc with a victory,\" he said. \"I hope we win as many trophies in 2026. That's our goal, which is ambitious, of course, but I think that everyone in this team, club, and our supporters are ambitious, too. We want to win trophies and that's what we're going to try to do.\"",

      "The Qatari billionaire went head-to-head with Sir Jim Ratcliffe in 2023 after the Glazer family opened the door to a sale of the club. Ratcliffe ultimately prevailed, securing an initial 25 per cent stake - now increased to 28.9 per cent - in 2024, leaving Sheikh Jassim empty-handed.",
      "However, one of the central pillars of his proposed ownership model appears to be influencing developments at Old Trafford. During the bidding process, it was widely reported that he intended to install former United players in \"prominent roles\" throughout the club, strengthening the connection between the boardroom and the dressing room.",
      "Sheikh Jassim believed the lack of club icons within United's hierarchy was a missed opportunity, especially given the wealth of experience and institutional knowledge available - and the idea is now gaining traction despite his absence.",
      "Ratcliffe, who oversees all football operations at United, has increasingly turned to former players for support over the past year. After dismissing Erik ten Hag last season, then assistant and club legend Ruud van Nistelrooy was appointed as interim head coach.",
      "That approach has now been repeated following Ruben Amorim's departure this week, with another former United stalwart, Under-18s boss Darren Fletcher, placed in temporary charge of the first team. Fletcher has also been joined on the coaching staff by his former United team-mate Jonny Evans, who only departed from his role as head of loans and pathways last month.",
      "Beyond the current setup, Ratcliffe is once again looking to United's past as he weighs up short-term solutions in the dugout. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who managed United between 2018 and 2021, is in talks over a potential interim return, while former midfielder Michael Carrick is also under consideration.",
      "Amorim was sacked on Monday following a fiery outburst after United's 0-0 draw with Leeds the day before. During a heated post-match press conference, the 40-year-old insisted he was the \"manager\" of the club, not merely the head coach - a remark that hinted at tension with the hierarchy.",
      "His 14-month tenure proved a major disappointment. Amorim won just 38 per cent of his games in charge, the lowest for any permanent United manager since Frank O'Farrell in the early 1970s.",
      "The Portuguese coach also presided over much of one of the club's worst domestic campaigns in decades, culminating in a 15th-place Premier League finish last season. They were also beaten in the Europa League final, missing out on a route back into the Champions League.",
      "Yet despite the setbacks, Amorim leaves the team in comparatively decent shape. At the time of writing, United sit sixth in the table - their highest position under him - and are just three points off the top four.",
      "With the club now turning to familiar faces for help, the stage is set for a period of transition that could redefine United's immediate future.",

      "Unfortunately for Fletcher, he has limited options to choose from to try and get a much-needed victory tonight. Amad, Noussair Mazraoui and Bryan Mbeumo remain unavailable due to their participation at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). As for injuries, captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount trained on Tuesday and are available tonight.",
      "Their minutes will be managed as they return to full match fitness but it is a boost for the Reds to have two players in such good form back available. Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire are out due to injury issues and Kobbie Mainoo faces a late fitness test.",

      "The chances of him lasting 90 minutes are very slim but it would set the tone. Playing him deeper could be the safe option and recalling Zirkzee, who provided a great assist for Cunha at Leeds, could be a wise option.",

      "Manchester United are on the hunt for a new manager once again following the sacking of Ruben Amorim, as the hierarchy ponder their next move.",
      "While Darren Fletcher is in post for now, Man United could turn to the familiar face of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who enjoyed a famous interim period with the club before landing the role as manager on a full-time basis.",
      "Reports surrounding talks over a short-term deal for the Norwegian coach could see him 'back at the wheel' once more, while the 52-year-old was spotted back in Cheshire, where he has owned a £4m home.",
      "The property is based in Alderley Edge, where plenty of famous stars have decided to settle - including Manchester City's Erling Haaland and Coleen and Wayne Rooney, while Victoria and David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo also lived in the area in the past - while celebrities such as Christine McGuinness and Kerry Katona have been spotted living in the area.",
      "Solskjaer bought his property, which was originally a cottage, and transformed it into an \"eco mansion\", which began building in 2007.",
      "It took some time for the former Manchester United man to move in with his family, having spent time in Norway after his playing career came to an end.",
      "That had led to him putting it up on the market, but when it wasn't sold, reports claimed that he rented it out to Liverpool star Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Solskjaer eventually moved into the property fully in 2019, when returning to Old Trafford, with the mansion featuring 3.4 acres of land around it.",
      "When put on the market back in 2016, the brochure provided by estate agents described the features of the property, which said: \"[The property] is an impressive contemporary style recently constructed detached family residence in extensive grounds of approximately 3.4 acres with impressive leisure complex with pool.",
      "\"[It] is a charming quiet, cobbled road on the outskirts of Alderley Edge enjoying a delightful rural setting. The village centre which is within a few minutes drive offers an excellent range of shopping, educational and recreational facilities with a wealth of quality cafes and fine restaurants.\"",
      "The estate agent added: \"[The home] enjoys extensive mature grounds surrounding the property with sweeping lawns, mature trees and shrubs with open views beyond.",
      "\"Natural wood electrically operated double gates to the front where a sweeping gravel driveway provides excellent parking facilities and leads to an attached garage.\"",
      "There is also a pool room in the house, along with a media room, similar to those seen in some footballer's houses that will often feature cinema rooms.",
      "With Solskjaer believed to still own the property, and spotted back in Cheshire, there is a possibility he and his family could move back into the house if he is called in for the interim spell.",
      "For the meantime, he will be watching on with every Man United supporter, as they prepare for an interesting few games ahead under Fletcher.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "It turns out this is a good year to be a bit rubbish, as there are 17 teams that are vying to be crisis clubs on any given weekend. (The goal difference column makes interesting reading). So we are still somehow knocking on the Champions League spots and as I see it, 2 out of United, Liverpool and Chelsea are likely to make it. It’s anybody’s guess how that pans out. But I’d give each club equal chance at this point which means we have a 66% shot at CL.",

This is a group of players who are definitely good enough to get into the top 5 of the league. United have had a history of late of somehow devaluing players and seeing them shine elsewhere. Largely because they didn’t fit the system and were being played out of position (McTominay), or just worn down by the lack of support and success (Rashford, Hojlund). Players were also encouraged to become d*ckheads (Garnacho/ Sancho) rather than buckle down and perform.",
      "Solskjaer’s term ended badly but there were good things about it – much like this year, we did well against the big teams playing a counterattacking style, and then with Bruno we were also able to break down deep lying defences. It all fell apart in trying to accommodate Ronaldo who liked to stay up further and Maguire, who needs to play deep.",
      "Failure isn’t the monster everybody makes it out to be. Failure without learning is where the problem is. As long as the Ineos group learn from their mistakes, and there is a sense of progression, I’m happy enough. Transfers have definitely been more on the money in the past year and this year we obviously have specific problems that are fixable. We’ve done badly against the bottom half of teams, and we have conceded too many goals despite the 3 at the back structure. I feel both of these can be addressed with some tactical flexibility and game management.",
      "Lastly, none of this would be a problem if Amorim had won 3 more matches – wins against Everton, West Ham, and Wolves – all 3 very winnable games would have removed all the swirling questions and issues, and it feels a little bit like Amorim chose to die on his formation hill – and that’s a shame because no manager can survive in the long term without tactical flexibility. Hopefully that’s something Amorim has taken away from this experience.",
      "What United need to learn perhaps is that before we aim for winning the league, we should aim for a couple of years of consistently finishing in the top 4 and building a squad capable of challenging on multiple fronts. If Solskjaer or the next manager can get us there over the next 3 years and then we get in somebody for a big push that probably is a better idea than sitting in 12th place and dreaming about winning the title.\nVed Sen, Optimistically, MUFC",

      "1. In August/September, they were hailed as “mentality monsters” as they won a succession of tight games in injury time or the last 10 minutes of normal time. Sign of champions, they’ll be unbeatable when they click, etc.",
      "2. Things turned, they lost a slew of games and conceded some late goals in the process. Turns out they’d been papering over the cracks and their luck had to run out some time. Directly contradicts the above, but everyone got a pass for ever thinking that.",
      "3. The crap run dragged on longer than expected, some people attributed it to grief while others focused on the form of their £400k-per-week totems falling off a cliff. New signings had been almost uniformly shit for months, so the scrutiny turned to Slot and how he was on borrowed time. Manager is a fraud, last season an aberration, can’t handle adversity, etc. etc.",
      "4. Salah decided to give a “me me meeeee” interview, got rightly dropped, promptly f*cked off to AFCON. One problem temporarily out of the picture, Liverpool’s form stabilised slightly after that, and they now sit atop the pile of mush occupying 4th-14th in the table. Cue the “transitional period” guff as the above rationales fade from relevance and fans scramble to explain the current state of affairs, which feels quite sterile from afar.",
      "In the space of less than 5 months this team has tumbled from heavy odds title favourites to distant also-rans, and to my eyes at least it’s because of a series of questionable decisions that have directly impacted them on the pitch. Throwing crazy money at Van Dijk and Salah, buying a pair of expensive full-backs who can’t defend, spunking £200m on strikers and neglecting more pressing needs in the squad.",
      "None of those things are markers of a club in transition whatsoever. They’re expensive, flawed decisions which were intended to stand on the league’s throat from a position of strength. The players who came in were all ready-made first teamers with the exception of Leoni. They were supposed to strengthen and refresh the squad, not form the foundation of a long-term rebuild. The players who left were also sold by choice, intended to be swapped out for incoming upgrades.",
      "When that approach backfires, you don’t get to retreat behind a wall of your own construction that you’ve covered in graffiti proclaiming that last season’s success only prolonged the inevitable after Klopp left. Trying to protect yourself from the slings and arrows from other fans with bull like that only makes you look childish. This isn’t a transition, it was fully intended to be a progression. You don’t have to like the direction of travel, and right now I wouldn’t blame Liverpool fans for that. But stop trying to sell the rest of us an absolute pup.\nKeith Reilly",
      "Antoine Semenyo is finally in the Premier League team of the season after his tenth goal v Tottenham.",

He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",

      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cools the immediate temperatures, but it does all feel extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves have lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",

      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to lose 3-2 to a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",

      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ends 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",

      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Manchester City and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 1 with four more games each.",
      "Burnley were only selected once more – on the February midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (24 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £20.2m in 2024/25",
      "2nd) Aston Villa (23 games) – worth around £19.3m",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (22 games) – worth around £18.5m",

      "It was almost too Manchester United DNA, too caretaker manager.",
      "Darren Fletcher had kept his powder relatively dry. He made one change to the starting line-up, the biggest alteration between Elland Road and Turf Moor coming in his chosen formation. Sir Jim Ratcliffe finally got his wish with a four-man defence but will probably be wondering why Bryan Mbeumo wasn’t picked at right-back.",
      "It conjured a positive performance worthy of victory. Manchester United had 30 shots to Burnley’s seven, with ten on target to one. Yet they still contrived to draw to a team consigned by most to relegation.",
      "Had Shea Lacey, the exciting academy graduate winger, shot marginally lower after collecting a Mason Mount pass and running at an increasingly panicked Lucas Pires in the 85th minute, then Fletcher would have had his crowning moment in the big chair.",
      "But try as he might, even with five positive and sensible substitutions, an attacking gameplan and the revitalisation of Benjamin Sesko, this is a club currently lacking fortune almost as much as it is intelligent thought and vague levels of competence.",
      "Fletcher wanted “to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball, don’t hide,” and it’s difficult to pinpoint anyone who specifically failed on those fronts. Casemiro and Lisandro Martinez could have done far better for the Burnley goals but it was an approach and display which, nine times out of ten, would have delivered a victory.",
      "This simply happened to be the one, and the first time a Ferguson disciple turned interim manager has failed to win their first game.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "Ryan Giggs, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy all proudly discussed having consulted Ferguson over their caretakership, all said the right things about passion, bravery, imagination and expression, and all savoured vibe-restoring, feel-good victories from the dugout as the support chanted their name again to escape the misery of the prior months.",
      "Fletcher was certainly embraced by the travelling fans as the latest saviour temporarily promoted from the former players’ WhatsApp group, but will have noted how Solskjaer and Carrick also had their songs given a run-out during a third straight draw against a team in the bottom five.",
      "Those who will ultimately decide which legend is pestered over tactics for the next four months by Jason Wilcox might have preferred a clearer indication of the populist choice.",
      "And this really did little to boost or block Fletcher’s candidacy. A good performance produced a poor result, neither of which really moves the needle sufficiently for or against him.",
      "The goals conceded were a deflected cross and a wonderful individual effort. The goals scored were the result of smart moves, the first a direct consequence of Fletcher’s half-time redeployment of Bruno Fernandes on the right. Two wrongs don’t make a right and 2-2 probably doesn’t extend this spell past one more game at most.",
      "Thus Manchester United, despite slipping below a quite absurd Newcastle team, are back precisely where they started. With the next appointment being purely for the rest of this season it is tough to imagine how either Solskjaer or Carrick set themselves apart from the other when both are seeking the counsel and advice of the same 84-year-old elephant in every room at Old Trafford and Carrington, both will be signing from the same hymn sheet about identity and culture, and both can point to past ship-steadying exploits, achieved with a great many of these players.",
      "It is a decision which can likely be put off past the weekend, when Brighton visit in the FA Cup. There lies the last opportunity for Manchester United to adorn this season with a trophy, but beyond that are their next two Premier League opponents: Manchester City and Arsenal on January 17 and 25 respectively.",
      "There is still plenty to play for, still a Champions League place to secure and a season to stabilise. Fletcher’s chance to make a compelling argument that he should be trusted with those responsibilities has passed; Manchester United have a week or so to make a decision they have already proven they cannot be trusted with.",

No doubt he can be more flexible and he can definitely bring something slightly different in terms of the way he’s going to manage things. But will he be happy with the squad he’s got or is he just going to accept the Man United job and say, this is what you’ve got, go on and manage it?",
      "“It’s a whole different Man United proposition, rather than coming in as it used to be, getting the big job at Man United, having money to put your own imprint on the club.",

      "Former Manchester United player Michael Owen believes the board always had “scepticism” about Ruben Amorim and his recent comments were simply an excuse to sack him.",
      "Amorim was relieved of his duties on Monday after taking a swipe at the United hierarchy, ending a tenure which had previously seen him survive calling the club the worst it’s ever been, a 15th-place finish and an embarrassing League Cup exit to Grimsby.",
      "Despite all this, part-owner Jim Ratcliffe said in the summer that Amorim should be judged over three years but Owen believes there was always “scepticism” about the Portuguese boss.",
      "“With regard to problems Amorim had,” Owen said. “I think the one positive he had, was I think people liked him, the way he spoke and how he articulated things and how honest he was. And I think that was an absolute stark contrast to his predecessor, Ten Hag.",
      "“I actually think Amorim’s honesty and his take on things was quite refreshing, and he would quite openly say, This is the worst Manchester United team there’s ever been, and all these things.",
      "“So it’s quite refreshing when you see that from a manager. So that possibly is one of the reasons why he kept the job after some real dips, because his results at the end of the day, compared to any manager in the last decades, were worse.",
      "READ: Solskjaer told to block ‘absurd’ Neville and ignore shadow of Sir Alex…",
      "“So I think there was a little bit of that. And I also think there was a little bit of everybody thinking, we can’t just keep changing the manager. So people were willing to give him even longer.",
      "“However, I do think behind the scenes, there was scepticism. I do think the results, I do think the system and the way he was reluctant to change had a big bearing on that. I do think that probably the powers above him were not convinced. Once he was going to step out of line, let’s say, in this situation, it almost gave them the perfect excuse to say ‘right, well, we weren’t happy anyway, so this is the perfect time to do it.’ I think that’s what happened.”",
      "For those reasons, Owen said he was not “surprised at all” by the decision and linked it to Enzo Maresca’s departure from Chelsea.",
      "The former Liverpool and Manchester United striker added: “I think both scenarios, Maresca at Chelsea and Amorim at Manchester United, both almost happened quickly. A week before, there was nothing.",
      "“In the lead up to the game against Leeds, I was doing the game on TV, and all the chat behind the scenes was, Amorim, there’s been a big bust-up. So I knew before the game that this could escalate rather like it did with Maresca. And of course, in many ways, it’s a very similar scenario.",

      "“Now there’s plenty of different departments that all need to be happy. So, yeah, it did happen quick, but I wasn’t surprised at all. I was a little bit surprised with what he said after the game, but I knew that there was trouble behind the scenes. But as soon as he said it, I wasn’t surprised that it ended quickly. You simply can’t say things like that about your team, about your employers, about anything, and expect to last. When you look back at his reign, there are so many points you can say it went wrong for him.”",
      "As for what comes next, Owen says that is the $64m question.",
      "“So we all know the way it goes. It’s eventually you can’t hide behind results and his weren’t good enough,” he exclusively told F365, courtesy of casino.org where he is UK ambassador, which helps players find the best casino online options in Britain. “Then obviously, the $64 million question is, to me, what type of manager? Who would you like to see go in there? Because it’s obviously going to take some type of manager to work under that system that they have at the club. They’ve tried the younger coaches.",
      "“Now, if Darren Fletcher gets a good result, we all know what will happen. He’ll get the next game and the next game and the next game. And then if he does it six, seven, eight, nine times, like Ole, then he’s going to get the job until the end of the season, you would think. So I get that. There’s lots of good managers out there. There’s lots of good managers that are in a job that might be ready for a change at the end of the season.",
      "“I’m looking at Crystal Palace, Glasner. I’m looking at Fulham. I’m looking at Bournemouth. There’s lots of managers that are in a job that are highly respected and touted. And then you’ve got people that are out of work.”",

      "It seems GNev and co continue to wield a disproportionate amount of influence over their former club, as seen by their continued criticisms of former manager head coach Ruben Amorim, which affected him to the point that he claimed one of the reasons he didn’t bin his 3-4-3 system was “I cannot change because the players will understand that I am changing because of [media pressure]”.",
      "United seem quite unique in having a large contingent of club legends dominating the mainstream media, and even more unique that said contingent is so persistently negative about the club, typically under the banner of “that’s not how it was done in our day” (Carra, by contrast, is usually sycophantically praising of Liverpool, even during their recent dafter moments of player management).",
      "Amorim is not the first post-Sir Alex Man U manager GNev, Keane and Scholes have gone after – Solskjaer himself is basically the only one who escaped their more acerbic assertions, largely because “he is one of us”.",
      "It hasn’t seemed to dawn on them that “their day” has long been consigned to history, and that Modern Football, and indeed modern Manchester United, are unrecognisable from the swashbuckling-winger era that Sir Alex Ferguson presided over, with the kind of impunity that modern managers can only dream about. One can leave to their own imagination what the fall out would have been if, say, Jason Wilcox had told Ferguson in 2012 “we are not signing Robin van Persie for you because he is over 25”.",
      "One could also point out the absurdity of Neville and Keane in particular having such little sympathy for modern managers given how they both failed abysmally as managers themselves. Neville’s entire managerial career lasted less than six months with a win percentage almost as low as Amorim’s, while Roy Keane torched bridges with the same aplomb he perfected in the back-end of his playing days. Club legends they may be, but experts on football management they are not.",
      "It may be time for Man United players, fans and management alike to let go of the continued romanticism of the past; of the misguided belief, possibly at the root of Ratcliffe’s “under 25” policy, that another “class of 92” will come along and repeat the miracles of the 90s – Chelsea fans can tell you how realistic that is.",
      "There is much that still needs to take root in the INEOS era, and doubtless more mistakes will be made.

This hardly constitutes a different approach for Manchester United.",

He was afforded more slack than any manager I’ve ever seen before. He took us to 15th in the league. 15th FFS! Think about that for one second. Ten Haag, who, let’s be clear, was dogshit, has a record far better than Amorim’s. That’s how bad he was.",
      "And, unforgivably, he was a complete coward. Need a goal with ten minutes to go, losing one nil at home to ten man Everton, put on another forward or two? Really go for it?

Here’s an opinion from Aman from December 2024 – “Amorim, Amad, Yoro, Hojlund, Garnacho & Bruno should stay, the rest of them need to be offloaded to whoever is willing to take them. There are 0 world class players at United and barely 5 above-average players at United”. Now, let’s ignore the Hojlund and Garnacho elephant in the room, that leaves 3 above-average players at United according to Aman.",

I’m guessing Aman doesn’t rate Dorgu or Sesko (because he comes across as that type of impatient supporter) and perhaps rates the others on a par with Bruno (remember “above-average”). That means that he doesn’t think most of our defence or midfield is good enough to be playing for United. Yet here he is, harping on about how good managers should be able to get players to perform their best, and suggesting this squad (remember, only a handful are “above-average”) should be doing better.",
      "In terms of results, we are joint 5th in the league, our attack is 3rd best. There are 5 teams above us who are at least a couple of years ahead in terms of squad building. How much better should we be doing? By your own admission the squad isn’t ready to compete. Money has been spent on the attack and it was working, in a season or two our MF and Defence would be stronger. Before this season started, had any Utd supporter been offered 5th, 3 points off 4th, with the 3rd best attack, at the halfway point they would have bitten your hand off.",
      "Embarrassing isn’t a supporter having an opinion that the club was wrong to sack a manager off the back of boardroom politics, when there are clear signs of progress on the pitch. Embarrassing is a “supporter” throwing around statistics such as a poor win rate, whilst also previously suggesting that the team needs a major overhaul and only a handful are “above-average” at best.

Watching them play, the results weren’t great, and crumbs they were frustrating to watch at times (oftentimes they were hilarious to watch), but the longer I watched I could see that he was making progress, the system was taking shape.",
      "Football is always Ideology vs Results, and results usually win in the end, but I think Amorim was hired on an ideology which everyone could see would take a few years to get in place. To me at least, if you look past the results, I think Amorim’s ideology was always improving.\nDale May, Swindon Wengerite",
      "",
      "Some of these so-called United supporters are truly an embarrassment to the club as a whole. I agree that INOES & the board have made some rubbish moves, and I agree that the RIGHT person should be given enough time to build a team and take the club forward. But Amorim was the equivalent of Andre Villas Boas at Chelsea/Roy Hodson at Liv level of manager.",
      "Absolutely out of his depth, only good at press conferences. If you cannot manage or coach a team of players to perform their best you are neither a good coach or a manager. You are rubbish.",
      "– When you win % at United is worse than Gary “Worst Manager Ever” Neville as a manager, you are rubbish",
      "– When you are the United manager in history with the worst record of goals conceded, you are rubbish.",
      "– When you lose to Grimsby & cannot beat Wolves, 10 man Everton, West Ham, Leeds etc etc, you are rubbish.",
      "– When you have a multi million pound job, and fail to show any signs of improvement, you are rubbish.",
      "We were never getting top 4 after failing to win some of the easiest matches of the season. After Burnley we play City & Arsenal, so clearly the last few matches were where we should be picking up points if we had any chance of a top 5 finish.",
      "Amorim isn’t a coach, he is a child who threw his toys out of the pram because he got called out for being rubbish. He could have worked with what he had to give the team the best chance to win and get points, and slowly progressed to his way of play once all the tools were in place. This is not a charity. You cannot use your position to gain work experience and learn on the job. He was out of his depth.",
      "Not one fan can say what his tactics or actual goal was with the team other than 3 at the back & chill. You cannot be throwing an attitude around when you are so abysmal at your job & your bosses try to give you constructive feedback. When Alex Iwobi gloats about how easy it is to play through your “tactics”, it’s time to learn and improve. He refused to learn, refused to improve, and acted a clown throughout his time at United.",
      "Good managers need to be given time, but Amorim is not a good manager. It’s that simple. He should have been fired long back and the board backed him as much as they could. But you cannot be talking shit when your results are absolutely crap. Its as simple as that. You failed to beat most of the top 17 teams last season. You failed to beat some of the bottom 5 teams this season. You are rubbish at your job.",
      "These United fans seem to have forgotten what standards are. Blindly supporting any nonsense at the club doesn’t make sense. If it was Conte, Ancelotti, Tuchel or someone, sure give them time. But you cannot just hope a turd turns into a diamond if given more time. It will stay a turd and just start stinking the place out more. There is not a single player Amorim improved. There is not a single match which felt like we were back. There is not a single thing he did which was memorable. He was an abject failure of a manager.",
      "He would make a good manager for West Ham or Brighton or someone one day maybe. United fans make fun of chequebook managers yet wanted Amorm to get his 15 players in before judging him? The clown couldnt coach & those are the facts.",
      "Coming to the board, it’s time to stop hiring random hipsters from small leagues. After the 2026 World Cup, we have Ancelotti, Tuchel & many many many more managers available who have the pedigree to coach a top club, win titles, and have the respect of players. Please do not go for another “hope and pray he works out” type of manager. PLEASE!!!\nAman",
      "",
      "…Ok, with the admission that I hate when an outsider writes in about Arsenal and seems to misunderstand everything about the team (and I suspect a good proportion of United fans who frequent the mailbox will think I am, based on their mails), I cannot believe any of you are unhappy Amorim is gone.",
      "I know there are more existential issues (can we ever recruit anyone good again, is the back office there for anyone to thrive etc) and some underlying data that things weren’t as bad as all that (xG tables, chance creation etc) which can mitigate some of his criticism, but at the same time, you realise everyone outside the club could see he was out of his depth; a terrible communicator, frankly quite immature and tactically so simplistic, everyone knew what he was going to do. That the performances were turning around was more because of the inordinate amount of money and sheer inevitability of talent that brings than anything else.",
      "We’re frankly devastated you’ve binned him.",
      "The ‘trust the process’ structure that worked so well for Arsenal and Arteta works only if your promising young manager actually has the fundamentals and flexibility to thrive – if he doesn’t and that will become apparent relatively quickly, you absolutely need to get rid to not fall into a sunk cost trap. Whatever the ‘haha, second place bottler’ banter merchants like to think, everyone who came across Arteta at every point before and after Arsenal hired him, from his coaching peers and players to the board rooms could see he had the qualities and personality to become an elite coach, he has changed and evolved into one over his tenure and Arsenal are immensely lucky to have him.",
      "But he was able to succeed where Emery didn’t (and I have a lot to say on this if F365 wants to give me a run at a fan article like that West Ham chap got) mostly because Arsenal got their house in order behind the scenes and it is fair to ask, if you don’t believe United have that, whether anyone can succeed.",
      "But Amorim never could, so you can be glad he’s gone.\nTom, Leyton",
      "(Write the article; you know where to send it – Ed)",
      "",
      "…There has been a lot written about Ratcliffe, Berrada and Wilcox and their role in the hiring and eventual firing of Amorim. Reports suggest Wilcox and Ratcliffe had begun nudging Amorim on tactical details before the axe fell. Some see that as overreach. If you hire someone welded to a back three, why the surprise when he insists on playing that way?",
      "Initially, I had some sympathy for Amorim. But I think the story goes back to the hiring.",
      "After Ten Hag, the hierarchy clearly fell in love with Ruben Amorim. They liked his charisma, his record, his face, and believed he could be the poster boy for Manchester United for the next decade under INEOS. At the same time, Wilcox spoke about identifying a style of play that would run through the club. We know he favoured a 4-3-3, and it is hard to believe that did not imply a back four long term. United’s history of attacking wide players would hopefully have been part of that thinking as well. That clearly clashed with Amorim’s known devotion to a back three.",
      "My suspicion is that the job came with an understanding. Amorim could start with three at the back while he settled into the league, but over time the team would evolve into a back four. That is how United play, and he would be supported through poor results because this was meant to be a long-term project (something Ratcliffe would keep his word on, publicly backing him for three years in October). Amorim accepted, likely believing he could deal with the change later or even perhaps change their minds through results.",
      "After a year of consistently poor performances in the back three, Christmas was chosen as the point of evolution. AFCON and injuries gave the necessary caveats, meaning no face was lost on either side.",
      "The Bournemouth and Villa games showed improvement. Attacking patterns began to emerge quickly. Then United beat Newcastle and everybody was happy. The team was improving following a change from the coach, who had been supported well by the board. Big money deals to finally fix the midfield were mooted. Champions League was still in sight. You could see where it was meant to go.",
      "Then came Wolves.",
      "Against a historically poor side, Amorim either lost his nerve or pushed back against the hierarchy by reverting to the back three. It failed. United went in behind, he switched to a back four, the team improved immediately, and the game was there to be won. It was not. The damage was done.",
      "From there, reports of arguments and nudging from above made sense. If the agreement had always been to evolve over the Christmas period and Amorim had gone back on it while costing the team points, the hierarchy were entitled to challenge him.",
      "Leeds was the final straw. Persisting with the back three and publicly leaning into the manager versus head coach narrative felt like deliberate provocation.",
      "I think Amorim had been overwhelmed for some time. Fear and ego pushed him toward the system he trusted most. Changing formation while overseeing one of the worst United runs in modern history would have felt like admitting the hierarchy were right all along.",
      "It is easy to see both sides. A potentially generational young coach was hired with the understanding he would initially be supported before evolving the team toward a defined long-term identity. Amorim reneged on that agreement.",
      "And he was never the manager. He was the first Head Coach of Manchester United. Everyone knew that. Saying otherwise in public could easily have been seen as crossing a line. A profitable one for Amorim.",
      "I know it is fashionable to pile on Ratcliffe and Wilcox, but there is at least a chance they did most things right. They picked the right guy, backed him, and worked with him. But he managed to fuck it up.\nMatt",
      "",
      "My first game at Old Trafford was to watch the Busby Babes in 1955. Since then I have been a fan of Manchester United. As with all fans I have watched my club go from the highs of winning the European Cup to the lows of the Munich Air Disaster. I even saw a United legend (Denis Law) relegate United.",
      "What we are going through now is a transitory period that we have seen so many times before. My problem stems from the day Martin Edwards sold the club to the Glazers. Edwards pocketed the money, walked away and left millions of United supporters in deep trouble. He even has the brass neck to go back and watch games. There is no doubt that when those money grabbing carpetbaggers from America “STOLE” our club the rot well and truly set in.",
      "Then due to greed and incompetence the Glazers wasted all the money they pulled out of the club along with all the debt they placed upon it. So the club was put up for sale because the Glazers had become nervous of the future costs facing them. The stadium was falling down and they owed that much money they were never going to borrow the money for a new stadium.",
      "So what happens? That idiot Ratcliffe comes along and bails them out with over a Billion £’s. You can forget all the propagander about him being a lifelong United supporter. He isn’t. He tried to buy Chelsea first and failed. He tried to buy United but didn’t have enough money to do it. So what we have got is his third option, like most of the players he has bought, not top quality.",
      "He then starts to appoint his “Best in Class” people. Again not top quality. Barrada was at City who had an owner who just threw money at problems. That is why somewhere there are 115 charges to answer. Wilcox another ex City person who had one year at Southampton. Hardly a prime resume. Brailsford, that well known football expert who didn’t last very long. Another who didn’t last as long as Brailsford is Dan Ashworth. He tried to bring us Gareth Southgate. When you look at all these facts it is almost a criminal enterprise with all these false prophets.",
      "Now the conspiracy theorists have come up with another darker side to all this mess. This fact is true. Both Barrada and Wilcox have brought in numerous people they worked with at Manchester City.It is said the club is now rife with ex City employees. The conspiracy theory is that Sheik Mansaur has deliberately infiltrated United to keep them a permanent fixture in the middle of the table. True or not it makes for an interesting conversation.\nBrendan Kearney",
      "",
      "With a few of the old guard linked, Gary Neville has warned Manchester United they could get stuck in a cycle.",
      "Antoine Semenyo is finally in the Premier League team of the season after his tenth goal v Tottenham.",
      "Why aren’t Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox falling on their Man Utd sword? The clown club dominate the narrative once again.",
      "Darren Fletcher can probably be removed from a Manchester United caretaker manager race which has been whittled down to two sides of the same Ferguson coin.",
      "Manchester United seem likely to go for the caretaker manager option, so we have made things a little easier for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Michael Carrick.",
      "The past is Man Utd’s biggest problem with ex-players and ex-managers dominating the narrative. They should all be blocked."

      "Squint a little and Manchester United's players and supporters were beginning to enjoy themselves again even if Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada did appear rather stoney-faced in the stands. Kobbie Mainoo and Mason Mount as the midfield two. Thirty shots.",
      "The stories are already doing the rounds about how Fletcher has inspired the young players at Old Trafford by showing them videos of Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney. We have been here before, of course, when Solskjaer had a tale for every situation. Fans lap it up.",
      "None of which should really convince United's decision-makers to lurch back to the past for any great length of time. As difficult as it might be after a painful - and now largely pointless - misstep under Ruben Amorim, United still need to look to the future.",
      "Nostalgia is a powerful emotion when you have won the lot but despite the subsequent line in the song claiming that it is never going to stop, United are stuck once again. This can feel like a football club that is happier looking backwards rather than forwards.",
      "For now, every match - every conversation around that match - has become a referendum on this club's path back to glory. United are at another fork in that road. Many seem tired of the attempts to modernise by mimicry. They want to do it their way.",

      "The culture at United is different and it is natural that Ferguson's former players look for lessons from their old guru, even if Solskjaer's infamous claim that he did not feel comfortable using his parking space at the training ground was rather stretching it.",
      "The challenge is that replicating him is not quite as easy as instituting the possession principles drilled into kids at Barcelona's La Masia or Ajax's De Toekomst. Ferguson was more malleable, his ideas a moveable feast that shifted to the game's requirements.",

      "Indeed, Liverpool went through all this too, dragging Sir Kenny Dalglish out of retirement when they lost their way under Roy Hodgson, the title never seeming so far from view. It took the arrival of a man with no ties whatsoever to the city to deliver that prize.",

      "That should be obvious. But when you are Manchester United and have won the lot under one man, the temptation to look back can be irresistible. Solskjaer at the wheel? Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. Squint a little and it might even start to make sense.",

I love a lot the way we played, we did many good things, but we don't score goals. There are too many clear chances. It is not just one or two players, it is all the players up front who create a lot. Unfortunately we couldn't score and scoring goals is part of the job. That is the reason why we could not win the games.\"",
      "After the game, Guardiola refused to confirm City were on the brink of signing Antoine Semenyo, who is expected to undergo a medical on Thursday after City reportedly agreed to meet the Ghana international's £65m release clause, but maybe a third successive draw underlines Guardiola's need for the Bournemouth winger's creativity.Oliver Yew",

      "Five goals in his last two games including a double against Sunderland, has seen the Brazilian write himself into Premier League folklore. His 16 Premier League goals this season is more than any other player from the country has managed previously.",
      "Bearing in mind that it is still the beginning of January, that is some feat for a player who must be thinking about earning a place at the table for the World Cup come the summer.",
      "More importantly for Brentford fans, his goals may leave them sat at the table of European contenders next season, something they wouldn’t have even dreamed of when the inexperienced Keith Andrews replaced the beloved Thomas Frank. He certainly has stepped into the spotlight without a hitch.",
      "All these changes for the Bees in the summer seemed to spell doom. But, football is a funny game, and it has ended up being another boom instead.",
      "When it comes to Panenka penalties, there's a fine line between audacious brilliance and awful execution.",
      "Which side of that line a player falls on ultimately depends on one thing - whether the ball ends up in the back of the net.",
      "A missed penalty is bad, yet a curious rule of this beautiful game we love dictates that a missed Panenka is orders of magnitude worse.",
      "In the case of Sunderland's Enzo Le Fee, not only did he miss a penalty, he compounded it with a Panenka, which happened to be one of the worst seen in the Premier League for some time.",
      "There is a time and place for Panenka - and this wasn't it. Ideally, they should be taken from a position of strength and not, say, when your team is fighting for a second‑half equaliser after being outplayed in the first period.",
      "Yet when tasked with cancelling out Igor Thiago's opener and hauling Sunderland level at the Gtech Community Stadium, Le Fee decided that was the opportune moment to whip it out.",
      "The penalty barely served as catching practice for goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher, who nonchalantly gathered to halt Sunderland's second‑half momentum, before Thiago's second and Ehor Yarmoliuk's third extinguished their challenge.Jack Wilkinson",
      "\"I'm not scared of anyone,\"",
      "That's what Mateus Mane said after he scored his second in as many games to rescue a point for Wolves at Everton.",
      "At just 18, he's the light that Wolves have needed in what has been a dark campaign.",
      "His maturity on the ball, whether in decision-making or looking after possession, is that of a forward well beyond his years. His composure was on full display as he took a deft touch to set himself and stroke home his side's leveller.",
      "Liverpool, Old Trafford and now Everton's Hill Dickinson, the England youth international is building a portfolio of impressive displays.",
      "Still just a teenager but it looks like whatever fate lies ahead of Wolves for the rest of this season, the next five months will be silver-lined by Mane.William Bitibiri",
      "Burnley have spent most of this season searching for something, anything, to break their way. Against Manchester United, they finally found it.",
      "This was not a performance built on dominance or territorial control. Far from it. Burnley lost the expected goals battle 0.24 to 2.25, were outshot 30 to seven and managed just nine touches in the Manchester United penalty box across the 90 minutes. Those numbers usually tell a blunt story. Usually they spell defeat.",
      "Instead, they walked off with a 2-2 draw and a sense that maybe the season hasn't completely slipped through their fingers.",
      "Burnley are now 12 matches without a win, a sequence that speaks volumes about the brutal learning curve of life back in the Premier League.",
      "They were outplayed. They were outshot. They were out-chanced. And yet they survived. It is something to build on.Lewis Jones",
      "It was a tale of two halves on the pitch and a tale of two very different moods from the managers in the press conference.",
      "Unai Emery, still seething VAR did not look at a late penalty claim for his side, insisted there were positives to take following the draw. But the frustration in his body language was clear to see.",
      "Villa could have moved clear of Manchester City in second with a win, although it likely would have been undeserved.",
      "Instead, they dropped points to Crystal Palace yet again. If Oliver Glasner could bottle up what he has over his counterpart when they face off against each other, managers across the Premier League would be queuing up.",
      "In the red and blue corner, Glasner was bubbling in his press conference.",
      "His side are in a tough period but despite injuries and absences due to AFCON, as well as transfer rumours surrounding captain Marc Guehi bubbling away, his side battled well and arguably should've come away with more.",
      "Football is unpredictable at the best of times but Palace causing problems and frustration for Villa now seems inevitable.Pat Rowe",

      "\"To lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I'm proud to do. It's not in the circumstances I expected it to happen so that doesn't sit easy with me.",
      "\"I've got a job to do which is to lead the team tomorrow. I have great honour and pride in doing that.\"",

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",

      "\"I best speak to Sir Alex.\"",
      "It has been a quick turnaround for the former United midfielder, who has spent the last six months coaching the club's U18s.",
      "After Monday's sacking of former head coach Ruben Amorim, he was asked by United's hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, to take the first team's training sessions and prepare them for Wednesday, an opportunity Fletcher could not say no to.",
      "\"It was shock, pride, I best speak to Sir Alex [Ferguson] - they're the things that first went into my head.",
      "\"I phone Sir Alex on all the big decisions that I make in general really in football - his words echoed what my thoughts were, that you do what's best for the club and that's always been my intention.",
      "\"It's beyond my wildest dreams that I'd be sitting here leading a Manchester United team. It's been thrown upon me and probably a good thing because I've not had time to think.",
      "\"If it would have been said to me and planned I might have slept on it and things like that, so the fact it's been thrown on me has helped me to react quickly and do things that come naturally. Luckily I know the club, I know the people and I know the players.\"",
      "For Fletcher, he began his affinity with Manchester United at the age of 11. After having an illustrious career as a player winning multiple Premier League titles, a Champions League and FA Cup, he rejoined the club in 2020 and has had several roles since.",
      "Whether that was as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick's coaching staff, becoming a technical director when Erik ten Hag became manager or now coaching in the youth set-up, Fletcher has truly seen it all in recent years but his aim has always been a clear one.",
      "\"It's never been about me,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"It's always about me giving back, doing the best that I can to help everyone, help the players, club, staff. Help them become better, which ultimately will help Manchester United become better and that's always been my goal and responsibility since being back here.\"",
      "When asked what the mood has been like over the last few days among the first team during training, Fletcher described it as \"mixed\".",
      "It was only Monday morning they saw Amorim leave Carrington before Fletcher took charge. It is also easy to forget with the Amorim sideshow that this is a team who have not played truly well in a long time.",
      "Two wins in their last seven games - with some disappointing performances against the likes of West Ham and Wolves within that - December and January has felt like a tough period for these players with few highs other than a win against Newcastle.",
      "Despite Fletcher knowing many of those in the squad, he has tried his best to speak one-on-one with players he has not come across as much during his return to the club. Two of those included Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens.",
      "However, one player he does know well and was particularly close to Amorim is captain Bruno Fernandes. Fletcher thought it was especially vital to take him aside.",
      "\"I've got a great relationship with Bruno and is somebody who I respect massively. He's been unbelievable player for Manchester United and an amazing leader,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"Like anybody, Bruno was disappointed. He wants to do well for every manager. Bruno has been disappointed when every manager he's worked with left the club and I know him and Ruben had a good relationship.",
      "\"But a bit like me, Bruno knows his responsibility as a captain - to help all the players, to help and do the best for the club. He is a great leader, a great sounding board.\"",
      "Although Fletcher does not know how long he will remain in charge of Manchester United - he admitted those conversations will happen after Wednesday night's game against Burnley.",
      "But regardless, Fletcher aspires to be a head coach one day and he has the opportunity to make a huge impression.",
      "Having sat in many of Amorim's news conferences, it always felt he cared more about the opposition than what his side would do to exploit them.",
      "I asked him after the 1-1 draw with Wolves why he reverted to a back three after a big win against Newcastle just a few days before with a back four, and he told me it was due to wanting to match Wolves with a similar system.",
      "That is not Manchester United.",
      "When it came to playing style, when Fletcher described how he wanted his side to play on Wednesday night, it was refreshing to hear perhaps somewhat cliché but key phrases like \"being positive\" and wanting his side to \"express themselves\".",
      "That is a United side we have not seen in a long time.",
      "Fletcher said: \"Football nowadays, formations are fluid in and out of possession in different phases, that's the way the game is played now. I want to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball. Don't hide.",
      "\"That they play as a team, they play with togetherness, they play with spirit and energy of Manchester United - go express yourself and enjoy yourself and go and try and win the game. These are all the things that I'll be expecting from the players.\"",
      "It has been a chaotic week to say the least for those at Manchester United, but it was impressive to see how Fletcher handled his first news conference as a head coach and how he came across when I sat down with him.",
      "Whether it is just a one-time wonder for now or maybe the start of many, United seem to have a custodian of the club who just simply gets it.",

Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore."

      "By Adam Smith and Nick Wright",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 11:16, UK",
      "Gary Neville has said the next Manchester United manager must suit the DNA of the club, so who fits the bill? As their hierarchy begin talks with prospective candidates, Between the Lines returns with a look at how their options stack up.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been put in caretaker charge as Manchester United search for a replacement for Ruben Amorim and Neville insists it's time to return to the club's traditions following a string of \"experiments\" after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "\"You can't say these managers are not good coaches but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies and none of them really fit the Man Utd way.\"",
      "So, with Oliver Glasner, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Enzo Maresca, Xavi, Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane among the names being linked to replace Amorim, which prospective candidate's playing style fits best with the club's identity?",
      "Neville referenced a video circulating online in which Sir Bobby Charlton describes Manchester United's DNA. \"Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Charlton traces it back to Sir Matt Busby, under whom Manchester United won five domestic titles and a European Cup in the 1950s and 60s with a youthful side playing attacking football.",
      "Ferguson harnessed the same traditions as United emerged as the Premier League's dominant force under his management, using a front-footed approach emphasising wing play and quick attacks.",
      "The club moved away from those principles post Ferguson, typified by the appointment of a manager, in Amorim, whose devotion to an incongruous back three became a bone of contention.",
      "And Neville is adamant about what the next man should bring. \"Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "To create a template for Manchester United's DNA, we used 15 style metrics from Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13, when he secured the last of his 13 Premier League titles as manager.",
      "Manchester United's triumph that season was clinched in characteristically offensive style. Using a 4-2-3-1 formation, they scored 11 goals more than any other side, placing an emphasis on attacking speed, width and crossing.",
      "When comparing prospective candidates and selected managers by their numbers in the same 15 metrics in league games managed, it is former Chelsea and Spurs boss Antonio Conte who ranks as the best statistical fit for United's DNA.",
      "The Napoli boss, who has been previously linked with the Old Trafford job, has a suitability score of 78.89 out of 100, based on his work with Chelsea and Spurs, putting him just ahead of former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who is currently managing the Portuguese national team.",
      "Stuttgart's Sebastian Hoeness is next on the list, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fourth, with a suitability score of 77.74 out of 100. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone completes the top five, just ahead of Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, now in charge of Coventry.",
      "Marcelo Bielsa, Carlo Ancelotti and Michael Carrick also make our top 10.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva is 11th and Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is 12th - just ahead of three other managers who have been linked with the vacancy in former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, Mauricio Pochettino and England's Thomas Tuchel.",
