      "Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) boss Howard Webb has been urged to speak with with referee Andrew Kitchen following Aaron Wan-Bissaka's controversial escape from a red card during Manchester United's draw with West Ham. The ex-United full-back remarkably avoided dismissal for a reckless sliding tackle on Patrick Dorgu despite having already been cautioned mere moments before.",
      "The Hammers drew level between those two Wan-Bissaka incidents when Soungoutou Magassa converted the rebound from Jarrod Bowen's effort that had been hooked off the line. Diogo Dalot had given United the lead earlier in the second period.",
      "United pressed for a decisive goal but couldn't breach Alphonse Areola's defences again, meaning they had to make do with a point. Had Wan-Bissaka been given his marching orders, the outcome could have been vastly different, with former Premier League official Keith Hackett left baffled by the decision.",
      "He has since proposed that Webb should be conducting debriefs with officials to comprehend their thinking. Hackett, speaking to Football Insider on The Final Whistle, said: \"I was just fooled by it.",
      "\"Watching it, I was saying, 'You're off, mate. You're going to have an early Christmas present,' but nothing happened. The second yellow was worse than the first, and the second yellow was more like orange.",
      "\"On its own, I could have had it sit as a red. This was absolute nonsense. When we have situations like this, it's important for Howard Webb to talk to the referees.\"",
      "\"He should say, 'Talk me through this situation.' Why didn't you issue a yellow card? What have you seen that negates a yellow card?\". Before that moment, Kitchen had delivered a strong performance in the middle, with Hackett eager to praise the 29-year-old before subsequently offering a damning assessment in the immediate wake of the incident.",
      "He said: \"Whilst I think that Andrew Kitchen had a very good game, I would like him to review the two Wan-Bissaka challenges, particularly the last one. On a yellow card, you put in a reckless challenge, he should have had a second yellow followed by the red.",
      "\"He's a lucky guy. Andrew, you've got to keep focused up until the final whistle.\"",
      "After his fairly prominent mistake, Kitchen wasn't chosen to take charge of a Premier League fixture in game-week 15, nor did he oversee any Championship matches.",
      "United are in action again on Monday night as they take on winless Wolves and Ruben Amorim has insisted his side must remain concentrated for the challenge ahead. He remarked: \"Everything can happen, and that will change.",
      "\"There is no team in the Premier League history that didn't win one game. So, it can be any game. So, we need to try to improve, to rest the players, work really well, and prepare a tough match because, with us, it's always a tough match.\"",
      "United welcome Bournemouth the following week before travelling to Aston Villa ahead of Christmas. Before 2026 begins, United host Newcastle United and Wolves at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United could potentially snap up Brighton and Hove Albion's midfielder Carlos Baleba for less than £75million in 2026, just six months after they were deterred by the Cameroon international's hefty price tag. The Red Devils have been eyeing the 21-year-old for a while and had approached the Seagulls via intermediaries about a possible summer transfer.",
      "Brighton's firm stance and a whopping £105m asking price led United to back off, opting instead to spend £18.2m on goalkeeper Senne Lammens as a replacement for Andre Onana. United's manager Ruben Amorim is keen to bring in a new midfielder when the January transfer window opens.",
      "Alongside Baleba, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is also high on their wishlist following his standout performances this season. On Sunday, Baleba was taken off during Brighton's Premier League draw against West Ham, marking the 12th time in 13 starts that manager Fabian Hurzeler has chosen to substitute the midfielder.",
      "Hurzeler has publicly questioned Baleba's performance levels, pointing to United's interest in the player over the summer. Now, recent reports suggest that Brighton's position on Baleba's potential departure has softened since the summer.",
      "However, Tavolieri has suggested that some figures within Bayern are hesitant to meet such a steep asking price for the player. This leaves the door ajar for United to maintain their position as favourites to secure the midfielder's signature, although whether they'll be willing to stump up that sum remains uncertain.",
      "Back in September, Hurzeler acknowledged his worries that Baleba's difficulties might have been triggered by United's summer pursuit. \"For sure, when a young boy reads there is interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep, deep down,\" he remarked.",
      "\"That's also part of the development to understand that when you play well, there comes a big offer, there comes a big club who wants to have him.",
      "\"But then to keep pushing, to be humble, stay here in Brighton, and try to make the next step with the team and that's something we have to keep on working with him. I can't give you a clear answer if it's really affected him or not.",
      "\"But for sure, he's a young boy and we need to understand he's not a machine that if you click on then he always runs and off then he stops. We need to understand his feelings, his emotions, where he comes from, and that's our responsibility.\"",

      "Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has acknowledged the club are bracing themselves for the potential departure of key players this summer amid Manchester United's interest in Adam Wharton. Wharton is among the top targets at Old Trafford as Ruben Amorim looks to bolster his midfield options.",
      "United tried to secure Carlos Baleba from Brighton and Hove Albion in August but chose to allocate the rest of their transfer funds toward a new goalkeeper. Bringing in a new midfielder is United's main priority heading into the January transfer window, with both Baleba and Wharton featuring prominently on their shortlist.",
      "The Red Devils have recently turned their attention towards Premier League-proven talent, having splashed out over £120 million on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo last summer. Wharton has three-and-a-half years remaining on his contract at Palace following his switch to Selhurst Park from Blackburn Rovers at the beginning of 2024.",
      "The England international is among several Palace assets who have been linked with lucrative moves away from south London. Marc Guehi came close to joining Liverpool toward the end of the summer window, while Jean-Philippe Mateta was reportedly attracting interest from United.",
      "\"We're not going to throw it all on red and have a massive problem. Unless you want to be in a situation where you're constantly putting in money every year, there's a cash limit to what you can spend.",
      "\"You can't spend money you don't have. You have to have some guardrails as a club, or you'll build up big problems down the track. Everyone saw where prices went in the summer; it's a difficult landscape.",
      "\"There wasn't the right thing available at the right time when the finances were in place. There's no point in doing something for the sake of it. How are you going to get someone to come and tell them they are No 1 in Ebs [Eze] position if you still have him? The one where we didn't, with Marc [Gueh], we kept him.",
      "\"You can't always make happen what you want to. We are where we are in the pecking order; you could ask why other clubs make bids for our players two weeks before the end of the window. I don't know why they did that.\"",
      "Parish's remarks follow revelations from Wharton's agent, James Featherstone, who disclosed that the midfielder harbours aspirations of reaching the very top. \"When he was at Blackburn we sat down and spoke about shooting for the stars and playing for England,\" he told talkSPORT.",
      "\"So how do you get there? Personally I think to play for England you have to play Champions League, to play in the Champions League you have got to play for one of the top teams in one of the top leagues.",
      "\"That jump to a Champions League team, I think you can get lost. The plan below that was to play for a Premier League team. We have got a plan. He is 21. I have to check myself to remember that every now and then. It doesn't have to be achieved yesterday, today or this moment.",
      "\"He has got his in-game, in-season targets and goals. He has got to do his bit and the rest will look after itself in a very structured, calm way to ultimately add value and maximise his ability.\"",

      "Manchester United's Rasmus Hojlund broke his eight-match goalless streak by netting twice for Napoli in their 2-1 victory over Juventus on Sunday evening. The 22-year-old joined Napoli on loan with an obligation to buy in the summer and is set to seal a permanent £38million move to Antonio Conte's side in 2026, provided the Italian side secure a Champions League place.",
      "Despite making a promising start in Naples, Hojlund's form seemed to have taken a significant dip. The United forward had only found the back of the net four times in 13 appearances prior to Sunday night's clash.",
      "However, his luck changed when Napoli faced Juve. After impressing in Serie A against Atalanta and Roma - bagging an assist in each match - he scored a double as Napoli leapfrogged Inter to top the table.",
      "Hojlund's first goal came in the seventh minute, when David Neres delivered a tempting cross into the box and Hojlund slipped past his marker to steer the ball into the net. After Kenan Yildiz levelled for Juventus, Hojlund restored Napoli's lead in the 78th minute, heading the ball home from close range after Weston McKennie set it up for him.",
      "The former Atalanta player now boasts ten goals and three assists in all competitions this season.",
      "Hojlund's brace arrived shortly after he emphasised that a collective triumph with Napoli takes precedence over individual accolades. \"Obviously, I'd like to score a lot of goals again and start doing so soon, but it's important to always contribute to the team, and I'm happy to help,\" he said, following Napoli's victory over Roma last Sunday.",
      "\"I try my best to be useful. I consider myself a - myself a team player: winning is more important than scoring goals.\"",
      "The striker's next outing will see Napoli make the journey to Benfica for their Champions League fixture on Wednesday. Following that, they'll head to Udinese on Sunday, 14 December, before squaring off against AC Milan in the Supercoppa Italiana.",
      "Reflecting on his side's triumph against Juventus, Conte heaped praise upon his squad. \"The players deserve all the compliments, we can only thank them as in a moment of extreme difficulty and with so few available, we are doing incredible things,\" the former Tottenham and Chelsea boss told DAZN.",
      "\"Everyone who plays steps up with great character and sense of responsibility.",
      "\"These lads have improved so much in that sense, and it fills me with pride, because they felt what we are doing, understood the difficulty of the moment, and gave remarkable responses.\"",
      "Napoli currently lead Serie A by a single point over Inter, having earned 31 points from 14 fixtures. AC Milan trail by three points in third place, whilst Roma occupy fourth spot, four points adrift of top position.",

      "I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! champion Angry Ginge received some handy tips from last year's runner-up Coleen Rooney before venturing into the Australian jungle. The Manchester-born content creator was crowned King of the Jungle on Sunday night.",
      "Ginge, whose real name is Morgan Burtwistle, launched his Twitch channel at 19, initially streaming FIFA gameplay. His online stardom has exploded since 2020, with the devoted Manchester United supporter regularly teaming up with other prominent content creators and sporting personalities.",
      "Before flying out to Australia, where he won over viewers and triumphed over E4 Celebs Go Dating receptionist Tom Read Wilson and EastEnders star Shona McGarty for the crown, it's emerged that Ginge was given some precious guidance from another well-known personality.",
      "During an appearance on Good Morning Britain, United and England icon Wayne Rooney, married to the 2024 I'm A Celebrity runner-up, disclosed that pals Ginge and fellow campmate Aitch were offered some pointers from his wife ahead of their jungle stint.",
      "\"She [Coleen] gave them a few tips. It was little things like, when you go to the toilet empty your water bottle out so they give you fresh water,\" Rooney explained.",
      "\"Speaking to Coleen, it is tough and it is real out there,\" he continued. \"She really enjoyed it. She loved her time in there. It gave her really great memories.\"",
      "Rooney's other half was a crowd-pleaser during her stint on the popular ITV programme but missed out on the top prize 12 months back to McFly frontman Danny Jones.",
      "However, Ginge wasn't the footballer's pick for this year's champion as he confessed ahead of the finale: \"I want to come on and give Aitch my support. He's been outstanding.",
      "\"He's been himself and you've seen at times him get a little bit emotional,\" Rooney continued about the rapper. \"It's good to see, because it's showing he's vulnerable as well at times. He's missing his family at home.\"",
      "Yet it was Ginge who snatched victory on Saturday, with the 24-year-old breaking down in floods of tears when Ant and Dec announced his triumph.",
      "Before revealing who the public had voted as their winner, the presenting duo disclosed they'd clocked up their biggest audience response in a decade.",
      "\"I don't think I can swear, but I feel amazing,\" declared Ginge. \"Honestly, a dream come true. I didn't think I could go all this way never mind win. Thank you to everyone who voted.\"",
      "Speaking about his jungle ordeal, he reflected: \"It was a lot harder than I thought it'd be. I'd reached out to people before I went in to get some advice, but nobody warned me about what I was about to go through.",
      "\"No one said it was going to be that hard. That was the hardest thing I've ever done and was a real mental test. There were so many times I wanted to throw the towel in.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has all but confirmed there is no way back for him at Manchester United after referencing his future plans in Italy. The Danish striker left Old Trafford in the summer as he joined Serie A side Napoli on a season-long loan.",
      "The reigning Italian champions paid a €6m (£5.2m) loan fee, while there is an option to sign Hojlund permanently for €44m (£38.4m). That clause will become an obligation should Antonio Conte’s side seal a spot in the Champions League. And it appears that Hojlund is already taking the stance that he is a permanent Napoli player.",
      "Speaking to DAZN after scoring twice in a 2-1 win against Juventus at the weekend, the striker promised: “Next season, I’ll give my interviews in Italian.”",
      "Hojlund, 22, joined Man United from Serie A side Atalanta in 2023 for £64million. He netted 16 goals in his debut campaign but scored only ten goals in the following season before being allowed to join Napoli.",
      "And he is already some way to surpassing that, having netted six times for Napoli this season in all competitions. Speaking about his recent form, Hojlund added: “Sometimes as a striker you don’t score and I try to help the team in different sorts of ways.",
      "“I know how important it is for the manager to hold up the ball, to put the game a little bit higher, also work hard on the pressing and keep the team compact. I scored two goals tonight, but it’s all down to my teammates, the manager and his staff.”",
      "After scoring, Hojlund celebrated with members of Conte’s coaching staff and claimed that their instructions on the training ground had led to his two-goal haul.",
      "He added: “Gianluca and the staff talked a lot about my movement in the box. I’ve been going a lot to the back post, but they said there’s space in the front. I attacked the front more and it worked, so I’m happy.”",
      "Meanwhile, Napoli captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo was full of praise for Hojlund as he continues to impress in Italy. He said: “It is certainly pleasing, we had another really good intense performance tonight with a high tempo, playing open football.",
      "“These are our characteristics, we’re happy, and I am pleased for Rasmus. He scored twice today, but he always helps us out every game. In difficult moments, we gave a strong response, that’s the sign of a great team spirit.”",
      "Hojlund will be aiming to extend his positive form this weekend as Napoli travel to Benfica in the Champions League ahead of a clash with Udinese on Sunday afternoon.",

      "Manchester have learned what the club needs to achieve to match Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton’s ambitions. The Red Devils were consistently linked with the 21-year-old in the summer as United looked to improve their midfield.",
      "Wharton has three-and-a-half years remaining on his Palace deal, making a January move unlikely. However, the player’s representative has shared a plan for his client’s career, which includes joining a Champions League club to become an England regular, with Wharton having earned three caps to date.",
      "“Personally I think to play for England you have to play Champions League, to play in the Champions League you have got to play for one of the top teams in one of the top leagues,” Wharton’s representative James Featherstone told talkSPORT. “That jump to a Champions League team, I think you can get lost. The plan below that was to play for a Premier League team. We have got a plan.",

      "Manchester United reportedly passed up the chance to add another young talent to their squad, with midfielder Mouhamed Dabo not being offered a contract after a recent trial at Old Trafford. The 17-year-old spent some time training with United earlier this season after being spotted by club scouts.",
      "Despite making a good impression, Dabo was not offered a deal and has since signed a pre-contract with Croatian second division side NK Kustošija. The youngster recently represented Senegal in the Under-17 World Cup, reaching the Round of 32 before being knocked out by Uganda.",
      "Even if United had decided to offer him a deal, Dabo would have had to wait until next summer, when he turns 18, to sign a pre-contract agreement in England. Scouting the international market and exploring untapped markets is something the recruitment team at United have done in recent years.",
      "Colombian teenager Cristian Orozco is the latest promising youngster to agree a move to Old Trafford. The midfielder, who is the same age as Dabo, will cost an initial $1million (£750,000) and will officially move to Manchester when he turns 18 in the summer.",
      "It's thought that Orozco's impending arrival may have influenced the decision not to offer Dabo a contract, as they would be competing for the same position. Diego Leon and Sekou Kone are two other international young talents signed by United.",
      "Amidst ongoing speculation that United will delve into the transfer market for a new midfielder in January, Ruben Amorim is reportedly eager to bolster his squad following an unsuccessful bid to sign Carlos Baleba last summer. Brighton's hefty asking price of over £100million deterred United, and Baleba's performances in the first half of the season have cast doubt on whether the Reds will make another approach.",
      "Other potential targets such as Adam Wharton, João Gomes, and Morten Hjulmand continue to be linked with the club. United's pursuit of a new midfielder has further clouded Kobbie Mainoo's future at the club.",
      "The England international has only started once for Amorim this season, in the Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby Town in August, and has clocked up just 171 minutes in the Premier League. His chances of securing a spot in the England World Cup squad hinge on whether he'll be permitted to go out on loan in January.",
      "It's reported that United turned down his request for a loan move in the summer. Napoli are still interested in Mainoo, with reports suggesting that several clubs across Europe are keen on signing him on loan until the end of the season.",
      "Despite the constant calls for Mainoo to come into the United squad, Amorim has defended his decision to use other options. \"I just want to win,\" he said. \"I don't look [at] who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"I understand, and my job is to answer. But you always ask me the same thing. I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in]. It's my decision.\"",

      "Former Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Gabriel Jesus helped the Gunners Under-21s secure a 3-0 victory over Manchester United in a behind-closed-doors friendly. The 32-year-old became available in the summer following the conclusion of his spell at Besiktas",
      "According to journalist Nathan Salt, the north Londoners triumphed on Saturday against a United side reduced to 10-men following James Overy's dismissal. Oxlade-Chamberlain, who recently re-joined the club to work on his fitness, has been training with the youth setup.",
      "Prior to Arsenal's Champions League clash with Slavia Praha, Oxlade-Chamberlain was spotted participating in youth team training during the first team's media open session. \"If we can help him and give him the space for him to get up to speed and have the capacity to find a club,\" Mikel Arteta said.",
      "\"It's a joy, the boys will learn from it. I had the privilege to play with him and if he is around he will be a really good role model to have around the team.\"",
      "Striker Gabriel Jesus also featured after making his return to the matchday squad. The Brazilian was included amongst the substitutes against Chelsea last weekend and Brentford in midweek, though he was omitted from the squad for the Aston Villa defeat.",
      "Jesus has been sidelined since rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, requiring surgery, and has only recently resumed full training. \"So we took that opportunity for the players that needed a bit of exposure and competition to provide that to them,\" said Arteta.",
      "\"It was very positive. Obviously, he has been out 11 months and you need that progression. You need to see how his body, that knee reacts and what else does he need.",
      "\"The players that we have available as well, it has to make sense to have the right balance in the squad. The good thing is that it is very, very close at the moment.\"",
      "Highly-rated academy prospect Max Dowman was also involved. Like Jesus, the youngster missed out on the Villa Park squad to take part in the behind-closed-doors match. Arteta and Arsenal will view the friendly as a success. With a comfortable 3-0 victory and game time for Jesus, Dowman continued his impressive form by finding the net.",
      "Charles Sagoe Jr, who featured in the squad against Slavia Praha back in November, was also amongst the goalscorers. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's appearance for the club marked his first since departing in 2017 for £35million to Liverpool. His contribution in the triumph over United was his first outing for the Gunners since the 4-0 thrashing at Anfield in 2017.",

      "Adam Wharton has a plan to play in the Champions League as Manchester United plot a big-money swoop for the midfielder. The Crystal Palace and England star is right at the top of the Red Devils’ short-list ahead of an overhaul of the United squad.",
      "Any deal does not look like it will be cheap, however. Wharton, 21, is anticipated to cost around £70m should he leave Crystal Palace in the near future.",
      "Speaking about the midfielder’s future, his agent James Featherstone has confirmed that Wharton has ambitions of playing at the highest level and there is already a plan in place to get him there.",
      "Speaking to talkSPORT, he said: “When he was at Blackburn we sat down and spoke about shooting for the stars and playing for England.",
      "“So how do you get there? Personally I think to play for England you have to play Champions League, to play in the Champions League you have got to play for one of the top teams in one of the top leagues.",
      "“That jump to a Champions League team, I think you can get lost. The plan below that was to play for a Premier League team",
      "“We have got a plan. He is 21. I have to check myself to remember that every now and then. It doesn’t have to be achieved yesterday, today or this moment.",
      "“He has got his in-game, in-season targets and goals. He has got to do his bit and the rest will look after itself in a very structured, calm way to ultimately add value and maximise his ability.”",
      "Wharton has shone for Palace since his arrival from Blackburn Rovers last year. He has since made 62 appearances in all competitions for the Eagles, helping the side win the FA Cup and to a place in Europe.",
      "Wharton has also earned international recognition, having compiled three caps for the Three Lions under Thomas Tuchel. The midfielder still has three-and-a-half years to run left on his contract at Selhurst Park.",
      "He is not the only midfielder that United have identified as a potential signing. Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, as well Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher are also options for the Red Devils.",
      "Should any of the trio arrive at Old Trafford in the near future, that could potentially open the door to Kobbie Mainoo departing. The academy graduate is reportedly eyeing a January exit after falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim.",

      "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot has called on his teammates to channel their \"anger and drive\" to fuel their performances.",
      "Following a disappointing draw against West Ham, Dalot expressed his frustration and urged his fellow players to become \"more obsessed\" with winning.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the mixed zone, Dalot didn't hide his disappointment. \"We are very disappointed. We cannot concede a goal, we have to control more the game. We should have done the same as we did for 60 minutes, and try to score the second. We had the game there,\" he said.",
      "\"And when we lose the ball, be in a good position so we don't suffer counter-attacks. Because we knew that today was going to be, for West Ham, the only way of creating danger was going to be second balls, transitions or set plays.\"",
      "Dalot was asked about the inconsistency and responded: \"First of all, I don't think they [West Ham] are at that [poor] level. Obviously, they have a lower block and you saw how hard it is to get in during 60 minutes.",
      "\"But as soon as we found a way to score a goal, we need to keep doing the same things because that's what put us in the position to control the game. I think we are dominant even though we conceded one or two transitions that we could have avoided.",
      "\"But in the end, they score a goal, it's not so hard to create chances and put the ball in the net. But then, with 30 minutes to go, we need to fight for the result.\"",
      "Dalot continued: \"It's always like this [needing to put together a run of decent results]. Even after winning three or four games in a row, people will expect you to win five or six or seven.",
      "\"So, we just have to focus on one game, one win at the time. Today, we had a good chance to get closer to the top positions and I think that's what hurts even more.\"",
      "Reflecting on the squandered opportunity to climb to fifth, Dalot continued: \"That's something that has to call us and has to be something that we need to look at. Because, in these moments, if we deliver, we'll probably be in another position and we'll be talking about other things.",
      "\"But that's part of the game also. But, at the same time, we have opportunities to improve. And, like I said, it's just a disappointing feeling because we had a game there.\"",
      "Dalot seemed to question his teammates when he hinted that subpar performances were down to \"sometimes not football qualities\", saying: \"I think we've shown this season that we can be a very good team and we can beat anybody. Then, it's something that we need to get into ourselves.",
      "\"Sometimes, it's not football qualities. It has to be from inside. It has to be from the anger and the drive that you have every day to win football games and to live your life like that.",
      "\"I think we need to become a bit more obsessed about playing for this club, winning games and winning trophies for this club. But it's a process. I'm not going to get into the 'we need time' thing.",
      "\"I think we have to win straight away because that's what the club demands. That's why it hurts sometimes even more when we have opportunities like this and we don't win.\"",
      "Dalot was dropped from the starting XI in favour of Patrick Dorgu ahead of the November international break, and found himself on the substitute bench when Everton visited Old Trafford. When Amorim was questioned about his left wing-back choices, he implied that neither player was replicating their training ground form on match days.",
      "Nevertheless, Dalot made his mark upon returning to the side against Crystal Palace, earning the set-piece that resulted in Mason Mount's decisive strike, before following that up with a goal of his own against West Ham. When quizzed about Amorim's remarks, Dalot responded: \"I think it's something in general. He could be talking about me, but I think he could be talking about everyone at the club. We always have to find ways to improve ourselves, be more consistent. We are in a team where you're as good as your last game.",
      "\"So, you just have to know that this is a type of pressure for a big club like Man United. Fortunately, I'm here long enough to understand how it works and find a way to help the team. I think that's the aim for everybody.\"",

He also received his first-ever Ballon d'Or nomination, marking a dramatic turnaround since leaving his childhood club.",

      "He said: \"It's sensational, it's incredible to be here and win this award. Thank you to everyone, the team, the staff, and my teammates. My bond with Napoli is special, there are so many special places here. Coming to Napoli was an easy choice, I came to the right place.\"",

Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba remain as options, albeit much could depend on the future of Kobbie Mainoo. Their coffers could also be boosted by the departure of Rasmus Hojlund, who looks set to complete a permanent move to Napoli.",

Unless you want to be in a situation where you're constantly putting in money every year, there's a cash limit to what you can spend. You can't spend money you don't have. You have to have some guardrails as a club, or you'll build up big problems down the track. Everyone saw where prices went in the summer; it's a difficult landscape.",

How are you going to get someone to come and tell them they are No 1 in Ebs [Eze] position if you still have him? The one where we didn't, with Marc [Guehi], we kept him. You can’t always make happen what you want to. We are where we are in the pecking order; you could ask why other clubs make bids for our players two weeks before the end of the window.

Perhaps no young Hungarian player playing in Hungary has ever been talked about as much as he is now.",

      "“We’re not giving away anything if we say that this will happen in the summer at the latest. I can make that statement, because there is an interest in him that I don’t think has been seen in the last 10 years around a young Hungarian player playing in Hungary. This transfer - which could take place in the summer at the latest - will fundamentally change the perception of Hungarian football on the international market.”",

      "Manchester United are looking to bounce back from their disappointing draw with West Ham when they face Wolves tonight.",
      "United seemed set to make it back-to-back Premier League wins last time out but they fluffed their lines again as Soungoutou Magassa scored late on to secure a point for his side.",
      "Pressure is beginning to mount on Ruben Amorim and failure to beat a side that have picked up just two Premier League points all season will see the United boss' future questioned further.",
      "In terms of the team news, United will hope to have Matthijs de Ligt available again after he missed the draw with the Hammers. Harry Maguire and Benjamin Sesko also missed Thursday's draw and aren't expected to feature tonight.",
      "Kick off is at 8pm and we'll have all the build-up, updates and reaction from Molineux so stick with us.",
      "There’s been a lot of talk about Mainoo this season. Amorim was spiky during his post-West Ham press conference and the optics of him laughing in response to a question about Mainoo weren’t good.",
      "Amorim laughed because he is regularly asked about Mainoo, but it looked disrespectful. Amorim should give Mainoo his first start of the Premier League season against Wolves.",
      "Then, if Mainoo underperforms, the United boss can at least point to the performance as evidence for why he doesn't play. And if Mainoo performs, then United will have a better chance of winning the game.",
      "Casemiro and Mainoo would be the logical partnership, which would mean playing Fernandes in the false nine role.",
      "There are question marks around the fitness of De Ligt after his absence against West Ham.",
      "The Dutchman had been the only United player to have played every minute in the league until missing out against the Irons. Mazraoui started in the back-three and Heaven came into the side for Yoro.",
      "De Ligt should be recalled if he’s fit enough to be involved, while Yoro should also start. De Ligt has enjoyed a great season so far and it would be a big boost if he is spotted getting off the team bus.",
      "United are heavy favourites to win tonight.",
      "Wolves v United odds",
      "Odds via Betfair.",
      "United are once again looking to bounce back when they travel to Wolves tonight.",
      "Diogo Dalot opened the scoring against West Ham on Thursday night but a Soungoutou Magassa equaliser led to a tricky post-match press conference for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim was questioned on Kobbie Mainoo's lack of involvement again and he admitted he could make no promises that the England international would be handed a chance when players depart for AFCON this month. United really need to pick up a win tonight against bottom of the table Wolves.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt will hope to be fit for the fixture after missing the West Ham game with a minor issue. Harry Maguire and Benjamin Sesko are both expected to miss out through injury.",
      "Here's a look at how our writers think United should line up at Molineux",
      "United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo made all the headlines despite not kicking a ball on Thursday night in the 1-1 draw with West Ham. The Reds' academy graduate looked set to be the present and future of the United midfield but he's found himself on the fringes under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim has restricted Mainoo's opportunities this season and the United boss was clearly unhappy when he was asked about the midfielder after the draw with West Ham. With Mainoo weighing up his options ahead of the January transfer window, there will be pressure on the Portuguese head coach to select him.",
      "Here's our predicted United XI.",
      "United have confirmed Jonny Evans has stepped down from his role as head of loans and pathways.",
      "Evans took up the position in June following his retirement as a player, but he has left after six months. He was responsible for arranging loans for youngsters and worked closely with Jason Wilcox to 'enhance processes which maximise individual player development and prepare young talent to perform in the first-team'.",
      "When Evans was appointed, he said in a statement: “I am looking forward to working with the next generation of talented players to support them to reach their potential.\"",
      "However, the 37-year-old has decided to leave to spend more time with his family, and it's understood he will now take time away from the game before deciding what to do next.",
      "United sources have said the departure is amicable and Evans leaves with the best wishes of everyone at the club.",
      "Read more here",
      "I made my first trip to Molineux on Boxing Day last year when Wolves won 2-0 against United.",
      "Cunha was outstanding in that game, opening the scoring in the second half, and evoked gasps when he brought the ball down with a Cruyff turn.",
      "Cunha has scored just once since arriving at Old Trafford. His overall performances have been strong, but he needs to chip in with more goals and assists in the final third.",
      "Cunha left Wolves on good terms and should receive a warm reception upon his return tonight. He’ll fancy a goal at a venue where he has already scored plenty.",
      "Could this game be the equivalent of Solskjaer’s Watford for Amorim?",
      "The Norwegian was put out of his misery after a shocking defeat at Vicarage Road in 2021, and some fans have suggested tonight’s game against Wolves has a similar feel ahead of kick-off.",
      "United are the overwhelming favourites with the bookmakers, but you cannot trust this side.",
      "However, Wolves are on course to be the worst team in Premier League history. They have amassed two points from 14 games and could beat Derby County's record of just 11 points in 2007/08. United must win.",
      "United have another chance to send a statement tonight and haul themselves up the table and into the European places.",
      "The Reds blew that chance a fortnight ago when they lost 1-0 at home to 10-man Everton and again last time out when they conceded a late equaliser to draw 1-1 with West Ham.",
      "Dropping points tonight would be a huge negative given the lack of quality Wolves have shown all season and United and Amorim cannot afford to continue to miss chances to climb the table.",
      "It's another Monday night matchup for Manchester United as Ruben Amorim's side head to Molineux to take on rock-bottom Wolves.",
      "The Reds begin the night in 12th but such is the congested nature of the table, they could end the evening in the top six with a win.",
      "That has to be the aim against a Wolves side who haven't tasted victory all season in the league and have mustered just two points.",
      "We'll have the build-up, action, reaction and analysis right here so stay with us."

      "Manchester United have rich history in the FA Youth Cup, the most prestigious competition in academy football. United have won the Youth Cup more than any other club and could extend that record this season.",
      "Darren Fletcher, manager of the Under-18s, has the talent at his disposal to lift the trophy, with the likes of JJ Gabriel, Kai Rooney, Louie Bradbury and Yuel Helafu all ready to contribute.",
      "And the competition rules state Fletcher will be able to call upon academy players who were under the age of 18 at midnight before the end of August, which gives United added strength.",
      "Bendito Mantato, Godwill Kukonki, Dan Armer, Amir Ibragimov and Jim Thwaites are just some of the players who represent the Under-21s but who are eligible to play in the Youth Cup.",
      "That's without mentioning Chido Obi, who could play in the competition again. Obi is currently recovering from a small injury, but he could feature in the Youth Cup for United for a second season in a row.",
      "Obi's goals fired the U18s to the semi-finals of the Youth Cup last season, in which they lost on penalties against eventual winners Aston Villa. Fletcher will be hoping his side can go two steps further this season.",
      "The U18s will begin their Youth Cup campaign against Peterborough at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. There should be a reasonable crowd, but it's a shame to see tickets priced at £10 for adults and £5 for children.",
      "Some may argue that Gabriel is worth paying the turnstile fee for. The 15-year-old is regarded as one of the most exciting talents to have ever come through the academy, and United did all they could to keep him in the summer, with Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada involved in a meeting at Carrington.",
      "The 15-year-old has trained with the first team already. It's unusual for a player so young to be given that opportunity, but United believe he could eventually become the face of the club.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Ruben Amorim at Carrington.",
      "During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Kai Rooney has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right [wing]. Left-footed, coming in off the right.\"",
      "Michael Carrick's son, Jacey Carrick, also plays in United's academy, and he was handed his debut for the U18s last weekend, coming on from the bench with 20 minutes remaining against Newcastle. He is a left-footed midfielder and has been involved with England's Under-15s.",
      "There are story lines galore with the U18s this season and they are playing entertaining football, impressively beating Liverpool 7-0 at the end of November (Gabriel scored a hat-trick).",
      "Ticket prices should be lower for Tuesday's Youth Cup game, but the youngsters deserve support.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Tyler Blackett has admitted he rejected joining Baller League over fears about how it would impact his credibility as a professional footballer. Baller League launched in the UK in 2024 and entered its second season at the end of October.",
      "The concept sees football blended with futsal and celebrities to attract younger audiences to the game. Teams compete in six-a-side matches in two 15-minute halves however the final three minutes of each half sees the rules change in what is known as the 'gamechanger'. This could result in offsides being eliminated, all fouls being awarded red cards or one-v-one being introduced.",
      "Celebrities, influencers and former players such as Maya Jama, Angry Ginge and Alan Shearer have all managed teams in the format. The clubs' squad lists include a mix of futsal, current and former professional footballers. Ex-United players Cameron Borthwick-Jackson and Josh Harrop have played in the league.",
      "Speaking to MEN Sport, Blackett, who is currently a free agent having left Rotherham in 2024, has insisted he has left the door open to joining Baller League but was fearful about how it would reflect on his chances of getting a professional deal. He explained: \"They asked me [to join] last season when they started it.",
      "\"The owner got in touch with me through Instagram and we had a phone call and spoke about it and I didn’t know that it was going to takeover as it did but in my eyes, if I was going to go over and play in Baller League, is it going to look like I don’t want to play professionally anymore. I was just like, maybe in the future I will play but right now? No.",
      "\"I just want to stay fit and wait for something professionally and see how that goes. But I have watched it and it is obviously entertaining and there is more attention and eyes going onto it and it is a good thing for football in general I guess.\"",
      "\"That is what you lose as a free agent. You lose a bit of yourself when you're not playing football.",
      "\"I've played football since I was six years old and for seven months I've not been able to so having the opportunity to go and play wherever that might be, like Baller League, it gives me that purpose back in life. It gives me something to wake up for, train for and turn up on a Monday night [for].\"",

      "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo made all the headlines despite not kicking a ball on Thursday night in the 1-1 draw with West Ham. The Reds' academy graduate looked set to be the present and future of the United midfield but he's found himself on the fringes under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim has restricted Mainoo's opportunities this season and the United boss was clearly unhappy when he was asked about the midfielder after the draw with West Ham. With Mainoo weighing up his options ahead of the January transfer window, there will be pressure on the Portuguese head coach to select him.",
      "However, as we have seen throughout his tenure, Amorim is not one to change due to outside pressures. If he was, the Reds would have abandoned the 3-4-2-1 formation many months ago.",
      "Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes is his preferred midfield partnership and with the weight of expectation to get a result at lowly Wolves, it seems likely he will stick with that pairing. Elsewhere, Matthijs de Ligt's injury concern is only thought to be minor and if he has recovered in time for today's game he should start.",
      "As should Leny Yoro. It's been a difficult period for the Frenchman but today could be a chance for him to get back on track. How the attack will look will also be interesting at Molineux.",
      "With Benjamin Sesko still out with a knee injury, Joshua Zirkzee could keep his place in the forward line. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, returning to his former club, will likely start behind Zirkzee.",
      "United predicted XI vs Wolves: Lammens; Yoro, De Ligt, Shaw; Amad, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dalot; Mbeumo, Cunha; Zirkzee",

      "Since Manchester United's draw at home to West Ham, the biggest talking point from the game has not been surrounding anyone who kicked a ball at Old Trafford but rather a player who was overlooked yet again. Kobbie Mainoo was once more an unused substitute on Thursday night and his exclusion led to ferocious questioning of Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"I just want to win,\" Amorim told reporters post-game. \"I don't look (at) who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch. You always ask me the same thing. I understand what you are saying.",
      "\"You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in]. It's my decision.\" But it is not just those who attend Amorim's press conferences who are fans of the 20-year-old.",
      "Mainoo was given a hero's reception when he came on against Everton in the previous United home match. A lot of that response was shaped by the performances the midfielder made prior to Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford - before the Reds' head coach boxed him in as a back-up to Bruno Fernandes.",
      "While his goal against Lyon in that thrilling comeback is remembered fondly, arguably his finest moment came at tonight's opponents Wolves in February 2024. After relinquishing a 2-0 and 3-1 lead in the 95th minute, Molineux held its collective breaths as Mainoo picked up the ball midway through the opposition half.",
      "He weaved his way past three defenders before placing an effort into the bottom corner to spark wild scenes in the away end. From that moment, Mainoo had cemented himself as a fan favourite and the sky appeared to be the limit for him.",
      "Erik ten Hag admitted as much post-match as he reflected on the moment he thought it was time to promote Mainoo into the first-team plans. He said: \"I think very quickly I saw him. I think last autumn I saw him for the first time and at that moment I thought he was playing a little bit too comfortable.",
      "\"I saw him playing in the U21s, he should be much more dominant. We pushed him a lot on that side, by pushing him in the training and you see he makes such good progress and he is almost progressing from game to game.",
      "\"And of course, it's wonderful to see and I hope he stays calm like he is, as he did with his goal as well. He is determined, he is a good character and I hope he keeps going with this progress.\"",
      "Ten Hag's tenure will not be looked back on fondly but few can argue with his hopes for Mainoo. Fast forward just under two years and the progress for Mainoo has stalled through perhaps no fault of his own.",
      "As mentioned, the United academy graduate has been relegated to a back-up role at Old Trafford. Following the arrivals of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, the decision was made to keep Fernandes in the line-up, as captain, and push Mainoo back as cover.",
      "If United were in the Champions League this season or had beaten Grimsby Town, which Mainoo is partly responsible for, these issues we are seeing today would not be a thing. Instead, the Reds find themselves in a situation whereby the youngster is frozen out of the starting XI plans.",
      "Even with Benjamin Sesko injured and question marks surrounding Joshua Zirkzee, Amorim still hasn't pulled the trigger on moving Fernandes into the No.10 role, Cunha to false nine and Mainoo back into central midfield. Instead, he persists with the captain in a deeper position and it is no wonder Mainoo now sees his future elsewhere.",
      "Amorim will be keen to keep hold of Mainoo, at 20 his potential is obvious, even to the United manager. But there comes a time when the head coach has to make a decision and it is starting to feel like too much water has gone under the bridge.",
      "Unlike many of the previous managers before Amorim, Mainoo cannot simply wait for the boardroom to become bored of the inconsistency the club are showing. Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made it clear he wants to give the manager time to get things right and that is noble.",
      "But if this is the case, Mainoo will have to ply his trade away from Old Trafford. It is not simply about the World Cup at the end of the season, the 20-year-old needs to go to a club where he is going to play before the progress Ten Hag raved about, stalls entirely.",

      "Manchester United could land Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba for less than £75million in 2026, six months after being priced out of a move for the Cameroon international.",
      "United have held an interest in the 21-year-old for some time and made contact with the Seagulls, via intermediaries, over a possible summer switch. Brighton's rigid stance and £105m price tag forced United to step away; instead, they spent £18.2m on goalkeeper Senne Lammens to replace Andre Onana.",
      "Ruben Amorim is eager to sign a new midfielder when the January transfer window opens. Alongside Baleba, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is also at the top of their list after his impressive performances this season.",
      "On Sunday, Baleba was substituted off in Brighton's Premier League draw against West Ham, the 12th time in 13 starts that Fabian Hurzeler has opted to take the midfielder off. The German has publicly questioned Baleba's performance levels, citing United's interest in the player during the summer.",
      "In even better news for United and Amorim, it's believed that Baleba's preference is to join United over Bayern Munich. The German champions are reportedly considering their own move for the Cameroonian amid uncertainty over Leon Goretzka's future.",
      "However, Tavolieri has claimed that some internally at Bayern are reluctant to pay such a high price for him. It keeps the door open for United to be in pole position to sign the midfielder, though it remains to be seen whether they will agree to pay that fee.",
      "Back in September, Hurzeler admitted that he had concerns that Baleba's struggles stemmed from United's summer interest. \"For sure, when a young boy reads there is interest from Manchester United with a big, big offer, it might affect him deep, deep down,\" he said.",
      "\"That’s also part of the development to understand that when you play well, there comes a big offer, there comes a big club who wants to have him.",
      "“But then to keep pushing, to be humble, stay here in Brighton, and try to make the next step with the team and that’s something we have to keep on working with him. I can’t give you a clear answer if it’s really affected him or not.",
      "But for sure, he’s a young boy and we need to understand he’s not a machine that if you click on then he always runs and off then he stops. We need to understand his feelings, his emotions, where he comes from, and that’s our responsibility.\"",

      "Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) chief Howard Webb has been told he should speak to referee Andrew Kitchen after Aaron Wan-Bissaka was controversially not sent off during Manchester United's draw with West Ham. The former United defender somehow avoided a red card for a late sliding challenge on Patrick Dorgu despite having been booked just moments earlier.",
      "The Hammers equalised between those two Wan-Bissaka incidents with Soungoutou Magassa scoring the rebound of Jarrod Bowen's shot that was cleared off the line. Diogo Dalot had put United ahead earlier in the second half.",
      "United pushed for a winner but could not find a way past Alphonse Areola again which saw them forced to settle for a point. Had Wan-Bissaka been dismissed, it could have been a far different ending with former Premier League referee Keith Hackett left bemused by the call.",
      "He has since suggested that Webb should be having a debrief with referees to understand their thought-process. Hackett, speaking to Football Insider on The Final Whistle, said: \"I was just fooled by it. Watching it, I was saying, ‘You’re off, mate. You’re going to have an early Christmas present,’ but nothing happened.",
      "“The second yellow was worse than the first, and the second yellow was more like orange. On its own, I could have had it sit as a red. This was absolute nonsense. When we have situations like this, it’s important for Howard Webb to talk to the referees.",
      "\"He should say, ‘Talk me through this situation.’ Why didn’t you issue a yellow card? What have you seen that negates a yellow card?“",
      "Prior to that incident, Kitchen had an impressive game in the middle with Hackett keen to compliment the 29-year-old before then delivering a brutal verdict in the immediate aftermath of the clash.",
      "He had earlier stated: \"Whilst I think that Andrew Kitchen had a very good game, I would like him to review the two Wan-Bissaka challenges, particularly the last one. On a yellow card, you put in a reckless challenge, he should have had a second yellow followed by the red.\"",
      "\"He's a lucky guy. Andrew, you've got to keep focused up until the final whistle.\"",
      "Following his relatively high-profile error, Kitchen was not selected to officiate a Premier League match in game-week 15 nor did he referee in the Championship.",
      "Once again, United are playing on Monday evening as they face winless Wolves. Ruben Amorim has stated that his team must be focused for the task at hand.",
      "He said: “Everything can happen, and that will change. There is no team in the Premier League history that didn't win one game. So, it can be any game.",
      "\"So, we need to try to improve, to rest the players, work really well, and prepare a tough match because, with us, it’s always a tough match.”",
      "United host Bournemouth the following week alongside a trip to Aston Villa before Christmas. Prior to 2026 starting, United welcome Newcastle United and Wolves to Old Trafford.",

      "Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has admitted the club are preparing for the possibility of replacing certain players in the summer amid Manchester United's interest in Adam Wharton.",
      "Wharton is one of the top targets at Old Trafford to improve Ruben Amorim's midfield. United attempted to lure Carlos Baleba from Brighton & Hove Albion in August but opted to spend the remainder of their transfer budget on a new goalkeeper.",
      "A new midfielder is the priority at United heading into the January transfer window, with Baleba and Wharton at the top of that list. The Reds have recently shifted their transfer focus to Premier League-proven players, with over £120 million spent on Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo last summer.",
      "Wharton has three-and-a-half years left on his deal at Palace after moving to Selhurst Park from Blackburn Rovers at the start of 2024. The England international is one of many assets at Palace that are being linked with a big-money move away from south London.",
      "Marc Guehi was close to joining Liverpool late in the summer window, and Jean-Philippe Mateta was the subject of reported interest from United. Palace sold Eberechi Eze to Arsenal for around £60m in the summer, 11 months after Bayern Munich paid £50m for Michael Olise.",
      "In an interview with The Athletic, Parish has conceded that the club could lose more key players when the 2025/26 season ends. \"We've got one eye on players who we might have to replace in the summer,\" he said.",
      "\"We're not going to throw it all on red and have a massive problem. Unless you want to be in a situation where you're constantly putting in money every year, there's a cash limit to what you can spend.",
      "\"You can't spend money you don't have. You have to have some guardrails as a club, or you'll build up big problems down the track. Everyone saw where prices went in the summer; it's a difficult landscape.",
      "\"There wasn't the right thing available at the right time when the finances were in place. There's no point in doing something for the sake of it. How are you going to get someone to come and tell them they are No 1 in Ebs [Eze] position if you still have him? The one where we didn't, with Marc [Gueh], we kept him.",
      "“You can’t always make happen what you want to. We are where we are in the pecking order; you could ask why other clubs make bids for our players two weeks before the end of the window. I don’t know why they did that.”",
      "Parish's comments come after Wharton's representative, James Featherstone, revealed that the midfielder has ambitions of making it to the top. \"When he was at Blackburn we sat down and spoke about shooting for the stars and playing for England,\" he told talkSPORT.",
      "“So how do you get there? Personally I think to play for England you have to play Champions League, to play in the Champions League you have got to play for one of the top teams in one of the top leagues.",
      "“That jump to a Champions League team, I think you can get lost. The plan below that was to play for a Premier League team. We have got a plan. He is 21. I have to check myself to remember that every now and then. It doesn’t have to be achieved yesterday, today or this moment.",
      "“He has got his in-game, in-season targets and goals. He has got to do his bit and the rest will look after itself in a very structured, calm way to ultimately add value and maximise his ability.”",

      "The scenes during Euro 2022 will live long in the memory. The nation was gripped with Lioness fever as England made history by beating Germany to lift the trophy at a sold-out Wembley Stadium. But the legacy of that tournament – which saw 16 nations battle it out across a total of 31 games in 10 venues from Wembley to Rotherham – has been huge for the women’s game.",
      "Close to 575,000 fans watched the matches live, many of them attending a women’s football match for the first time, while more than 365 million people tuned in on TV from 195 countries. The sport boomed on social media as fans found their new heroes, while money began pouring into the sport.",
      "In the past three years since that tournament, the game has just continued to grow in terms of awareness, investment, publicity and interest. So the news that the UK is so far the only nation in the running to host the 2035 World Cup is something everyone associated with the sport should be excited and delighted about – and the December edition of the Mirror's Women's Football News is certainly that.",
      "If it is confirmed when the final decision on the hosts is made in April that football is coming home, it will see 48 teams competing in what will be a truly stunning festival of football. A list of 22 venues across all four nations have been put forward by the UK bidding team including the new Old Trafford, Wembley, Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium, Glasgow’s Hampden Park, Belfast’s Windsor Park and Newcastle’s St James’ Park. And although that list will be whittled down once the decision on the host nation is confirmed, by the size of the stadiums put forward, organisers are expecting big crowds.",

      "Despite picking up a very good victory over Crystal Palace, there was a sense of trepidation ahead of Manchester United's clash with West Ham on Thursday evening. Last time United were under the lights at Old Trafford, they came unstuck as ten man Everton picked up a deserved victory.",
      "In the second half of that fixture, United had plenty of the ball but offered very little attacking threat. Joshua Zirkzee struggled to lead the line while build-up play, particularly down the left, often broke down. There were simply no solutions to turn to on the United bench, either.",
      "This is why what happened against West Ham was not a shock. On this occasion, United managed to score the opening goal through Diogo Dalot but instead of pushing for a second and killing off the game, the Reds made changes to consolidate their advantage. Patrick Dorgu, Manuel Ugarte and Lisandro Martinez were all brought on, the latter after the Reds had conceded.",
      "The only attack-minded substitution was Mason Mount. who replaced Zirkzee. The Dutchman has had his critics but at least he was offering good link-up play and having left the pitch, United were ill-prepared to refocus on attacking if West Ham found an equaliser, which they managed from a corner.",
      "After the game, Ruben Amorim was quizzed about his substitutions. He initially said his plan was to win more second balls after making the substitutions, but it was telling that Amorim also asked this question in reply: \"We had more men to put in the offense. Who would be more offensive?\"",
      "This statement could be perceived as a message to the United boardroom. As he continues to overlook Kobbie Mainoo, who is more attack-minded than Ugarte but still obviously not an out-and-out attacking player, there were very few options Amorim would be willing to turn to.",
      "Since the international break, United have played three matches without Benjamin Sesko. In those matches, United have had a maximum of two players who are offensively-minded on the bench - during the Crystal Palace game it was just Shea Lacey.",
      "But the new norm at the minute is Mount and Lacey on the bench. Amorim simply does not have the options available to him to make attacking changes - even if he wanted to. Would throwing Lacey into the game on Thursday night have been helpful for the Reds? Probably not.",
      "He is a young player who has a bright future but he needs to be eased in to senior football. Lacey shouldn't be thrust into a game like that with an expectation to come up with a goal to kill the game off - not at this stage of his development, anyway.",
      "Amorim has uncovered a major priority heading into the January transfer window. If United pick up any more injuries or absence in their forward line, they will be even more stretched. Adding reinforcements to the squad - particularly a centre-forward - should be at the top of the manager's wishlist heading into 2026.",
      "There should be genuine concerns ahead of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad leaving for AFCON soon. Should Sesko be deemed unfit to return when Mbeumo and Amad leave, who does Amorim turn to then? Until this issue is addressed, United can expect to find goals difficult to come by.",

Collyer received permanent and loan interest from over a dozen clubs in the Championship during the summer transfer window, but West Brom won the race for his signature.",
      "The youngster's loan at the Hawthorns hasn't gone to plan, though. Collyer picked up a muscle injury in October, which kept him out for four games, and suffered a more serious issue after his return. Collyer was absent from the West Brom squad last weekend. Their manager, Ryan Mason, spoke to the Express & Star on Thursday and confirmed he has returned to Carrington to be assessed.",
      "Mason explained: “It’s quite a big injury. He’s at United at the minute. They’re just assessing him, and then I think in the coming weeks we’ll just decide his plan regarding his rehab.”",
      "When asked if the injury could impact Collyer's loan, Mason said: \"We’ve got him on loan for the season. That’s the plan. Normally, any loan player who gets an injury that’s a bit more than a small one, more of a significant one, I think it’s right for the parent club to look at them to check them over.",
      "\"We’re in dialogue and hopefully he can do his rehab and come back better. We’re looking into it, both clubs. He’s disappointed, naturally. When you’re trying to build your career when you have setbacks that hold you back, it’s challenging. But I guess the reality is to get to the top in any industry there’s going to be challenges. I think if he’s clever, if he uses it wisely, then for sure it can make him stronger in many different aspects.\"",
      "Collyer made 13 first-team appearances in a breakthrough 2024/2025 season at Old Trafford. Last year, a source discussed Erik ten Hag's fondness for Collyer and another source said he records 'freakish' running stats in training that are only bettered by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Ruben Amorim has praised Collyer. \"He has very good legs, he's improving with the ball. He knows what he needs to do to play for this club and feels the club in the right way. He's really humble and when you work hard, you get the opportunity,\" said Amorim in January.",
      "Collyer's contract at United runs until the summer of 2027, with the option of another year.",

      "Ruben Amorim said he had no regrets over his second-half substitutes in Manchester United's draw with West Ham despite criticism they had been too negative. After replacing Ayden Heaven with Leny Yoro at half-time, he brought Patrick Dorgu on for Diogo Dalot and in a bid to see out the game took off Joshua Zirkzee for Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha for Manuel Ugarte.",
      "With West Ham level in the 83rd minute, the United head coach then took off Luke Shaw for Lisandro Martinez and left Kobbie Mainoo on the bench, despite his team needing a winner. But Amorim said he had made the changes because his team were losing too many second balls and he felt they still had the firepower to score goals.",
      "\"No,\" he said when asked if he would change the replacements. \"We are losing because of the second ball. Sometimes there's not more men in front that you are going to win the ball. We had more men to put in the offense. Who would be more offensive?",
      "\"It was the second ball. I was worried with Matheus. I know that Bruno has reached the box really well. Mason Mount is playing in his position. They were trying to push us. Bryan has a lot of pace to try to win the ball in one position. So that was my idea.\"",
      "Asked how he felt after seeing his side concede a late equaliser that cost them a chance of going fifth in the Premier League, he said he was \"frustrated and angry\", but then rejected claims his team were failing to progress.",
      "\"It’s not going backwards, we had some moments,\" he said. \"That can happen. You were talking about when we had the [good] run we were perfect, we are not, we are really inconsistent.",
      "\"If you look at the goal, 83 minutes we have a log ball and everything under control and we have to do better.\"",

      "Manchester United are facing a difficult decision over the future of Kobbie Mainoo, as their England midfielder angles towards a potential during the January transfer window.",
      "The academy graduate has struggled for minutes under Ruben Amorim, who has preferred a double pivot with Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro - particularly this season.",
      "Mainoo has played just 261 minutes so far this term, making just one start, which came in the Carabao Cup. He hasn't had much tome off the bench in the Premier League, either.",
      "That has seen the 20-year-old fall out of favour in the England system, too, with his last appearance coming in September 2024, which comes as quite a blow, considering it is a World Cup season.",
      "With opportunities seeming hard to come by, it seems as though Mainoo is willing to take things into his own hands, as The Athletic report that the midfielder is ready to seek a loan move away from United in the January transfer window, owing to his frustration over game-time",
      "The report also indicates no final decision has been made by the club, who aren't expected to make one until after AFCON, which is in the middle of the market, due to the potential impact of players leaving during the competition.",
      "It puts a timeline on when the academy star could leave, if United decide that the best course of action is an exit during the coming weeks.",
      "Mainoo was an unused substitute in his side's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday night, with further questions arising over his future at the club.",
      "\"I see it [frustration]. I just want to win,\" Amorim said before Monday's clash against Wolves when asked whether Mainoo may be demoralised by his decisions. \"I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "\"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games,\" the Portuguese went on. \"One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "While Amorim has defended his stance on Mainoo, United legend Paul Scholes is less forgiving with the manager after recent comments he made.",
      "Scholes took to Instagram and said: \"Bulls***. The kid's being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing home grown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether Mainoo will be allowed to depart and progress elsewhere - from January onwards - with some big calls still to make. However, with links continuing around United, and a midfield transfer in over the near future, everything points towards a possible exit for Mainoo.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been singled out by Gary Neville as the only Manchester United star that seemed to care about the disappointing 1-1 draw against West Ham. Back at Old Trafford, Ruben Amorim's side had a great chance to move up to fifth but failed to capitalise on teams around them dropping points.",
      "An early second-half goal from Diogo Dalot put United ahead but Soungoutou Magassa equalised late on to claim a share of the spoils. Following the clash, Neville went on quite the rant about United's lack of intensity, but he did point out that only Fernandes looked to be trying to score a winner.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville Podcast, he said: \"We lost games here and we drew games here. We drew big games and sometimes what would be considered lesser games, but I don't think we drew or lost games in that way.",
      "\"I think we'd throw the kitchen sink at it, you'd see both full-backs flying forward, centre-backs in the box, goalkeeper coming up for corners.",
      "\"You'd see mayhem and there would be a real massive urge to not lose or draw this game and I don't see that, why? You may as well lose. I just don't see the appetite to throw your whole life at the game, [give] everything you've got and take risks.",
      "\"I have to say it does look like Bruno does that. At the end, it seemed like he was trying to get everywhere. I had to see that little bit of panic in him that we can't draw this game. I don't see it in enough of the others.",
      "\"They're walking towards throw-ins and taking things easy, that can't be what it is. I don't know what to say other than they are what they are.",
      "\"What I will say about this league at this moment in time is that the consistency is really dire. Everyone is dropping points, apart from Arsenal. So many teams are not playing at the standards they can achieve.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim, you can see it in his eyes, a frown, he'll be absolutely livid but also gutted that his team can't deliver at the point where he needs them to.\"",
      "After the game, Ruben Amorim spoke on a number of topics and was far from pleased by some questions in his press conference.",
      "When asked if United were going backwards, he said: \"It's not going backwards. The results are going backwards. We had some moments. That can happen.",
      "\"You were talking about when we had that run that team was really perfect and saying we are not that far from being in the perfect moment. We are really inconsistent.",
      "\"But if you look at the goal, 83 minutes, we have a long ball, we have everything under control and we need to do better.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Jacobs said at the end of October: “At this stage I wouldn’t say they’ve cooled their interest, I would just say there’s absolutely nothing Manchester United can do in terms of their pursuit for Carlos Baleba except let the player focus on his season, wait, and then come summer try and finally get a specific ballpark out of Brighton to start a negotiation, and if it’s £120m, they may walk away.”",

This sum is giving Bayern Munich pause for thought, where Leon Goretzka’s future remains uncertain.

      "Wharton has made a name for himself as one of the most composed and reliable players in the Premier League since joining Palace from Blackburn Rovers in February 2024. The midfielder’s rapid rise has seen him win three caps for England too, and he will be aiming to earn a place in Thomas Tuchel’s World Cup squad.",

      "“When he was at Blackburn we sat down and spoke about shooting for the stars and playing for England,” Featherstone said.",
      "“So how do you get there? Personally I think to play for England you have to play Champions League, to play in the Champions League you have got to play for one of the top teams in one of the top leagues.",

      "I’ve seen a lot of people saying that such poor sides as Liverpool or Manchester United sitting within touching distance of the top six shows the poor quality of the league this season. And also that Arsenal are top by winning games from set-pieces and that Manchester City are over-reliant on Erling Haaland. I honestly don’t know what such precious people want. Have you bought the ‘elite’ rubbish the league has been selling for decades?",
      "It perfectly illustrates how a certain mindset has been inculcated into some fans when the league tries to make a virtue out of tedious predictability. What do you want – competition or dominance? Surely competition wins every time? Money bringing success has become the default; don’t you find that depressing? Can’t you enjoy the smallest temporary cracks in its hegemony?",
      "I’d love to see Villa win the league (they probably won’t) but let’s not pretend the current travails of some big clubs represent a change in the overall direction of travel. The richest clubs will assert their dominance sooner or later. I think some people actively dislike unpredictability. It’s like people who buy fast food because it’s always the same and predictably so. Homogeneity reduces everything to a facility or product without the dirty unpredictability of humanity.",
      "Leeds United’s 3-3 against Liverpool wasn’t an example of the weak league; it was just really enjoyable football.",
      "If you can’t enjoy that without making some overarching judgement about this mythical concept of ‘quality’, I pity you. Living life as a series of judgements on where everything is placed on a notional quality league table sounds very anal.",
      "That draw – was it quality? Why bother judging? It was just fun. It’s not an essay writing competition. You can resort to clinical facts, of course, as if we enjoy football for the logic and statistical conclusions rather than emotion. But surely the important thing, regardless of this supposed quality, is whether it’s actually enjoyable. I take enjoyment above any skill level you want to reference. Poetry stimulates your synapses in a way maths doesn’t.",
      "If a defender kicks it in off someone’s backside, that’s clearly more fun than a technically perfect 0-0 draw.",
      "Don’t worry, the same teams will be back hogging a lot of the talent and dominating soon enough. There hasn’t been a revolution. It’s more than likely that City, Arsenal or Chelsea will win the league; let us just enjoy a brief moment where sometimes we don’t know the result of a game before kick-off.",
      "Why do these people insist on the Freudian practice of trying to measure everything and everyone to arrive at a ‘satisfaction’ quotient? Is it a result of computer football where everything is presented as predictably good, average or poor, with a corresponding price? That’s not reality.",
      "The irony is, more typically, the Premier League is less regularly entertaining and more predictable than the other four major European leagues and certainly less entertaining than the Scottish Championship so enjoy this, almost certainly brief, period where results are unpredictable. Because history suggests it won’t last long.",
      "Stop mithering that a side isn’t good enough in your vague, imprecise assessment of ‘quality’ to be top six. If many of the sides are all bunched together and keep flying up the table and dropping back down, that’s a good thing. Yes it’s unusual and a break from what has become the norm, but the opposite of a sign of this league being poor. It makes it more compelling. Better.",
      "The companies, organisations and states who own top-flight football crave predictability and want to invest in a safe bet and use huge amounts of money to ensure it. The last thing they want is teams going up and down the league as it might harm their income stream. Don’t be like them. Their influence is already pernicious enough. Celebrate unpredictability because it won’t last long.",

Then they switched off in the second half against Manchester United, with Joshua Zirkzee’s strike from an acute angle (0.03 xG) a bad look on the England keeper. But then came another clean sheet against Burnley and three good saves v Fulham.",

In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season.

Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford.",

Back to being solid at Palace and it wasn’t his fault v West Ham.",

      "That run is now nine wins in ten Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four and now genuine title contention. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially as they now somehow find themselves within two points of Arsenal despite not really playing convincingly well for quite some time now.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for an Arne Slot Sack at Liverpool or even Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more. For more than one reason, it’s vital Palace don’t lose Glasner to someone as ropey as Spurs.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves and West Ham, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton and easily beaten by Everton, though.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom five have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else even vaguely competent is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they once were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now, but a win at Wolves on Monday would be handy.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things out, although defeat to Palace does leave Fulham closer than they would like to the relegation fight.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. After the harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week, he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and one that could have been even more convincing.",

      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, which have gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But, well, they’re going down right? It’s whether Burnley still think Parker gives them the best chance of avoiding that fate.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 v proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

      "Barely a press conference goes by without Amorim being asked about Mainoo’s lack of game time under him in his time at Old Trafford, after the 20-year-old broke into the first team under Erik ten Hag in quite some style and played a key role for England at Euro 2024.",

The English are only considering a temporary transfer, as is the player, seeking playing time so as not to miss out on the World Cup showcase. Napoli hopes to be able to finalise everything within a couple of weeks. But in the meantime, the game is still on, and the Azzurri will do it in an emergency.’",

Win the PL, or go coach in league 2, and spare us the monotone Iberian whining while you’re at it. The brass neck of the man is breathtaking.",

      "",
      "F365 had nothing to publish about the Arsenal game mainly because it was much more like a run of the mill routine victory we become accustomed to earlier in the season i.e. nicely worked goals by Arsenal with a clean sheet.",
      "Merino is a Godsend with his overall contribution to our game. The stats I have to hand shows he has 16 goals in 63 games with his assists building up. Also it was great to see White again showing he isn’t just a spare part but to see him confirm that he still offers an important role to this campaign. His defending is still top drawer and, as his contribution to the first goal showed, his customary overlapping runs are a true asset. Some nice footwork from Madueke at times and if he can work on his final delivery he will be useful",
      "I like what I see from Mosquera and Hincapie as a pairing. They dealt with the set pieces well. Shame Mosquera picked up a knock but Mr Reliant in Timber came on and played to his usual standard.",
      "Fair play to Brentford for giving it a go by playing football and not resorting to niggly fouls. They would have scored but for a World Class save by Raya. Another Godsend for Arsenal.",
      "Good to see Chelsea bought down to earth by Leeds. Chelsea seemed sterile without Caicedo but that takes nothing away from the good performance by Leeds. They are looking good and put in a good account of themselves against City.",
      "Now Aston Villa away. Why, after feeling relieved to get games against certain title challengers off the list, we come up against a new contender in good form. All this talk about Arsenal being dead certs for the title is wrong. If that was the case, with a record so far of ten wins, three draws and only one defeat, Arsenal would be further ahead than they currently are.\nChris, Croydon",
      "",
      "Why is it that when the league is bunched up, or when teams outside the traditional “big 6/7” (or whatever we’re calling them now) do well, people suggest the league is weak? Monty in the mailbox falls foul of this when he proclaims, “It’s wild that we could win at Leeds and go fourth; a real reflection of how incredibly low the standard of the league is this season”. I put it to the jury, it’s actually a reflection of how incredibly strong the standard of the league is now.",
      "This is reflected in how tricky games have become against any team in the league, with the exception of Wolves (and Liverpool – titter) who have looked poor up until now (cue them taking points off us on Monday) but even they drew with Spurs and Brighton. It’s not just that my team are consistently inconsistent, I look at the fixture list now and can barely come up for air! Any team on their day will give you a game. Just look at how well the promoted teams can hold their own. Even Burnley – are you confident of your team going to Turf Moor and getting 3 points? Because I sure as shit am not!",
      "Oh you want some evidence and not just anecdotal ramblings of a mad man, you bunch of pedants? Look at how well English teams have been doing in Europe recently. Last season all 4 made it out of the group stages in the CL, with Arsenal and Villa going relatively deep. Spurs and Utd reached the final of the EL (can’t remember who won), and Chelsea breezed through the EC and won it. This season, Arsenal are flying in the CL with the other 4 teams in with a strong chance of qualifying; the same for the teams in the lesser comps (although Palace could be doing better to be fair).",
      "So why is this? Well there is obviously the money. Contrary to what slippery Puffy might have opined, mo money does not equal mo problems in football. Mo money in fact equals better players. However, something that has been nagging at me for years is that the main influence on the league is actually the standard of manager (or coaches) and the evolution of tactics.",
      "I’m not sure how to easily prove or disprove this theory, and maybe the better players and better coaches go hand in hand, like the old nature vs nurture conundrum. Or did the better coaches follow the better players or vice versa, like the old chicken and egg conundrum. But the influx of better coaches (typically foreign – they took our jobs Randy!) and ideas has really ramped up the standard of the league, and improved domestic coaching too.",
      "If there’s an Econometrics student out there looking for an idea for a dissertation, feel free to run a regression model on all of this and write in with the results.

One approach that I can think of is to look at the average points per game so far this season of the teams that finished in the top 6 last season, and compared them to their average points per game over the whole of last season. Here is what I found:",

      "Out of these 8 teams (who, in recent seasons, regularly competed for Champions’ League spots), Liverpool, Newcastle, and Chelsea are averaging fewer points per game this season. So, this measure, while inconclusive, does not really indicate that the League is weaker this season. What are other measures that people can suggest?\nNick",

      "The alternative opposite view is the league is more competitive than it’s ever been. Currently there’s only 3 genuinely weak teams, but if you’re slightly off it against anyone else particularly away from home you’re liable to get turned over no matter who you are and no matter what perch you’ve toppled off.",
      "In Liverpool’s case the alternative view is also that they are incredibly lucky that so many good sides are taking points off each other to enable Liverpool to stay 1 win away from the Champions League places, as they certainly don’t deserve to be that close based on performances this season.

      "Manchester United can smell the Champions League places, but they’re not going to finish in the top five of the Premier League if they don’t a) make some signings in January and b) win more than one game in a row.",
      "Will their finances allow a big spending spree in the winter transfer window? Probably not. Are we going to create a scenario where Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos spend around £250million? Yes. Absolutely.",
      "These five transfers would make for a perfect January for Manchester United and Ruben Amorim, with a Liverpool hijack, Vinicius Junior and Mason Greenwood all thrown into the equation.",
      "",
      "It’s obvious that Manchester United need and want to sign a new central midfielder. The question is: who?",
      "If this was Career Mode or Football Manager, it would be one or two of Federico Valverde, Sandro Tonali, Declan Rice, Pedri, Frenkie de Jong or Moises Caicedo. But this is the real world. And in the real world, it’s going to be Elliot Anderson or Adam Wharton. Which is still absolutely fine, by the way.",
      "Ruben Amorim is never shifting from his beloved 3-4-2-1 formation, so looking at previously successful English clubs operating in the same way, the Red Devils need a player like Nemanja Matic, N’Golo Kante or Jorginho. So it really isn’t all that simple. The best option, that also happens to be realistic, is Anderson.",
      "The Nottingham Forest star’s 2025/26 statistics put him up there as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League. He has made 24 key passes (6th), 802 passes (5th), 111 progressive passes (1st), 111 ball recoveries (1st), 35 tackles (9th), 14 interceptions (23rd), won 29 fouls (2nd), and only received two yellow cards. And in Forest’s defeat to Brighton, Anderson became the first player in the last 10 Premier League seasons to record 100+ touches, 10+ ball recoveries, 10+ duels won, 5+ key passes and 5+ successful dribbles.",
      "He might not be Kante, but he could be Matic, and we’re confident he can become better than Jorginho, if he isn’t already.",
      "It would be a statement signing for Manchester United and there isn’t a better option out there among the players who would actually want to join. The fact he can do absolutely everything and has the engine to play midfield on his own makes him perfect for Amorim’s system. The only issue is the price. In January, you’re looking at £100m. In the summer, maybe closer to £80m. Better, but still very pricey. For England’s No.6, though? Probably worth it…",
      "",
      "Not only would Guehi massively improve United and walk straight in as a leader and their best defender, but signing him means Liverpool don’t, which is probably top of the list of positives, next to a blank column of negatives.",
      "There isn’t really much more to say about it. He would be an absolutely outstanding signing, but the odds are heavily stacked against United.",
      "Liverpool put all the groundwork into signing Guehi last summer and were hours away from getting it done, putting them comfortably ahead of the Red Devils in the race. He can negotiate a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs from January 1, which gives Real Madrid a big advantage. They love a free transfer, need a centre-back and have dropped their interest in Reds defender Ibrahima Konate.",
      "But it’s still in United’s hands if they want it to be. Offer Palace £30m and they might struggle to reject it, considering he’s in the final six months of his deal. Just make a sufficient offer well before the deadline, lads.",
      "Liverpool are also in a much worse place than they were when Guehi agreed to join. They were reigning champions – and still are, technically – and looked set to dominate England and Europe after spending over £420m. Now they are mid-table, out of the title picture, and on an abysmal run of form. It’s not the place to be for someone like Guehi, though he could help fix the problem.",
      "And does Guehi even want to leave England? You’d have to ask him. Some players are reluctant to go abroad, especially if a top English club is offering a fat contract and guaranteed minutes. Real Madrid is the exception, though. You don’t turn down Real Madrid.",
      "",
      "It would be audacious to even try, and the noise surrounding Vinicius‘ situation at Real Madrid is probably a ploy to get a better contract. When he realises his only options are Manchester United or Saudi Arabia, he’ll likely return to Florentino Perez with his tail between his legs.",
      "But let’s say he actually does want to leave and refuses to renew. United would actually stand a chance. They are still, in the eyes of many, the biggest club in the world. They are an institution. Players are addicted to the idea of being ‘the one’ who finally fixes them after years of chaos.",
      "Out of all the big names United could chase, Vinicius would be the most ambitious and exciting. Leaving Real Madrid at 25, after being Ballon d’Or runner-up two years earlier, is not a normal career move. Joining United might be career suicide, but if anyone who is remotely gettable can single-handedly fix them, it’s Vinicius.",
      "",
      "Signing Anderson or Wharton, Guehi, and Vinicius is impossible without a significant sale or two. The best sale for everyone is Ugarte. Casemiro could work if the right offer arrives, but he’s actually been pretty good since Ruben Amorim came in. You could argue he’s been the Portuguese coach’s biggest success story so far. Then there’s Kobbie Mainoo, who is a ‘break glass in case of emergency’ pure profit option.",
      "Truth be told, only Saudi Arabia can bail Manchester United out when it comes to Ugarte. No Champions League contender will want him after back-to-back disappointing spells at two giant clubs. Sporting might want to re-sign him, but for nowhere near the £50m United paid Paris Saint-Germain in August 2023. That leaves the filthy-rich Saudis, who will surely be interested in a big name like Ugarte, who is still only 24.",
      "It’s unrealistic, but not completely delusional. And United will only sanction his sale if they’ve already signed a new midfielder, or have one lined up.",
      "The Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules will probably still punish United anyway, but they can at least tell supporters they lived and enjoyed the dream while it lasted.",
      "",
      "Another significant windfall could come via the sale of Mason Greenwood from Marseille.",
      "Reports suggested United wanted to reintegrate Greenwood after his charges of attempted rape and assault were dropped, but after putting the feelers out, fan backlash was fierce. They quickly U-turned and pretended they always wanted to sell him. After a year on loan at Getafe, he joined Marseille for £26.7m, which was a low fee, but United’s hands were tied. In an uncharacteristically savvy move, they included a big sell-on clause, believed to be 50%.",
      "Transfermarkt says the 24-year-old is worth around £35m, but 10 goals and three assists in Ligue 1 this season, coupled with his potential and previous seasons, suggests he will go for much more – perhaps around £60m, giving United £30m.",
      "And when Greenwood does leave Marseille, Manchester United will finally be able to close a dark chapter.",
      "READ NEXT: Top 10 transfer flops of the season: Liverpool trio shamed as Premier League clubs waste £500m",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could be set for a significant windfall as an ‘offer’ has been submitted for Marseille forward Mason Greenwood.",
      "Man Utd are ready to splash out on one of two Real Madrid players in the summer, while they want Antoine Semenyo in January, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are set to break their transfer record next summer on one of two players as they look to bring in a new midfielder, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly decided to break the £100m barrier on their next addition, though four stars may need to leave first.",
      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",
      "Former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood has been backed to play for England again on one condition as he would solve “many problems”."

      "The now honorary president of Bayern Munich called Newcastle’s £69m signing of Nick Woltemade “completely crazy”, suggested their record-breaking £13m loan deal of Nicolas Jackson from Chelsea was in fact good business, and can barely open his mouth without saying something salty about Liverpool landing Florian Wirtz ahead of the Bundesliga giants, most recently exposing Arne Slot’s “broken promise” over the playmaker’s shirt number.",
      "He’s a 73-year-old man struggling to come to terms with the Premier League’s gold-laden hands reaching out into a market that Bayern have cornered for decades, plundering the cream of the crop from the Bundesliga that they have historically hoovered up to dominate that division to the tune of 20 titles this century.",
      "“One farmer comes to another and says: I sold two cows for €50,000 each and bought four chickens for €25,000 each,” he joked through gritted teeth when discussing the inflated transfer market.",

      "Harry Kane to Chelsea\nA huge long shot for so many reasons, most of which are amusingly listed by the nameless ‘5 elite reporters’ working on the now infamous X account who got one thing right once, were credited by David Ornstein, and are now further buoyed to treat things overheard in a pub or proclaimed by an Uber driver as genuine transfer news.",
      "‘Kane’s age, his hefty wages, and the length of his contract are all hurdles,’ they admit, but insist the Tottenham legend (another ‘hurdle’ they didn’t consider) is Enzo Maresca’s ‘dream target’ who can be ‘the difference-maker in Chelsea’s quest for the Premier League and Champions League titles’.",
      "",
      "Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich\nAfter insisting Bayern only actually paid £11.8m as Jackson and his agent paid the rest, which is definitely actually a very good deal for a striker that would likely cost roughly £1m per goal based on his past goalscoring antics, Hoeness went on to explain why the conditions required to trigger the further £56m to make his loan deal permanent would “never” be met.",
      "“The big money only has to be paid if he starts 40 games. He never does that.”",
      "With just five starts to his name it doesn’t look hugely likely that clause will be met, but a Harry Kane injury or January move could do the trick.",
      "",
      "Michael Olise to Arsenal\nQuite why Arsenal are ‘prepared to submit a record-breaking offer close to €150m (£131m)’ for a guy who’s played 173 games in his career on the right wing when they already have Bukayo Saka and have just signed a very serviceable back-up in Noni Madueke, over signing someone for the left wing, where Olise has played just nine times, isn’t entirely clear.",
      "But we’re not here to question the validity of Fichajes’ claims, we’re here to imagine the steam cascading from Hoeness’ ears when Arsenal sign Bayern’s most valuable player just because they can.",
      "",
      "Lennart Karl to Manchester City\n“It’s like Monopoly: move forward to Schlossallee [the German Mayfair], then some sheikh will come along and then you can buy,” Hoeness said during his rant on Newcastle pinching Woltemade from under their noses.",

      "They can’t keep taking one step forward and then two steps back, and that’s the incredibly unsexy dance they performed once again in their 1-1 draw at home to West Ham after beating Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "That was a huge win, an unexpected win, against a very good team. They had to back that up with another win against a pretty poor one. Alas, they didn’t.",
      "Ruben Amorim should be criticised for his substitutions, which ultimately cost them victory on Thursday night. He even managed to spark debate with his starting XI.",
      "The Manchester United head coach made the bold call to hand young defender Ayden Heaven his first start of the season, with Matthijs de Ligt – the club’s player of the month – out due to a minor injury. Heaven didn’t come in for De Ligt, but for Leny Yoro, whose dropping to the bench was a “tactical” decision.",
      "Heaven needed to settle quickly, and he did the opposite, smashing into Jarrod Bowen with a slide tackle and receiving a yellow card after only eight minutes. Not ideal, but it clearly didn’t rattle him because he didn’t have a poor first half. Still, he evidently wasn’t good enough in Amorim’s eyes as he was substituted at half-time for Yoro, with the booking clearly concerning the Portuguese.",
      "Heaven starting on Thursday reaffirmed what we already knew: Kobbie Mainoo is in Man United exile.",
      "After emerging as one of the club’s best players under Erik ten Hag, becoming an England regular and starting in the final of Euro 2024, Mainoo can’t get a kick anymore, and a January sale is looking more likely with every passing week.",
      "Another appearance on the bench while Heaven was in the starting XI left Mainoo in worrying company with Tom Heaton, Lisandro Martínez and Tyrell Malacia as United’s only first-team players yet to start in the Premier League this season. If you were unsure, that’s their third-choice goalkeeper, a guy who has been injured all season, and someone who was in Amorim’s pre-season bomb squad.",
      "While his standing in the Red Devils’ squad hierarchy is striking, it’s not like he’d have transformed a cautious United performance.",
      "Amorim has said that he’s competing for a starting spot with club captain and best player Bruno Fernandes, and from the minor minutes we’ve seen of them together, it actually makes sense. But for Mainoo, it’s a horrible situation; Fernandes is literally undroppable. His form needs to fall off a cliff to be benched, and he’s only missed nine Premier League games in five full seasons, largely due to suspension.",
      "Casemiro has also been pretty good in midfield for the Red Devils and is Amorim’s biggest success story. He has been criticised for his rashness in the past, but he is more disciplined in that position than Mainoo.",
      "Man United fans are desperate to see Mainoo play more because they love him and he’s an academy graduate with incredible potential, but during a disappointing performance against West Ham, there can’t have been many people watching and thinking the game was crying out for him.",
      "Their performance made for a very dull first half at Old Trafford, highlighted largely by Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s defensive contributions.",
      "The first genuine moment of quality came from Alphonse Areola, who acrobatically tipped Bryan Mbeumo’s cross-cum-shot over the bar, denying United another set-piece goal that would have seen them overtake Arsenal in that statistic in the 2025/26 Premier League season.",
      "In terms of attacking quality, that was really all she wrote in the opening 45 minutes. There was a brief flurry of shots that could have sparked Ruben Amorim’s men into life; Wan-Bissaka cleared a Joshua Zirkzee header off the line, Matheus Cunha had an overhead kick blocked, and Bruno Fernandes’ scissor volley clipped the post. It wasn’t the shot in the arm United needed, just three shots.",
      "Wan-Bissaka was player of the half, adding an incredible sliding tackle on Cunha in his own box before producing an expertly read headed clearance from a tantalising Fernandes cross.",
      "It was unfortunately much of the same when the game restarted, but in a match between two teams that can be excruciating to watch that was crying out for a goal, we finally got one just before the hour mark, and in fairness, it did improve proceedings.",
      "Diogo Dalot benefited from a bit of luck when Casemiro’s blocked shot fell straight to him, though he still had plenty to do. His first touch was perfect and the finish was that of an experienced No.9, shifting the ball past Wan-Bissaka and in the opposite direction of Areola’s momentum.",
      "Beating West Ham at home was the only acceptable outcome for United, and going up into the Champions League places would’ve been a welcome bonus. But after taking the lead, they didn’t push for a second, and as the second didn’t come and their opponents found an equaliser, Amorim’s substitutions will rightly be criticised.",
      "Patrick Dorgu on for the goalscorer, Manuel Ugarte for Matheus Cunha, and Mason Mount for Joshua Zirkzee suggested that Amorim thought it had to be a case of holding onto the one-goal lead rather than pressing on against one of the worst teams in the Premier League this year and putting the game to bed.",
      "Ironically, when Nuno Espírito Santo brought on Andy Irving, his first contribution was to instantly take a corner kick that led to Soungoutou Magassa’s 83rd-minute equaliser.",
      "United might feel aggrieved that Wan-Bissaka wasn’t shown the most blatant of second yellow cards you’ll see all season, but the fact of the matter is that they didn’t do nearly enough to win the game. Areola wasn’t tested enough and any half-chance they did get was rashly wasted, like Fernandes’ left-footed volley in the fifth minute of injury time.",
      "There was a serious lack of quality at Old Trafford. It was just a bad game of football. The United players looked dejected at the end, knowing it was an unacceptable performance and that West Ham at home should have been an easy three points.",
      "Questions will be asked about Amorim’s in-game management again. It cost United and epitomises their season so far: one step forward, two steps back. Just when you think they could get back amongst it, they do something stupid. It’s tiring for us, let alone someone who actually goes to the games.",
      "It’s bottom-club Wolves next. Another team in the relegation zone. No matter how poor they are, United can’t relax and act as if the game is won at 1-0. Or, knowing this team, even at 2-0.",
      "Amorim’s substitutions were so negative that they rubbed off on his players, who seemed to think it was game over and that they could just see it out. Nope. West Ham can still punish you. Even Wolves can still punish you.",
      "United can’t become too casual in these fixtures. They cannot follow an impressive win at Palace with a poor draw at home to West Ham. And we can’t keep looking at games and saying afterwards, ‘Well, Amorim will learn from this.’",
      "It’s clear that this team still has a long way to go. They’ve taken a step forward and a step back so many times they no longer have any idea which way they’re facing.",

      "After Kobbie Mainoo, without a Premier League start all season, was left on the bench against West Ham, Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faced questions about his continued omission of the 20-year-old England midfielder...",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim robustly defended his decision to continually omit Kobbie Mainoo during a spiky press conference ahead of Manchester United's game against Wolves on Monday Night Football.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game this season and remained an unused substitute throughout the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening. Amorim was asked repeatedly about the player during the press conference at Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, Amorim said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "Asked if players departing for AFCON could present a chance for the England midfielder, Amorim replied: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Pressed further on whether he understood the questions about Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim also hit back when his support for Manchester United's academy was questioned - it being put to him that not playing Mainoo reflected a lack of trust in any of the club's young players.",
      "In response to the claim that he did not play any academy players, Amorim said: \"Any players? We have Kobbie Mainoo…\"",
      "When the name of 18-year-old winger Shea Lacey came up, he said: \"But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard.",
      "\"So, you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.\"",
      "United boast a proud record of having named at least one academy graduate in every matchday squad since 1937.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes offered his own frustrations about the treatment of Mainoo after he was an unused sub on Thursday night.",
      "In a since-deleted post on Instagram, Scholes reacted to Amorim's recent comments that he considers Mainoo a starter:",
      "\"Bull****, the kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football.",
      "\"Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team. We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason, it's not quite up. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this moment, but at some point, he will get frustrated.\"",
      "Questions about Mainoo have been a running theme during Amorim's time at Manchester United and understandably so given that the talented young midfielder had been seen as someone to build the team around when the Portuguese first came in.",
      "Mainoo, remember, scored what proved to be the winner in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City in May of last year. The team's other scorer that day, Alejandro Garnacho, has already left in acrimonious circumstances. There are fears Mainoo is next.",
      "While Garnacho was a winger who did not quite fit what Amorim wanted, Mainoo finds his path blocked by captain Bruno Fernandes given that United operate with only two midfielders and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to deputise for Casemiro.",
      "Given Fernandes' robustness, coupled with Amorim's refusal to tweak his structure in any circumstances, that leaves Mainoo struggling for minutes let alone starts. And there is no sign of a solution. Amorim has always stressed he will do this his way.",
      "It is a problem for Mainoo, of course. But it is awkward for Amorim too. His focus, he argues, is on winning games rather than any bigger purpose - such as the club's proud academy tradition. If he is not winning those games, it puts him firmly under the spotlight.",

      "Manchester United blew the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League on Thursday when West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford; Roy Keane slammed a 'frightened' performance and questioned the standards of the home side after conceding again from a corner",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 07:27, UK",
      "Roy Keane accused Manchester United of being too \"frightened\" to see out victory over West Ham after blowing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League, and called the performance \"desperate\".",
      "West Ham salvaged a late 1-1 draw at Old Trafford when Soungoutou Magassa's 83rd-minute equaliser cancelled out Diogo Dalot's opening goal.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, United have only taken 27 points from 20 games at Old Trafford, and only managed one win from their last five in the league - drawing three of those, despite being ahead in each.",
      "\"After they get the goal, you are playing against a team in the bottom three, they take their foot off the gas,\" said Keane. \"Take nothing away from West Ham and they just about deserved the equaliser.",
      "\"You are just putting yourself under pressure. Every time I watch this United team, they disappoint. They aren't clinical, they weren't nasty enough to get the job done.",
      "\"People will be scratching their heads. One minute they are making progress, win and you go fifth. There will be a lot of frustration.",
      "\"Show your quality. In their last three or four games, I think it has been desperate. Really poor. An opportunity to get the job done and they were almost frightened.",
      "\"Same old problems. The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group of players? I've watched the games closely, the lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team. There is expectation at this club, you have to deal with that.\"",
      "Keane also questioned the standards of the home side after they switched off from a set-piece to concede the leveller. Since the start of last season, only West Ham themselves (17) have conceded more league goals from corners than Manchester United (15).",
      "\"The reason you are playing for Manchester United is that you deal with these situations,\" Keane added.",
      "\"If they are anxious, you worry why they are playing for Manchester United and what they are fearful of. Fearful of West Ham, why?\"",
      "\"I don't get it, I don't get the lack of urgency, and the lack of intensity. I don't get the slow play. I don't get the lack of risk in the game.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim told us he wanted more intensity from the very beginning. Now I suspect, he's not going back into the changing room saying 'guys, play slowly tonight'. He's saying 'let's get the ball moving quicker, let's run forward, let's play with real threat and vigour'.",
      "\"It doesn't transpire out on the pitch, so I don't know, why does that happen? I've got no understanding.",
      "\"I don't see the actual appetite to go and throw your whole life at the game, and everything you've got, and throw it forward and take risks. They're showing us what they are, the seventh, eighth or ninth team in the league.\"",
      "Defender Diogo Dalot said his side became \"anxious\" after opening the scoring at Old Trafford, and must look at themselves after squandering another lead.",
      "\"We cannot get as anxious as we get. We were a bit more sloppy with the ball in possession. Obviously disappointed with the draw, we had the game there.",
      "\"It's a solution we need to find. In the end, we have to look to ourselves. It's more our fault.\"",
      "It was established far further back than Thursday night that Manchester United lack resolve under pressure. Diogo Dalot says his team-mates are hindered by anxiety. Really, it's just about concentration levels.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have not registered a clean sheet in seven games - since early October. They establish a foothold in games and then inevitably hand it back. They win a game and then suffer a setback in the next. There is no continuity here.",
      "United dominated every attacking metric against inferior West Ham, creating higher xG, landing more shots on target and generating three big chances - two of those were missed. They had 42 touches in the opposition box. That's a staggeringly high amount if the yield is only one goal.",
      "Ultimately, this United team have very little conviction. Amorim bemoaned a lack of second-half control post-match and blamed \"second ball losses\". If you don't compete, or can't compete, for a whole 90 minutes that is what will happen.",

      "Alphonse Areola tipped over Bryan Mbeumo's cross-shot, Aaron Wan-Bissaka cleared off the line from Joshua Zirkzee and Bruno Fernandes' effort on the follow up shaved the post. United finished the first half with a season-high 25 touches in the opposition box.",
      "Ayden Heaven, making his first start since the debacle against Grimsby, was withdrawn at half-time having picked up an early booking, but the United boss maintained his 3-4-3 structure, of course. And it was his left wing-back of all people who opened the scoring.",
      "Wandering into the box unmarked, the ball fell kindly to Dalot and the Portuguese defender slammed the ball into the net to lift the mood inside Old Trafford. But the fact that they were unable to capitalise on it highlighted why Amorim's team still frustrate.",
      "Andy Irving swung in a corner with his first touch after coming on, Jarrod Bowen won the flick on ahead of Fernandes and though Noussair Mazraoui cleared off the line, Magassa's slotted away the rebound. West Ham even threatened to score a winner.",
      "Since Nuno Espirito Santo’s first game in charge of West Ham, only Aston Villa (9) have won more Premier League points from losing positions than the Hammers (8).",
      "That would have been pushing it but they do not look like a team that will be facing relegation under Nuno in the spring. Where Amorim's United find themselves is less clear. Champions League qualification is a possibility. But not with this sloppiness.",
      "\"The last three or four games, that sums them up. Not quite doing enough.",
      "\"Where is the frustration with this group players? I've watched the games closely. The lack of quality and intensity. They got two goals against Palace but they defended like a pub team.",
      "\"Tonight, you give United praise before the game and they can go fifth. This team is not ready to go fifth. Fifth in the league!",
      "\"They've got Wolves next, they are one of the worst teams I've ever seen in the Premier League. Let's see.",
      "\"I don't get how the players or manager don't sense it. That there could be a twist. They have to do better than that.\"",
      "We had good moments and we lost a little bit of control after the goal.",
      "\"We should have closed the game when we scored the first one.",
      "\"The game was in control, we knew it. Any set pieces can be a problem. We couldn't maintain the ball after the goal.",
      "\"Losing second balls, running with the ball, they were winning the first ball. We can control that kind of game. We should be better with the ball after the first goal.",
      "\"The characteristics with the players inside the box were sometimes not enough.\"",
      "\"It's important because it's a tough place to come. We are proud that we achieved something. It could have been three [points].",
      "\"We are trying to build urgency with results, looking for a better performance.\"",
      "\"I thought all the game, especially second half, we created many problems for Man Utd.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."
