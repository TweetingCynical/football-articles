      "Marcus Rashford endured a horror first start for Barcelona as he was hauled off at half-time with the Catalans losing 2-0 to Levante - leading to a hugely critical reaction from some fans.",
      "The Manchester United loanee impressed off the bench last week as the Spanish champions made light work of Real Mallorca, but a week on and Rashford had an evening to forget as Barcelona were facing an embarrassing defeat early in the La Liga season.",
      "As a result, Hansi Flick quickly hooked the loanee, along with Marc Casado. Dani Olmo and Gavi came on to replace them and helped provide the spark that was required with Barcelona eventually completing their comeback in stoppage time to win 3-2.",
      "Pedri needed just four minutes in the second half to get the Catalans on the right track before Ferran Torres, formerly of Manchester City, equalised. Barcelona found their winner beyond the 90 minutes as Levante defender Unai Elgezabal headed into his own net from a Lamine Yamal cross.",
      "Rashford will not have furthered his case for more involvement, especially with the amount of attacking quality available to Flick at Barcelona. And several fans took aim at the Englishman.",
      "One said: \"Rashford has successfully brought the Man Utd mentality to Barca.\" Another wrote: \"You can take Rashford out of Man Utd but you can't take Man Utd out of Rashford.\"",
      "Flick refused to blame Rashford for the below par first-half performance, insisting he continues to show that he will be able to contribute as the season goes on. But ultimately Barcelona need to tweak their personnel and tactics with the United man among those sacrificed.",
      "He said: \"I think Marcus had some situations in the first half where he showed how good he is and how he can help us. This is, for me, where we have to continue. Of course, the second half, we have to change something. Raphinha on the [left] side is our No.11.",
      "\"He knows everything [about how we play]; what we want to do when he has to come inside. I think we got the right changes. But of course, when we score the first goal so early in the second half, it helps a lot for us and changed the strategy.\"",
      "Rashford is in the midst of his second successive loan spell having spent the latter part of last season with Aston Villa. The Englishman was determined to seal a switch to Catalunya to play with Barcelona, where he is now rubbing shoulders with Yamal, Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United wonderkid JJ Gabriel only need 45 minutes to score for their U18s as he continued to underline his credentials after being invited to train with the first-team by Ruben Amorim.",
      "Gabriel is just 14, but has been fast-tracked in the United academy after some stellar performances and continues to perform well above his age group. And now Amorim has made him aware that he will be given the opportunity to train with the first team on occasions this season.",
      "Amorim was told about the teenager's progress earlier in the summer and was shown video clips of Gabriel during United’s pre-season tour of the United States. He has since taken a keen interest in his development and has sat down to meet Gabriel, claims the BBC.",
      "The pair met at Carrington and the youngster watched the opening Premier League match of the season against Arsenal from the directors’ box at Old Trafford.",
      "Gabriel looks to be paying back the faith shown in him and was on target twice as United's U18s hammered Middlesbrough 5-0. The 14-year-old scoring shortly before half-time and then again 20 minutes from the end during the rout.",
      "The winger committed his future to the Manchester outfit earlier in the summer, with the club’s technical director Jason Wilcox playing a role in those discussions. That is unusual for an academy player so young and highlights just how highly he is thought of at the club.",
      "Gabriel put himself on notice after scoring twice for the U18s in a 13-1 hammering of Leeds in April. That saw him become the youngest ever player to feature for United’s U18s and the team’s manager, Darren Fletcher, is the man aiding his development.",
      "The 14-year-old's incredible rise is summed up by the fact he won’t be able to play in their FA Youth Cup campaign because he is still too young. Amorim made it clear that, this summer, he wanted to combine smart recruitment with utilising the academy to produce a squad that had quality and depth.",
      "He said: \"Then we have a plan that is to bring [in] some new players. Our big plan is to improve the team we have and improve the academy as that is our future, as it was in past. It's not going to change so much.\"",

      "The Eberechi Eze transfer saga is one that can finally be ticked off after his Arsenal move was confirmed. The winger was shown off to the Emirates with north London rivals Tottenham left to lick their wounds after missing out.",
      "One storyline that still has plenty of time to play out is the Alexander Isak - Newcastle affair. Liverpool wait in the wings and the Swede is not expected to feature when the Magpies play the Reds on Monday night. It is sure to be a hostile atmosphere given the current situation.",
      "Isak maintains his time at St James' Park is up but Newcastle don't want to sell. All the while Liverpool know that they still need to add at least one more face in attack.",

      "There was no place in the Brentford squad for Yoane Wissa, who is pushing for a move away from the club, as the Bees saw off Aston Villa.",
      "The striker is looking to secure himself a move to Newcastle and his boss felt it was best he was missing.",

      "Fernandes was subject to interest from interest from Al Hilal earlier in the window, but wanted to remain playing in Europe, which suggests he has no interest.",
      "United will leave the 30-year-old to make his own decision again, as they did earlier this summer. It is understood that talks with Fernandes' camp have already taken place and Al Ittihad are willing to pay the midfielder £33m per year.",

      "Ruben Amorim has made it clear that the arrival of a new goalkeeper will not mean one has to leave.",
      "Eddie Howe insists Newcastle will not be left without a striker as the Alexander Isak saga continues to play out.",
      "He was quizzed about the prospect of losing Isak without a replacement coming in, but he doesn't see that as a scenario that will play out.",

      "Mikel Arteta is adamant that Eberechi Eze will add another dynamic to the Arsenal attack after his move was completed on Saturday.",
      "He said: “We are absolutely delighted to bring Eberechi to Arsenal. He is a powerful and exciting player who will give us a new dimension in our attacking game. What stands out just as much as his talent and intelligence as a player, is the way he has worked hard throughout his career to get where he is today.",
      "\"His journey, his mentality, and his ambition are exactly what we want in our team, and we love how much it means to him and his family to be joining our club. We all look forward to start working with Eberechi soon.”",

      "Dimitar Berbatov admitted Sir Alex Ferguson's treatment of him led to his acrimonious Manchester United departure. The Bulgarian became the Red Devils' most expensive player in 2008 when they forked out £30.75million to prise him away from Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "After scoring 21 Premier League goals in his first two seasons combined at Old Trafford, Berbatov netted 20 goals in his third season, which not only clinched his second league title in England but his first Golden Boot honour.",
      "Despite coming off what was the second-best scoring season of his career, Berbatov found games hard to come by the following season, as he appeared in just 12 league games, while scoring seven.",
      "In the last 15 games of the 2011/12 season, the former striker had just 28 minutes of action to his name. The frustration felt by Berbatov at the time could be traced back to the season prior where he was left out of the squad by Ferguson for United's 3-1 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League final.",
      "The 2011/12 campaign turned out to be the last Berbatov would be a United player as he opted to sign for Fulham. Upon his arrival in west London, he didn't hold back when revealing how his fractured relationship with Ferguson was created, admitting he wouldn't say goodbye to the Scotsman when leaving the club.",
      "Speaking in 2012 to The Guardian, he said: \"I don't think I deserved such treatment at United – not playing in the last year. I went more than 10, probably 15, times to ask the coach if they need me.",
      "\"And every time I was told that I'm an important player and should not leave, but then again I was not in the team. Maybe I should've gone when he [Ferguson] left me out of the squad for the Champions League final [in 2011]. I know he's the boss, but he has lost, to some extent, my respect because of the way he treated me.\"",
      "Berbatov revealed the writing was on the wall for him at United after he was informed by Ferguson of his decision to change the team's style of play. \"He [Ferguson] tried to explain to me that the team will be using a more direct style, with more speed,\" he explained.",
      "\"But I've never been among the fastest players, I like to hold the ball, this is my style. I found it hard to accept his decision – I still have my dignity. I scored many goals, I won the league two times, and I was the league top scorer, so it's not bad.",
      "\"I'll have no problems playing against United as this already happened in my career. But there's no point to look back again. I said goodbye to the people, who deserve it. I couldn't say goodbye to Ferguson.\"",
      "Berbatov was 31 years old when signing for the Cottagers, but that didn't stop him from continuing to be one of England's most potent strikers as he scored 15 league goals in his debut campaign.",
      "He played just one more year in England before departing for Monaco. After two years in the Principality, he enjoyed short stints with PAOK and Kerala Blasters before retiring from football in 2018.",
      "Berbatov will surely be a keen viewer when United and Fulham clash at Craven Cottage on Sunday afternoon with kick-off set for 4.30pm.",

      "Andreas Pereira revealed he dodged a conversation with Erik ten Hag to force through his exit from Manchester United. The Brazilian, who now plays for Fulham, insisted it was the best decision of his career as he sought regular first-team football and a sense of being \"loved\" by fans.",
      "Pereira left for Fulham in 2022, with the London club snapping him up in a £8.6million (rising to £10m) deal. Ten Hag had only just arrived at Old Trafford, but after years of limited opportunities under previous managers, Pereira wasn't willing to wait and see if his fortunes would improve under the new boss.",
      "After three consecutive loan spells, Pereira saw Fulham - United's Premier League opponents this Sunday - offering him the stability he had been missing. It was an opportunity he felt he couldn't turn down.",
      "\"This was when I came back to England [after my loan],\" Pereira told United legend Rio Ferdinand on his Rio Ferdinand Presents show. \"Erik ten Hag, he worked at PSV when I was 16 years old.",
      "\"Before leaving for United, the [PSV] president and Erik ten Hag came to speak to me and my dad and said, 'Look everything is set up for you at PSV, if you stay here you're going to play in the first team'. But I'd just been to United and spoke with Fergie. I was like, 'I'm going to United'.",
      "\"That's why I didn't want to speak to Erik because I knew him and I knew that, at the time, it was always a conversation, like, 'Andreas, stay here. You're not going to play every game, maybe one game in every three, you'll be around the squad'. That's not what I wanted, I wanted to play.\"",
      "Pereira, 29, came through United's youth ranks after joining from PSV Eindhoven in 2011, making 75 appearances for the first team. However, his time at the club was marked by inconsistency and stints on the sidelines, with loan spells at Granada, Valencia, Lazio, and Flamengo limiting his opportunities under various managers.",
      "Upon returning from a successful period in Brazil with Flamengo in 2022, Pereira was determined to leave permanently. The decision wasn't easy, as Pereira admitted to second-guessing himself amid the prestige of staying at the Theatre of Dreams.",
      "\"Leaving United, you're like, 'Am I really going to do this? Am I sure?' In the end, you're never 100 per cent sure, really. Sometimes you think stay and have another go. Other times, you have to leave,\" he said.",
      "A key factor was his desire for consistent minutes, coupled with a yearning to reconnect with his Brazilian roots. He nearly joined Everton before opting for Flamengo on loan.",
      "\"I wanted to play, after COVID, I wanted to play. I was going crazy, wanting to play in the Premier League. I wanted to show that I was good enough, I was very close to joining [Everton] and suddenly my father called me and said, ‘Andreas, you never played in Brazil, you're Brazilian,'\" Pereira recalled.",
      "\"I wanted to play in Brazil and want to feel loved. I didn't feel the love that I thought I should get. I wanted to feel loved by my own people, play close to my family and enjoy football.\"",
      "Despite warnings from United staff that a move to Brazil might end his European career - \"Everyone at United said, 'You're crazy, you'll stay in Brazil, you'll never come back to Europe',\" - Pereira proved them wrong. He returned to the Premier League with Fulham, where he has flourished under Marco Silva.",
      "In 119 appearances, he has contributed 10 goals and 22 assists, becoming a midfield linchpin and even drawing interest from Chelsea, who eyed him as a replacement for Conor Gallagher in 2024. In three years at the West London club he's been left out of just eight Premier League games - with six of those due to an ankle injury in 2023.",
      "He was, however, an unused sub in Fulham's opening day draw with Brighton last weekend. The Cottagers snatched a point late on thanks to an injury-time equaliser scored by Rodrigo Muniz.",
      "Sunday's clash with United not only offers Pereira the chance to work his way back into the starting XI, but also to prove a point to his former club and demonstrate how far he's come. His bold choice to sidestep Ten Hag and seek a fresh start has paid dividends, transforming him from a United fringe player into a Premier League mainstay.",
      "As the two teams lock horns this evening, Pereira's story serves as a testament to the value of betting on oneself -even if it means leaving a giant like Manchester United behind.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Fulham opened their Premier League season with a 1-1 draw away at Brighton. Although Brighton edged the contest, Fulham will be satisfied to have come away with a point, thanks to Rodrigo Muniz’s stoppage-time equaliser.",
      "One of the biggest positives for Fulham was the standout performance of 18-year-old academy graduate Josh King. Given a surprise start in midfield, King impressed with his composure on the ball and relentless energy.",
      "For Fulham to push on this season, manager Marco Silva will need support, as the squad saw no new additions over the summer. While Fulham should have enough quality to avoid being dragged into a relegation fight, the lack of reinforcements could see them fall behind rivals who have strengthened.",
      "Manchester United, meanwhile, suffered a 0-1 defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford in their opener. Despite the result, much of the post-match reaction was positive for Ruben Amorim’s side, who dominated large spells of the match. New signings Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha both made promising debuts.",
      "However, United struggled to convert their dominance into goals, and there are growing calls for Benjamin Sesko to be given a starting role to add more attacking threat. While his inclusion could make a difference, it’s clear that United need more if they are to return to the top four.",
      "The match also highlighted United’s need for midfield reinforcements. Casemiro put in a solid shift, but Fernandes lacks the physical presence for a deeper role, and Manuel Ugarte has yet to justify his £60m price tag. With Kobbie Mainoo seemingly out of favour, new midfield signings are essential if United are to progress.",
      "Despite the opening defeat, United delivered a strong performance and will head into this fixture with confidence. Fans can expect a determined display as they look to get their season up and running.",

      "Louis Saha carved out a stellar Premier League career that spanned over a decade. But most of the Frenchman's billion-pound fortune has been accumulated with his boots hung up.",
      "Saha first arrived in England on loan with Newcastle United in 1999 and made his stay permanent when signing for Fulham from Metz one year later. He would leave Craven Cottage for Old Trafford in 2004, before swapping Manchester United for Everton in 2008.",
      "Time with Tottenham and Sunderland followed before a swansong season at Lazio, but it has been through his sporting company, AxisStars, that he has amassed a great deal of wealth. The firm, which tends to \"professional athletes and entertainers, their peers and trusted partners,\" has seen Saha's net worth soar to £4.3billion.",
      "After playing just 11 times for Newcastle during the 1998/99 Premier League season, Saha was snapped up by second-tier side Fulham in 2000 for a moderate £2.1m, but soon made that price tag look cheap.",
      "The Cottagers achieved promotion to the top flight that season, partly thanks to Saha's 27 league goals, which saw him named in the PFA Team of the Year. In the Premier League, he continued to find the back of the net, scoring eight, five, and 13 league goals in three campaigns for the London side.",
      "However, things soon turned noxious when the Frenchman sought a move to the Red Devils, who had already seen two bids for him rejected in January 2004. To try to force through a move, the then-25-year-old offered up a threatening ultimatum and dubbed Fulham \"not honest.\"",
      "\"The club say they would rather sell me in six months' time, but I am fed up now,\" Saha said back in 2004. \"Either I leave now, or I am staying at Fulham until the end of my contract, which finishes in 2006. If Fulham love me that much, they are going to have to cope with me until the end, and then I will leave them for zero euros.\"",
      "This rather unsavoury scene was soon resolved when Saha made a £12.8m move to Old Trafford less than two weeks later, being handed the No. 9 shirt that Andy Cole had last worn.",
      "\"I am absolutely delighted, it's a dream come true,\" said Saha after signing. \"I would like to thank my family and all the people who have helped me through this. I am just happy everything turned out. To leave a great atmosphere like Fulham has been difficult, but I am glad to be joining one of the best clubs in the world.\"",
      "Yet, with Wayne Rooney's arrival and the presence of Cristiano Ronaldo, Diego Forlan, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy in United's forward ranks, minutes were scarce for Saha in Manchester.",
      "Saha scored 42 goals in 124 appearances for the club from 2004 until 2008, when Everton signed him up to a 'pay-as-you-play' deal. He was plagued by injuries at Goodison Park but still found rich veins of form at times, even scoring in seven consecutive games during the 2009/2010 season.",

      "United still lost the game 1-0. But there is a new sense of optimism shared by both players and fans alike. And ahead of the trip to face Fulham at Craven Cottage, Amorim insisted: “I think you can see it (an improved physicality).",

      "Fulham's rising starlet Josh King admires Manchester United's summer transfer business - but he's hoping it will work against them today. The 18-year-old attacking midfielder, born in 2007, is like a new signing for Marco Silva given the Cottagers have spent just £500k this window on a backup goalkeeper in Benjamin Lecomte. Meanwhile, United have splashed around £196.5million on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon. However, King is hopeful United's new arrivals are still settling into their new surroundings, explaining: \"They've bought quite well, some big players, big names and it will be a really nice test for us. \"It's probably a good time to play against them. As a team, we've gelled quite well, obviously the team has stayed quite similar over the past one, two, three seasons. \"That might help us out when it comes to them, because they may not have gelled as well as we have. It'll be a good test, I definitely think we'll pull through.\"",
      "King is full of confidence after earning the man of the match award in last weekend's dramatic 1-1 draw at Brighton.",
      "Substitute Rodrigo Muniz struck the winner deep into stoppage time and there's now optimism the Brazilian will be staying put after Italian side Atalanta moved onto alternative targets. Talented teen King was overjoyed to learn he would be starting at the Amex and he's almost certain to keep his spot against United.",
      "He continued: \"When I found out I was starting, I was buzzing to be honest, I was really over the moon. I called my family - it was nice! The manager has put a lot of trust in me, I feel like I can play with freedom knowing that I've got his confidence behind me.",
      "\"It's quite a nice feeling to be able to just go out and express myself on the pitch. I definitely enjoyed it, it was a good matchup against [Carlos] Baleba. He's a good player, it was a good challenge.\"",
      "England U19 international King, who made his Premier League debut against Brighton last December, signed a bumper four-year contract extension earlier this summer.",
      "He is relishing the chance to learn from Silva and a string of experienced team-mates. King concluded: \"There's some really top players who I'm training with everyday, who I'm still trying to learn from and develop.",
      "\"People like Emile [Smith Rowe] and Andreas [Pereira], it's a really nice challenge to have. It pushes me on to be better, to be training and competing with players like that.\"",

      "Fernandes was pursued by Saudi club Al-Hilal earlier this summer and the Portuguese playmaker looked likely to join them until he performed a huge U-turn and opted to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "There is only about a week until the summer transfer window closes and Al-Ittihad are now trying their luck for the 30-year-old in a last-gasp attempt, according to the Sun.",
      "The meeting between Al-Itthiad and Fernandes is said to have been \"positive\", the report says, and the Middle East outfit are \"very keen\" to secure his signature.",
      "During the discussions, Fernandes is said to have asked Al-Ittihad for an eye-watering contract worth around £33million a year.",

      "Fernandes is seen as central to United's re-building project, but the club are in desperate need of balancing the books after splashing out £72m on Benjamin Sesko, £71m on Bryan Mbeumo and around £62m on Matheus Cunha. Young left-back Diego Leon also arrived for £7m.",

      "Arsenal icon Ian Wright has slammed the \"two-bob centre-forwards\" who laid into Viktor Gyokeres after the Swede drew a blank in the Gunners win over Manchester United. Gyokeres, 27, made a £63.7million move to the Emirates Stadium and now carries the hopes of Arsenal fans that he can fire them to the Premier League title after three consecutive second-placed finishes.",
      "However, Gyokeres was hooked after an hour at Old Trafford in Arsenal's 1-0 victory and failed to register a shot on target. It's unfamiliar territory for the Swede, who scored 97 goals in 102 games for Sporting CP.",
      "Arsenal's new forward naturally drew criticism from a section of pundits for his sub-par performance and in the days afterwards. Boss Mikel Arteta also claimed the striker has work to do to integrate with his new team-mates. However, speaking on Arsenal podcast, 'Arsecast', Wright fired back at Gyokeres' naysayers, and has fully backed the striker to succeed in north London.",
      "“What I would say to him, bro, embrace this,\" Wright said. \"Because I tell you, Viktor Gyokeres being part of Arsenal winning the title again after so many years, with the pressure he's under now, the discourse... the people I'm seeing, two-bob centre forwards on whatever it is – I won't mention where they are – talking about him like, yeah, he's a flat-track bully, whatever it is, it means f*** all, because he's where he wants to be.",
      "\"Now, it's up to him, go and get it. Just go and get it.\"",
      "Wright believes once Gyokeres' assimilates with the squad further, it will be a matter of when – and not if – that he discovers his scoring boots at Arsenal.",
      "Wright added: \"I think that obviously as a striker, and I've been there, and I'm going to Arsenal, in that first game, you'd probably want to show a little bit of what you're capable of – get a chance, half chance, maybe take it if you're fortunate.",
      "\"And even if you play like Viktor Gyokeres played against United, and he didn't really show much, if we're going to be totally honest, we saw good running into the channels, good strength and stuff like that.",
      "\"But in respect of what we're going to need, we didn't really see that. Now, that's a combination of him getting used to the team, the team getting used to him, and Man United causing us a lot of problems.",
      "\"Viktor Gyokeres has got to understand he's now at the place and, this is what I had to realise with Arsenal, he's now at the place where all that work, all that ignoring of him when he was scoring goals in different places thinking he's going to get the move, get the next move to get to where he wants to be. All that is done, because now he's at the place. So now it's on Viktor.\"",
      "On his own journey to Arsenal and how he dealt with the pressure of his own big switch, moving from Crystal Palace to Arsenal in 1991, Wright said: \"I've never felt so afraid and Viktor will be feeling the same. But then it's down to you to draw on that, the hard work, the ignoring of you, the fact that people don't think that you're as good as you think you are.",
      "\"And you've got to continue to do that in the dark. He's here, so it's now up to him to go out there and show what all that hard work is about.",
      "\"So I would say to him, even if he scored and got taken off, it'd still be for me something where he'd say, 'Well, I'm pleased I scored there, but like, okay, I could do better,' but the team weren't functioning as well. He's just got to go back into the headspace of what he does when his chances do come.\"",

      "United's interest in Lammens is also not motivated by a desire to offload one of their current goalkeeper. Altay Bayindir deputised for Andre Onana in last Sunday's loss to Arsenal, but his error ultimately proved crucial in the end result.",
      "Onana himself has not convinced during his two years in Manchester and there was talk this summer of him moving on, although he's determined to stay and prove himself once he returns to full fitness.",
      "Amorim, after Sunday's loss, maintained that he was happy with the options he had in between the sticks and any arrivals would not lead to another goalkeeper leaving Manchester with Onana, Bayindir and Tom Heaton currently available to him.",
      "The Portuguese boss said: \"It's not an idea that 'these players are going to leave and then we'll receive another player'. We don't know what is going to happen but we are not waiting to take out someone to bring another player [in].",
      "\"One thing is not responsible for the other. The players you're talking about are not players who are training with the group in this moment. We have a group training so it's not going to affect a lot.\"",
      "Gary Neville was among those to insist that his former club go into the market for a new goalkeeper. He maintained that it was an issue that would continue to haunt them and the lack of a dominant presence would hamper their backline.",
      "“I'm unequivocal on that because I had an experience with Man Utd for 20 years where there were two big periods of seven or eight years with Peter Schmeichel and Edwin van der Sar. In between, we had seven or eight goalkeepers in a six, seven, eight-year period and it is really unsettling when you haven't got a dominant No 1.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney condemned Alexander Isak's efforts to force a move away from Newcastle, over 10 years on from the England great's bid to facilitate a departure from Manchester United. The Sweden international has been embroiled in the most toxic saga of the summer transfer window as he attempts to leave the Premier League side after three years on Tyneside.",
      "Liverpool tabled a £110million bid for his services, which was swiftly rejected at the start of the month. And Isak has reportedly refused to ever play for the club again, despite having three years left on his contract.",
      "The 25-year-old broke his silence for the first time this summer earlier this week, where he accused the club's hierarchy of \"breaking promises\". Isak was absent from the matchday squad of the Magpies' league opener against Aston Villa, which they drew 0-0.",
      "With less than 10 days remaining in the window, it remains to be seen whether Isak – who has been training alone – will clinch his dream move to Anfield or whether Eddie Howe will manage to hold on to his star man. He is not expected to figure against Liverpool on Monday night.",
      "Plenty have had their say on Isak's behaviour in order to engineer a move away, with Rooney admitting if he was a team-mate of the Swede, he wouldn't welcome him back.",
      "While there is no evidence the Red Devils icon refused to train or play in the two instances he requested to leave Old Trafford, he stated there are correct ways to go about requesting an exit.",
      "\"If I'm a Newcastle player, I don't want Isak back,\" he said on the BBC's Wayne Rooney Show. \"I think if players leave football clubs – and that happens all the time – there's a way to go about it. You can't go on strike, can't not turn up for training and train with your team-mates.",
      "\"If you want to leave the club or not, you have to be there for your team-mates and be ready if needed. So I think if I was a player I wouldn't want him back. He's deserted you. He doesn't want to be there, he doesn't want to be your team-mate. So I wouldn't want him back.\"",
      "It was in 2010 when Rooney first submitted a transfer request to leave United but eventually opted to stay before signing a bumper five-year deal, as Ferguson ultimately turned a blind eye to the first saga where the player had wanted to join Chelsea.",
      "It was only three years later, in Sir Alex Ferguson's last season in charge, that Rooney once again asked to leave the club, with the Scotsman confirming the club had refused his transfer request.",
      "Ferguson admitted that was the reason Rooney was absent from his last home game in charge, which was a 2-1 win over Swansea. He said: \"I don't think Wayne was keen to play, simply because he has asked for a transfer.\"",
      "Once again, Rooney was convinced to stay, this time under David Moyes, as he penned a contract extension with the club in February 2014.",
      "Despite Rooney's claim that Isak can no longer make amends in the north east, he certainly was able to under both Ferguson and Moyes.",
      "Rooney added: \"Now, Newcastle aren't happy with Isak's behaviour because Liverpool want to sign him. But then on the flip side of that, Newcastle are trying to sign Yoane Wissa who's behaving the exact same way at Brentford.",
      "\"I remember Anthony Gordon not playing for Everton because he wanted to go to Newcastle. So you can't have it both ways. But in terms of Isak's team-mates, I wouldn't want him back. Once you've overstepped the mark I think it's very difficult to come back in.",
      "\"You can ask to leave a football club – that happens – or the club tell you you're leaving. But you have to be professional. You've got friends in there who you play with, you have fans who are paying a lot of money to support and you can't just walk out on it. And if they're going to do it once, they'll do it again.",
      "\"For me, I don't think there's any way back for Isak at Newcastle. I think there are cases where it can happen, but from me as a person, don't think I could accept them back.\"",
      "Newcastle will host Liverpool on Monday Night Football in their first home game of the season, which could prove to be an enthralling evening of action with plenty of emotions running high at St. James' Park.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United though need their potential buyers to cough up the appropriate sums if they are to sanction their departures. Old Trafford bosses are already prepared to take huge financial hits to get certain players off their books.",

      "\"So we try to arrange everything for both parts to be happy, so I have to try to imagine to have the training with the guys that I think are going to be the future and the other guys are training and preparing for the next chapter. When the window is closed, it’s a different history, when the window is closed, we have to receive the players and in a new life, anything can happen.\"",
      "United have been able to rid of Marcus Rashford, at least temporarily, with the forward heading out on his second successive loan spell. He will play out the year at Barcelona after it became apparent that his involvement was going to be limited under Amorim.",

      "Young defender Diego Leon has arrived but Amorim will hope for more experience at the back, while a central midfielder is also on his wishlist after walking away from a move for Brighton star Carlos Baleba.",
      "There are also a handful of players hoping to seal exits from Old Trafford before the window closes, including Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "Mirror Sport has rounded up all the major Manchester United news as the summer transfer window heads to a conclusion.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is another United player who faces an uncertain future and he is one player Amorim would be eager to offload to balance the books.",
      "United are listening to offers for Hojlund after struggling to impress since his £72m move from Atalanta in 2023, with just three goals in the Premier League last season.",
      "The arrival of Sesko has pushed him further down the pecking order and he wasn't involved in the squad to face Arsenal last week.",
      "Napoli have been one of the teams interested in Hojlund, but along with other teams in Italy keeping an eye on the Danish international, they were previously only keen on a loan deal.",
      "But the complexion of the move has now changed after Antonio Conte lost forward Romelu Lukaku to injury.",
      "With the Belgian now unavailable, reports from Italy state Napoli have made Hojlund their priority target and are willing to strike a deal that will see them include an obligation to buy into any loan deal.",
      "Clearing Hojlund off their wage bill would allow United to reinvest the money into a new midfielder after splashing £72m on Sesko.",
      "While United have just welcomed back Andre Onana from injury, Amorim is still unsure about the Cameroonian after some costly errors last season.",
      "Onana cost United £47.5m when he joined from Inter Milan in 2023 but he has failed to impress with some mixed displays that have not inspired confidence.",
      "United have been strongly linked with a new goalkeeper in this transfer window to provide more quality competition for Onana amid doubts over back-up Altay Bayindir too - after a howler against Arsenal.",
      "And according to the Sun, United are closing in on the signing of Royal Antwerp shot-stopper Senne Lammens, who has been highly rated for a number of seasons.",
      "Lammens has regularly been tipped for a move to Old Trafford after watching the 23-year-old turn into one of the most promising keepers in Europe and reports say personal terms have almost been agreed.",
      "The youngster has played 63 times for the Belgian side and featured 44 times last season.",
      "Another player United have been linked to often is Angelo Stiller, who plays for Stuttgart. Stiller would fit the bill of a solid and reliable central midfielder Amorim is looking for.",
      "The 24-year-old has impressed for Stuttgart in recent seasons and has been tipped for a move to a big club in the near future.",
      "Last season he started 31 times in the Bundesliga for his team, scoring once and assisting eight times to show his creative qualities.",
      "But while he has been earmarked as a player United are chasing, Sky in Germany have reported that rumours linking the player to Old Trafford are \"wide of the mark\".",
      "The report states there have been no discussions between United and Stuttgart and there are no plans to move for Stiller before deadline day.",

      "Supporters of the West London club will now pay an eye-watering £7.50 for a pint of lager at Craven Cottage, which is up 4% on last year’s price of £7.20. London rivals Arsenal are runners-up in the lager league - as they have been in the Premier League for the past three seasons - charging £7.20 for a pint of Asahi.",

Arsenal have topped the table for most expensive pie. Fans will pay £8.85 for a ‘pie on its own with gravy,’ the most expensive in the Premier League, compared to £6.75 last season, a whopping 24% price hike.",

      "Fans will have to fork out £6 for a pie in their new home - compared to £3.90 last season. Consumer expert Scott Dixon, said: ”Premier League clubs are pricing out the next generation of fans. Hiking lager and pie prices by 50% during a cost-of-living crisis is tone-deaf and indefensible.",
      "“These mark-ups are less about necessity and more about blatant greed. This isn’t about inflation. It’s about clubs testing how far they can push fan loyalty. It’s time for clubs to reward loyalty and stop seeing their fans as cash cows to rip off at every opportunity.”",
      "Premier League clubs point out that they offer early bird discounts and bundle offers on food and drinks. Last season, Fulham had pre-game and post-game offers for every match. For this Sunday’s game against manchester-united-fc>Manchester United, the club are set to offer fans pints for £5 before and after the game.",

      "The Cottagers will be eager to improve on their league performance having missed out on Europe last minute but with only one summer signing in the form of a second-choice goalkeeper, it will be difficult to achieve this feat. It must be incredibly frustrating for Marco Silva who has seen his side showed constant signs of improvements but has not been backed appropriately in the market in comparison to his competitors - including Ruben Amorim.",

It remains unchanged on the injury front for the visitors: last season’s match‑winner at the Cottage, Martínez (knee), and Noussair Mazraoui (hamstring) are still sidelined, while Amorim otherwise has a full squad to choose from.",
      "Marco Silva’s concerns also sit at left‑back. Ryan Sessegnon (unspecified) and Antonee Robinson (knee) missed the trip to Brighton, but neither has been ruled out of Sunday. Even so, Calvin Bassey remains the likeliest option to patrol the left of the defence if late tests do not clear the senior duo.",
      "Raúl Jiménez faces pressure after Rodrigo Muniz’s South Coast heroics. Up the pitch, Silva has a genuine dilemma at number 10. Josh King offers direct running, Emile Smith Rowe brings craft between the lines, and former United midfielder Andreas Pereira provides set‑piece quality and an understanding of the stage.

Ruben Amorim and his staff will have liked the look of the numbers on the analysts' laptops.",

      "United were fitter in pre-season, the 3-4-2-1 system looks fluid when it was once rigid, they displayed tactical innovation against Arsenal and were creative. New recruits Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo had their best goalscoring opportunities.",
      "Amorim knows he will be judged on wins and they remain hard to come by. United have won only seven times in the Premier League since Amorim stood in the dugout at Portman Road on November 24 and he has incurred 15 defeats in 28 league games.",
      "\"In the end, we cannot control the results,\" Amorim protested. \"We need to try to see the game in the small things that we can do better, we need to work during the week and we need to score goals.",
      "\"Every game has its history. Sometimes we are not going to play so well, like we did in the last game, but the consistency of the movements, the intensity, the opportunities, the runs in behind, all these small things, we need to be consistent.",
      "\"If you look at the last games - pre-season is pre-season - but the pre-season, in the first game of the league we are maintaining more or less the level. I think you can see when we are playing we are more confident.",
      "\"I feel the team is more free playing the game and that is something I watched during all the games since we start the season. That is a good thing.",
      "\"But every week is a test and we need to be there. But, in the end, the result we cannot control. But we need to do everything to win the games. But we need to be consistent in the small things and important things.\"",
      "United won the Premier League Summer Series with two impressive wins against West Ham United and Bournemouth before a 2-2 draw with Everton. That fuelled the confidence in a happy camp whose harmony was protected by the omission of the 'bomb squad' members, with five of them still on the club's books.",
      "Both of United's wins in the United States came with Rasmus Hojlund in the starting XI. In the three matches since, United have started without an out-and-out striker and none of their starters have scored from open play. Benjamin Sesko has to make his full debut at Craven Cottage.",
      "\"Maybe when you have a good performance, even in pre-season, you get confidence,\" Amorim opined, \"then you have more time to train, you have more time to understand the way we play, you don’t need to think all the time, 'what do I do in these situations?' It’s already in their minds.",
      "\"It’s a lot of things and hard to pinpoint one reason.\"",
      "Fulham are one of only two teams that lost both of their league fixtures against United last season. Winning regularly would be a more welcome new normal at United.",

      "United lost 1-0 against Arsenal in their opening game of the new Premier League campaign, but there were positives to take and Arsenal were fortunate to claim the three points.",
      "Ruben Amorim is hoping his side can get off the mark against Fulham today. United won home and away fixtures against Fulham in the top flight last season and need another victory at Craven Cottage.",
      "Regarding the team news, Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui are the only unavailable players.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up:",
      "United have an easy choice to make in goal: play the first choice. Altay Bayindir would be lucky to make the bench at Craven Cottage.",
      "Luke Shaw was fine against Arsenal but it is a point of principle to take him out of the team and recall Harry Maguire. Amorim won't do it but Maguire was one of United's best players last season and has been for the past two years.",
      "Manuel Ugarte did nothing to earn a place in the starting XI last week but United cannot go on with Casemiro. They need to try and make it work with the defensive midfielder they shelled out up to £50.75m for last year.",
      "Amad and Benjamin Sesko would make a promising attack even better.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "United performed well against Arsenal and did not deserve to lose, so I would make just three changes to take on Fulham. The first would be replacing Bayindir with Onana. Bayindir was at fault for Arsenal's goal last weekend, and it says something when fans are desperate for Onana to return.",
      "Dalot was preferred to start at right wing-back, but I would start Amad at Craven Cottage. Amad was bright from the bench against Arsenal and should be rewarded with a start.",
      "Finally, Sesko must start down the middle after making a cameo from the bench.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Barely a week remains of the summer transfer window, and United are still due to be active in the market. Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Matheus Cunha are the four who have arrived thus far, with Enzo Kana-Biyik also joining from Le Havre as a free agent before being loaned out to Lausanne-Sport.",
      "Senne Lammens seems set to become the sixth as their interest in the Belgium youth international is accelerating. United have not entirely ruled out signing a new goalkeeper before the close of business on transfer deadline day, but are not planning to acquire a headline number one.",
      "They explored the possibility of signing Emiliano Martinez on loan from Aston Villa. The club, though, have scoffed at suggestions that they could make a move for Paris Saint-Germain player Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "The MEN also reported in June that the expectation was for Andre Onana to stay. Onana is in the 21-player travelling squad for today's match against Fulham and is under consideration to start at Craven Cottage, which well-placed sources suggested would \"kill\" the confidence of Altay Bayindir.",
      "Being dropped before the signing of Lammens could see the Turkey international depart - United also have Tom Heaton as a backup option, who signed a new one-year contract this summer. As for other outgoings, after months of waiting, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund are all expected to leave within the next week.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma has reportedly agreed on personal terms with Manchester City.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims the goalkeeper is keen on working with Pep Guardiola and that negotiations with Paris Saint-Germain are underway. Man United are another club credited with an interest in Donnarumma, but scoffed at suggestions of signing the player.",
      "An Old Trafford insider has said to the Mirror:",
      "Of course, it's not ideal to have senior players training away from the first-team group, but until offers are received that meet our valuations, then the situation remains the same. Some clubs might feel that we will be happy to do business at any price but that isn't the case.",
      "The manager has said he will look to reintroduce any or all of them back to the squad if they are still United players when the window closes. Situations like these tend to be resolved late in the day.",
      "Real Betis are reportedly planning on making another approach to re-sign Antony on Monday.",
      "The Daily Mail claims that the winger prefers a return to Spain over interest from Fenerbahce and hopes that La Liga club can make progress in their bid to bring him back to Seville this summer.",
      "Senne Lammens will reportedly not play for Royal Antwerp today against KV Mechelen at lunchtime.",
      "Belgian football journalist David Van den Broeck claims the Belgian club have decided to keep Lammens on the sidelines, barring a last-minute change, as a transfer to Manchester United is reputedly close for the goalkeeper.",
      "Talks remain ongoing between Man United and Royal Antwerp for Senne Lammens.",
      "Taking to X, Fabrizio Romano wrote: \"Manchester United are proceeding in talks to get Lammens deal done. It follows exclusive update on Friday on talks underway and agreement with the goalkeeper.",
      "\"Royal Antwerp want €25m, talks ongoing around €20m w/add-ons. Deal currently not linked to Onana’s future.\"",
      "When the Manchester United teamsheet dropped at 3.15pm on Sunday, a fair few jaws dropped with it.",
      "The decision not to start with an out-and-out striker, with Mason Mount asked to provide a focal point for United's new-look attack, instantly looked dubious. But with Benjamin Sesko still settling in and Ruben Amorim experimenting with a false nine in pre-season, it wasn't really a shock.",
      "The third contentious call was in midfield, but with Casemiro having started United's biggest game in decades just months earlier and Manuel Ugarte failing to impress on a consistent basis in pre-season, a lot of fans saw it coming.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Man United reportedly look set to win the race for young goalkeeper Senne Lammens despite a bid from Galatasaray.",
      "Lammens is understood to favour a move to Old Trafford, despite strong interest from Galatasaray, Inter Milan, and Lille. United will now aim to finalise an agreement with the player, though Turkish giants Galatasaray submitted a late bid on Saturday night in an attempt to hijack the deal for the 6ft 3in goalkeeper.",
      "The Mirror reports that Lammens is expected to sign a five-year deal.",
      "According to journalist Han June, Man United are closely monitoring PSG's Kang-in Lee.",
      "Taking to X, he wrote: \"PSG have set a huge €40–50m price tag on Kang-in Lee, making a summer move extremely difficult. Arsenal made contact but have since signed Eberechi Eze and stepped back.",
      "\"Manchester United remain closely monitoring. PSG see Lee as a key rotational player — only an exceptional bid will change their stance.\"",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, reports of Man City’s interest in Lammens are wide of the mark.",
      "Speaking on his YouTube channel, he said: \"Man City have been linked with a move for Lammens. Guys I’m not aware of that, Man City never moved for Lammens.",
      "\"Why? Because Man City want to go for Donnarumma. City want to sign Donnarumma IF Ederson goes to Galatasaray. The negotiations between Man Utd and Royal Antwerp for Senne Lammens are advancing very well.",
      "\"Very good negotiations, the package requested is €20m. There is a negotiation ongoing on deal structure and fee, still not a done deal between the clubs. It’s agreed with the player because Lammens already said yes to Manchester United. The arrival of Lammens – if it happens – doesn’t mean that Andre Onana is going to leave Man Utd.\"",
      "AS Roma director Frederic Massara confirms that nothing has changed since Monday following Jadon Sancho’s decision to turn down a move.",
      "He said: \"Sancho is a strong player who has been linked to all the big Italian teams. At the moment, he remains a suggestion because I don't think the conditions, especially the motivation, are there to pursue this negotiation.\"",
      "Fernandes is reportedly drawing interest from Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad - and his potential exit could provide a significant boost for Man United when it comes to their transfer kitty.",
      "The Sun reported Al-Ittihad have held discussions with Fernandes' representatives - and they were described as positive. The midfielder is said to be 'open' to the move - and is understood to have requested a contract worth approximately £33million-a-year. Although that doesn't necessarily mean their captain, Fernandes, will be leaving - a potential departure would, of course, provide them with a significant financial boost, freeing up funds that could be reinvested into their squad or used to secure high-profile targets.",
      "On Baleba, the club's hierarchy have opted to wait (at least) another year before trying to get a deal over the line. Brighton & Hove Albion have valued the 21-year-old in excess of £100million and are adamant Baleba is not for sale.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Manchester City are reportedly eyeing a move to hijack Man United's pursuit of Lammens.",
      "The Reds have been negotiating with Royal Antwerp over the goalkeeper, with personal terms already agreed. In a surprising development, Sacha Tavolieri claims that City are now considering signing the Belgian shot-stopper as a potential replacement for Ederson.",
      "Previously, Gianluigi Donnarumma had been City's primary target in goal, but Paris Saint-Germain’s valuation of the Italian is considered ‘too steep’.",
      "Man United face Fulham on Sunday in their first Premier League away match of the campaign.",

      "Fabrizio Romano claims more positive talks were held between Man United and Napoli.",
      "Taking to X, he wrote: \"Understand Napoli are now advancing in talks to sign Rasmus Hojlund. Positive talks today with Hojlund and his camp about contract terms and project for long term.",
      "\"Manchester United are informed about talks and ready to get deal done if Højlund and Napoli agree on terms.\"",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes understand that United are eyeing up a move for Sevilla midfielder Agoume.",
      "After deciding against pursuing a move for Carlos Baleba, United could still sign a new midfielder before the September 1 deadline. The report suggests that Agoume could be available for a fee ranging from £21.7m to £30.4m.",
      "According to reports, United have set their sights on Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller.",
      "It's suggested that Stiller has a £31.5 million release clause, but it only becomes active in 2026, meaning United would likely need to pay a premium to secure him immediately.",
      "The Mail understands that Onana is expected to stay at Man United despite speculation the club may move for Senne Lammens.",
      "\"Onana is ready to play like last week so we will see in the game who is going to be the goalkeeper,\" Amorim said in his press-conference.",
      "The report claims that both United and Onana anticipate he will stay beyond the transfer window, which closes a week on Monday, despite Monaco having been quoted £30million earlier in the summer and the possibility of renewed interest from his former club Inter Milan.",
      "Meanwhile, Lammens is thought to be seen as a long-term option in goal and is expected to challenge Onana, whose future has been uncertain following a string of inconsistent displays last season.",
      "Donnarumma fought back tears as he bid farewell to the PSG fans amid links to Man United.",
      "The Parisian giants began their Ligue 1 title defence on Friday evening, hosting Angers at the Parc des Princes. After the final whistle, Donnarumma, who was not included in the matchday squad, was given the opportunity to bid farewell to the fans.",
      "Donnarumma was soon joined by his teammates, who also showed him their affection. The Italian made his way toward the fans, climbed over the advertising boards, and continued applauding them.",
      "He announced he was leaving PSG earlier this summer in an emotional statement: \"To the special Paris fans, from the first day I arrived, I gave everything – on and off the pitch – to earn my place and defend the goal of Paris Saint-Germain. Unfortunately, someone has decided that I can no longer be part of the group and contribute to the team’s success. I am disappointed and disheartened. I hope to have the opportunity to look the fans at the Parc des Princes in the eyes one more time and say goodbye as it should be done.",
      "\"If that doesn’t happen, I want you to know that your support and affection mean the world to me, and I will never forget it. I will always carry with me the memory of all the emotions, the magical nights, and of you, who made me feel at home. To my teammates – my second family – thank you for every battle, every laugh, every moment we shared. You will always be my brothers. Playing for this club and living in this city has been an immense honour. Thank you, Paris.\"",
      "It remains to be seen whether United will make an approach for the 26-year-old amid their interest in Senne Lammens.",
      "Man United could be a line for a small transfer windfall as Andreas Pereira reportedly gets set to leave Fulham in the final week of the transfer window.",
      "That's because United negotiated a sell-on clause when they agreed to sell the midfielder to Fulham in 2021 for a deal worth up to £10m. The Brazilian spent 11 years at United and, despite only making 45 Premier League appearances for the club, the clause negotiated by United's transfer chiefs means they would be entitled to 20% of any profit Fulham make on the midfielder.",
      "Of course, whether Fulham would be able to demand in excess of £10m for a 29-year-old with less than 12 months remaining on his deal remains to be seen. Asked about Fulham's dealings in the transfer market last week, manager Marko Silva said the club had been too \"passive\".",
      "\"It's not an ideal scenario,\" said Silva. I didn't expect us to be this passive. I knew what I wanted and the plan was there but it hasn't happened. Right now we need to reinforce. In some positions we are very short.",
      "\"Did I expect it? Of course not, but the market is the market.\"",
      "Reports in Italy claim AC Milan tried to sign Rasmus Hojlund this summer.",
      "It's said that technical director Igli Tare 'even held talks' with the Reds in England. However, it's now Napoli who are closing in on a move for the 22-year-old.",
      "Gazzetta reports that the Italian champions are pressing ahead by increasing the salary to €4.5m (£4m) net per year, aiming to convince Hojlund to agree to a loan deal with an option to buy rather than an obligation.",
      "They state: \"Napoli reiterated to Hojlund that they consider him crucial this season, where there will be games every three days between the league and the Champions League, to defend the Scudetto and play a leading role in Europe. And a showcase like this, come what may, can’t be ignored.\"",
      "This is not the first time that Fernandes has been linked with a move away from United this summer.",
      "The midfielder has already turned down a chance to join Al-Hilal, with him rejecting the club before formal contact was made with United.",
      "There has also been links with Al Nassr this summer, with those not going anywhere.",
      "United will hope that it's the same outcome the third time in a row.",
      "Roma seem to be moving on from a possible move for Jadon Sancho, with the player reportedly turning down a move to the Italian side.",
      "Gianluca Di Marzio has given the latest, saying:",
      "“Roma are considering the idea of Elmas to strengthen the wingers.",
      "“Given the difficulties in the negotiation for Jadon Sancho, who has not yet given the green light, the Giallorossi are sounding out other solutions.”",
      "Manchester United could still find room to make a few more additions in the closing days of the summer transfer window. Ruben Amorim faces tough and key decisions in the final moments of the market before it slams shut at the beginning of September.",
      "There are questions surrounding the goalkeeping position after Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have been guilty of high-profile errors, reports suggest that talks are progressing for Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens while Gianluigi Donnarumma has also been mooted. After the arrival of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, there is room for United to offload players.",
      "And there are those within the 'bomb squad' who have yet to leave the club, after expressing their desire to explore options.",
      "READ MORE HERE",
      "Ruben Amorim has said that the arrivals of Matheu Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko can help the team both on and off the pitch this season.",
      "\"We have different options this year, but sometimes football is more than just on the pitch.",
      "\"They [Mbeumo and Cunha] are coming in at a moment where the spirit is different, the place is different - sometimes we have a lot of very good players but the scars were there and that influenced the dynamic of the team.",
      "\"They can help us, not just on the pitch but off the pitch too, I feel the guys are more free because they were not here in the very, very difficult moments - they are seeing a different thing.\"",
      "There is again more reports over the future of Unied captain Bruno Fernandes with Al-Ittihad linked with an interest in the midfielder.",
      "Journalist Kostas Lianos reports that a positive meeting has taken place between Fernandes and the Saudi club.",
      "It is added that the United captain is 'open to the move'.",
      "Manchester United have said 'yes' to Napoli's offer of a loan with an option to buy from Napoli for Rasmus Hojlund, but the player himself still needs convincing, according to reports in Italy.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport say that there are daily meeting between the clubs, and United have agreed to the deal.",
      "The decision is now down to Hojlund himself, with Napoli trying to use Champions League football to convince the player to make the move.",
      "Manchester United could be in line for a financial boost with an expectation that Andreas Pereira will leave Fulham this summer.",
      "The Times' Peter Rutzler reports that while Fulham are yet to accept a bid for the player, there is interest from Brazil in the former United man.",
      "As part of the transfer to Fulham, United hav a 20% sell-on clause, meaning that they will be in line for some money if Fulham do sell this summer.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva has sent a wartning to his team ahead of facing United in the Premier League tomorrow.",
      "Speaking at his pre-match press conference, he said:",
      "“We are playing against a great side.",

      "Manchester United are hoping to get off the mark in the Premier League this weekend.",
      "United suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to Arsenal in their opening game of the new league campaign at Old Trafford and they are looking to bounce back against Fulham at Craven Cottage.",
      "Ruben Amorim made a handful of contentious selection decisions against Arsenal and it will be fascinating to see his starting team. Benjamin Sesko was named on the bench against Arsenal and could make his full debut.",
      "Fulham drew 1-1 with Brighton last weekend after a last-gasp equaliser in added time.",
      "Here are the five things to look out for at Craven Cottage...",
      "Benjamin Sesko should be in line to make his full debut against Fulham. The Slovenian international was introduced from the bench in the second half against Arsenal, which made it difficult for him to impose himself.",
      "It was impossible to gauge anything from Sesko's cameo and fans will be desperate to see him from the start. The front line was fluid and slick in the first half last weekend, but it's a no-brainer to start Sesko.",
      "United's biggest weakness was their inability to score goals last season. The Reds notched just 44 goals in the Premier League and Sesko has been signed in a £73.7million deal to fix that.",
      "It would be strange to start Sesko on the bench again. Amorim may feel Mason Mount combined well with his teammates against Arsenal, but United did not score and they need a striker on the pitch.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund might be left at home again. Hojlund was dropped from the squad for the opening game of the season and he watched the contest from the directors' box at Old Trafford.",
      "Journalists will be waiting for the United team bus to arrive to confirm whether Hojlund has travelled before the team news is announced. It seems likely he could be omitted from the squad again.",
      "It feels harsh to drop Hojlund from the squad altogether - he has not worked his ticket - but Amorim seems to have marked his card and decided he needs to leave before the transfer deadline.",
      "The unwanted statistics have stacked up across the last two seasons, but United could create some positive club history when they take on Fulham because their record at Craven Cottage is impressive.",
      "Since drawing 2-2 with Fulham away from home in August 2010, United have won every visit to Craven Cottage in the Premier League, racking up a sequence of eight wins in London.",
      "Another win at Craven Cottage would set a new club record of successive wins at a venue.",
      "Craven Cottage should also be a happy hunting ground for United forward Matheus Cunha, who had a strong record against the London club during his two-and-a-half years with Wolves.",
      "Cunha has recorded four goal involvements in the last three Premier League games against Fulham, which includes two goals and assist in a comfortable 4-1 win for Wolves at Craven Cottage last season.",
      "That defeat represented Fulham's heaviest defeat of the 2024/2025 campaign. Marco Silva will be aware of the threat Cunha will pose, but will his players be able to stop the Brazilian?",
      "Ineos' headquarters are based in Knightsbridge, London, which is just a 20-minute drive away from Craven Cottage. That explains why Sir Jim Ratcliffe attended last season's game away at Fulham and why he might show his face again.",
      "Ratcliffe was approached by angry supporters after United's 1-0 win against Fulham in January. Lisandro Martinez scored a late match-winner, but fans conveyed their anger about the rise of ticket prices.",
      "The British billionaire was confronted as he sat in his car outside the stadium. Ratcliffe wound his car window down before he appeared to say: \"Get your photograph.\"",
      "\"66 quid, you're taking the p***. You're worse than the Glazers, sort it out,\" a fan replied.",
      "Another fan said during the heated exchange: \"66 f****** quid, mate. What are you doing mate? We're northerners, come on, mate. Our prices should be a third of Fulham's.\"",
      "United fans are still annoyed about ticket prices, but Amorim has been backed in the summer transfer window and it's unlikely Ratcliffe would face similar hostility this weekend.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United go in search of their first win of the season when they travel to Fulham on Sunday.",
      "United were beaten 1-0 by Arsenal on the opening weekend of the season but largely looked much improved compared to last season.",
      "The front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko could be seen from the start together for the first time this weekend after all three players featured against the Gunners.",
      "And while a number of leading Premier League pundits have offered mixed predictions for this weekend's trip to west London, it is clear all three summer signings have already made a positive impression.",
      "Here is a round-up of how the pundits see United faring at Craven Cottage.",
      "\"Like a lot of people, I try to be balanced about Manchester United,\" Sutton told BBC Sport. \"They lost last week but I do think they will be better this season. Well, they can't be any worse.",
      "\"I really like Bryan Mbeumo and I especially like Matheus Cunha, I think he's got loads going for him. Fulham were fortunate to get something against Brighton but I think they'll improve in front of their own fans.",
      "\"Fulham don't play with any fear and will take the game to Manchester United which gives me a sneaking feeling United will exploit them and win this one.",
      "\"But then again I always predict Manchester United games wrong. I want to be positive about them but I'm not sure I can be. Plus, I think I predicted Fulham wrong for every one of their matches last season.",
      "\"I'm leaning towards a Manchester United win so, because of that, I'll go for a draw.\"",
      "Sutton's prediction: Fulham 1-1 Manchester United",
      "The former Tottenham boss told football betting site BetVictor: \"United lost, but there was definitely more positives than negatives against Arsenal.",
      "\"On another day, they might even have won that game. The new lads looked good and I think we can see what Amorim is trying to build here, but that defence remains an issue.",
      "\"Will Sesko get his first start here? He went with Cunha the other day and I think Sesko will be in from the start. You saw glimpses the other day of what a handful this boy could be.\"",
      "Redknapp's prediction: Fulham 1-2 Manchester United",
      "\"I don't think Manchester United were as great as some people say. It looks like their new signings might take time to get used to each other and they still lack a killer instinct in front of goal.",
      "\"Matheus Cunha showed some spark, but there was a moment when he beat three players and could only muster a weak attempt. That is the problem if you ask me. Fulham will not offer the kind of space that Arsenal gave lavishly for him to operate. I actually don't think there will be a lot to separate these two teams on the table at the end of the season.",
      "\"I was impressed by Matthijs de Ligt, I thought he was solid. It was almost the perfect battle for him against Gyokeres. But Manchester United still ended up losing the game. Not sure if they are okay with playing better and losing, especially considering their situation now. I think this will be a draw.\"",

      "As much as Manchester United's opening day display against Arsenal offered plenty of positives for the season ahead, there was a very familiar feel to game for United: no goals and no points.",
      "Positive performances are all well and good, but Ruben Amorim knows he can't afford for his side to start the season slowly and so a win against Fulham this weekend is badly needed.",
      "Andre Onana was not named in the matchday squad for the opening day defeat, but he absolutely should be brought back into the team in the wake of Altay Bayindir's awful error which cost United on Sunday.",
      "The back three performed well last weekend and so there is no reason for Amorim to twist in that department, meaning Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw start.",
      "United looked far more dangerous down the right-hand side when Amad entered the game on Sunday and so he should start at right wing-back, with Patrick Dorgu on the opposite flank.",
      "Bruno Fernandes can start in midfield but Casemiro simply cannot cope with the pace of Premier League football, meaning he should come out of the team. Options for his replacement are limited at best, so Manuel Ugarte comes into the side.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha looked very bright in the No.10 roles on Sunday and they must start behind the striker. Mason Mount didn't offer United a focal point against the Gunners, unsurprisingly. Benjamin Sesko will take time to adapt to life in a new country and a new league but needs must and he has to start at Craven Cottage.",

      "Manchester United's interest in the Royal Antwerp goalkeeper is accelerating amid the prospect of bringing the Belgian in to challenge Andre Onana for the number one spot.",
      "The spotlight is often thrust on Old Trafford keepers and last week it shone brightly on Bayindir. Ruben Amorim showed faith in the 27-year-old to hand him the gloves against Arsenal but he flapped badly at an early corner and Riccardo Calafiori headed in what proved to be the only goal of the game.",
      "Amorim defender the Turkey international after the match but deep down the boss must know his number two isn't up to task. With uncertainty over Onana's long-term spot as first choice keeper and the dependable if overlooked Tom Heaton approaching 40, there will need to be a reshaping of the goalkeeping department.",
      "Lammens, a 23-year-old who has caught the eye in his homeland, could be the first piece in the jigsaw. Since moving to Antwerp from Club Brugge he has caught the eye, earned international recognition and been linked with a number of top clubs.",
      "United could make a move for the €20million rated keeper and he would bring a calmness and confidence that Onana and Bayndir have failed to offer.",
      "\"As a goalkeeper you have to stay calm to instil confidence in your defenders and the rest of the team,\" Lammens said in a 2024 interview with Het Nieuwsblad.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"You're not supposed to be stressed out between the posts. As a youth player, that happened to me sometimes, but in recent years, it hasn't bothered me at all.",
      "\"They always say that I stay level emotionally. That I'm stable and never go up or down too quickly. I'm happy about that, by the way. I think that's a good quality for a goalkeeper.\"",
      "It's a quality United have lacked in recent years. The prospect of a calm keeper providing a foundation at the back and a confidence in his team-mates would offer the Reds a cornerstone on which to build.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson once said a great goalkeeper could be worth 15 points a season. This United are in no position to turn down a chance to improve their tally as they seek to challenge the top six following a dismal 2024-25 campaign.",
      "Lammens is far from the finished article but is a decent distributor - something that United sought out when signing Onana - while the Belgian is a commanding presence in his penalty area and a capable shot stopper.",
      "According to Opta Analyst, Senne Lammens prevented 17.4 goals from being scored in the Belgian Pro League in 2024-25.",
      "And he's ready for the next step. When he left Brugge in 2023 he spoke about being in his comfort zone and needing a change of scenery. He had to wait for his breakthrough at Antwerp but grasped it with both hands and went from strength to strength. Now he's eyeing a top European league.",
      "When asked in late July if he was ready to make a move amid United's interest, he said: \"Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes. But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here [grins]. In any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.",
      "“I certainly have enough confidence in myself. I think the most important thing is that my future team, whenever they arrive, has a plan in place.",
      "“Ideally, that means playing immediately, but it’s also possible I’ll have to take a step in between. As long as there’s a plan, it doesn’t matter whether I’m ready for the next step or not. Everyone has their own career, their own path. Even if I don’t take the right step right away, I’ll get there.”",
      "Lammens next step could be at Old Trafford, it would cap quite the journey for a player who struggled to make the breakthrough at Brugge despite being highly rated coming through the ranks and being named in a Champions League matchday squad at just 16.",
      "He even scored from a corner in a Youth League game against Real Madrid as a teenager in 2019. United will simply settle for him stopping set pieces at the other end.",

      "Luke Shaw made an appearance in each of Manchester United's pre-season games.",
      "Shaw made three starts and came on from the bench twice across the summer schedule, so it was no surprise to see him start against Arsenal, especially with Lisandro Martinez unavailable.",
      "The 30-year-old jumped into a rash challenge early in the first half but recovered well. Shaw delivered a strong performance, keeping Bukayo Saka quiet, and reminded fans of what he can do when fit.",
      "The truth is that nobody has ever doubted Shaw's quality. He was even the best left-back in the world in 2020/21 (that sounds absurd, but look back at the other left-backs from that season and you'll agree).",
      "The only problem with Shaw is his United career has been plagued by injuries, some of which are due to his lack of robustness, some of which have been the club's fault, and others that have just been unfortunate.",
      "Shaw suffered a double leg fracture in 2015 and his muscle injuries were mishandled in 2023/2024, with United expecting him to play two games in the space of a few days after returning.",
      "Referring to that season, Shaw said: “I felt something against Aston Villa and came off at half-time. It’s kind of ­everyone’s fault. Partly my fault, partly medical staff, I think everyone would admit that.",
      "\"I didn’t train the whole week. The scan came back and there wasn’t too much there. But I didn’t train all week, then trained the day before the game. If the manager asks me to play, I’m never going to say no. I shouldn’t have played.”",
      "You don't need a degree in medical science to work out Shaw shouldn't have been playing two games in the space of four days, immediately after recovering from a muscle issue.",
      "Having said that, Shaw is not a robust athlete and can be fairly scrutinised for missing so much time on the pitch. The positive news is United are competing in just the Premier League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup this season, which means Shaw should be able to cope with the fixture load.",
      "United's defeat against Tottenham in the Europa League final meant there would be no European football at Old Trafford, and that is good news for Shaw's chances of maintaining fitness.",
      "If Shaw is available, it seems he will be a regular starter on the left of the back-three. Martinez is due to return from a knee injury, but he might find it hard to wrestle back the starting role from Shaw.",
      "Amorim rates Shaw highly and he discussed the left-back and Mason Mount at his press conference on Friday. \"More important [than England] is for them to help Manchester United to reach our goals,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Then they are very, very good players, they are experienced and have played a lot of matches. Mason Mount won the Champions League, and Luke Shaw, I've already said, when he's fit, is really a special player and you can see it every time he plays. So it's really important for us to have these two guys available for more games.\"",
      "Shaw will compete with Martinez and Ayden Heaven for the left side role in the back-three, but he has the advantage of starting the new campaign in that position, so something must give for him to lose it.",
      "That could be Shaw picking up an injury and performing poorly. However, on the evidence shown against Arsenal, Shaw will be confident of retaining his role, providing he's able to stay fit.",
      "It was interesting to hear Amorim describe Shaw as a \"special\" player. That was high praise from United's head coach, but Shaw's quality has been rarely seen over the last few seasons.",
      "Shaw needs to remind everyone why he is a special talent consistently each week.",

      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko have all arrived as first-team players at United from Wolves, Brentford and RB Leipzig respectively. Diego Leon has also came into Amorim's squad after his move from Paraguay was finalised.",
      "However, after their worst season in 51 years, the Reds still could do with further recruits. Reports this week have indicated that a new goalkeeper could come in with Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens the subject of advanced interest.",
      "With United's forward line significantly bolstered, United are in a better position to seek success this season. However, some positions remain untouched and prove to be a problem.",
      "With that in mind, MEN Sport takes a look at how an alternative transfer window may have transpired for United had things gone differently...",
      "As mentioned above, United have been busy this summer and their attack shows that. However, it is only their attack that is proof of their activity and other positions remain lacking quality.",
      "So many players have been linked with a move to Old Trafford, enough to make a brand new team. Let's start with the forward line and in an alternative word, United would be lining-up differently.",
      "Before Sesko arrived, the likes of Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen, Liam Delap and Dusan Vlahovic were all linked. Different people had their preference but Osimhen, from the outside, looked the perfect fit.",
      "A consistent finisher who had constantly admitted his ambition to play in the Premier League, Osimhen would have been the powerful, efficient striker United had been lacking last season.",
      "Behind him, is Mbeumo and Cunha. They are both exactly what United need. But in midfield, an alternative transfer window would have seen Ederson come in to be the dream partner to Bruno Fernandes.",
      "United are yet to add a new face in the middle of the park but the Atalanta star’s arrival would ease the concerns over Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte that have emerged from the opening game of the season.",
      "The final signing would be in goal, a position they are currently considering with Lammens. However, their failed attempt to lure Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa earlier in the window is a deal that made perfect sense.",
      "With Osimhen eventually signing for Galatasaray in a £64.8m deal, reports suggesting Martinez was available for £40m and Ederson reportedly available for £51.6m - it would have required a £156.4m outlay to sign those three players.",
      "That would likely have needed United to make significant sales, but several players have been available all summer...",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Where do we begin with this? United have loaned Marcus Rashford out and lost Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof. Away from that, there has been no movement.",
      "The 'bomb squad' of Tyrell Malacia, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony are all still at the club despite being available for transfer since the start of the window. Ideally, all four would have left at the start to help fund incomings. There are also the ongoing question marks over Rasmus Hojlund and Casemiro.",
      "Exits for both would have handed Amorim more funds to spend elsewhere on other recruits. There's also the mention that had Martinez arrived to become United's new number one, Andre Onana would have likely have been sold - but the club will continue with the Cameroonian as their first-choice goalkeeper this season.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is giving serious consideration to recalling goalkeeper Andre Onana against Fulham.",
      "Onana has recovered from a hamstring injury that prevented him from playing during pre-season and he had three team training sessions before the opening Premier League defeat to Arsenal.",
      "Amorim deemed Onana too undercooked to start against the Premier League runners-up of the past three seasons and Altay Bayindir kept his place. Onana was left out of the squad entirely.",
      "Bayindir was widely criticised for his feeble 'keeping that led to Riccardo Calafiori's 13th-minute winner and Amorim is leaning towards starting Onana at Craven Cottage on Sunday.",
      "Well-placed sources say Onana and Bayindir enjoy an excellent relationship but that a demotion for Bayindir could kill his confidence.",
      "United players had a recovery day on Monday before a day off on Tuesday. Provided he has not suffered a setback, Onana will have had a minimum of four team training sessions.",
      "Bayindir, 27, joined United on transfer deadline day in September 2023 for £4.3million from Fenerbahce and has played 12 times for the club, conceding 21 goals.",
      "The Turkey international started the three matches that United shipped four goals in last season and his error against Arsenal was reminiscent of Son Heung-min's winner for Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup quarter-final last December.",
      "United's goalkeeping situation is further complicated by the club's efforts to bring in a reinforcement. United enquired about the possibility of signing Emiliano Martinez on loan from Aston Villa in the summer but the MEN revealed in May a new goalkeeper was not considered a priority.",
      "Amorim bristled at the suggestion that he might have considered starting the 39-year-old Tom Heaton ahead of Bayindir against Arsenal.",
      "\"Why? He (Bayindir) suffered a goal like this where?\" Amorim asked. \"Without VAR. With VAR (at Tottenham), is a foul and then what happened in the next game? At Arsenal (in the FA Cup third round): who saved the penalty? Who saved the game, all the game? No, no, no, before the penalty.",
      "\"You don’t remember the game? I remember the game. Altay was unbelievable in that game. I consider everything to put one or the other and I choose Altay.\"",

      "Riz Rehman was only nine years old when the challenges of achieving his dream to become a professional footballer came to light.",
      "His father was the only South Asian parent on a coaching training course when he was struck by the demoralising answer to his question surrounding a lack of Asian players. It was when he went home to his children, that he passed on the deflating response.",
      "The answer: “The weather, got the wrong diet and your kids are pushed towards education.”",
      "Riz and his brother Zesh were told, “You’re good players, but you’ve got no chance.”",
      "Times are changing and Riz - along with the help of his elder brother - are pushing their initiative through the Players’ Football Association (PFA) to boost the number of representatives from the South Asian community.",
      "Zesh would go on to be one of the groundbreaking trailblazers for the community and became the first South Asian to play in the Premier League with Fulham, where he made 21 appearances.",
      "Now a coach at Portsmouth, the 41-year-old is one of the few to represent South Asia in a position within the professional game and he acts as a mentor for the programme alongside the likes of Danny Batth, Mal Benning and Neil Taylor.",
      "It all changed for Riz, from Birmingham before moving to Surrey, when a broken leg curtailed a promising playing career.",
      "He then swapped his determination to become a footballer for doing his coaching badges before obtaining a sports science degree.",
      "The challenges were always there before he felt within the PFA, things had to be stepped up to bring the lack of South Asian representation to the forefront of the conversation.",
      "As a result, the Asian Inclusion Mentoring Scheme (AIMS) was created to bring a structured network of support focused on enhancing the experience for Asian footballers at all levels of professional football.",
      "“I’ve been here for 12 years and when I started working for the PFA, when an enquiry came in or a newspaper wanted a quote, it was quickly thrown onto my desk. We needed to stop the pretty quotes and doing the work,” says Rehman.",
      "“In 2018, I was working in the education department and we spoke about connecting with all the South Asian players in the game.”",
      "There have been challenges throughout Rehman’s career, whether it was playing or since he has obtained a role at the PFA.",
      "During his time at a professional football club, he was subject to racism and racial undertones.",
      "With the help of AIMS, he hopes that the correct advice and support for players will help them not feel isolated and deal with their coaches, as well as teammates better..",
      "“During the time the Twin Towers came down so I was the first Pakistani-Muslim playing for the club, there was some inner-city, middle-class working backgrounds, when I was captain of the youth team, I asked why a player was late for training and he said: ‘okay, call me a terrorist’,” he explains.",
      "“You’d speak to your coaches and they’d say it was banter, you had to deal with it and I learned quickly, you don’t say much and got on with it but if it was said to a young, Asian player now, I’m confident they would come to us.",
      "“Any issues players face, the PFA are there to support the player.”",
      "Participation figures within the field of sport are increasing for South Asians, whether it is in competitive football or on the backroom staff.",
      "The AIMS project is now at the end of its five-year plan with another rise expected ahead of the next stage in the programme. With AIMS, they provide workshops, events and face-to-face Zoom meetings for their players to speak to high-profile figures or some of their mentors.",
      "Rehman adds: “It’s peer-to-peer mentoring at all ages and all stages of the game, because I come from an Asian, Muslim background.",
      "\"Families we speak to about the project open up to it straight away, they recognise that there are barriers whether it’s your ethnicity, religion but once they speak to people who have been through the system, live through their experiences and it helps build that connection.",
      "“What they’re now seeing is a community of young Asian players, it really inspires them to believe it can be done.”",

      "Manchester United head into the final days of the transfer window with plenty of business still to do.",
      "The club are reportedly advancing in a deal to sign Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp, with club-to-club talks with the Belgian outfit over a deal for the goalkeeper, who has attracted interest from Inter Milan among others this summer, said to have taken place. Lammens, 23, caught the eye in the Jupiler Pro League last season, keeping seven clean sheets in 30 appearances.",
      "Elsewhere, United remain in the market for a new central midfielder, while there is also expected to be a focus on getting players out of the door before the September 1 deadline.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "A decision over Rasmus Hojlund's future is expected to take a few more days, according to Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg. The journalist says that the 22-year-old front man has been offered to Bayern Munich on loan but the Bundesliga side are exploring other possibilities.",
      "Napoli are instead working on a loan deal for the striker, following Romelu Lukaku's latest injury setback, but the player's decision could take a few more days. RB Leipzig and AC Milan are among the others interested in Hojlund, who didn't feature during last Sunday's defeat against Arsenal.",
      "MEN says: Getting Hojlund out of Old Trafford before the end of the summer would be the best resolution for all parties. Amorim doesn't appear to want Hojlund as part of his United squad and it makes sense for him to go.",
      "As for his destination, I do think Napoli would be the most ideal for him. Antonio Conte has proved that he can get the best out of players, as seen by Scott McTominay last season, and he can do the same with Hojlund.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",
      "Fenerbahce have agreed to meet Manchester United's £39m asking price for Antony before the summer transfer deadline, it has been claimed. Former United manager Jose Mourinho is reportedly keen to bring the Brazilian to Istanbul.",
      "However, ESPN Brasil has reported that the 25-year-old is unconvinced over joining Jose Mourinho's side and is holding out for another team, likely to be Real Betis. Antony spent the second half of the 2024/25 season at Betis, scoring nine goals and providing five assists in 26 appearances.",
      "MEN says: It's not a surprise to see Antony want a move back to Real Betis, following his impressive form during the second half of last season. He looked to have got his mojo back, after a difficult couple of years at United.",
      "Fenerbahce would be an intriguing destination if Antony chose to go there, however, as he would slot in alongside former Aston Villa forward Jhon Duran in a exciting-looking front line for Mourinho's men.",

      "A worthy bet on Pep…\n60 minutes into Spurs vs Manchester City and City just do not look good at all. On the flip side spurs look excellent in all the ways they didn’t under Ange.",
      "Here’s a bet I think it’s worth placing – Pep Guardiola to leave before the season end. Not sacked but I think he’ll leave. Because I don’t think he really knows how to fix city. The stress will get to him again like last season when he tried to fight a Liverpool fan in the street and then he’ll announce that he’s leaving.",
      "It’s a long shot obviously but I think it’s genuinely worth a bet.",
      "I know they usually lose to spurs (how weird is it that almost every single spurs manager beats city?) but they don’t usually get schooled the way they are today. There’s a massive gulf in tactics, motivation, and organisation.\nLee",
      "READ: James Trafford mistake inevitable amid Ederson succession botched by Man City",
      "",
      "The new ‘weak link’ at Arsenal…\nWith the the goons buying Eze, I wonder if Arteta realises that he is now the weak link. One wonders if he has worked on trying to improve his coaching skills over the Summer to the point where he can add at least one alternative to his current one dimensional approach. Penny for Nwaneri’s thoughts too. We are led to believe he hesitated on signing his new deal because of concerns about his minutes. Fair to assume then that he received assurances, because sign he did. Ten minutes later Eze struts in.\nRHT/TS x",
      "",
      "Potter in trouble…\nJust gonna call it as I see it, no shame losing to Chelsea.. 5-1 does raise plenty of questions particularly after a 3-0 to Sunderland.. They are bang in trouble.. looking at the fixtures don’t see them picking up a single point until late Oct (8/9 games in) Potter certain to be gone by then and West Ham in relegation flight this year for sure unless there is massive turnaround.\nChris (Broken Hammers)",
      "",
      "Arsenal = The Crazy Gang\nArsenal get a lot of hate in these here pages, but I for one enjoy the atavistic stylings they bring to the table. There’s something incredible about spending almost a BILLION pounds in order to bring Graham Taylor and Charles Reep’s dreams to the modern world.",
      "The Premier League of today is missing the antic energy, the pure fun of those lovable upstarts, the late 80s/early 90’s Wimbledon teams. Antagonistic manager, unlikable owner Sam/Stan, ball in the mixer, hilarious disciplinary record, scoring loads of scrappy goals from corners. I love that Arteta has attempted to recreate that style and bring fun and joy back to our sterile football world. He truly is a student of the game.",
      "Eze is the final piece. The cheeky chappy Dennis Wise figure who might even end up with a handful of England caps. He’s going to need to look out for the midfield Martins (a very 90’s British name) cutting his suit in half though! Or that big lump up front who scores four goals a season Big Victor Fashanu setting fire to his pants! How about ole David Raya/Beasant, ready to punch any one, any time the ball comes near him! Look out! And don’t mess about with this lot or Vinnie Rice will be right in with a reducer early doors!",
      "The brilliance of Arteta is to realize that the key to winning is not your fancy creativity in the final third of your Cities or you Liverpool’s, or your Wenger’s, no sir. What you need is to get the ball in the box high and early for the big man. He wins a corner or a long throw, then your other big lads crash the box and bundle it in! It’s the Arsenal way!",
      "I can hear Arsenal fans protesting right now. No! We pass the ball sometimes! Wimbledon never almost won the league! It’s all about marginal gains! (which I think is what you get by spending marginally less than a billion quid?) but I say why protest? You’re living the dream! Watching Arsenal every week is not a torturous slog akin to a five hour documentary on making paint, in Romanian, with no subtitles, no! It is pure, golden nostalgia. A throwback to a simpler time.",
      "Plus at the end of the day, you can taste other fans tears of jealousy with that ultimate measure of success ̶w̶i̶n̶n̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶t̶r̶a̶n̶s̶f̶e̶r̶ ̶w̶i̶n̶d̶o̶w̶ trophies! Just like the original Crazy Gang*, this Arsenal team have, in total, one whole FA Cup triumph to savor. Who could want or expect more than that in almost six years? The endless grind was all worth it! I can hear the Emirates quietly singing now; “One trophy… to the Arsenal! One Trophy!’\nDrew, LA. (*to be fair to Wimbledon, they also achieved 3 promotions as well as the FA Cup triumph in the same time frame as Arteta has had, don’t want to cause any controversy with this missive.)",
      "",
      "Spurs ‘look mightily decent’ despite ‘Levy absolutely Levy’ing this transfer window\nI said it earlier this week in the mailbox and I’ll say it again now – after what was a calm and fuss-free performance from Spurs – but having your players play in their actual position with the correct set up is an understated element.",
      "Of course, conceding a record 497 goals and finishing one place above the relegation zone will always have the ‘your defence is sh*t’ line thrown at you. Negative. It was always the set up. These are very good players and, despite my reservations of Vic as a truly elite goalie, this back 5 has genuine potential to be very miserly indeed.",
      "Hard to get too excited after beating ‘just’ Burnley. And some may even argue that Spurs v City doesn’t count much either, because we have some curse over Pep, but I’m getting semi-excited. Not a semi though, don’t worry.",
      "It’s been a horrible week for Spurs on the old internet. This whole Eze thing has got the fanbase evoking Sol Campbell emotions. Which is weird. Eze, an Arsenal fan and once at their academy, decides to sign for *check notes*, oh, Arsenal. Hardly a f***ing surprise is it.",
      "Let me give you some advice, stay off socials and just watch the footy. It might leave you feeling happier and lighter.",
      "Anyway, despite Levy absolutely Levy’ing this transfer window – no MGW, Eze, Rodrygo, Rogers, Paz or the million others we’ve been linked with – we’ve got Frank coaching the team to play as a team and making us look mightily decent, even without key creative players in Madders and Kulu. He’s even got Richy looking like an actual football player, which he has very rarely done in a Lilywhite top.",
      "I’m not sure we get anyone else in. If we do, it’s probably underwhelming. The challenge will be when we are playing multiple games per week. For now, though, we look like a very decent prospect. I expect the top 4 to be Pool, City, Ars*nal and Ch*lsea. 5th? Who knows. Could we? Maybe. Qualification for a European comp would definitely represent success this season. That plus the CL and FA Cup. F*** it, and the league cup.",

      "For the most part, English clubs pay Gucci prices for Uniqlo players. And the media happily plays along saying we can’t compete with the Reals, Barcas and PSGs.

      "Logic not your strong point, I guess.",
      "Also, ftr, there is no comparison between Coutinho whilst playing for Liverpool and Isak in present day. Coutinho was far better – the conversation of the time was whether he or Hazard was better… and then they both went to Spain and flopped. Often, players don’t perform as well out of the environment that made them stars. Doesn’t mean they weren’t utterly fabulous for those clubs in the Premier League in a way that Isak can’t claim to be after just one season or so of superb football. If he can do it for, say, 5 years in a row, then sure.",
      "Also worth remembering that Newcastle are demanding 150% of the current British transfer record, and Liverpool are offering as an opening offer 110% of it. It’s not as if anyone is being stingy here.\nJon, Bridgwater.",
      "",
      "Isak, promises and perspectives…\nOn Isak. People keep pointing at the Coutinho deal like it somehow makes £150m for Isak reasonable. Come on. The Coutinho fee was Barca losing their minds after PSG nicked Neymar. Liverpool didn’t set a trend, they just cashed in and we’ve been laughing about it ever since. That doesn’t suddenly mean Isak is “worth” £150m.",
      "Newcastle can value him however they like, but let’s not pretend Isak agrees with them. I’d be stunned if he wasn’t told something along the lines of “if a big bid comes in, we’ll look at it.” A record bid did come in and Newcastle basically said “jog on.” No wonder the lad’s annoyed. Liverpool have already tested the water with £120m talk, and he can see it. If you were him, wouldn’t you feel stitched up?",
      "As for this “Liverpool don’t need another attacker” argument – nonsense. We’ve lost players, spaces need filling. This isn’t disruption, it’s evolution. You refresh a title-winning side or you fall behind. The new signings are bedding in fine, and another attacker doesn’t change that. The whole point is to set the squad up for the long term, not just this season.",
      "And Newcastle “acting like a big club” by clinging on? Please. Real big clubs know when to cash in, reinvest, and come back stronger. Newcastle look terrified of life without Isak because they know they can’t find anyone close. That’s not Liverpool’s problem, it’s theirs.",
      "And while I’m here, my last mail about the racist abuse of Semenyo and the disgraceful comments that followed never got published. Felt like a cop-out. The abuse was vile, but instead of focusing on supporting Semenyo, too many people in your comments used it as another excuse to bash Liverpool. That isn’t rivalry, it’s just bitter nonsense, and it lets the actual racist off the hook.",
      "So, back to football. £150m is silly money, Isak feels let down, Liverpool are evolving, Newcastle are clinging on, and this whole saga is dragging on longer than Odemwingie in a car park. At some point, they’ll either take the cash or they’ll end up with a striker who magically develops calf injuries every other week.\nLJ DUB – LFC stranded in Salford",

      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "18=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nIt is still very early days but really not much more Thomas Frank could have done. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’d get on operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. Remarkably, he appears to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "The first part is already locked in. So now we wait: is it full meltdown or sauntering to the league title? Nothing else will be tolerated or is indeed even possible.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "15=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "15=) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves and no matter how hilarious it remains that a manager who has cracked absolutely everything else in this game of ours simply cannot get his head around Tottenham.",
      "",
      "15=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least.",
      "",
      "11=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "11=) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "11=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which that limp defeat at Leeds snowballs into a more significant disappointing start to the season, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "11=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "5=) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, and it really might just be that West Ham are that bad.",
      "",
      "5=) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "5=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "5=) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "",
      "5=) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "5=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "We’ll know far more pretty soon given Burnley face Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "4) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and a lacklustre defeat to a Bournemouth side with plenty of problems of their own.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "3) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "2) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club and a 5-1 battering by Chelsea will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland and Chelsea were both very good, but the Hammers were honking on the opening day and arguably even worse on Friday night, with the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory so early in the season, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, and it really is starting to look like he can’t, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "",
      "1) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nAlways felt possible, didn’t it? Even after such a fine season last year, even after managing to get their European ticket upgraded. Maybe especially after those things. Mr Marinakis is on one, and anyone who stands in his way is at risk.",
      "There are whispers already and Nuno actually now appears to be doing his level best to win this race in order to escape Evangelos Marinakis, who is apparently minded to bring Ange Postecoglou straight back to the Premier League. Think we can all agree that relationship would be one to savour, although Spurs fans might feel that going straight from Nuno to Postecoglou without Antonio Conte being a big miserable sod in the middle is basically cheating.",
      "Arsenal face a nervous wait on Kai Havertz after a knee setback, with Mikel Arteta confirming he’s unavailable to face Leeds United.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta has made a key decision on Viktor Gyokeres, who has been blasted after his ‘non-existent’ debut.",
      "Mikel Arteta has reportedly ‘identified’ Arsenal’s ‘next signing’ and Fabrizio Romano has backed them to pull off a last-minute transfer on one condition.",

      "We’re so back. The 25/26 Premier League season is up and running, and halfway through the second weekend, there’s already been significant early jostling in the marathon-not-a-sprint for the Golden Boot.",
      "There’s already a very strong, very familiar favourite heading a strong group of contenders featuring plenty of new names.",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the big shiny shoe, according to oddschecker.com, with each player’s current goal tally in brackets.",
      "",
      "",
      "",
      "8=) Ollie Watkins (0)\nAmong the most consistently reliable Premier League goalscorers since making his debut in the competition back in 2020, always reaching double figures but never yet cracking the 20-goal barrier. Based on the very early evidence this time around, you are going to need to crack the 20-goal barrier to be in the frame and that looks like hard work in this particular Aston Villa team.",
      "",
      "9=) Chris Wood (2)\nThe Nottingham Forest striker smashed in two goals v Brentford in his opening game of the season on the back of a fine 24/25. Does seem slightly disrespectful that his two goals in one game sees him comfortably trailing plenty of none-in-two merchants at this time.",
      "",
      "7=) Benjamin Sesko (0)\nNot since Robin van Persie in 2012/13 has a Manchester United player got their hands on the Golden Boot, and Sesko will need United’s general attacking play to be far less moribund than last year’s if he is to have any chance. Still, like Van Persie all those years ago, he is in his first season at the club so maybe that’s a good omen. Although unlike Van Persie, he didn’t score 30 Premier League goals the previous season.",
      "",
      "7=) Cole Palmer (0)\nOne of two members of Chelsea’s Club World Cup heroes to make this top 10. Much is expected of Chelsea – and Palmer – this season.",
      "",
      "5=) Joao Pedro (1)\nHas any player made a greater contribution to a club before even playing a league game? His role in Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph after rocking up halfway through the tournament was stunning. His first Premier League goal of the season came v West Ham.",
      "",
      "5=) Alexander Isak (0)\nTwo fairly significant questions here. Where, exactly, will he be attempting to score the necessary Premier League goals to secure this prize? And how much of a headstart will he give some pretty tasty rivals before we know the answer to question one?",
      "",
      "4) Hugo Ekitike (1)\nHas made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like until the Alexander Isak Situation is resolved.",
      "",
      "3) Mohamed Salah (1)\nFaded towards the end of last season but already had this award in the bag long before that. Early evidence suggests he won’t have to shoulder quite such a goalscoring burden at Liverpool this season, but also that he’ll still get/create a vast number of opportunities.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (2)\nThe Proper Striker to finally deliver the title to Arsenal? Not on the evidence of that opening-day performance v Man Utd or the first half against Leeds but definitely possibly of the second half.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (2)\nLooking to reclaim his crown after last season’s ‘struggles’ and made – as he generally does – a rapid start to the season with a couple of goals on the opening day as the familiar focal point of a new-look Man City side. He was odds-on favourite after everybody had got a glimpse of Gyokeres on Sunday.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed Man City have reached a ‘club-to-club agreement’ for a player sale, while Real Madrid plot a huge swap bid for Erling Haaland.",
      "Despite their 0-0 draw to kick the new season off, Stuart Pearce reckons Chelsea have enough to finish in the top two this year.",
      "Legitimately excitable responses to Alexander Isak’s statement and the fallout from it understandably dominate the headlines.",
      "Mind games? Being nice to an Arsenal interviewer? Whatever the reason, the newly minted Player of the Year reckons Mikel Arteta’s side are the favourites this year.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for two-and-a-half seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends.",
      "Either Pep Guardiola’s new Man City are incredibly good, or denuded Wolves are incredibly bad. It could well prove to be both."

      "",
      "20) 🆕 Morgan Rogers – Aston Villa to Tottenham\nOn Thursday, The Sun suggested that Arsenal were keen on Rogers, but Tottenham’s interest has obviously intensified since they lost out in the race for Eberechi Eze. We can’t see either club getting Rogers out of Villa before the deadline without doing something mental. Rule nothing out with Spurs, but it’s certainly a harder deal to do than the ones they have already failed to pull off.",

      "",
      "19) 🔽 Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWhile Liverpool have signed one centre-back, the Reds are facing stronger resistance from Palace, who quite reasonably don’t want to give their captain away for a bag of balls, even if he is in the final year of his contract. That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Tottenham\nReports in Spain suggest Spurs have agreed a deal. Colour us sceptical. Very. F***ing. Sceptical. Rodrygo’s representatives are clearly trying to create a buzz around the Brazil star, with Liverpool, City and Spurs all said to be interested. The Liverpool links don’t pass the sniff test. Spurs are bound to do something big and probably daft before the deadline, but more likely is that they go for Savinho. Which could free up space for Rodrygo at City…",
      "",
      "17) Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nJackson has been available all summer but £80million was said to be the price, which is obviously mental for a one-in-three striker who Chelsea clearly want rid of. It does, though, make £60million sound more palatable but even that is too much for any club that hasn’t lost their mind. Desperation, though, can make you do funny things and Newcastle are said to have been in touch with Chelsea in recent days. Bayern Munich too, and Villa continue to be linked, but Newcastle feel the most likely club to offer anything more than a loan-to-buy deal.",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Rasmus Hojlund – Manchester United to Napoli\nMilan were hopeful of finding a deal but it seems they have failed to convince Hojlund as well as United, with neither of those parties interested in a loan deal. Which might have scuppered whatever hope Napoli might have had of filling their Romelu Lukaku void with the Dane, but that hasn’t stopped them from talking it over with United on Wednesday.",
      "",
      "15) 🔼 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nThis one has been bubbling under while Newcastle consider their options around Isak. Larsen is said to be one of a small number of strikers on their radar to serve as a replacement for the Swede and the Wolves hit-man is up for it. But he won’t go full or even semi-Isak by agitating for the move. And Wolves will apparently demand £60million since they know Newcastle have it to spend.",
      "",
      "14) 🆕 Angelo Stiller – Stuttgart to Manchester United\nYouTube searches for Stiller have presumably increased exponentially after it emerged on Thursday that the midfielder is on United’s list of Baleba alternatives. Of course, the Germany international would be cheaper and a more simple deal to pull off but United’s interest has not yet led to a conversation with Stuttgart so links are tentative. For now.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nThe good news for Newcastle: Brentford have signed a forward in Dango Ouattara. The bad news: Ouattara is viewed as Bryan Mbuemo’s replacement. Worse news: reports suggest Brentford have significantly increased their valuation of Wissa, perhaps to as much as £60million. The player did not take it well, reacting by removing all references to Brentford on his social media, seemingly forgetting he’s not a teenager who just broke up with their boyfriend. Newcastle have tried to cheer up Wissa with a second offer, worth £45million plus another £5million in add-ons, but it’s still not enough for Brentford to seriously consider. Wissa’s next move after his Instagram tantrum: explore legal options. Prepare to hear more about Article 17…",
      "",
      "12) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nIt’s ‘Chelsea or nowhere’ in Garnacho’s mind and, to be honest, we’re curious to see what ‘nowhere’ looks like. United are still insisting on £50million, using Noni Madueke’s £49million plus add-ons move as the yardstick. Chelsea, though, know Madueke wasn’t acting the d*** and they realise United need rid so their stance is that £30million is more than reasonable. Romano reckons the Blues are ‘advancing in club-to-club talks’ and a ‘deal is underway’. We expect them to meet close to the middle, probably closer to Chelsea’s number.",
      "",
      "11) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester City\nDonnarumma will leave PSG. Where he ends up is less certain. The Italy keeper said his goodbyes to PSG fans after Friday night’s Ligue 1 win over Angers but while City were the frontrunners in what appeared to be a one-horse race, reports suggest the European champions are asking more than the Citizens are prepared to pay. Though James Trafford’s performance against Spurs might refocus City’s minds.",
      "MORE ON DONNARUMMA: Keeper’s flaws mean Man Utd makes more sense than Man City",
      "",
      "10) Ederson – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nYou could say there are already too many No.1s at the Etihad before the interest in Donnarumma, and City appear open to selling Ederson. Galatasaray’s offer, though, must double before City consider selling the Brazilian, which may appear unlikely but new links with Royal Antwerp’s Senne Lammens – also a target for Manchester United – suggests City are expecting some movement. Ederson will not be keen to remain on City’s bench, from where he watched James Trafford’s poor tribute act against Spurs.",
      "",
      "9) 🆕 Christopher Nkunku – Chelsea to Bayern Munich\nNkunku wants to join Bayern – of course he does! – but the Bavarians have been knocked back by Chelsea when they asked for a loan deal. Talks are ongoing so it could change very quickly, especially while Chelsea are extremely motivated to get rid.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Manuel Akanji – Manchester City to Galatasaray\nThe City defender was left out of the defeat to Tottenham amid talk of interest from Galatasaray. Which City are likely to encourage given their desire to trim Pep Guardiola’s squad but Akanji is said to be keen to stay. Let’s see if being bombed from the matchday squad changes his tune…",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Savinho – Manchester City to Tottenham\nSpurs reportedly offered £43million when City wanted £60million, but there seems to have been a re-think at the Etihad. With Savinho keen to play ahead of the World Cup, some at City are more open to cashing in, so a compromise could be found. Things had gone quiet while Tottenham were faffing over Eze but now that deal is dead, reports suggest Spurs are lurking with more intent. Savinho was left out of the City squad that faced Spurs on Saturday.",
      "",
      "6) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nSimons was in the RB Leipzig side that was splattered all over the Allianz by Bayern Munich on Friday night but the club’s sporting director Marcel Schafer says the attacker has made clear his desire to join Chelsea. The Blues just need to shift some of the forwards they no longer want first. Nkunku seems to be the one this deal hinges on.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Christos Tzolis – Club Brugge to Crystal Palace\nTzolis is towards the top of Palace’s list of replacements should Arsenal or Spurs stump up for Eze. The winger has been about a bit. So far, the 23-year-old has played in Greece, England, Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The capital could be Tzolis’s next stop, but Palace will have to improve on the opening bid rejected by Club Brugge. It will cost around half of their Eze money to get the Greek.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Bilal El Khannouss – Leicester to Crystal Palace\nThe Foxes playmaker is being linked with Spurs, Newcastle, Leeds, and probably a few other Premier League clubs but Palace appear better placed while they look for a replacement for Eze with £60million burning a hole in their pocket. El Khannouss was left out of Leicester’s squad to face Charlton on Saturday.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Senne Lammens – Royal Antwerp to Manchester United\nUnited certainly need a goalkeeper and their refusal to engage over Donnaruma suggests they have something else up their sleeve. Indeed, some reports claim a deal with Antwerp is ‘almost done’ with United paying around £17million to give Andre Onana something to think about.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nIsak went for the nuclear option on Tuesday night with his first public statement since going on strike. Did it move the dial? Not really. Newcastle’s response did not exactly close the door on a move but it turned the screw on Liverpool somewhat and now Isak needs to hope that the Reds are prepared to break the bank for him. We anticipate another less mischief-making offer after Monday night’s clash between the two sides at St James’ Park and the nagging feeling remains this will get done.",
      "F365 SAYS: Alexander Isak should be raging at Liverpool, not Newcastle United",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nPerhaps spooked by Tottenham’s interest, Everton have finally agreed a deal worth £42million which includes £6million in add-ons and a 20 per cent sell-on clause for the Saints. Can the Toffees get it done to parade him before the first Premier League game at the new gaff on Sunday?",
      "",
      "Pep Guardiola must accept that James Trafford is learning on a very difficult job. The speculation around Man City and other goalkeepers can’t help…",
      "Manchester United lost against Arsenal and now Sunday v Fulham is absolutely massive. Can they be Premier League title contenders?",
      "There’s been a record spend in the Premier League this summer, but have you been paying attention to the transfers in Europe?",
      "It’s still all about Alexander Isak and there have been ‘bombshells’ aplenty after words from both Arne Slot and Eddie Howe.",
      "Should Liverpool really be spending all that money on Alexander Isak? Do they need him? Does he break their transfer policy?",
      "Rodrygo would be quite the coup for Man City, Liverpool or whoever gets him this summer, but the vast majority of players swapping Real Madrid for the Premier League have ..."

      "The 2025 summer transfer window is in full swing and there are a whole raft of deals agreed. This list will change roughly a trillion times over the coming weeks.",
      "If you want a full list of just Premier League transfers then this is your link.",
      "Players are ranked by size of the initial fee, with add-ons stated.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool) – £100m rising to £116m\nLiverpool’s quiet summer of 2024 certainly isn’t being repeated 12 months down the line with another Premier League trophy in the cabinet. And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig to Manchester United) – £66.2m rising to £73.4m with add-ons\nThe Red Devils turned to the 22-year-old after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, as they have taken a huge risk in a Rasmus Hojlund repeat when Ollie Watkins was right there.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",
      "",
      "8) Eberechi Eze (Crystal Palace to Arsenal) – £60m rising to £67.5m with add-ons\nArsenal looked like being Eze’s destination before they teased Tottenham with some brief dithering. Once the Gunners made decisive move, it was always going to be them.",
      "",
      "9) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal) – £60m\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to part with the mountains and food on offer in San Sebastian but when another opportunity to move to the Premier League came around a year later, the midfielder happily hopped aboard the Arsenal bandwagon.",
      "",
      "10) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",
      "",
      "11) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting to Arsenal) – £55m rising to £63m with add-ons\nIt is finally done. At last we can rest for five minutes.",
      "",
      "12) Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea) – £55m rising to £60m with add-ons\nTwo years after joining Brighton from Watford for a club-record fee, the Seagulls have doubled their money on the Brazilian with the usual sale to Chelsea.",
      "",
      "13) Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Tottenham) – £55m\nThis move will go down well in east London, we’re sure.",
      "",
      "14) Illia Zabarnyi (Bournemouth to Paris Saint-Germain) – £54.3m rising to £57m with add-ons\nBournemouth held firm for as long as they could but were only able to resist the European champions for so long before making their third sale of a defender for at least £40m this summer.",
      "",
      "15) Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle United) – £52m rising to £55m with add-ons\nNewcastle United have finally landed a right winger after missing out on targets in recent windows. Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak is a very fun front three…",
      "",
      "16) Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid) – £50m\nReal Madrid matched Huijsen’s release clause just a year after he joined the Cherries for just £12.6m. The fee will be paid in three instalments by Real, with his former clubs Juventus due 10% and Malaga 5%.",
      "",
      "17) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nChelsea didn’t have enough forwards already.",
      "",
      "18) Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nThere was an actual petition launched against the signing of Madueke, who might well have come in handy last season when it turned out Raheem Sterling was no Bukayo Saka.",
      "",
      "19) Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan to Manchester City) – £46.6m rising to £59.2m with add-ons\nThe last of four signings rushed through in the first transfer window to prepare for the Club World Cup, as officially Serie A’s best midfielder in 2024/25 Reijnders might be the most intriguing.",

      "",
      "10) Newcastle United – £126.3m\nIt’s been a slow and frustrating summer – and there’s still no sign of a new striker – but Jacob Ramsey has arrived for £39m to join Anthony Elanga and Malick Thiaw. They still need to spend a whole lot more.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "9) Sunderland – £142.59m\nNine first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "8) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "7) Nottingham Forest – £151.23m\nThere was always a sense that Evangelos Marinakis was waiting to get Crystal Palace out of the way before sanctioning a heavy spend to Europa-proof Nuno’s squad. Three players have cost more than £30m apiece and Arnaud Kalimuendo wasn’t much less.",
      "",
      "6) Atletico Madrid – £151.4m\nDiego Simeone rebuilds again, with 10 permanent signings through the door, eight of whom are between the ages of 22 and 27. Alex Baena is the most expensive of the bunch.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "3) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "2) Arsenal – £254.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudged Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes. Then came Eberechi Eze for another £60m.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £289.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. Giovanni Leoni edges the champions closer to the £300m mark."

To mistreat him like this after everything he did last season is unbearable. That’s what’s most shocking.",

      "Manchester United’s summer rebuild may not be done yet, with fresh talks behind the scenes about strengthening Ruben Amorim’s midfield before the deadline.",
      "The Red Devils have already transformed their attack by signing Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Still, Ruben Amorim has acknowledged that the midfield remains the area most in need of work, with Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton allegedly his ‘dream target.’",
      "Casemiro started the season opener against Arsenal, and Manuel Ugarte came off the bench, yet neither convinced, leaving United still searching for the right profile alongside Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Carlos Baleba was considered the priority target, but Brighton have shut down interest unless bids hit £100million, forcing United to consider alternatives.",
      "Other names such as Morten Hjulmand and Lucien Agoume have been floated, though none have progressed. There were rumours yesterday United would be offered the chance to sign a French international and former target.",
      "According to journalist Ben Jacobs on X, Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller has now been raised in conversations at Old Trafford.",
      "“One of the midfielders on Manchester United’s list of options is Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller,” Jacobs said.",
      "“No guarantee anything develops, or that any midfielder arrives, but internal discussions taking place over different targets.",
      "“Stiller has come up in discussions as #MUFC now decide whether to sign another midfielder before the window shuts.”",
      "Stiller, 24, came through Bayern Munich’s academy before moving to Hoffenheim and later Stuttgart, where he has flourished over the last two seasons.",
      "His rise in value has been rapid, climbing from €5million to around €45m, and he made his Germany debut in 2024.",
      "His reputation as a deep-lying playmaker has been highlighted by Statman Dave on X, who described him as a “world-class distributor” after he ranked among Europe’s elite midfielders for progressive passes last season, averaging 9.49 per 90 minutes in the Bundesliga.",
      "Real Madrid were reportedly tipped off about Stiller by Toni Kroos earlier this year, though they never moved for him, while Liverpool and Arsenal have also tracked his progress.",
      "United’s interest fits with their recent Bundesliga focus under Christopher Vivell, with targets emerging from Germany throughout the summer.",
      "For now, no formal talks have taken place with Stuttgart or the player’s camp, but the discussions inside United point to Stiller being seriously considered as the club weighs up a late midfield move.",
      "United have ten days left to close out their window, and Amorim has been clear about the need for another addition in the middle of the park."

      "Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham have all been strongly linked with Rodrygo, who is clearly not in Xabi Alonso’s plans.",
      "But they should perhaps pump the brakes after casting an eye over this truly appalling comprehensive list of honking flops who have made the move from Real Madrid to the Premier League, in order of transfer fee.",
      "",
      "19) Christian Karambeu (Middlesbrough, £2.1m)\nWe’re in absolute agreement with Karambeu, who insisted his move to Teeside from Madrid was a “big, big deal” on the back of two Champions League titles in three years for Los Blancos, to go with his World Cup and European Championship winners medals with France. Boro finished 14th in his only season before Karambeu upped sticks to Olympiacos.",
      "",
      "18) Davor Suker (Arsenal, £3.5m)\nBought as a replacement for Nicolas Anelka, who moved in the opposite direction for £22.3m, it’s fair to say Croatia’s World Cup 1998 hero wasn’t quite like-for-like, scoring just 11 goals in 39 appearances. Fortunately Arsenal also signed a certain Thierry Henry in the same summer.",
      "",
      "17) Fernando Morientes (Liverpool, £6.3m)\nHe managed just 12 goals in 61 appearances and later admitted he was the “worst version of myself” during a two-year stint as Anfield which was “killing me slowly”. Yikes.",
      "",
      "16) Jonathan Woodgate (Middlesbrough, £7m)\nAfter two injury-ravaged seasons at the Bernabeu, Woodgate returned to fitness and form at Boro before moving to Spurs in January in 2008 and immediately becoming the second-last (yes, the second last) trophy-winning hero.",
      "",
      "15) Njitap Geremi (Chelsea, £6.9m)\nArriving in the first cash-laden summer of the Romano Abramovich era, his always felt like a slightly odd signing after a decent but not world-beating season on loan from Madrid at Middlesbrough. After 19 starts in his debut season under Claudio Ranieri, Geremi was never more than a bit-part player under Jose Mourinho, though we’re sure he’s perfectly happy with a haul of two Premier Leagues, two League Cups and an FA Cup.",
      "",
      "14) Rafael van der Vaart (Tottenham, £8m)\nWe’re not sure whether Tottenham fans will be delighted or sickened by Van der Vaart claiming the Harry Redknapp side he played in with Gareth Bale and Luka Modric was “the best team I ever played in” having left Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema, Raul and Ruud van Nistelrooy behind him at Real Madrid.",
      "That may well have been the peak ‘Spurs are fun but are never going to win anything’ period and Van der Vaart was a big reason for that, presumably swapping notes with Jamie O’Hara over their future roles as Tell It Like It Is pundits, colloquially known as ‘pr*cks’.",
      "",
      "13) Esteban Granero (QPR, £9m)\nHe joined as one of several ‘marquee signings’ among 15 in total in that mad 2012 summer which was entirely predictably QPR’s undoing as they finished bottom of the table.",
      "",
      "12) Claude Makelele (Chelsea, £16.8m)\nComfortably the best Premier League signing from Real Madrid, Makelele made 217 appearances for Chelsea, winning five major trophies including two Premier League titles and has one of the most enduring legacies of any footballer to play in England, with clubs now spending nine-figure sums to fill The Makelele Role, albeit for slightly more well-rounded players than the diminutive Frenchman.",
      "",
      "11) Michael Owen (Newcastle, £16.8m)\nThere’s a misconception that injuries stopped Owen from reaching the Premier League heights he enjoyed before moving to Real Madrid on his return to the English top flight. But he played 29 and 28 games in consecutive seasons for Newcastle and was just a bit balls, scoring 19 goals across the two.",
      "",
      "10) Danilo (Manchester City, £26.5m)\nWe would refer to Danilo as a rare misstep in the Pep Guardiola, Txiki Begiristain era in a summer in which they also signed Aymeric Laporte, Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, who’ve done alright, but they somehow managed to make a £7.5m profit on the Brazilian after two years of not doing very much at all.",
      "",
      "9) Sergio Reguilon (Tottenham, £25m)\nFor a famously miserly football chief, Daniel Levy does choose to spend Spurs’ money very strangely at times. He was entirely duped by five knockout games for Reguilon on loan at Sevilla to help them to the Europa League, and five years and 73 games after joining Spurs, the full-back is now without a club having left at the end of his contract.",
      "",
      "8) Martin Odegaard (Arsenal, £30m)\nOdegaard is presumably the recent example Rodrygo is hoping to mimic with his eyes on the Premier League. The playmaker was destined for great things when he signed for Madrid as a child but needed to leave to realise his potential, and while Rodrygo’s situation is different in that he’s proved he’s good enough for Real Madrid while still at Real Madrid, he will be attracted to a major role similar to Odegaard’s at a top English side.",
      "",
      "7) Raphael Varane (Manchester United, £40m)\nWe wonder whether Manchester United signing a centre-back with far more miles in his legs than his 28 years for £40m would be seen in more negative terms had it not been for his 30-year-old pal signing for £60m a year later.",
      "",
      "6) Robinho (Manchester City, £32.5m)\nQuite the 2008 deadline day for City, with Robinho arriving along with all the Abu Dhabi cash after their takeover of the club. The Brazilian announced his delight at signing for Chelsea in his first City press conference and manager Mark Hughes later claimed he believes he didn’t recognise him and was “expecting to see Sir Alex Ferguson at the airport”.",
      "",
      "5) Mateo Kovacic (Chelsea, £40m)\nThe ultimate close-but-no-cigar footballer in many ways as he’s never really been a key cog after leaving Inter for Real Madrid in 2015, as illustrated by him having four Champions League winners medals but not playing a single minute in the three for Real Madrid and just 10 minutes for Chelsea in 2021.",
      "",
      "4) Mesut Ozil (Arsenal, £42.5m)\nHe left Arsenal with a reputation of being work-shy, but mercurial may be a better description of an absurdly talented footballer who could do astonishing things with the ball at his feet but also often went missing in games, particularly at the end of his time at the Emirates. We’re not quite sure of the definition of a ‘streets won’t forget footballer’ but Ozil was somewhere between that and world class.",
      "",
      "3) Alvaro Morata (Chelsea, £58m)\nMorata has said he “stopped enjoying football” at Chelsea and that was pretty clear to everyone watching. “I didn’t feel like doing anything, leaving home, talking to people, nothing.”",
      "",
      "2) Casemiro (Manchester United, £60m)\nThere was undoubtedly an uptick in Casemiro’s performances at the end of last season, but he had set a very low bar by his standards to hobble over and we are very amused by what looks to be a reasonably decent chance of him starting the coming season at the base of Ruben Amorim’s midfield after well over a season of desperation to be rid of him.",
      "",
      "1) Angel Di Maria (Manchester United, £59.7m)\nHe actually started very well, with three goals and six assists in his opening 10 Premier League games, and Amorim would bite your hand off for a forward with a goal contribution ever 126 minutes as Di Maria managed in his solitary season at Old Trafford.",
      "But he really didn’t get on with Louis van Gaal and his wife might be the only person in the world who hates Manchester more than Mr Di Maria.",
      "“The people are all pasty-faced, prim and proper… weird,” she said.",
      "“They’re walking down the street and you don’t know if they’re going to kill you or what. The food’s disgusting. All the girls are all dolled up to the nines, perfectly made-up and there’s me with my hair in a bun and with no make-up on.",
      "“We try to be closer when things go bad. I did not blame him for being there. I just told him, ‘Darling, I want to kill myself, it is already night at 14:00 p.m. in the afternoon.'”",
      "We’re guessing she preferred Paris like her husband, who got 92 goals and 120 assists while starring for PSG.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have ‘submitted an offer’ for a Real Madrid star, while they have ‘reached an agreement’ for their next signing.",
      "Manchester United are closing in on a deal for goalkeeper also linked with Manchester City, while Everton finally pony up for a winger eyed by Spurs…",
      "Pep Guardiola must accept that James Trafford is learning on a very difficult job. The speculation around Man City and other goalkeepers can’t help…",
      "Arsenal have ‘ruled out’ a move for Rodrygo this summer having agreed a deal for Eberechi Eze, to leave the Brazilian with ‘one possibility’ in the Premier League.",
      "Manchester United lost against Arsenal and now Sunday v Fulham is absolutely massive. Can they be Premier League title contenders?",
      "Liverpool, Man City and Arsenal shouldn’t be sleeping on Rodrygo. Apologies to Tottenham, but a hijack turns any of that inseparable trio into clear title favourites."

      "There’s a top-of-the-table Premier League clash to enjoy at the earliest possible opportunity, while the Bundesliga’s brave new broadcasting era has us briefly intrigued.",
      "",
      "Game to watch: Manchester City v Tottenham\nThe fixture computer has blessed us with a top-of-the-table clash at the earliest possible moment. Unless you consider Arsenal v Aston Villa on the very opening day such a thing, in which case you’re a damn fool. Even more so if you’re going to start indulging AFC Bournemouth and their Acme shenanigans in such alphabet-based nonsense.",
      "No, the second weekend of the season is the first time such a thing can legitimately happen, when you have a whole one game’s worth of compelling evidence of how the entire season might look, as long as every other team in the league is roughly as bad as Wolves and/or Burnley.",
      "Embryonic league table whimsy aside, it’s still a fascinating game. Historically, City v Spurs is already a fixture simply not to be missed by anyone for any reason. It has delivered goals, goals, goals and a frankly absurd number of pants-pullings by silly old Spurs.",
      "Last season’s 4-0 splattering was Spurs at their Angeball best against City in the very deepest depths of their astonishing season-wrecking autumn funk, but the wildest thing about that result is that it is only very slightly an outlier.",
      "Working backwards from that game, the Etihad encounters between these two during the Pep era have finished 0-4, 3-3, 4-2, 2-3, 3-0, 2-2, 1-0, 4-1 and 2-2. And let’s not forget that ludicrous Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2019, which City actually won 4-3 on the night as Spurs went through on away goals.",
      "It has been as close to guaranteed entertainment as the Premier League can offer. We’ve run it through the supercomputer and this fixture has the highest xN (expected nonsense) stats of any in the entire Barclays universe.",
      "And yet even without the fact it’s a top-of-the-table clash with sky-high xN values, it would still be the game of the weekend anyway for actual reasons. City looked a million dollars against Wolves last weekend, while Mohammed Kudus and Richarlison looked like absolute world-beaters for Spurs against Burnley.",
      "There were hugely encouraging signs for both teams’ seasons. But the phrases ‘against Wolves’ and ‘against Burnley’ mean care must be taken. We don’t yet really know how much of what we saw last weekend was these teams being good and those teams being rubbish. We have an inkling about which victory/performance was the more reliable long-term indicator, but we don’t yet know.",
      "We should have a far clearer idea about both teams after this game, even if it is one that itself has recent history for deception.",
      "Spurs, because they are Spurs, come into this game on the back of a week where they’ve once again decided to subject their fans to another of their trademark ritual humiliations for sh*ts and giggles, while also taking the bold step of unsettling and alienating the striker who scored two brilliant goals for them on the opening weekend. There really is nobody else who does it like Spurs do.",
      "But we already have a decent clue as to how Thomas Frank might set them up for this one. The Super Cup final ended in disappointment but for 85 minutes Frank’s 3-5-1-1 really did work strikingly well and if we’re honest we suspect Spurs would cheerfully take a 2-2 draw from this one.",
      "In a way, the transfer failings of this week and the summer as a whole make Frank’s job easier for this specific game. He can’t be accused of going too defensive when he has literally no No. 10 anyway.",
      "There seems no reason not to go to City and try the triple-pivot midfield that made life so awkward for PSG in Udine, while who doesn’t want to see Kevin Danso launching long throws at John Stones’ head?",
      "For City, it’s also a bit of a free hit in its ridiculous way. A sterner test than poor denuded Wolves could provide, surely, and one where a compelling victory would lay down a significant early-season marker about just how back they might be. But also one in which failure can just be shrugged off and put down to xN.",
      "READ: Ranking all 97(!) players left out of opening Premier League matchday squads by how p*ssed off they might be",

      "Player to watch: Eberechi Eze\nA good way to endear yourself to a new club’s fanbase is to have completely pied off their biggest rivals along the way. Emmanuel Petit knew it. Willian knew it. Eden Hazard knew it. But perhaps nobody has ever known it quite like Eberechi Eze, who kept Spurs on the hook until Arsenal’s time of need was upon them.",
      "Spurs must have known this could happen, and that it would look just awful – especially in the wake of the Morgan Gibbs-White fiasco. We do think Eze would have joined Spurs, but we do think it would only have happened once he was absolutely definitely certain Arsenal weren’t coming back.",
      "The whole ‘Oh he just wants to play in the Conference League qualifier to help Palace out before he leaves’ turned out to be the bullsh*t it always appeared to be, a convenient way to drag a transfer out even when dealing with the arch transfer-dragger-out himself in Daniel Levy.",
      "The result is Eze being an absolute hero to Arsenal fans before he’s even kicked a ball for them. It’s a lovely place to be. And it’s distinctly possible he still won’t kick a ball this weekend, but he’s still going to be the player to watch.",
      "He’ll surely at the very least be presented to the crowd before Arsenal’s opening home game of the season against Leeds, and should help ensure a buoyant atmosphere. There will be songs. There will be p*ss-taking. There will be endless shots of Eze in the stands watching on and penny-for-his-thoughtsing from the commentators.",

      "Team to watch: Manchester United\nThere was a lot to like about Manchester United’s performance against Arsenal on the opening weekend, but any optimism from that narrow, unfortunate defeat will dissipate quickly if they don’t get a result at Fulham this weekend.",
      "United were simply unready and unprepared for the start of the new season, still stuck with the same utter absence of reliable goalkeepers. It is staggering to us how often really big clubs do this. The window may be open until September 1, but the start of the season is in mid-August, and those games do still count. It wasn’t sprung on United with no notice.",
      "Another week has passed and nothing has been done to address the most obvious and glaring of issues.",
      "Fulham were as lucky to nab a point at Brighton as United were unlucky to walk away with nothing against Arsenal, but they represent a deeply awkward second fixture given the way the first one has gone.",
      "Fulham away is nobody’s idea of an easy game. It is not one where victory would normally necessarily be mandatory. But for United, after last season and the way the opening weekend panned out, it already feels like one where the result is of far greater importance than performance.",
      "This is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. You can’t be taking the positives if you find yourself with one point or worse from two games after finishing 15th the previous season and when the flaws in your squad are and remain so very, very obvious.",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: David Moyes\nIt will be a proud moment when Moyes leads his Everton team out against Brighton for the first ever Premier League match at their magnificent new stadium, but one that he surely approaches now with a touch of trepidation.",
      "The wave of optimism he and Everton rode on his return to the club last season has crashed, and Monday night’s effort at Leeds was a pretty pitiful one for an established Premier League club against a newly-promoted one.",
      "Everton were passive and ponderous, allowing Leeds to set the tone and tempo of the game throughout. It nearly delivered a point – although for what it’s worth we simply cannot understand the fuss around the penalty given the way James Tarkowski moved his arm towards a ball coming at him from such a distance – but it wasn’t exactly a showing to inspire confidence for the season ahead.",
      "A new stadium is blessing and curse, with home advantage no longer quite the familiar helping hand it once was as everyone gets used to the new surroundings. Yet Everton and Moyes cannot afford to make a slow start to life on the docks if the club is to avoid the kind of worries and anxiety that have been all too common in recent Premier League seasons.",

      "Football League game to watch: Charlton v Leicester\nIt’s not been a convincing start to life back in the Championship for Leicester, who needed a late goal to beat existential dread’s Sheffield Wednesday at home and then lost at Preston having also gone out of the Carabao to League One Huddersfield.",
      "Charlton, meanwhile, are at this early stage faring rather better on their own return to the second tier from the other direction having beaten Watford, drawn with Bristol City and avoided Carabao banana skins (their newest flavour of surely deliberately undrinkably unpleasant energy drink).",
      "",
      "European game to watch: Bayern Munich v RB Leipzig\nWe don’t normally include Friday night games in here, but come on. Bayern v Leipzig would be a fine opening night Bundesliga game in a regular season. But now it comes with added Mark Goldbridge. You have to admit you’re intrigued.",
      "You can watch it on the BBC as well if you like, or on YouTube. But out of sheer morbid fascination if nothing else we’ll be watching to see just how and how quickly the world’s most Deliberate Partridge performatively perma-furious internet ragebaiter manages to make Bayern Munich v RB Leipzig all about Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir.",

      "",
      "75) Gabriel Slonina (Chelsea)\nA Club World Cup winner despite not yet playing a senior game for Chelsea, but no goalkeeper on the Blues’ books can be without a chance. It is a position where Chelsea have enormous breadth but no actual depth.",
      "",
      "74) Lewis Dobbin (Aston Villa)\nOne of last season’s entirely normal and unremarkable late June transfers between clubs in PSR strife and there was absolutely nothing to see here. Has yet to play a game for Aston Villa and that’s unlikely to change this season or, very possibly, ever. Spent last season on loan at West Brom and then Norwich, and another Championship loan is surely on the cards.",

      "73) Ian Poveda (Sunderland)\nDidn’t feature in pre-season, didn’t feature in the opening-day win over West Ham, is very obviously clear to leave the club. Did contribute a pair of assists for the Under-21s in a 5-3 defeat to Tottenham on Monday night.",

      "",
      "71) Romain Faivre (Bournemouth)\nLeft Lyon for the south coast in the summer of 2023 but has still spent far more time in France than England since then after loans at Lorient and Brest. Has made only five brief substitute appearances in the Premier League and doesn’t appear likely to add to those any time soon.",

      "68) Ashley Barnes (Burnley)\nJoined Burnley for a third time after signing from Norwich in January following 18 months away and declared he had ‘unfinished business’ upon signing a one-year extension to that short-term deal in the summer. Certainly brings vast top-flight experience to the Clarets, but the nagging question is how much chance he’ll get to bring that experience to bear on the actual pitch. Get the sense this is unofficially almost a player-coach role.",

Our crystal ball says: season-long loan somewhere in La Liga.",

      "41) Harrison Ashby (Newcastle)\nStill yet to make a competitive appearance for Newcastle since his move from West Ham, and at 23 can surely no longer rely on ‘promising youngster’ status. Make-or-break season, you feel. And a sub-optimal start.",

Werder Bremen are apparently keen.",

      "27) Owen Bevan (Bournemouth)\nHighly-rated Wales U21 centre-back has seen injuries hamper his progression to the first team, whether that’s at Bournemouth themselves or somewhere else on loan. If he stays fit, could yet get a chance this season given the way pretty much Bournemouth’s entire defence was picked off in the summer.",

      "",
      "24) Jamaal Lascelles (Newcastle)\nThe club activated a contract extension last season, but with Lascelles having now apparently slipped to, at best, fifth-choice centre-back it wouldn’t be a huge shock to see Newcastle’s longest-serving current player moved on over the next 10 days.",
      "",
      "23) Reiss Nelson (Arsenal)\nArsenal would like to sell him, Fulham would like to have him back. Should be simple, but the Cottagers favour another loan for an injury-prone player entering the final two years of his contract while Arsenal would prefer something more permanent. It screams loan-with-option on September 1, frankly.",
      "",
      "22) Mike Tresor (Burnley)\nRestricted to one substitute appearance in the FA Cup across the whole of last season. It’s just never quite happened for the winger at Turf Moor and having been prominently involved in pre-season was nowhere to be seen in the matchday squad at Tottenham, suggesting a departure over the next couple of weeks is surely the likely outcome here.",
      "",
      "21) Ethan Pinnock (Brentford)\nHas seen it all across six years at Brentford and you’d imagine he remains a welcome familiar sight after a summer of upheaval and flux for the Bees. Played 32 matches in Brentford’s first Premier League season, then 30, 29 and 22 in the subsequent three. No great surprise to see those numbers continue on that trend this season, but he was still on the bench for every game he was available last term.",
      "",
      "20) Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nCurrently sat with his trotters up on close to 200 grand a week. You can only be so miffed about that. Chelsea’s transfer policy is not his fault, and he’s another one whose wildly generous contract terms make him extremely awkward to shift no matter how surplus to requirements he becomes.",
      "",
      "19) Axel Disasi (Chelsea)\nDoes appear among the more shiftable of the 25/26 Chelsea bomb squad. Spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa and there must surely be a Premier League suitor out there that works for all parties. Also not one of the Chelsea outcasts on the very daftest money, putting him within the wage structure of most non-crazy Premier League clubs. Most obviously and necessarily Bournemouth given the scale of their defensive losses this summer.",
      "",
      "18) Albert Sambi Lokonga (Arsenal)\nSevilla didn’t take up the option to make his loan permanent at the end of last season, so Lokonga is back in career limbo. They’re not Man United-level, but Arsenal are low-key bad at getting fringe players out the door.",
      "",
      "17) Alejandro Garnacho (Man United)\nChelsea or nothing has been Garnacho’s mantra all summer. Could actually end up being nothing. Can Chelsea get Prick Protection?",
      "",
      "16) Illan Meslier (Leeds)\nHigh-profile errors last season didn’t cost Leeds in the end, but have cost Meslier. Firmly replaced as first choice by Lucas Perri and not even on the bench against Everton. A return to France seems the likeliest outcome here.",
      "",
      "15) Jadon Sancho (Man United)\nEverything appears to be agreed with Roma for a loan-with-obligation, and we’re not quite sure what Sancho is waiting for as his ill-fated United career meanders to an acrimonious close. We should all be hacked off at this waste of an obvious talent, but not sure where exactly Sancho can reasonably now direct his own ire without asking himself uncomfortable questions.",
      "",
      "14) Konstantinos Tsimikas (Liverpool)\nNow behind Milos Kerkez as well as Andy Robertson in the left-back pecking order at Anfield, with Fulham, Leeds and Nottingham Forest all keen to offer him a more straightforward route to Premier League minutes, but he could yet be retained at Liverpool for squad depth purposes.",
      "",
      "13) Tyrell Malacia (Man United)\nPart of the bloated United Bomb Squad, but not perhaps a villain in the same way as certain other members of that cohort. Malacia’s crime, such as it is, is to be not quite good enough. He also wasn’t quite good enough for PSV, where he spent the second half of last season on loan.",
      "",
      "12) Tariq Lamptey (Brighton)\nHas made over 100 Premier League appearances for the Seagulls and signed a one-year contract extension in the summer, but could yet move on before the window closes. Everton have been sniffing around, by all accounts.",
      "",
      "11) Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton)\nLooks certain to join the Brighton exodus; the only question is where, for how long, and/or for how much. The list of clubs reportedly interested is a long and glamorous one with Spurs, Borussia Dortmund, Bayer Leverkusen, Roma and also, in fairness, Leeds, West Ham and Forest all credited with interest of some sort or other in the Argentine playmaker this summer.",
      "",
      "10) Carney Chukwuemeka (Chelsea)\nChelsea are holding out for a permanent sale, and want somewhere close to the £40m release clause in his contract. Borussia Dortmund wanted another loan move, and now Juventus are reportedly interested having allowed Douglas Luiz to join Nottingham Forest on loan.",
      "",
      "9) Emerson (West Ham)\nMarseille are keen on the left-back who played 31 Premier League games last season but has apparently fallen way down the pecking order at the London Stadium. Which really might be a blessing.",
      "",
      "8) Antony (Man United)\nDesperately wants to return to Real Betis, where he enjoyed himself so much on loan last season, and is clearly willing to wait until the very last minute if necessary to give that move every chance of coming to fruition, no matter how much United might have preferred a swifter solution.",
      "",
      "7) Oleksandr Zinchenko (Arsenal)\nFulham, Porto, Fenerbahce and Real Betis have all been linked but no solution appears imminent for the Ukrainian as he enters the final year of his Arsenal contract.",
      "",
      "6) Rasmus Hojlund (Man United)\nErik Ten Hag continues to haunt Manchester United, apparently closing off one exit route for Hojlund by selling Victor Boniface to one-time Hojlund-suitors Milan. Surely someone somewhere must want a striker who doesn’t really score goals but runs about a bit while secretly being far taller than you expect.",
      "",
      "5) Ben Chilwell (Chelsea)\nA member of last year’s bomb squad and back hanging around the training ground after Crystal Palace opted against making his loan move permanent. Genuinely quite daft from all concerned this hasn’t been sorted out more swiftly and permanently.",
      "",
      "4) Patrick Bamford (Leeds)\nHas been told he is not in Daniel Farke’s plans and is free to find a new club with just a year left on his contract. Leeds’ understandable concerns around Bamford’s injury history are nevertheless slightly dented by signing Dominic Calvert-Lewin as his direct replacement.",
      "",
      "3) Yoane Wissa (Brentford)\n‘We’ve made a decision that he’s not available after a very disrupted pre-season,’ was future-Sporcle-scupperer Keith Andrews’ statement ahead of the Nottingham Forest game. “I’ve been very clear on the situation as head coach: I want Yoane in the building.” But not, at this time, on the pitch. Has probably played his last game for the club.",
      "",
      "2) Jakub Kiwior (Arsenal)\nNo shame in being unable to shift William Saliba or Gabriel Magalhaes from the starting XI, but slipping behind Cristhian Mosquera and out of the full-strength matchday squad altogether might sharpen Kiwior’s focus on finding a new club. Although, funnily enough, also didn’t make the matchday squad on the opening day last season, before being in every single one of the remaining 37, so maybe it’s fine actually.",
      "",
      "1) Alexander Isak (Newcastle)\nWe’ve scoured the internet and can find no mention of Isak anywhere, meaning his absence from the opening-day draw with Aston Villa is a complete mystery. Perhaps some things man is not meant to know.",
      "He can be – and is – very pissed off indeed that he’s missing the start of this season, but should really be aiming almost every drop of that boiled piss in a different direction.",

      "Should they sell each of those players, they should make a decent sum of money, to potentially but some new talent.",

      "“I don’t think it’s going to lead anywhere, because Chelsea don’t want to sell. That’s another player, though, that Manchester United appreciate. It’s nothing more than that at this stage.”",
      "It is unsurprising that Chelsea don’t want to lose Santos. After going out on loan to Strasbourg last season, where he scored 10 Ligue 1 goals and assisted four more, he played four times in the Club World Cup for the Blues in the summer, assisting once, and came off the bench in this season’s Premier League opener.",

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Manchester City) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Sunderland) – £50.4m",

      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Arsenal are the only team who have had every possible game so far selected for broadcast:",

      "Manchester United have reportedly picked out their ‘dream target’ from another Premier League side, and the star man is open to a move to Old Trafford.",
      "United have been very active in the summer window. They have spent over £200million so far, with more than half of that going on Premier League stars Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The Red Devils are clearly eager to ensure they can compete in the Premier League – after a 15th-placed finish last season – by landing experienced talents.",
      "That is also true of Carlos Baleba, who has had two good seasons in English football, but United are seemingly aware the signing of the £100million-plus-rated midfielder is not plausible right now.",
      "As such, our friends at TEAMtalk report the Red Devils have picked out a different ‘dream target,’ also from within the Premier League.",
      "United have long been known to be admirers of Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, and it’s said they dream of bringing him to Old Trafford.",
      "They have been given positive signs in that pursuit, as it’s reported Wharton would be open to a move to United, where he is drawn due to their storied history, and the vision of boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The manager himself is said to see the midfielder as ideal for his system, offering vision and control in midfield.",
      "Though he’d be open to joining, the report also states Wharton is ‘deeply respectful’ of Palace. The Eagles themselves are also in no rush to sell the midfielder, who has played 45 times for them since joining from Blackburn in January 2024.",
      "His contract runs until 2029, and as a result, Palace know they are in a very strong negotiating position, and could demand upwards of £60million.",
      "That, though, has not deterred United. The report states there has been a caution that it would be ‘unwise’ to rule out a formal approach from the Red Devils before the window closes.",
      "However, similar was said about Baleba, and for this summer at least, things seem to have died down.",
      "Indeed, it’s been known that United are going to struggle to finance deals without sales this summer, and with essentially no money being made, they have been unable to lodge a bid for Baleba.",
      "Though it looks as if Wharton will cost £40million or so less than the Brighton man, the Red Devils might well still struggle to finance that deal this summer in their current state.",
      "Real Madrid could complicate Premier League transfer plans this summer with a move for a sought-after Crystal Palace star.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘willing to invest’ around £130m to ‘close two signings’, while they plot a move for a Real Madrid star.",
      "After their pursuit of Carlos Baleba went cold, former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has given his old club another target they should go after.",
      "Xabi Alonso has his eye on two Premier League midfielders as Real Madrid ‘open the door’ to a double swoop which would cost Los Blancos £142m.",
      "Liverpool are reportedly the ‘favourites’ to land the Crystal Palace star, who’s ‘ready to wait’ for a Reds bid rather than moving to Tottenham.",

      "With Manchester United, there is hardly ever a middle ground but instead an ever expanding extremes of a scale",
      "Let me explain.",
      "Last season, United had a clear problem with their goalscoring and build-up play - that was simply highlighted by their 44 goals scored in the Premier League, only three teams scored fewer.",
      "So what did United do in this window? They spent around £200m on addressing that problem with the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "After a positive first performance of the season in their defeat to Arsenal - much of the conversation has now been centred around the opposite end of the pitch with the goalkeeping department the latest area to be under focus after what seemed to be a mistake by Altay Bayindir against Mikel Arteta's side.",
      "Ruben Amorim admitted in his first news conference of the season that he learned a lot last season. This included realising just how much he needs to protect his side from the amount of noise around the club on a weekly basis.",
      "\"For me, the only way to protect myself and my players it to tell them not to see anything.",
      "\"You have to be like a monk, especially when you have problems and then I try to present the facts because sometimes there is a narrative that is not true.",
      "\"Altay made one mistake, but last year he had very good performances, so I try to tell that to the players and then try to battle that narrative.",
      "\"But in the end, it's with the players, they have to enjoy their life, go to work, enjoy their family and try not to see anything on the TV or on the internet.\"",
      "Many of the players have highlighted that they feel the vibe and bond around the team has been different.",
      "Yes, there is some hesitancy to believe that after previous managers and false dawns, but there does seem to be genuine optimism after the re-opening of their training ground, new and exciting players joining the club and a positive first performance against Arsenal.",
      "Amorim said: \"Last year, sometimes I was worried going to the games, but now I'm excited, it is completely different.\"",
      "\"We suffered together so much (last season) and that can bond people - the spirit is really good.\"",
      "\"When you feel the team is playing well, you get confident and you feel more free to play and if you feel more free to play, you are happier.",
      "\"If you are happier, your day-to-day is better and it's like a snowball.\"",
      "Amorim's attacking options have been bolstered with Premier League tried and tested Mbeumo and Cunha - both who can play as No 10s or as the main striker to share the load alongside the young Sesko.",
      "The threat they showed against Arsenal, whether it was Cunha's mazy runs or Mbeumo's movements in behind, left fans at Old Trafford with a renewed sense of optimism and Amorim feels the same.",
      "\"We have different options this year, but sometimes football is more than just on the pitch,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"They [Mbeumo and Cunha] are coming in at a moment where the spirit is different, the place is different - sometimes we have a lot of very good players but the scars were there and that influenced the dynamic of the team.",
      "\"They can help us, not just on the pitch but off the pitch too, I feel the guys are more free because they were not here in the very, very difficult moments - they are seeing a different thing.\"",
      "A big component of whether Amorim's United will truly be a \"different thing\" this season could be the young Slovenian Sesko - who Amorim had called 'football obsessed'.",
      "He had already spoken about the potential of Sesko, 22, but I wondered - how exciting can it be for Amorim himself to work and develop a young player like the Slovenian?",
      "Amorim explained: \"When you are in a club like this, you want to have the best players but you also have to imagine the future.",
      "\"That is so exciting - I like to know the players, I like to see the videos of the players and to try to get all the information, but you want that confirmation and I felt Sesko was even better than what I was thinking.",
      "\"I have to be careful, Sesko is going to be our striker for many, many years so we need to put that in his head and let him settle down, to stay calm and enjoy his day because he's really like you said, obsessed.",
      "\"I'm really happy - not just with him but with Cunha, Diego (Leon), and Mbeumo - we know that we have the players and we know that in our future we are going to have that base and that is really important for us.\"",
      "We are only one game into the season, but if United can replicate their performance against Arsenal most weeks, especially without the distraction of European football, it could present a promising opportunity for United to improve on last season's 15th-place finish.",
      "However, United need to earn that optimism from those outside the gates of Carrington and, as Amorim said previously, it is only up to them to fight and change their own narrative.",
      "They will only do that by showing up on the journey rather than focusing on the destination.",
      "\"Success is to win titles, and we don't know if we are going to achieve that (this season),\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We are not in the moment that we can say we are clearly fighting for the league - we just need to get the small steps and the small steps is to prepare every game like it's a final.",
      "\"We want to be really competitive, trying to dominate games, trying to score goals and not get our fans bored to see our games… so if we have the small things and we put check, check, check - in the end, it's going to be better.",
      "\"I think everyone knows that we have a goal - not for this season but in three years to win the Premier League title.",
      "\"We are going to do these steps to reach that goal, but in this club, you know that every week the narrative is going to be different so we need to be prepared for that, block the noise, do the job and try to win games.\""

      "Matheus Cunha arrives with the usual broad smile, introduces himself to everyone for the interview, and starts to casually chat about football.",
      "It takes a few minutes to start recording - you don't want to interrupt his excitement when he starts a conversation. The big news on TV of Eberechi Eze's impending move to Arsenal, his first few weeks at Manchester United, tactical challenges - all even before our crew press 'record'. Cunha's vibrant personality is the first impression you'll get of him.",
      "\"But when I go to the pitch, I always know why I'm here. I always think back at all the hard things that built me to be this guy. These kinds of things cannot play against me, they need to play with me. I always try to manage the psychology. It's not easy! But I always try.\"",
      "The energy and fire Cunha shows on the pitch helped to produce a good debut for Manchester United against Arsenal, when he produced four shots and four dribbles and was arguably their best player. Enough to excite fans and brush away concerns from some, whose eyebrows were raised when he signed due to his recent disciplinary record.",
      "Last season, for Wolves, he missed out on five games across two different suspensions. The first, a two-game ban, after he was found to have acted in an \"improper manner\" following an altercation with a member of Ipswich staff after a match in December.",
      "The same charge followed in March, earning another three matches on the sidelines after lashing out at defender Milos Kerkez three times in an FA Cup game with Bournemouth.",
      "What does he think to people who say he has a temper? \"Honestly, I don't really care about it,\" he replies. \"I think every single thing I did in the game is out of love for the game.",
      "\"I'm very passionate to win games, to make my team and myself better to achieve things. I think inside of me I always believe in something more.",
      "\"And when I bring this to United now, it's something that pushes me forward. Of course we can make mistakes, and I made some mistakes. I am sorry, I apologise for that. But it's always with a good intention.",
      "\"I always try to do something good, and maybe pass a little bit (he means 'to go overboard'). I never put myself in [positions to make people] question my character, because inside I know who I am.\"",
      "When asked if he is the type of player who likes to play on the edge, he is quick to respond: \"Yes, honestly. Everyone talks about the pressure in this club, but I've always wanted to be here.",
      "\"Of course, I understand it's one of the biggest clubs in the world. The pressure is big, but I always try to feel the pressure like a privilege. I always dreamed to come here, and then when I'm here, I can't have this excuse of the pressure being too much, you know. It's a privilege.\"",
      "We are at the reception of Manchester United's renovated training ground. Right behind us sit replicas of some of the most important trophies the club has won - a club he watched back in Brazil when he was a kid.",
      "\"I try not to look around at the trophies\", he laughs. \"I hope I can build my story here with these players.\"",
      "It has been a long path already for the 26-year-old. One of the difficulties he mentioned that helped shape his personality was leaving Brazil so early to become a professional footballer.",
      "At the age of 18, after playing at the academy for Coritiba FC, he was scouted by Sion and moved to Switzerland to sign his first pro contract. Spells at RB Leipzig, Hertha Berlin and Atletico Madrid followed, until he joined Wolves in 2023.",
      "European football shaped him as a player, and he says it helped him develop more tactical awareness and invest in his physicality. As a kid, he played mostly as a No 10, but during his career he also had successful spells as a striker.",
      "His versatility, alongside his goalscoring record, attracted Man Utd, and he seems pleased to play as one of Ruben Amorim's No 10s.",
      "\"It's something that Ruben, when he brought me here, chatted a lot about,\" he reveals. \"I think my perfect position to play is around the middle, a little bit between the midfield and the striker.",
      "\"So, a No 10, I think this is the position that is easier to understand, behind the forward, where you can create much more space. This is the position they brought me here for, it is somewhere I feel comfortable, and I hope I can bring some creativity to the team.\"",
      "During his period in Europe, he also worked on his language skills. Besides his native Portuguese, there is English, Spanish, French, as well as a little bit of German and Italian - five in total, because: \"If you put my German and my Italian together, it counts as only one!\"",
      "They are of course important tools to communicate with team-mates and a respectable list of managers, including Julian Nagelsmann, Ralf Rangnick and Diego Simeone.",
      "He always speaks warmly about Gary O'Neil at Wolves and how he helped him to develop in different positions. Then there is Amorim, who played an important role in his move to Manchester.",
      "\"Ruben is someone that helped me a lot to come here, explaining how my position would be, how I can bring him something that he wants,\" he says. \"I feel very adapted, very comfortable. He's someone who always pushes me forward.",
      "\"I love having someone to push me a little bit more. We never fight, but we have, like, some conversations when I say something, and then they says 'no, it's this way' and I understand and go forward!",

      "🔴 Mbeumo's running power🔄 O'Riley to replace Joao Pedro? 🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United face Fulham on Super Sunday hoping to build on the positives from their narrow loss to Arsenal. Bryan Mbeumo's performance was one of them. His debut, following a strong pre-season, underlined his potential to transform their attack.",
      "It could be seen in his very first actions of the game.",
      "Inside the opening minute, Mbeumo controlled a looping clearance in his own half then drove Manchester United deep into Arsenal territory on the break. Soon afterwards, he was latching onto a Bruno Fernandes through-ball and testing David Raya.",
      "Manchester United ended up dominating possession against one of the Premier League's top teams for the first time in a decade. It was when attacking quickly and directly, though, that they looked most dangerous. Matheus Cunha helped but Mbeumo was key.",
      "Last season, Manchester United directed a far higher percentage of attacks down the left than the right but the emphasis switched completely against Arsenal as they looked for Mbeumo at every opportunity. The former Brentford winger is their outlet now.",
      "He finished the game having had more shots than any other player. He ranked top for touches in the opposition box and dribbles too. But it is his movement that makes it all possible.",
      "Mbeumo made more attacking runs than anyone else in the division at Brentford last season and he occupied the same spot in the rankings on the opening weekend of the new campaign.",
      "The 26-year-old has given Manchester United a new level of running power. His total of 30 attacking runs in his very first appearance for the club was only bettered by Manchester United players on five occasions in the whole of last season in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim has said since his appointment last year that he wants his side to have more possession and thereby more control. But increasing their threat on the counter and on transitions is also seen as crucial. It is already clear that Mbeumo makes it possible.",
      "Against Arsenal, Manchester United totalled four direct attacks and three fast breaks, a combined total beaten only by Liverpool and Bournemouth on the opening weekend and a significant increase on the side's averages under Amorim last season.",
      "The trouble, of course, was that they were unable to make them count. The next challenge is to find a ruthless edge, starting at Craven Cottage. But Mbeumo's impact is evident, even after one game. Manchester United have glimpsed what they can become.",
      "Matt O'Riley assumed penalty-taking duties for Brighton against Fulham last weekend following Joao Pedro's departure to Chelsea. Playing in the No 10 role vacated by the Brazilian, he offered a similar level of off-the-ball industry too.",
      "His total of 66 pressures in the 1-1 draw with Marco Silva's side was the eighth-highest among Premier League players on the opening weekend. Crucially, O'Riley offered quality as well as quantity. No player made more pressures leading to turnovers. His industry helped create opportunities for Brighton to hurt Fulham.",
      "Fabio Hurzeler praised his all-round contribution afterwards. \"He is doing a lot of work out of possession, so we are not only happy to have him because of the goal,\" he said. The Brighton boss will hope for more of the same from him against Everton on Super Sunday.",
      "Injuries made it difficult for O'Riley to showcase those physical qualities anything like as much as he would have liked in his first season at Brighton following his £25m arrival from Celtic last year. He was limited to only 11 starts in the Premier League.",
      "But despite interest from Italian clubs Napoli, Atalanta and Roma this summer, the early evidence this season suggests the club would be wise to keep hold of him as they adapt to life without his former team-mate, off the ball as well as on it.",
      "Nottingham Forest have lost Anthony Elanga but they have gained Dan Ndoye. The 24-year-old marked his debut with a goal against Brentford and could cause Crystal Palace problems next.",
      "The opening column of the season featured analysis of Martin Zubimendi's Arsenal role, Matheus Cunha's potential to help Patrick Dorgu thrive, and Ismaila Sarr's value to Crystal Palace.",

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows thinks Fulham will inflict another defeat on Man Utd on Sunday.",
      "My first port of call whenever a key player leaves or suffers a serious injury is the with and without data to try and quantify how much a team will miss that player's output. Well, since the start of the 23/24 season, Eberechi Eze - on his way to Arsenal - hasn't started 21 games in the Premier League and in that time Palace's win percentage goes from 40 per cent to 19 per cent and their points per game drops from 1.5 to just 1.0 per game.",
      "Oliver Glasner has a difficult job in keeping confidence and mentality levels high within his squad after losing such an important and well-liked player.",
      "Forest are a trustworthy team as you know exactly what you're going to get in that they're very good in both boxes, and are led impeccably by Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo in defence - one of the best defensive pairings in Europe.",
      "This looks a great time to head to Selhurst Park and the away win at 21/10 with Sky Bet does appeal.",
      "One lazy narrative that has stuck out during the pre-season chat is how Everton could struggle without the fortress of Goodison Park and may suffer from new stadium nerves. However, the last five teams in the top two tiers of English football that have moved stadiums possess a healthy record across their first five games.",
      "From those 25 games, they won 16 of them, losing just four.",
      "Hill Dickinson Stadium has been strategically built to keep the atmosphere hot and hostile and when Everton fans turn up the noise, they remain one of the most passionate set of fans in the country. Brighton are a team overrated by the markets in my view and the 19/10 with Sky Bet on Everton starting with a win at their new home looks a solid wager.",
      "The market likes what it saw from Manchester United against Arsenal based on their win price here. They are 21/20 with Sky Bet although it doesn't feel like particularly smart money is driving the United price into what it is. They still looked very timid in central midfield without the ball and doubts remain about whether the wing-backs - a key cog in any 3-5-2 system - provide enough attacking output to turn United into a functional and exciting team.",
      "I like backing Fulham when they are overlooked. Marco Silva's men are mostly ignored by the market but they took 30 of their 54 points last season against top-half teams. That's a huge return and one that made them very profitable to back as outsiders when the price was right. You can get 6/4 with Sky Bet here on Fulham on the draw no bet market meaning stakes are refunded if the game ends level.",
      "Eddie Howe is doing a great job at using the Alexander Isak situation to bring the club together as best he can.",
      "When St James' Park smells disrespect, it bites back. You can expect the atmosphere to be a bearpit on Monday. Every Liverpool touch booed. Newcastle players pumped to play aggressively from the first whistle as they look to utilise that hotbed of noise to their advantage.",
      "And that's when the Toon are at their most dangerous.",
      "Despite the win vs Bournemouth, Liverpool appeared more vulnerable on the break than last season as they faced more fast breaks (5) in that game than in any Premier League game at Anfield last season.",
      "And Newcastle are built to counter-attack with a front three of Anthony Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Harvey Barnes perfectly equipped to hit Liverpool in transition. The hosts look a great bet in the double chance market at 4/5 with Sky Bet.",

      "They will need to improve because it wasn't the greatest of displays. They had to rely on a set piece again, but they got their goal, and the defence was rock solid. They got themselves over the line for a vital three points, especially with the game against Liverpool coming up soon.",
      "It was a must-win game with Liverpool away, Man City at home and Newcastle away coming up, but they will have to play better to get results in those games.",

      "Special mention for Martin Odegaard. I thought he was back to his best.",
      "There were a couple of times he didn't have the options on the counter, and he also made a couple of wrong decisions, but he was so much better than last season.",

      "He needs some support. If opposition teams pick him up and mark him well, I'm not sure what threat Chelsea have. Pedro Neto and Jamie Gittens have pace, but they struggled to beat their defenders on Sunday.",
      "But he also has to have a bit of faith in the team. He needs to stay as high up the pitch as he can because when he gets frustrated, he gets deeper and deeper. He goes shorter and shorter to get the ball and it's so difficult to hurt a team from inside his own half.",
      "It's hard for Palmer. You've got have runners around when you get the ball and for me, he hasn't got those.",
      "It's not just all on Palmer because Enzo Maresca has to come up with solutions too. He has to work out a way to get him the ball in areas where he can hurt teams. But for Palmer, patience is key. He has to wait for the ball a bit more instead of dropping deep to come and get it.",
      "You cannot hurt anybody on the halfway line. He needs the ball in and around the box where he's special.",
      "I'm not buying it just yet with Spurs.",

      "Should Riccardo Calafiori's winning goal for Arsenal have been disallowed for a foul on goalkeeper Altay Bayindir? Should Matheus Cunha have won a penalty after a foul by William Saliba?",
      "Also, Dermot discusses all the other major refereeing talking points from the opening weekend.",
      "INCIDENT: Matheus Cunha went to ground in the penalty area after a challenge from William Saliba. Did Saliba get the ball? Referee said no penalty.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: I wasn't convinced it was a penalty. What I would say is if it is going to be a penalty it's one the referee is going to give. VAR will not get involved in this.",
      "\"How is that not a penalty? It's a guaranteed penalty.",
      "\"If it happens on the halfway line it is a free kick.",
      "\"Saliba has hit his foot and the ball has gone nowhere. If Saliba isn't there Cunha doesn't go down. It's a penalty.\"",
      "INCIDENT: William Saliba stood in close contact with Altay Bayındır as Arsenal score at Old Trafford - was it a foul?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: Not a foul. Not a foul at all. If anything the goalkeeper puts his hand on the player.",
      "\"He hasn't been strong enough, he's caught out of position and that mistake has cost Man United the game. If he thinks it's a foul, go down, at least you've got a chance of winning a free kick. It's just poor, you need to be stronger.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Eberechi Eze free kick disallowed by VAR after Marc Guehi interfered with the wall.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: This is the law. If a wall is set up with three or more players, opposition players have to be a metre from it. Often you see forwards standing in front of the wall. In this case, Guehi is stood between two players.",
      "Where they set up, Guehi initially is not deemed to be in the wall, he's between two players to the right of the wall, but as the ball is kicked, Guehi's movement is towards Caicedo and without doubt, he's not a metre from it.",
      "The IFAB Laws of the Game for 2025/26 state: \"Where three or more defending team players form a 'wall', all attacking team players must remain at least 1 m (1 yd) from the 'wall' until the ball is in play.\n\n\n\"If, when a free-kick is taken, an attacking team player is less than 1 m (1 yd) from a 'wall' formed by three or more defending team players, an indirect free-kick is awarded.\"",
      "You don't see it often. Most free kicks don't result in a goal, and because this one does, VAR has to check it.",
      "It was all about Caicedo moving into the wall and Guehi being in contact with him.",
      "The genie is out the bottle now.",
      "Micah Richards said: \"There can't be any complaints but it feels like VAR is anti-goals.\"",
      "Roy Keane added: \"Attacking teams now need to be aware of this rule. We see players in there blocking and being a nuisance all the time.",
      "\"Guehi's almost gone too far in being a nuisance and shoving players about. He just needed to do it a little bit.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Senesi avoids punishment after appearing to handle the ball as the last defender.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: I think this is a really interesting situation. The VAR, for me, has looked at it too quickly and cleared it.",
      "I think he's seen the ball fly up off Senesi and has not watched the second part.",
      "He's seen the ball hit the elbow off the knee and stopped looking, he hasn't looked for the second swipe. If he sends the referee to the screen, the referee has all options. He probably sends Senesi off because Huge Ekitike is going to be away. The only doubt is, is it too far from goal? But this is a class forward.",
      "If it goes to the screen he would have been sent off. It was a mistake and fortunately it didn't affect the outcome of the game.",
      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher on how referee Anthony Taylor deal with the incident involving Antoine Semenyo at Anfield:\n\n\n\"Firstly, it's terrible what happened.\n\n\n\"However, from the referee's point of view, absolutely first class.\n\n\nWhat I really liked was he got both managers together really quickly and explained what had happened.\n\n\n\"They identified where it came from and it was dealt with really quickly.\n\n\n\"The referee was first class because he kept everyone aware of what he was doing. he made it very apparent that protocol was followed and the fourth official was noting everything down.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Burnley goalkeeper Dubravka gets penalised for holding the ball for more than eight seconds, resulting in an opposition corner.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: If you watch, he does take too long. I get a bit concerned with the eight seconds, because we don't want to have to get the stop watch out. But he's making no attempt to release the ball.",
      "It's a deterrent. That's why the rule is there. No referee wants to have to apply that rule, they want goalkeepers to get rid of the ball and keep the game moving faster.",
      "\"I don't know why he's holding onto the ball for so long, it's about 12 seconds.\"",
