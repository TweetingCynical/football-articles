      "Pep Guardiola and Erik ten Hag pursued Ederson and Andre Onana respectively and the motivation was simple - both goalkeepers would evolve the way their manager's wanted to play.",
      "The two tacticians decided after a year at the helm that they needed to upgrade their shotstoppers if they were to achieve what they set out to do. Manchester City's former goalkeeper departed English shores this summer having put himself in the conversation of the Premier League's best ever goalkeepers.",
      "Onana meanwhile leaves in a similarly live debate, discussing who may be the worst goalkeeping investment in England's top flight. Ederson set City back £35million when they signed him from Benfica in 2017.",
      "If players are judged on a value for money basis then few have paid their fee back more than the Brazilian, who immediately did exactly what he said on the tin. He's ball-playing ability immediately evident as he sprayed passes in the same ilk as former team-mate Kevin De Bruyne, all from his own 18 yard box. His exploits being compared to a quarterback such were his vision and accuracy.",
      "Within months Ederson had clips going viral as he controlled balls out of the air in his own half before passing backwards such was his advanced position. His feet were so impressive that when City found themselves in the midst of a penalty-scoring crisis the goalkeeper was touted as a possible solution.",
      "In stark contrast to that Onana was raising his own red flags on debut. The goalkeeper flying out in stoppage time on his first outing with United 1-0 up before clattering into Wolves ' Sasa Kalajdzic. A VAR check somehow saving him - something the PGMOL would later admit was an error.",
      "The mistakes kept on coming as teams found ways to breach United's goal with relative ease. Even if Onana was more capable than David de Gea with his feet, it certainly wasn't worth the fear he had put into his back four. Ten Hag was left to stick by him more through stubbornness than belief.",
      "The then United boss launched a staunch - and questionable - defence of Onana months after his arrival. Ten Hag claiming: \"If you analyse it well then you see he is the second-best goalkeeper in the Premier League.\" This was a Premier League that included Ederson, Alisson and Emi Martinez among his goalkeepers.",
      "City's former shotstopper can boast three successive Golden Gloves on his CV, partly owing to his stellar backline, but equally reflective of the commanding presence he continued to be in between the sticks for an all-conquering City side.",
      "His exit this summer came after eight years with an acceptance that the two parties had done all they could together and City needed to bring in new blood. The Ederson-era in Manchester will go down in the club's history books with Gianluigi Donnarumma his replacement.",
      "Turkey is his new home after making the move to Fenerbahce. And in the Super Lig he will now be joined by Onana himself with the United goalkeeper making a somewhat surprising loan switch to Trabzonspor. Ruben Amorim had shown no desire to move on the Cameroonian, even if he was eyeing a new goalkeeper during the summer.",
      "The Red Devils signed Senne Lammens on deadline day but still very much planned to have Onana as an option. But a route out of Manchester has emerged and, perhaps tellingly, United haven't stood in his way.",
      "A heavyweight club allowing their, apparent, first choice goalkeeper to leave is a move that speaks volumes in itself. Onana's only outing this season saw him make another howler as United were embarrassed by Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup.",
      "And so he'll call Trabzonspor home for the upcoming season. His debut coming against Fenerbahce as they boast their new goalkeeper, Ederson, who will also be making his first outing.",
      "Two goalkeepers who have called Manchester home now get to enjoy the sunny surroundings provided by the Turkish climate. But there's no doubt that Onana arrives under a cloud. Amorim has not yet faced the media to explain why he let the 29-year-old leave the club.",
      "Faith appeared to be dwindling with Altay Bayindir starting all three Premier League games thus far. The signing of a up and coming goalkeeper is also the furthest thing you can get from a glowing endorsement. But the nature of the loan agreement means Onana will be back in Manchester next year.",
      "So whilst Ederson can embrace his new life in the Super Lig safe in the knowledge he'll go down as a modern day pioneer for how goalkeepers can be used, Onana needs to somehow show that his last two years at United were rogue outliers in his career.",
      "What he's lacked in performance he's made up for in defiance. The ex-Ajax and Inter goalkeeper said in 2023 during his struggles: \"You want to tell me in six months the best goalkeeper in the Champions League last season can become the worst in the world? Nah. Everything is temporary. I know it'll be alright. If not today, it will be tomorrow, if not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.\"",
      "Safe to say, those in Manchester are still waiting for that day to come, and it certainly didn't happen when he said it would.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester City welcomes Manchester United to the Etihad this weekend for the highly anticipated Manchester derby. Recent meetings between these two sides have been entertaining affairs, with both teams scoring in four of the last five encounters and over 2.5 goals being recorded in five of the last six. City have been formidable at home, winning five of their last six league matches at the Etihad, while United have struggled on their travels, failing to win any of their last six away league games and losing four of those.",
      "Erling Haaland enters the derby in red-hot form, having scored five goals in a single game for Norway during the international break, and adding three goals in as many appearances for City so far this season. The Sky Blues, however, have made an uncharacteristically shaky start to their campaign, with one win and two defeats from their opening three matches. After a resounding 4-0 victory at Wolves, City suffered back-to-back losses against Tottenham (0-2) and Brighton (1-2), results that have increased the pressure on Pep Guardiola and his squad.",
      "This is the first time under Guardiola that City have lost two of their opening three league games, and coming off a season without silverware in 2024-25, there is mounting pressure on the Catalan manager, who could be entering his final season at the club. Nevertheless, City will take confidence from United’s own struggles and will be optimistic about securing all three points in front of their home fans.",
      "Guardiola will be hopeful that Phil Foden can recover from a foot injury in time for the derby, but Omar Marmoush, Savinho, Rayan Cherki, Josko Gvardiol, and Mateo Kovacic are all expected to miss out, while John Stones faces a late fitness test.",
      "Manchester United, meanwhile, come into this fixture with a record of one win, one draw, and one loss from their first three games. New manager Ruben Amorim is already under significant pressure, as his side have exhibited many of the same weaknesses that contributed to last season’s disappointing league finish. United’s campaign began with a 0-1 defeat to Arsenal, followed by a 1-1 draw with Fulham and a narrow 3-2 win over Burnley before the international break. While there have been occasional signs of improvement, United remain vulnerable, and Amorim is still searching for the right formula with his team selections and tactics.",
      "For this match, United will be without new signing Matheus Cunha, a significant blow to their attacking options, while Mason Mount remains a doubt and could also miss out. United will need several players who have yet to make a real impact to step up if they are to come away with a result.",
      "All signs point to another difficult afternoon for United, and we expect City to take advantage of their rivals’ struggles and add further pressure on Amorim with a home victory.",

      "It's derby day in Manchester, with Ruben Amorim taking his side to the Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City on Sunday. It's a huge game for Manchester United, who are yet to click into gear this season.",
      "Altay Bayindir will start in goal for United, with Andre Onana having left on loan for Trabzonspor and £18.2million arrival Senne Lammens deemed not ready by Amorim. There could be a new goalkeeper for Manchester City, though, with Gianluigi Donnarumma having arrived from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "United picked up their first win of the season before the two-week international break, beating Burnley 3-2. But those three points came at a cost, with Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount picking up injuries. They will sit out of the City match, with Diogo Dalot also out injured.",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes has once again been forced to defend himself over criticism about his style of leadership. The 31-year-old has been targeted for his emotional approach on the pitch, but he says he won't change.",
      "“People have an opinion about me and I can't change that,” said Fernandes. “It's the way people want to judge you about what they see on most of the people, what they see on the pitch, some of them, what they see on the television, some of them what they see on interviews.",
      "“You know, I can't change that. They have the freedom to think the way they want about me, as I have the same freedom to think about them. But what I don't do is I don't judge people until I know them. They can. They can have an opinion about me and that's fine.\"",
      "Manchester City could attempt to exploit Bayindir's weakness from crosses and set pieces in the derby on Sunday afternoon according to Craig Burley.",
      "“With Bayindir, every set-piece I’m putting Haaland and every centre half on him and just swinging it under the crossbar for fun,” Burley told ESPN. “Hell, if Man City have got someone who takes long throws, I’m throwing it in Rory Delap style. I’m just piling it into the box because he’s absolutely hopeless at coming out and dealing with aerial balls – he’s shown that.”",
      "Amorim is confident that Bayindir is up to the task. He said: “We are in the moment that the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience but we also have to look at the present with a focus on the future so it is a bit of both. He will be ready.”",
      "Benjamin Sesko has struggled to make an impact in a Manchester United shirt so far. But Rene Aufhaser, a coach who worked with Sesko and Erling Haaland at Red Bull Salzburg, has backed him to come good.",
      "\"He will develop in the next one and two years, I'm sure. Erling reached his mark after his transfer from Dortmund to Man City and we will see. I am quite sure Benji will reach this mark after one or two years. But, of course, Erling is the top. He has 10 out of 10 from me.\"",

      "Mainoo has not started a Premier League game for United this season and asked to go out on loan before deadline day due to a lack of playing time, a request that was rejected.",
      "Midfielder Mainoo was left out of Thomas Tuchel's latest England squad due to his lack of game time, with the 20-year-old worried he could miss out on next year's World Cup in the USA.",
      "But Amorim warned Mainoo – who is in contention to start today's Manchester derby because of injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha – he needs to get better to win back his place.",
      "“I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that he is already done [the finished article],” said Amorim. “I think he can do so much better, he can improve a lot.",
      "“For some guys it [talent] is enough, but for him it's not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie. He will have opportunities like the other guys.",
      "“If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he's going to play and I've proved that already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot. He's a top, top player, but he can be so much better.”",
      "Mainoo scored United's winner in last year's 2-1 FA Cup final win over City at Wembley and started for England in their Euro 2024 final defeat to Spain by the same scoreline seven weeks later.",
      "Despite such a meteoric rise for club and country, Mainoo's progress has stalled under Amorim, who told the Stockport-born player it is up to him to prove the United boss wrong.",
      "“Sometimes it's the opinion of a coach,” said Amorim. “I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolves. Nowadays, you can see that Vitinha is maybe the best midfielder in the world.",
      "“The way I play is completely different from the last manager. I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal and you could feel the United team was really transitional.",
      "“Kobbie was the only guy who calmed the game down. Now we have other players who can calm the game down. We play a different game and sometimes I expect more from Kobbie - and I know he can give that.",
      "“I know that he started the final of the European Championships in a team that has a lot of talented players. Phil Foden played in that game, Cole Palmer was on the bench and Kobbie was playing. I know all that, but sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.",
      "“Kobbie is really good at controlling the game, but if he plays as an eight, he has to reach the box, then return and sometimes he has to cover a lot of space with just two [midfielders]. Bruno is doing that job and then sometimes it's just bad luck.",
      "“Bruno is the more influential player in the last few years and he’s been playing in that position. Kobbie could play as a six [a defensive midfielder], but sometimes he passes the ball and goes away, so we have to balance everything.",
      "“He has the technical ability, but he needs more pace. He needs to understand the position better. He needs to play at different speeds. Sometimes it's slower. Sometimes it's faster and I think he can improve on that.",
      "“Then he has to beat Bruno. He has to beat Casemiro. He has to beat Manuel Ugarte. They are also good players and so I need to choose.”",

      "Even in difficult moments in recent years, United have shown themselves capable of springing a derby day surprise and that’s left Guardiola wary - especially with their cross town rivals currently above them in the League table.",
      "Said Guardiola: “It always is (dangerous) against United. United is United - they have good players just look at what they spend in the last decade.",
      "“They can beat us, of course. Do we want to be beaten tomorrow? No, because we need the points, we need to break the rhythm of two defeats.",

      "Despite Manchester City’s Premier League dominance during Guardiola’s nine year reign, United have won four times at The Etihad while the Spaniard has been in charge.",

      "Martinez was left out of Aston Villa's matchday squad for their Premier League clash against Crystal Palace just a day before the deadline. Emery, at the time, refused to be drawn on the reasons for making that decision.",
      "In the end, United opted to swoop for Senne Lammens ahead of Martinez - with the former joining from Belgian side Royal Antwerp. That, in turn, has allowed Andre Onana to complete a loan move to Trabzonspor.",
      "Having stayed put at Villa, Martinez was back in their starting line-up for Saturday's Premier League clash against Everton at the Hill Dickinson Stadium. The game ended in a 0-0 draw, and Martinez was widely praised for keeping a clean sheet.",
      "\"Firstly, the goalkeeper, Martinez did a fantastic job. He saved us a lot of times.\"",
      "Emery added: \"We were defending with the ball, we were being disciplined and organised. Then we've have to improve offensively, as we are not scoring goals - but with this point I am happy. We are building the team and getting confidence and getting emotions together. This point is necessary to keep going.",

      "Unai Emery is aiming to end Jadon Sancho's England exile during the Manchester United outcast's time with Aston Villa. Sancho, 25, joined the Midlands side on a season-long loan towards the end of the transfer window.",
      "It was his third such move having been sent to both Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea over the past few campaigns. Chelsea had an obligation to buy him for £25m, but paid a £5m penalty to back out of that deal.",
      "And that has seen Sancho, yet again, look for pastures new with Aston Villa. Boss Emery already has high hopes for the winger having underlined his target to help Sancho return to England contention.",
      "Speaking during his pre-match press conference ahead of this weekend's clash with Everton, Emery said: \"Yes, of course, this is my objective, to get him back to his best - and if he does that, then he'll come back to the national team.",
      "\"Every player wants to be part of the national team. When he was in Borussia Dortmund, he performed fantastic. And he played with the national team 25 matches, more or less. Of course, he's still young.",
      "\"He's still being hungry to show his capacity to play with his skills, his qualities, and hopefully we can exploit here, again, his best.\"",
      "Sancho has 23 England caps to his name so far and scored three goals, but he's not made an appearance for the Three Lions since 2021. Current England boss Thomas Tuchel has yet to comment whether he would be willing to facilitate Sancho's return.",
      "But his predecessor as interim Lee Carsley did give an insight and claimed that regular football could, potentially, help Sancho find a way back into contention. He said: \"Jadon is a player that has huge potential who has hopefully found a home where he feels rated, he feels loved.\"",
      "He added: \"I think he just needs time now to play. I don't ever feel in a rush where a player [who] is doing well for three or four games should be in an England squad.”",
      "England were well stocked for wide options during the latest international break. Tuchel selected Eberechi Eze, Jarrod Bowen, Anthony Gordon and Marcus Rashford in the squad for World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia.",
      "England are back in action next month when they take on Wales in a friendly, and Latvia in a World Cup qualifier. And Sancho will certainly be aiming to catch the eye for Villa who are in Premier League, Carabao Cup and Europa League action before then.",

      "Sam Mather is still exploring his dwindling options to leave Manchester United after a move to Turkey collapsed.",
      "Mather came through the academy at Old Trafford, but has yet to make a senior appearance. He did travel with the first team on their pre-season tour in 2024, but has thus far failed to make the grade.",
      "The winger spent the second half of last season on loan with Tranmere and is hoping for another move to help kickstart his professional career.",
      "Kayserispor had agreed a permanent move for the youngster, with the fee, buyback clause and personal terms all given the green light. But that move will now have to wait until January, after United’s deadline was not met.",
      "He may still get his wish granted though, with BBC Sport claiming an imminent exit could still be on the cards. Serbia and Israel are the only two UEFA-registered leagues with windows open, while teams in the UAE and Qatar are still able to sign players.",
      "While Mather’s move to Turkey didn’t materialise, Andre Onana did make the switch, signing for Trabzonspor on a season-long loan deal.",
      "The error-prone keeper has fallen out of favour under Ruben Amorim, with Altay Bayindir getting the nod in the first three Premier League games of the season. And with the arrival of Senne Lammens on deadline day, Onana has been deemed surplus to requirements.",
      "Speaking about Onana’s exit, Amorim said: “You can be really experienced but in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail.",
      "“I think we understood that this needed a change. Sometimes it's hard to point why. It's the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.”",
      "Tyrell Malacia was also tipped to swap England for Turkey, but has remained at United - and included in their Premier League squad.",
      "The Dutch defender is the only member of United’s ‘bomb squad’ from this summer to stick with the club. Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony all moved on, but Malacia could yet force his way back into contention.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been told he will regret starting Altay Bayindir in the Manchester Derby on Sunday because Manchester City will exploit his key weakness.",
      "Amorim confirmed on Friday that Bayindir will start in goal ahead of new signing Senne Lammens. The Manchester United manager had a choice between the Turkey international and £18.2million new arrival after Andre Onana left to join Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "He suggested that the decision had been taken more because Lammens was not ready, rather than having particular faith in Bayindir. Lammens, 23, has only played in Belgium previously and Bayindir has started all three of United’s Premier League games this season.",
      "Bayindir was at fault for Ricciardo Calafiori’s goal in Arsenal’s 1-0 win over United on the opening weekend of the season. The 27-year-old flapped at Declan Rice’s corner and former Scotland international Craig Burley thinks his weakness at dealing with balls into the box will be played on by City.",
      "“With Bayindir, every set-piece I’m putting Haaland and every centre half on him and just swinging it under the crossbar for fun,” Burley told ESPN.",
      "“Hell, if Man City have got someone who takes long throws, I’m throwing it in Rory Delap style. I’m just piling it into the box because he’s absolutely hopeless at coming out and dealing with aerial balls – he’s shown that.”",
      "Amorim chose Bayindir as his starting goalkeeper this season, with Onana coming into pre-season injured after a difficult 2024/25 campaign. He hasn’t convinced in goal and some believed the deadline-day arrival of Lammens would make him the new No.1, only for Amorim to nail his colours to the mast.",
      "“Altay is going to continue,” he said. “It is a different league, different country, different ball [for Lammens]. So they [he and Bayindir] will fight for the position. We are really pleased – he is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential.",
      "“We are in the moment that the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience but we also have to look at the present with a focus on the future so it is a bit of both. He will be ready.”",
      "United won their first game of the season before the international break, beating newly-promoted Burnley 3-2. But the midfield balance is another obvious problem that Amorim is yet to address, according to Burley.",
      "“I can’t help but think, looking at Casemiro and [Bruno] Fernandes if that is the midfield two, that City have to dominate that area, they just have to,” he added. “And if they do dominate that area as I expect, then the supply line to the wide players and Erling Haaland is going to be plentiful.",
      "“I just don’t see how United are going to dominate the middle of the park. Yeah, they’ve got [Bryan] Mbeumo and some forward players that can get in behind and hurt City, but you have to have possession of the ball, and that’s been their big problem.”",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson left Owen Hargreaves feeling uneasy when he offered to make him a cup of tea. Former England international Hargreaves was signed by Ferguson for Manchester United in a £17million deal from Bayern Munich in July 2007.",
      "Speaking on That Peter Crouch Podcast, Hargreaves recalled how Gary Neville first broke the news to him that Ferguson wanted to sign him. \"So, I remember Gary was the first one to call me after the World Cup. He was like, 'Boss wants to sign you, do you want to come to Man United?' I was like, 'Yeah, if we can make it work,'\" he said.",
      "When asked about conversations with Ferguson, he added: \"Yeah, of course. Do you know what, I remember one of the coolest things was... because it's quite surreal, all those things you know? We all have a poker face, right? So you're just reading it as you go.",
      "\"I remember he said, 'Oh, do you want a cup of tea?' and I remember thinking, 'I can't let him make me a cup of tea, it feels disrespectful.' So I was trying to like get in the mix, but I didn't want to p*** him off either.",
      "\"It was cool that he had acknowledged you as a player and wanted you to be a part...See, I remember he said to me, 'You can help us win the Champions League,' and I said, 'Yeah, boss, that's why I'm here.'\"",
      "It's evident that the now 44-year-old held Ferguson in high regard before joining Manchester United, given the Scot's impressive record of nine Premier League titles, five FA Cups, two League Cups and a Champions League trophy with the Red Devils prior to Hargreaves' arrival.",
      "However, the remainder of his time in the North West was fraught with difficulties. From 2008 to 2011, Hargreaves only managed to play four more games for Manchester United due to a series of injuries, which eventually led him to join cross-town rivals Manchester City.",
      "Knee troubles kept him out of action for 573 days between 2008 and 2010, while thigh problems in 2010/11 saw him miss an additional 148 days. Despite having high expectations for his stint with the Cityzens after signing a one-year deal, he only made four appearances for the club before being released in 2012.",
      "And although City clinched the Premier League title that season, Hargreaves left without a winners' medal due to insufficient game time. Ferguson, on the other hand, continued to manage Manchester United until 2013, when David Moyes took over.",
      "Despite having a host of top-tier managers since then, including Jose Mourinho and Louis van Gaal, none have managed to replicate the golden era that the legendary Scot presided over during his 27-year tenure. Ruben Amorim is the most recent manager to take charge at Old Trafford.",
      "The 40-year-old has brought in several new faces, including Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, and will be hoping they can provide the goal-scoring prowess his team lacked last season. But with one win, one draw and one defeat from his first three matches, Amorim will be looking for more consistency going forward when United return to Premier League action on Sunday to face City in the Manchester derby.",

      "Rene Aufhaser, a football coach who played a key role in the development of Erling Haaland and Benjamin Sesko, has boldly predicted that Manchester United's forward will match the prowess of Manchester City's goal machine.",
      "Aufhaser, who helped shape Haaland and Sesko into two of Europe's most thrilling forwards at RB Salzburg, was asked to draw a comparison between the two. Ahead of this weekend's Manchester Derby, he confidently stated that Sesko, who made the switch to the Red Devils from RB Leipzig this summer, will be as good as Haaland.",
      "Despite the 22-year-old only starting one game under Ruben Amorim - the disastrous League Cup second-round exit to Grimsby Town - Aufhaser remains confident that the United forward will realise his potential, having seen both Haaland and Sesko when they were still raw talents.",
      "\"He will develop in the next one and two years, I'm sure. Erling reached his mark after his transfer from Dortmund to Man City and we will see. I am quite sure Benji will reach this mark after one or two years. But, of course, Erling is the top. He has 10 out of 10 from me.\"",
      "This isn't the first occasion a direct parallel has been drawn between Sesko and Haaland. The promising United striker even revealed that numerous teammates have told him he surpasses the Norwegian, who has netted 88 times with 17 assists across 100 Premier League outings for City.",
      "In an earlier interview, Sesko revealed: \"Such comparisons motivate me and give me energy. They do not represent pressure. I will listen and learn, so I can be even better than he is.",
      "\"My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\".",
      "Sesko did backtrack on those remarks when his switch to United was confirmed. This was perhaps sensible as he has yet to make his mark in any of his three substitute appearances for United in the Premier League.",
      "Throughout his stint with RB Salzburg, FC Liefering and RB Leipzig, Sesko has found the net 100 times and provided 26 assists across 228 career outings. He also possesses 16 goals in 43 caps for Slovenia, but couldn't find the target in his country's 2-2 stalemate with Sweden and 3-0 defeat to Switzerland in the recent international break.",
      "Despite this, he still received backing from international colleague Andraz Sporar, who called for patience. He told reporters: \"What does he bring to United? Everything. He has speed, power, intelligence, good football IQ.",
      "\"I believe he can be a complete striker in the next two or three years. But he's still young. He will help Manchester United a lot, they just need to be patient. I believe he'll score the goals and every year he will be better and better.\"",

      "Jadon Sancho's value has nosedived since his move to Manchester United. The 25-year-old, who recently secured a loan switch to Aston Villa, was once hailed as one of the brightest talents in European football.",
      "This reputation convinced United to fork out a whopping £73million to lure him away from Borussia Dortmund in 2021. At that time, the fee - one of the largest in English football history - seemed justified since, just a year prior, Transfermarkt had valued Sancho, then only 19, at an impressive £113m.",
      "However, his value has plummeted ever since. Today, he's estimated to be worth around £24m - a jaw-dropping £89m decrease in just five years. A lacklustre and unproductive spell at Old Trafford is largely to blame, with Sancho struggling for form, confidence and goals.",
      "He managed to score a mere five times in all competitions during his debut season with the club - a stark contrast to the 16 and 20 goals he netted in his last two campaigns in Germany. Managerial changes certainly didn't help matters, nor did the unexpected return of Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the man who brought Sancho to the club, was given the boot before Christmas, while Ronaldo's comeback forced a reshuffling of the attack that saw Marcus Rashford moved to the left and Sancho awkwardly slotted into an unfamiliar position on the right.",
      "Things initially looked up when Erik ten Hag joined in 2022. Sancho finished the 2022/23 season with six Premier League goals and a more pivotal role in the first team. But everything fell apart at the start of the next campaign.",
      "In September 2023, Sancho was axed from the squad to take on Arsenal, with Ten Hag openly slamming his training displays. Sancho fired back on social media, branding his boss a liar and insisting he had been turned into a \"scapegoat.\"",
      "What came next was a four-month battle. Exiled to work with the reserves, Sancho eventually landed a loan switch back to Dortmund. By that point, though, his market worth had crashed to £22m - the lowest since his breakout campaign in 2017/18.",
      "Returning to the Bundesliga, Sancho enjoyed a modest renaissance that offered glimpses of the talent United had been desperate to capture. He bagged three goals and three assists in 21 games and played a key role in Dortmund's run to the Champions League final, where they came up short against Real Madrid.",
      "His brilliant semi-final display against Paris Saint-Germain drew compliments from Ten Hag himself, who hailed it as proof of United's initial gamble on him. This period not only rebuilt some of his belief but also steadied his market worth briefly, providing a ray of light during the chaos.",
      "That hope was fleeting, though, as Sancho's 2024/25 loan to Chelsea became another tale of disappointment. Arriving on deadline day with an obligation-to-buy clause valued at around £25m, he battled for regular starts in a packed forward line under Enzo Maresca.",
      "Throughout the season, Sancho managed to net just three league goals, a far cry from his dazzling performances in the Bundesliga. Chelsea, disappointed with his output, chose to fork out a £5m termination fee rather than seal the permanent deal.",
      "Now on his third consecutive loan stint, this time at Aston Villa, Sancho's market value is a mere £24m - barely a third of what United shelled out four years ago. The Red Devils are still footing part of his wage bill, and they're hoping that a successful run at Villa Park could either pave the way for a permanent departure or reignite the possibility of him re-joining the squad.",
      "Regardless, Sancho's career trajectory serves as a stark warning about unmet potential in contemporary football, where hype and hefty price tags can easily collapse under strain.",
      "Perhaps at Villa, under the watchful eye of Unai Emery, Sancho can finally put a stop to his downward spiral, boost his worth, and remind everyone why he was once touted as one of Europe's most promising talents.",

      "Manchester United have a chance to capitalise on their momentum by grabbing a second consecutive win in their derby clash against rivals Manchester City this weekend.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men went into the international break with a hard-earned 3-2 win at home to Burnley but now face a tough test away at the Etihad - though Pep Guardiola's men have shown they have vulnerabilities too.",
      "City have lost two of their first three games this season and are under pressure going into this game, which they cannot afford to lose if they want to keep pace with the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool.",
      "United won this fixture 2-1 away from home last season - which was his second victory against Guardiola in 2024-25 - so Amorim will be fairly confident of getting a result.",
      "Amorim will certainly be under pressure if he continues to pick up poor results this season, with some pundits claiming he should be axed after guiding the team to a 15th placed finish last season.",
      "United only have one win under the Portuguese boss in 2025-26 and the club's higher-ups will be expecting him to bring in more positive results in due course.",
      "Should Amorim be sacked in the future, there would be a number of top managers linked with the role - including ex-Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, who has constantly been rumoured to be a contender in recent years.",
      "But former Burnley, Southampton and QPR star Charlie Austin has offered a more left-field option and tipped his ex-Clarets boss Sean Dyche for the role. He said that Zidane would be his No 1 pick, but if he was not available he'd appoint Dyche because he would give the team \"structure\".",
      "\"I think he's got to go, if it's my decision, I'm going after Zinedine Zidane,\" he said. \"Ultimately, there are a different set of managers that you've got to be looking at, because the situation Manchester United are in, I would take Zidane but is he the right man for the job and how we see them, probably not.",
      "\"In my honest opinion, you have to look at the job Sean Dyche did at Burnley, what he did at Everton,\" Austin added. \"For me, he stabilised the club, at least he's going to put structure in there.",
      "\"Zidane is the top of the tree for me, but what the club needs now is structure because that is something they do not have. I know Manchester United fans will look at me saying, 'he said Sean Dyche', no, they need structure [and] that is a man who will come in and make the team a lot better than what we are all seeing.\"",
      "Amorim knows he won't have Onana in his squad this weekend after the Cameroonian shot-stopper was granted a loan move to Turkish outfit Trabzonspor, with no loan fee or obligation to buy included in the deal.",

      "Onana came under huge pressure during his time at Old Trafford after making a succession of mistakes, including a handful during the team's humiliating Carabao Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby this season.",
      "He appeared to take a swipe at United after being welcomed in by hordes of Trabzonspor fans this week, admitting he had \"never felt so much love from people around me\".",

      "Pep Guardiola and Ruben Amorim have both revealed they'll be missing several key stars for Sunday afternoon's Manchester derby showdown at the Etihad Stadium.",
      "United face fewer headaches, though Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount have suffered recent blows. Both players hobbled off during the thrilling 3-2 triumph over Burnley a fortnight ago, while Diogo Dalot withdrew from Portugal duty in September's break.",
      "The trio have been ruled out by Amorim for the cross-city clash. They in turn join Lisandro Martinez in Carrington's medical room at United's Carrington base.",
      "\"They are out for this game, I don't know how long it's going to take,\" Amorim stated in Friday's press conference. \"We need these guys to be a competitive team.",
      "\"We have very good players, who are eager to play, so we will be competitive on Sunday. But they are out.\"",
      "When pressed on the potential length of their absences, Amorim continued: \"I don't want to say. If you talk to Cunha outside, he will say he can play this game. They are pushing really hard.\"",
      "As for City, Guardiola appears set to be without several vital figures. However, the Catalan head coach may also welcome back a crucial trio.",
      "On the brighter side, there, Josko Gvardiol and Savinho have both resumed training lately and might therefore be involved, while Phil Foden is anticipated to be available. The September international break didn't treat Guardiola kindly, with Omar Marmoush picking up an injury while representing Egypt, just days after John Stones had to pull out from the England squad.",
      "The City boss provided updates on these two. He also confirmed other names on the injury list.",
      "\"Omar is injured. Rayan Ait-Nouri, Rayan Cherki [is injured]. The rest are fine,\" he stated on Friday.",
      "\"Stones as well is a doubt. Not a big issue, but he is a doubt for Sunday.\"",
      "When quizzed about how long Marmoush might be side-lined, Guardiola disclosed: \"We have to make the last tests. A few weeks. Before the [October] international break he will be ready.\"",

      "Last time out, they squandered a lead at Brighton to lose 2-1 after also falling to a 2-0 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Pep Guardiola's side had started the season with a 4-0 thrashing of Wolves but they have not once since.",
      "After the first international break of the season, Haaland has labelled their season start as \"not good enough\". This week, City take on United in the first Manchester derby of the season and they will be looking to seek revenge for last season's defeat.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has wasted little time making an impact at Chelsea's Cobham training ground after his move from Manchester United. After signing the winger to a seven-year contract with Stamford Bridge, Blues manager Enzo Maresca didn't hesitate to put Garnacho through his paces.",
      "The Chelsea coaching staff were keen to assess the Argentinian international's fitness, so he was assigned a series of strength and conditioning tasks. Garnacho and compatriot Facundo Buonanotte, who joined the Blues on loan from Brighton on deadline day, began their regime in the gym before joining their new teammates on the pitch.",
      "Once they joined Maresca's squad, the pair were subjected to an intense running drill. In a video shared across the club's social media platforms, Garnacho appeared worn out, but team-mate Wesley Fofana offered little sympathy.",
      "\"Welcome to Chelsea Football Club,\" Fofana told his new colleague, with Garnacho responding: \"I can't move my legs now, man\". The former United winger seems to have settled well in west London, though, with his dedication and conduct not going unnoticed.",
      "Speaking to reporters at Cobham on Friday morning, Maresca commended Garnacho, hinting that he might make his debut against Brentford this weekend. The Chelsea boss said: \"He's working well. For sure he needs to work because he arrived here probably not 100 per cent fit. So he needs to work. He's working well and we'll see. But hopefully soon we can give him minutes.\"",
      "Garnacho gave an interview when he swapped Old Trafford for Stamford Bridge at the end of last month, laying out why he made the move. Speaking to the official club website, he said: \"I have a winning mentality. I have passion and a big personality.",
      "\"It's a natural fit with a club like Chelsea, which have just won the Club World Cup. Chelsea are at the top now, and it's important to fight for the club like the fans deserve. I watched the Club World Cup, and to join the world champions is special – it means we're the best team in the world!\".",
      "\"It's not common to have played a lot of games at this age, but it has helped me a lot. I'm only 21 and I have a lot of experience from these different types of games, stadiums and moments.\"",
      "Garnacho had been a key player under Ruben Amorim until he was unexpectedly benched for the Europa League final. The winger had featured in every previous knockout match in the tournament, so the choice immediately raised questions about his future.",
      "Days later, the United manager left him out of the matchday squad entirely for the Premier League season finale. Garnacho was told he could depart - and promptly sealed a £40million switch to Chelsea.",

      "Shaun Wright-Phillips has revealed that Mario Balotelli once told Manchester police he'd \"robbed a bank\" after scoring twice to help City beat United 6-1 in the derby. The Italian striker spent two-and-a-half seasons with Manchester City and was notorious for his on and off-field antics, which frequently landed him in hot water.",
      "City fans will always fondly remember Balotelli's performance in one particular derby, where reigning Premier League champions Manchester United were humiliated 6-1 at Old Trafford. Balotelli scored twice and famously lifted his shirt to reveal an undershirt that read 'Why Always Me?', a nod to the constant scrutiny he faced while playing in England.",
      "Wright-Phillips, who had two spells with City spanning seven seasons, appeared on BBC Sport's YouTube channel to discuss the upcoming derby this weekend and reminisced about his time during these intense matches.",
      "Speaking about Balotelli, Wright-Phillips said: \"He was like a 12-year-old in almost like an adult's body. Like the things he would do, you'd expect from a 12 or 13-year-old, like the fireworks in his bathroom. Like, who would think of that when you've got a garden? Why would you light fireworks in your bathroom?\"",
      "The 43-year-old recounted a hilarious incident involving Balotelli after the notorious 6-1 match, where the Italian striker found himself in hot water with the police.",
      "\"He said to me one time when he came to training, he's like, 'Shaun, you'll never guess what happened to me yesterday,'\" Wright-Phillips said.",
      "\"So he said to me, 'After the game, I decided I'm just going to drive through Alderley Edge with my roof down and sing Manchester City songs because we beat United.' And then he said he got pulled over.",
      "\"He's obviously got cash on him because he's going somewhere. Police have asked him why he's got cash. He's turned around, he said to me, 'I told them I robbed the bank.",
      "\"I was just like, 'Why would you like think of that?' That's just his personality. Like he said, it's just his character. I bet some player he could've been, and some player he was at the time.\"",
      "Balotelli spent almost three seasons with City, scoring 30 goals and providing six assists in 80 appearances for the club. His time in Manchester was marred by injuries and suspensions, as the young forward also struggled to keep his on-pitch antics in check.",
      "Throughout his entire City career, the now-35 year old was yellow carded 21 times, two of which led to second offences and a sending off, and two straight red cards as well.",
      "Despite his notorious behaviour, Balotelli will forever be etched in memory for his legendary celebration during the once uncommon City victory in the Manchester derby. Regrettably for United, Pep Guardiola's squad now frequently secure the three points in this fierce game.",
      "But now, Ruben Amorim is planning to carry forward the momentum from United's 3-2 triumph over Burnley prior to this month's international break, as the two long-standing rivals prepare to clash once more at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.",

      "Wayne Rooney opened up on the footballing advice he's handed his children as his eldest son, Kai, deals with injury. The 15-year-old, who is a Manchester United youth player, has followed in his father's footsteps by turning out for the Red Devils and recently earned promotion to the club's Under-19s squad, demonstrating the potential he possesses.",
      "However, the teenager's momentum - which saw him score a left-foot volley for the Under-18s - has been halted in cruel fashion after he took to Instagram to upload a mirror selfie that showed him on crutches whilst wearing a protective boot on his right foot.",
      "Kai, 15, captioned the photo writing: \"Life can't get worse,\" adding a crying emoji alongside the brief message, suggesting he's suffered an injury while playing for United's academy. While the nature of the injury or the length of his absence has yet to confirmed, it remains to be seen when the youngster can expect to return to action.",
      "It was in 2020 when he first joined the United youth set-up at 11 years old, and while he usually plays centrally, similar to Rooney Sr, he's shown versatility in his performances on the flanks.",
      "On top of the coaching he's received at United, he does possess a person at home with a wealth of knowledge of the game – his father. It was during Friday's edition of The Wayne Rooney Show that the 39-year-old delved into the guidance he'd give his sons when it comes to improving their footballing skills.",
      "\"I'm quite lucky where I live as I've got a little pitch there and when the kids say, 'we're coming on the pitch', all they're gonna do is tie the balls on the top corner,\" he said to Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kelly Somers and Kae Kurd.",
      "\"So when I say to them when I was younger, I remember setting a little square to practice passing into it and just playing off the wall. So I'm very similar, [I tell them] 'you need to work on your speed, you need to work on your technique and control.' Otherwise, you go out and you're just like, 'watch me hit the ball in the top corner'.\"",
      "Despite having handed words of wisdom to his children over the years when it comes to football matters, the former England captain admitted he's a proponent of allowing Kai to find his feet in the sport without constant advice from himself.",
      "Speaking with BBC Sport during the Super Cup NI tournament in Northern Ireland, Rooney said: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist.",
      "\"So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing. I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it.",
      "\"Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\" After leaving Plymouth Argyle last year following just 25 games in charge, Rooney has yet to return to management.",

      "Ruben Amorim has already confirmed Altay Bayindir will start for Manchester United against Manchester City.",
      "Explaining the decision at his press conference on Friday, Amorim said: \"It is the same thing I do with different positions, but Altay is going to continue. It is a different league, different country, different training, different ball [for Senne Lammens]. So they will fight for the position.\"",
      "United completed the signing of Lammens for £18.2million, plus add-ons, on deadline day, and Andre Onana was subsequently shipped out on a season-long loan to Trabzonspor.",
      "When Lammens' transfer was announced, United sources noted the goalkeeper had one of the highest goals prevented metrics in Europe and made the most progressive passes of any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Lammens was a data-driven signing and the numbers suggest he possesses the potential to be a future star, but Amorim has decided to persist with Bayindir for the Manchester derby.",
      "The 3,000 United fans in the away section at the Etihad may spend much of the game watching through their fingers. It's rarely a comfortable watch when Bayindir attempts to deal with set-pieces.",
      "Bayindir flapped at a corner against Arsenal, he nearly cost United the win against Burnley and he was fortunate not to concede from a set-piece against Fulham at Craven Cottage.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Bayindir struggles to deal with aerial balls. And City know Bayindir is starting on Sunday afternoon, so they will target him from set-pieces.",
      "Thankfully, City only scored seven Premier League goals from set-pieces last season, a record which ranks among the worst in the top flight, but Bayindir will definitely be targeted when deliveries are played into the box.",
      "The selection of Bayindir could backfire, but the goalkeeper selection for the derby was never going to be straightforward for Amorim. There are pros and cons for all of his options.",
      "There is logic in starting Bayindir, despite his poor performances in the opening few weeks of the season, because he has started the campaign as first choice and so has match practice in the Premier League under his belt.",
      "Bayindir's distribution is sometimes iffy, but it can be a strength on a good day. It would also be a risk to throw the untested Lammens into one of the biggest games of the season on his debut.",
      "It would be damaging for Lammens to make a mistake on his debut in the derby. On the other hand, there is no better fixture than the derby for a new United signing to deliver a strong performance.",
      "Lammens won't get that opportunity, so it's a moot point, and all eyes will be on Bayindir.",
      "Speaking about Lammens, Amorim said: \"He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential. We are in the moment that the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience, but we also have to look at the present with a focus on the future so it is a bit of both. He will be ready.\"",
      "The uncertainty around United's goalkeepers is not helpful, but the situation was bound to continue when United pushed to sign an inexperienced goalkeeper over Emiliano Martinez.",
      "Although Martinez was an imperfect solution, he wouldn't be starting on the bench this weekend if he had signed from Aston Villa. Lammens needs time to adapt to his new environment and is a long-term project.",
      "City also signed a goalkeeper on deadline day, signing Gianluigi Donnarumma for £26m from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "It would be a surprise to see Donnarumma on the bench and James Trafford in the team at the Etihad, as Donnarumma has enough experience at the top level to play immediately.",
      "City signed a proven goalkeeper and United signed a goalkeeper with potential. Donnarumma will likely be given the chance to help his side claim a win in the Manchester derby, but Lammens will have to watch on.",

      "Sunday's Manchester derby will mark the 4,326th United first team match with a homegrown player in their squad. Before Ruben Amorim sat down at Carrington on Friday, it was forgivable to think the sequence was under more threat than his position.",
      "\"I don't want to be the guy that broke that record,\" Amorim stressed. \"If you see the past of Manchester United, it's built on kids that grew up here and stayed here for a long time. I think that should be our goal in the future. So I will try to maintain that.\"",
      "In the 25-man senior squad Amorim has assembled, there are now only four academy members. The 39-year-old Tom Heaton has not played since February 2023, Tyler Fredricson may not play for United again after his first half horror show at Grimsby Town, Chido Obi has not had a kick this season and Kobbie Mainoo last started a Premier League match in May.",
      "Mainoo missed four months of last season through injury. In the hypothetical scenario that every United player bar Mainoo is available for a match, Amorim could feasibly pick a 20-man squad of Bayindir, Lammens, Dalot, Mazraoui, Yoro, De Ligt, Maguire, Martinez, Heaven, Shaw, Dorgu, Fernandes, Casemiro, Ugarte, Mount, Amad, Cunha, Mbeumo, Zirkzee and Sesko.",
      "Heaven and Diego Leon, though teenagers, do not qualify as academy members. It was a grey area when Louis van Gaal's debutants were totted up. Reece James and Regan Poole did not qualify as they never played in the youth team.",
      "Amorim has put two 'keepers on the bench before, as Erik ten Hag occasionally used to. It would be a cop-out if the only academy representative in a United matchday squad is Heaton, who turns 40 in April.",
      "United have won only three of the past 11 Manchester derbies and two were decided by academy products. With Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount injured for Sunday's derby, Mainoo is in line for a recall.",
      "Since the Busby Babes, there has always been an academy poster boy through the decades. United's top five appearance makers - Ryan Giggs, Sir Bobby Charlton, Bill Foulkes, Paul Scholes and Gary Neville - are graduates. George Best is 15th in the list. Sammy McIlroy and Arthur Albiston are in the top 25.",
      "Every United manager post-Ferguson has had an academy legacy: David Moyes's was Adnan Januzaj, Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard came under Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho saw something in Scott McTominay, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer championed Mason Greenwood, Ralf Rangnick brought Anthony Elanga in from the cold while Erik ten Hag had Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Concern was briefly voiced that United's academy run, which dates back to October 1937, could be jeopardised by Van Gaal amid the Van Gaalactico summer of 2014 when Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao were headline signings. Van Gaal ended up doling out 12 debutants to academy members, ranging from Saidy Janko to Rashford.",
      "Solskjaer trumped Van Gaal, affording names as obscure as D'Mani Mellor and Will Fish a chance. There were six academy debutants against Kazakhstani side Astana alone. After Solskjaer left, United sources were dismissive of his penchant for granting debuts to talents with little or no chance of breaking into the first team squad.",
      "Mourinho and Ten Hag were more selective, though the latter unfathomably promoted Omari Forson to the starting XI for the home defeat to Fulham in February 2024. Rangnick was also particular and championed Elanga, Garnacho, Hannibal Mejbri and Alvaro Carreras.",
      "It was sobering to hear Dan Ashworth opine that the era of the one-club player was effectively over a year ago. Ashworth, two months into his brief tenure as United's sporting director, was philosophically addressing the departure of McTominay, a sale that has become more contentious since he won the Scudetto with Napoli, was named Serie A's MVP and nominated for the Ballon d'Or.",
      "The former United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was dismayed that the club had only two Ballon d'Or nominees in 2013 (Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney). They did have two Golden Boy nominees last year: Mainoo and Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho is gone and Mainoo was intent on going before United blocked him last month. He has started in a derisory 16 of Amorim's 46 matches in charge but a recall is in the offing against City.",
      "Three of the debutants under Amorim have come from the academy: Obi, Fredricson and Harry Amass. Amass did not train with the first team at all in pre-season and eventually joined Sheffield Wednesday on loan last Monday.",
      "With Noussair Mazraoui fit again, Fredricson is back in the stands. Obi, not 18 until late November, is having to bide his time in the under 21s, for whom he has scored two goals in two starts.",
      "Obi removed United from his Instagram bio last month. He has since restored it and he is not the first teenage footballer to act in a puerile manner. United have two strikers they invested more than £100million ahead of him and Obi has not set the world alight in his eight senior appearances. He has to bide his time.",
      "\"We all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games,\" the under 21 coach Travis Binnion told the MEN. \"If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",
      "United are undergoing a change of identity. Vital academy products have become sellable assets (McTominay's last start was in the 2024 FA Cup final) as they strive to comply with the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules. A club famed for their wing play does not use conventional wingers as they dance to the tune of Amorim's 3-4-2-1 and there will be a new Old Trafford in the 2030s.",
      "Eleven academy talents were included in Amorim's maiden pre-season squad but he is not one for gimmes. Dermot Mee, Will Murdock, Jack Fletcher and Reece Munro did not get a kick in the United States. Murdock enjoyed his work experience as Andre Onana was unfit.",
      "Bendito Mantato returned to the glamour of a mid-August friendly at Tamworth. Ethan Williams, a scorer in Chicago, came back down to earth on these shores with a Monday night at Middlesbrough.",
      "In a season where United could have as few as 40 fixtures, that first team ceiling could be impregnable for academy members. At least one will always be on the teamsheet, though.",

      "City vs United continues to be a blockbuster Premier League fixture and the fallout from the contest will be significant, irrespective of who comes out on top.",
      "But, as the players leave the field at the Etihad Stadium, there will be a piece of the Manchester derby playing out more than 2,000 miles away.",
      "Istanbul will be the setting for two debuts that will attract the attention of United and City fans.",
      "Fenerbahce vs Trabzonspor might not be the first fixture football fans in this country look up but this weekend's clash in the Turkish Super Lig will garner extra attention due to the likely debuts of goalkeepers Ederson and Andre Onana.",
      "Both departed Manchester this month with Ederson signing for Fenerbahce on a permanent deal and Onana agreeing a loan switch to Trabzonspor. The latter has been jettisoned by Ruben Amorim while Ederson's glittering City career has ended perhaps a year earlier than most predicted with James Trafford and Gianluigi Donnarumma now in situ at the Etihad.",
      "It is the dawn of a new era for Ederson and Onana, and both will be hoping for a winning start and an error-free debut.",
      "Onana's time at Old Trafford has been characterised by glaring mistakes while Ederson will want to hit the ground running for a side that expects to challenge for the title.",
      "The pair faced off five times in Manchester derbies - Stefan Ortega started for City in the FA Cup final which United won. The most recent was April's stalemate at Old Trafford, and you'd have got long odds on both being out of the picture just five months later.",
      "On a day where their Manchester allegiances meet at the Etihad, Ederson and Onana will come up against each other once again.",

      "Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes was asked what critics get wrong about him and responded: \"Nothing.\"",
      "Fernandes is regarded as the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. The United captain has produced remarkably consistent performances since signing from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020.",
      "The Portugal international won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award for a fourth time last season, joining David de Gea and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only other players to have won the award four times.",
      "Fernandes attracted interest from Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal in the summer transfer window, but he turned down a lucrative offer to remain in the Premier League.",
      "The United captain is hoping to lead his team to victory against Manchester City this weekend. Speaking ahead of the Manchester derby, Fernandes gave a candid interview to BBC Sport where he was asked: \"What is one thing people get wrong about you?\"",
      "Fernandes responded: \"Nothing. People have an opinion about me and I can't change that. That's the way people want to judge you about what they see on the pitch or the television or interviews.",
      "\"I can't change that. They have the freedom to think the way they want about me, as I have the freedom to think about them. I don't judge people until I know them.",
      "\"They can have an opinion about me, that's fine - we all have an opinion, and that's why life is so good and so different. If we all think the same way it would be so boring.\"",
      "Fernandes was asked what he believed to be the toughest part of football, replying: \"Being consistent, I think. During 90 minutes, you have to be so consistent in everything you do,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes it slips away from you and it can change everything. So I think consistency in the first thing - consistent in doing whatever you think is the best for the team, because that has to come first of everything and you can't do anything without thinking of the team first.",
      "\"That's true in football, and it's what has to come above everything because there's nothing more important than the team. And then it comes to yourself to put yourself in the best position to help the team.",
      "\"And when I'm on the pitch, that's the thing that I have most in my head - to do my things will help the team to become better so I have to. I have to be the most consistent and accurate player I can be in any moment of the game, not with the ball, but also without the ball.",
      "\"But also in some things that you have to say to your teammates when you want to change something position-wise, changing set-pieces as to be accurate because if little things change, it can go against you.\"",
      "When asked whether he gets nervous in games, Fernandes said: \"No, never. During the games? No. Before the games I can get nervous. During the game I just think about the goal we have for the game, which is to win.",
      "\"I remember every step that we have trained and that my teammates have to do and I remember every position they have to do.",
      "\"When I go to a training session I focus not only on what I have to do but what is around me because it can change, I have to play a different position or a teammate could not be aware of where he has to be or which position he should stay.",
      "\"On set-pieces, I know exactly where everyone has to be. The only nervous thing is getting everything into my memory so I can remember in the game every step.",
      "\"Also, when I'm on the ball I know every movement my teammates have to do. To be aware of, 'I'm on the ball here so this is what we trained' - but you have to think that in a split second.",
      "\"It gets automatic because I think about that during the week until the game. When you think so many times about something your muscle memory works by itself.\"",

      "Except the game was called off, leaving 50,000 fans and a worldwide TV audience disappointed and Pep Guardiola furious.",
      "Heavy rain and thunderstorms at the Bird's Nest Stadium in Beijing meant the contest was called off due to the shambolic state of the pitch.",
      "Torrential weather had destroyed the playing surface, while a fungus problem meant large sections had been dug up only for the newly-laid grass to be washed away by the incessant rain.",
      "It all added up to farcical scenes and prompted anger from both clubs, with Guardiola in particular not holding back.",
      "“The pitch was unacceptable,\" he blasted in the aftermath of the abandonment. “We don't travel all the way to China just for holidays or a training session.",
      "“We came to play two friendly games so I think it was the first time a game has been cancelled here. They are looking for hotels, inviting players, but at the end, if the pitch is not good enough, all that doesn't matter.",
      "“For them, the pitch doesn't matter, but for us it's the most important thing. All the players and the coaches want to play as well as they can.",

      "“We have played in really bad conditions in our careers, but that pitch two days ago was impossible to play on. It wasn't just about avoiding injured for the players, it was about the fans. They buy tickets to watch players of quality from City and United.",
      "“But if we had played on that pitch, the fans would have said 'what is that game?' because it was unacceptable.",
      "“The pitch [turf] would have moved two metres. Believe me, it was the right decision not to play on it.”",

      "“If it was already a friendly then it becomes a double friendly because [the message is]: no injuries, play calm, play safe, go home, keep the preparation next week,\" he said.",
      "“They are no conditions to play a good game of football, but we have to play. We cannot just run away and disappear and not play. So we have to play and try to be lucky.",
      "“Normally when you say lucky you say lucky because you want a good result. The result I want tomorrow is to go home without injuries and that is the luck I want.”",

      "Manchester United will take on Manchester City in the Manchester derby this afternoon.",
      "United have made a disappointing start to the new season, but they secured a late victory against Burnley before the international break to ease the pressure on Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim signed Senne Lammens on transfer deadline day and Andre Onana has been shipped out to Trabzonspor on loan. Altay Bayindir has started the campaign as United's first choice goalkeeper and Amorim has confirmed he will start the Manchester derby.",
      "Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount, Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez are unavailable due to injury.",
      "This is how our writers think United should line up:",
      "Bayindir is starting but Tom Heaton would be the most dependable option. Sticking with the same back three would be advisable, given how decently Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have done. Patrick Dorgu comes back in to provide balance, with Amad on the right.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has thrived next to Casemiro in the past and they would be the logical partnership, given the alternative is Manuel Ugarte. United have played well without starting Benjamin Sesko but he has to come into the team at some stage and there are two significant absences in the attack. That said, a triumvirate of Mainoo, Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes could function more fluently.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Amorim has confirmed Bayindir will start, but he is an accident waiting to happen and I'd throw Lammens in at the deep end. Although there is logic in protecting Lammens by naming him on the bench, there is no better place to start than the Manchester derby to deliver a strong debut performance.",
      "Cunha and Mount have been ruled out, which means there needs to be a reshuffle. I'd start Casemiro and Mainoo in the midfield pivot and push Fernandes to the left side of the attack.",
      "Amorim had a twinkle in his eye when he discussed Sesko potentially making his first league start at his press conference on Friday. Sesko is the only choice to lead the attack this weekend because Joshua Zirkzee is not a goalscorer.",

      "The 21-year-old will turn 22 next month, making him too old to be included on the unlimited U21s list.",

      "The 22-year-old largely struggled following his high-profile £72million transfer from Atalanta to United in 2023. In total, Hojlund managed 26 goals in 95 appearances in all competitions.",
      "It led to the Denmark international slipping down the pecking order once Ruben Amorim came into power in the dugout last November; then with the arrival of attacking trio Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, his fate was sealed.",
      "Therefore, he was loaned out to Serie A's reigning champions Napoli on transfer deadline day. As the agreement includes a €44m (£38m) obligation-to-buy, depending on certain criteria being met, a return to United is unlikely.",
      "So it seems the striker has set about making his former club regret the decision on debut against Fiorentina on Saturday night.",
      "The 22-year-old followed former Manchester City midfielder Kevin de Bruyne's opener from the penalty spot by making it 2-0 to Napoli - with under 15 minutes played. He latched on to a threaded pass by Leanardo Spinazzola before holding off his marker and tucking his shot in off the inside of the post.",
      "Hojlund was then mobbed by his teammates, who he would have only met the majority of since the end of the international break earlier this week.",
      "In his first interview since leaving the United, he had said: \"I'm very excited, because it's a team that just won the league. I also know how great the fans are, the city, and I'm very happy for this opportunity.",
      "\"It's different now, obviously, as I come with more experience and I'm a better football player. I come with a lot of international experience.",
      "\"I played in the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League and in multiple countries. I come with a lot to prove, I want to show myself in the best team in Italy, and Napoli is going to be very, very good.\"",
      "Also on the field at the time of Hojlund's debut goal was Scott McTominay - who departed United in summer 2024 when his role under Erik ten Hag diminished. The Scotland midfielder was revitalised in Italy and was included in the 2024/2025 Serie A team of the season after he lifted the Scudetto.",

      "Ruben Amorim oversaw a shock 2-1 comeback victory at the Etihad last season thanks to heroics from Amad in the game's final minutes. It was 0-0 when the two sides clashed again at Old Trafford in April.",
      "United will be without Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot due to injury, but City have their own injury concerns, with Omar Marmoush among those to be ruled out through injury.",
      "Here are five things to look out for in the Manchester derby:",
      "Two league wins on the bounce?",
      "Amorim was appointed from Sporting Lisbon in November, but he has yet to win successive games in the Premier League. That is no surprise given how dismal last season was, but it's an unwanted record.",
      "United were excellent in the first half against Burnley before the international break and could have been 3-0 up by half-time. The Reds were wasteful in front of goal and allowed Burnley back into the game.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' penalty in the 97th minute sealed an important victory and United now have the opportunity to do something they have never done before under Amorim: win two league games on the bounce.",
      "Sesko to make his full league debut?",
      "There was a glimmer in Amorim's eye when he discussed Benjamin Sesko in the embargoed section of his press conference. Amorim was asked for his thoughts on Sesko and said: \"I think what’s more important than looking at exactly what he did during the games, is what he can bring to our team.",
      "\"If you see against Burnley, he had some movements – especially inside the box – that we don't have with Josh (Zirkzee), or with (Matheus) Cunha, and even with Rasmus (Hojlund) in the past. We have a guy (in Sesko) who really likes to go inside the box to have a header.",
      "\"He can run – we need to use him more as a runner – and he’s going to improve. So we need to get used to that. It feels like the pace is different and he is going to get used to that. But maybe against City, it is a good moment for him to start the game.\"",
      "Amorim smiled as he finished his answer, and Sesko could be set to make his full league debut.",
      "United to hammer title hopes?",
      "It would be foolish to suggest City won't win the Premier League if they lose on Sunday, but the last time City lost three of their first four top-flight games was in 1995/96 under Alan Ball.",
      "That campaign ended in relegation. That won't happen this season, but defeat in the derby could see them fall nine points behind Liverpool.",
      "That is added motivation for United this weekend. Dishing out an early blow to City's hopes of winning the league would make a win even sweeter, and City's supporters have been notably edgy in the build-up to the game.",
      "Local representation",
      "There could be no Mancunians starting in the Manchester derby. There were no local United players in the team when the two sides met at Old Trafford in April, which was the first time in a decade that was the case.",
      "Altay Bayindir will start in goal with Tom Heaton potentially not even in the squad. Kobbie Mainoo has failed to cement his place in the starting XI under Amorim but there's hope he could start tomorrow.",
      "The Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability (PSR) rules incentivise the sale of homegrown talents and local representation in Manchester derbies could be reduced even further in the coming years.",
      "Amorim's record vs Guardiola",
      "Amorim has faced Guardiola five times in his managerial career. United's head coach has won two games, drawn twice and suffered one defeat, so he has a strong record against the Catalan coach.",
      "Sporting won 4-1 against City in the Champions League just before Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford. United won 2-1 against City at the Etihad in December and drew 0-0 in the reverse fixture.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has hinted Benjamin Sesko could start against Manchester City.",
      "Sesko completed a €76.5million (£66.4m), plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons, move to Old Trafford before the start of the Premier League season.",
      "Amorim decided to name Sesko on the bench for the opening league game against Arsenal, and the 22-year-old has made further substitute appearances against Fulham and Burnley.",
      "Sesko was given his first start against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, but he has not started in the Premier League. Amorim was asked for his verdict on Sesko at his press conference on Friday afternoon and hinted the young striker could be given his first league start in the Manchester derby.",
      "\"I think what’s more important than looking at exactly what he did during the games, is what he can bring to our team,\" said Amorim of Sesko's first few weeks at the club.",
      "\"If you see against Burnley, he had some movements – especially inside the box – that we don't have with Josh (Zirkzee), or with (Matheus) Cunha, and even with Rasmus (Hojlund) in the past. We have a guy (in Sesko) who really likes to go inside the box to have a header.",
      "\"He can run – we need to use him more as a runner – and he’s going to improve. So we need to get used to that. It feels like the pace is different and he is going to get used to that. But maybe against City, it is a good moment for him to start the game.\"",
      "Amorim has started Mason Mount down the middle in the Premier League this season, but Mount picked up an injury against Burnley and has been ruled out of the Manchester derby.",
      "United won 2-1 at the Etihad last season thanks to Amad's heroics in the game's final minutes. \"I don't know,\" said Amorim when asked whether the win backfired by raising expectations.",
      "\"It's hard to point to a game last year that was a backfire. We had so many moments like that. We just focus on the future. We have four points. I think we should have more in this moment, but we need to be really competitive.",
      "\"It’s a very important game for everybody here, but especially for our fans, so we will try to do our best.\"",
      "When asked about potentially having more pressure on him than Pep Guardiola, Amorim responded: \"No, you cannot compare. The guy (Guardiola) is winning all the time. He can relax in not winning anymore.",
      "\"I have to prove myself every day here and I feel that. So I'm really comfortable with that and I think that every day that I come here, that I have to do better. To compare me with the situation of Guardiola? Is just a joke (laughs).",
      "\"I think we have bigger problems. We continue to have bigger problems, but we are addressing everything. And sometimes we are frustrated, angry… but we are facing all the problems.",
      "\"And we are trying to improve. And I see the team playing so much better now. We just need to be more clinical, to win more games and things are going to get easier.\"",

      "Manchester United's stunning win in the 2024 FA Cup final was made sweeter by the goalscorers at Wembley.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo were developed in the club's academy, and the pair contributed heavily to a truly great United performance.",
      "It meant more to see academy graduates topple rivals Manchester City.",
      "Mainoo's matchwinner was particularly special given his Stockport roots. Erik ten Hag had entrusted Mainoo with first-team opportunities and the midfielder grabbed his chance with both hands.",
      "Ten Hag described Mainoo as the \"perfect midfielder\". Gareth Southgate said England \"haven't really had a player like him until now\". Mainoo started for England in the Euro 2024 final against Spain.",
      "Just 14 months later, Mainoo is out of favour at United and was left out of England's squad for the September international break. There are concerns about where Mainoo fits into Ruben Amorim's system and Thomas Tuchel has explained he needs minutes to feature in his England plans.",
      "Mainoo requested to leave United on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window and fans questioned why such a talented young player felt he needed a change of scenery.",
      "Amorim has challenged Mainoo to fight for his place in his starting team, but eyebrows were raised when United's head coach said Mainoo is competing with Bruno Fernandes to start.",
      "The next few months will be pivotal for Mainoo. The 20-year-old is suddenly at a crossroads in his career and wants to feature at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Mainoo was a talking point at Amorim's press conference ahead of the Manchester derby on Sunday.",
      "\"No, like a lot of guys, he wants to play more,\" said Amorim when asked whether he'd seen a difference in Mainoo. \"I didn’t have a conversation with him before the window closed - I did this week.",
      "\"Because I don't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having any conversation with him just to hold on to him. I don't want that feeling. I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done (the finished article). I think he can do so much better, he can improve in a lot.",
      "\"I think for some guys it is enough (their talent), but for him it is not enough. Maybe it’s not fair, but I think I'm helping Kobbie Mainoo, and that’s it. He will have opportunities like the other guys.",
      "\"If I feel during the week that someone is the best player to play, then he is going to play. And that I proved already to every player here. So I believe in him a lot... I have the same thing that you have: that he is a top, top player, but he can be so much better. So I'm focused on that.\"",
      "Mainoo has not started in the Premier League so far this season. Amorim said: \"You have to imagine… Sometimes it's the opinion of a coach. I remember Vitinha was not playing for Wolverhampton.",
      "\"Then nowadays, you can see that Vitinha – maybe – is the best midfielder in the world. So you never know. Something can happen sometimes. The way I play is completely different from the last manager.",
      "\"Sometimes, I look at Kobbie Mainoo and I feel that sometimes he was like – and I watched a lot of games from the Premier League when I was in Portugal – and you can feel that the Manchester United team was really transitional.",
      "\"He was the only guy who calmed down the game. Now we have other players who can calm down the game. We play a different game, and sometimes I expect more from Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "\"And I know that he can give that. So sometimes, like you said, maybe if I start more Kobbie Mainoo, then he is going to play and he's going to get hard to take out. Sometimes it's not fair, but I need to go with what I'm feeling in the moment, and that is the only feeling.",
      "\"I know that he started the final of the European Championship in one team that has a lot of talented players. (Phil) Foden played in that game. (Cole) Palmer was on the bench. He (Mainoo) was playing… I know all that. But sometimes I have a different way of seeing the game.\"",
      "Amorim was asked whether he could clarify the \"most important things\" that he looks for in a midfielder. \"Everything. Sometimes, it's the balance in the midfield,\" he responded.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo is really good at controlling the game, but if he plays as an eight, he has to reach the box, returning (tracking back), and sometimes he has to cover a lot of space with just two.",
      "\"Bruno is doing that job. And then sometimes it's bad luck. Bruno is maybe the more influential player in the last few years, and he’s been playing in that position. Kobbie Mainoo could play as a six (a defensive midfielder), but sometimes he passes the ball and goes away and it's not a reference as a six, so we have to balance everything.",
      "\"I think he needs to have the technical ability that he has, but he needs more pace. He needs to understand the position better. He needs to play in different speeds. Sometimes it's lower.",
      "\"Sometimes it's faster, and I think he can improve on that. And then he has to beat Bruno. He has to beat Casemiro. He has to beat Manu (Ugarte). They are good players, also. So I need to choose.\"",
      "Amorim relocated Mainoo to the deeper midfield role throughout pre-season, but does he have a suitable midfield partner in the squad? \"I don't know. It depends on the game,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"It depends on the opposition. It depends on set pieces sometimes. All these things matter when you choose the team. Kobbie Mainoo is a very, very good player, but so is Bruno. So okay, I could put Bruno on the side, or I can push him up, but then I have to take Cunha (out).",
      "\"I can put Cunha on the other side, but then I take Bryan (Mbeumo) out. Sesko is on the bench all the time. I'm trying to make choices, and to play for Manchester United, you have to have more than 11 players, that's my feeling.\"",
      "Amorim insisted he was \"really happy\" with his midfield options. \"I'm not going to say that I'm not happy,\" he added.",
      "\"That's the point, guys. You ask me if I'm confident with my goalkeepers; I don't know what is going to happen. I'm not going to say to you, no, no, I'm not confident with my goalkeepers – I need another guy.",
      "\"I am not this guy. They are human beings. My players are the best ones until they move.\"",

      "A draw with Fulham was sandwiched between defeats to Arsenal and Grimsby, heaping even more pressure on Ruben Amorim after a heavy summer of spending. There was some speculation that Amorim might not be the United boss come the end of the international break - with such talk intensifying after he refused to confirm he would still be at Old Trafford after the pause - but a dramatic win against Burnley improved the mood at Old Trafford.",

      "Diogo Dalot's injury means Amad is a shoo-in to start at right wing-back, with Patrick Dorgu on the opposite flank. Casemiro seems certain to start in midfield, and injuries further forward could allow Kobbie Mainoo the chance to start alongside him with Bruno Fernandes pushed forward into a No.10 role.",

      "A football coach who oversaw the development of Erling Haaland and Benjamin Sesko believes the Manchester United forward will reach the same level as the Manchester City goal guzzler.",
      "Rene Aufhaser, who helped mould Haaland and Sesko into two of Europe's most exciting forwards at RB Salzburg, was asked to make a comparison between the two. Ahead of this weekend's Manchester Derby, he boldly said the latter, who joined the Red Devils from RB Leipzig this summer, will be as good as Haaland.",
      "So far, the 22-year-old has only started one game under Ruben Amorim, which was the disastrous League Cup second round exit to Grimsby Town. However, after seeing both Haaland and Sesko when they were both raw football talents, Aufhaser is confident the United forward will fulfil his potential.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"He will develop in the next one and two years, I’m sure. Erling reached his mark after his transfer from Dortmund to Man City and we will see.",
      "\"I am quite sure Benji will reach this mark after one or two years. But, of course, Erling is the top. He has 10 out of 10 from me.”",
      "It's not the first time a direct comparison has been made between Sesko and Haaland. The young forward even claimed many of his team-mates told him he is a better player than the Norwegian, who boasts 88 goals and 17 assists in 100 Premier League games for City.",
      "In a previous interview, Sesko said: \"Such comparisons motivate me and give me energy. They do not represent pressure. I will listen and learn, so I can be even better than he is.",
      "\"My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\"",
      "Sesko did row back on those comments when his move to United was secured. This was perhaps wise as he is yet to make an impact in any of his three appearances off the bench for United in the Premier League.",
      "Over the course of his career with RB Salzburg, FC Liefering and RB Leipzig, Sesko has scored 100 goals and contributed 26 assists in 228 career appearances. He also boasts 16 goals in 43 appearances for Slovenia, but failed to get on the scoresheet in his nation's 2-2 draw against Sweden and 3-0 loss to Switzerland.",
      "Nevertheless, he was still backed by international team-mate Andraz Sporar, who urged patience. He told reporters: \"What does he bring to United? Everything. He has speed, power, intelligence, good football IQ.",
      "\"I believe he can be a complete striker in the next two or three years. But he’s still young. He will help Manchester United a lot, they just need to be patient. I believe he’ll score the goals and every year he will be better and better.\"",

      "Manchester United have been thanked by Sheffield Wednesday manager Henrik Pedersen after they loaned highly-rated defender Harry Amass to the South Yorkshire club on deadline day.",
      "The Owls are currently in crisis in the Championship with the club's owner Dejphon Chansiri cutting an unpopular figure at present. Wednesday are under a transfer embargo - and were blocked from completing deals that would add expenses on to their wage bill.",
      "This has led to Pedersen having a threadbare squad to choose from - and without any realistic means of improving that situation. Wednesday could not sign any players permanently or on loan for a fee this summer and the same is in place for the next two transfer windows.",
      "However, United were happy to send Amass to the South Yorkshire club as they wanted him to gain regular first-team football this campaign. United are believed to be footing the bill for his wages which allowed Wednesday to complete the transfer.",
      "Speaking ahead of his team's Championship clash with Bristol City on Saturday, Pedersen thanked United for their help. \"I think we have to be proud, and we have to be very thankful, because what they [United] have done for us is fantastic and big respect for what they have done,\" the manager told BBC Radio Sheffield.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I'm proud because they could see that Sheffield Wednesday could be a good space and a good club for Harry and the trust they have in this direction, and on the other hand what that has done for us, it's a big respect, and thanks.\"",
      "When asked if Amass was happy to have joined a club that is so clearly struggling - both on and off the pitch - Pedersen added: \"He feels really well, when I speak with him and see him on the pitch, I see a concentrated and happy boy, who likes his new life in Sheffield and he's doing really well.",
      "\"You always have expectations before when you're choosing players, but it feels like he feels really well and I'm really happy that he's in.\" Wednesday only sit off the bottom of the Championship table owing to their arch rivals Sheffield United losing all of their opening four matches this season.",
      "United have held no reservations in sending some of their younger players to the Championship previously. Radek Vitek could face Amass at Hillsborough this weekend having signed for Bristol City after agreeing a new contract at Old Trafford.",
      "Meanwhile, midfielder Toby Collyer is on loan at West Bromwich Albion. The biggest recent success story from a Championship loan came when Amad was loaned to Sunderland.",

      "Cast your mind back to November 2022, and it felt like Manchester United entered a watershed moment in their history.",
      "With the Glazers overseeing the football operation, club legend Cristiano Ronaldo took the unprecedented step of undertaking an interview with Piers Morgan. During that conversation, he aired all his grievances about the club, the manager and even some of his former teammates to really distance himself from Old Trafford.",
      "United had little choice but to release Ronaldo and the decision was heralded as a victory for Erik ten Hag. The Portuguese forward was the biggest name to try to use his power to influence change at Old Trafford and it had been quashed by the manager and the boardroom.",
      "At the time many of us, myself included, thought the decision to part ways with Ronaldo was the right one. He had burnt bridges purposefully at United and Ten Hag really could not afford to be undermined in such a way.",
      "What we should have realised from then onwards is that Ten Hag's authority had reached its crescendo and it was only downhill from there. The Jadon Sancho saga followed and the Dutchman got his way again but after the winger left on loan for the second time, Ten Hag had just two more months remaining in the job at Old Trafford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "While many once again agreed with the principled decision of moving Sancho on, Ten Hag was not rejuvenating the players that were remaining and he had to go. Fast forward to this September's international break and that decision from Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his Ineos colleagues has proven to be the right one.",
      "At the beginning of the break, Ten Hag was fired just three matches into his spell at Bayer Leverkusen. The Bundesliga club suggesting that it had become obvious the Dutchman was not the right man to rebuild them following Xabi Alonso's exit.",
      "Then on Thursday, United commemorated four years since Ronaldo returned to Old Trafford and made his second home debut against Newcastle. Any anger or distrust from the Reds towards the Portuguese forward clearly long forgotten.",
      "However, will United commemorate four years since Ten Hag first entered the dugout for a competitive fixture next August? My bet is no.",
      "It may not have been plain sailing for the Reds post-Ten Hag with Ruben Amorim clearly suffering his fair share of struggles too, it is also obvious that United were right to sack his predecessor. Any lingering concerns that this move was premature have now been put to bed for good.",

      "Brighton & Hove Albion have confirmed they have parted ways with technical director David Weir as Manchester United continue to mull over a proposed approach for Carlos Baleba.",
      "Weir, who has worked in the backroom set-ups at Rangers, Aston Villa and Brentford, joined the Seagulls in 2018 as loan manager. Having held that position for four years, the ex-Scotland international became technical assistant for nearly half a year before eventually taking on the role of technical director.",
      "His main duties at the club were to oversee player recruitment and he was responsible, in part, for Brighton signing Baleba in 2023. However, in a statement Brighton owner, Tony Bloom, explained that the Premier League club were now looking to go in a new direction.",
      "\"David has served our club well, but we now wish to refresh our technical area with new leadership and direction,\" Bloom said. \"I'd like to thank David for everything he has done for us, and to wish him well for the future.\"",
      "Brighton CEO Paul Barber added: \"I have greatly enjoyed working with David over these past eight years, and have appreciated his support and hard work throughout this period. I wish David all the best going forward.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Weir's departure signifies a shift within Brighton's recruitment department, which may alter how United approach potentially bringing Baleba to Old Trafford. At this stage, there are no signs Weir's exit may disrupt the Reds' plans, but it may lead to the Seagulls having an even harder stance on transfer negotiations.",
      "So far this season, Baleba has continued his progression - starting in all three Premier League matches prior to the international break. Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson have also been linked with United in recent weeks as they start to plan for the January transfer window and beyond.",

      "Unai Emery has claimed Emiliano Martinez is \"happy\" to stay at Aston Villa after missing out on a transfer to Manchester United.",
      "United considered the Premier League-proven Martinez in the final days of the summer window, but a breakthrough was eventually reached to sign first choice target Senne Lammens.",
      "Lammens arrived from Royal Antwerp for £18.2million, plus add-ons, late on transfer deadline day.",
      "However, Lammens is a long-term signing for the future and Ruben Amorim has already confirmed that Altay Bayindir will start against Manchester City at the Etihad on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Martinez wouldn't have needed time to settle in at Old Trafford, but United sources are convinced they made the right choice.",
      "Emery omitted Martinez from Aston Villa's squad on the eve of deadline day, which hinted that he could be on the move, but the 33-year-old will remain in Birmingham this season.",
      "Discussing Martinez at a press conference, Emery explained: “Everything that happens with players we have, maybe staying, maybe they were close to leaving, maybe other players were close to others or to join us. For me, it is normal, I understand it completely, everything.",
      "“Staying here, Emi Martinez, it is good news, I am so, so happy. He is the best goalkeeper in the world and his commitment to Aston Villa is massive.",
      "“He is always training to get his best and he is always respecting Aston Villa. It is not changing. Some circumstances happen, but everyone is happy, the energy today was very good.",
      "“Emi is happy and he knows his challenge is with Aston Villa and his national team. He has a lot of challenges this year himself.",
      "“I am excited and motivated and I am wishing to play the match tomorrow against Everton in a new stadium and they are playing very well.”",
      "Amorim was asked about Lammens at his press conference and said: \"We are really pleased. He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential, I know we are in a moment where the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience.",
      "\"But also in the moment we have to look at the present but with a focus on the future, it’s a little bit of both. A guy with great potential, one more option to play and he will be ready.",
      "\"Sometimes you as a club, you try to see different options, sometimes you are able to do one option or another, we have an option that can give us different things in the moment but also has the potential to be our goalkeeper for a lot of years. That was our choice in the end.",
      "\"Altay is going to continue (in goal) because it’s a different league, a different country, different trainings, different ball, so we will try to maintain that. They will fight for the position. For this game, it is clear Altay will start.\"",

Coming on the back of a post-transfer window international break, the preparation for derby no.197 will be sub-optimal for both sides even before you begin to consider the wider contexts. And those wider contexts give Guardiola more grounds for concern than Amorim.",

      "It is not an unrealistic prospect that City could be nine points behind Liverpool and seven off Chelsea by Sunday evening. The Reds and Blues face opponents fancied by many to struggle this season. That those teams, Burnley and Brentford, are on the same number of points as Guardiola’s men is a damning indictment on City, even at this early stage.",
      "That is what Guardiola will have spent most of the last fortnight stewing over. The City boss flew to New York for the US Open but he must have been preoccupied at Flushing Meadows by the thought of City pulling the chain on their title prospects with a derby repeat of the performances that reaped no points from Tottenham or Brighton.",

      "Spurs are City’s weird kryptonite, but there was still an added zip and swagger about Thomas Frank’s side at the Etihad, especially on the break, that portrayed an absolute confidence that the hosts were vulnerable.",
      "At the AmEx, City assumed the control that Guardiola so craves before they relinquished it whole. And all it took was a quadruple substitution. After that, Brighton unleashed a storm on their visitors that the City of old would usually weather with little inconvenience. But this version of City, one evidently still traumatised and in transition, wilted.",
      "“We forgot to play,” as Pep put it and his four changes – two doubles – to counter Brighton’s, initially to steady the ship and then to stop it sinking, failed to have the desired effect.",
      "More lasting changes came in the following days, with Ilkay Gundogan, Manuel Akanji and Ederson waved off, the trio following Kevin De Bruyne, Kyle Walker and Jack Grealish through the exit. It is a turnover that City planned for – most of it, at least – but one that sees a lot of stoic experience leave a dressing room already on the back foot.",

      "Does Gianluigi Donnarumma make a derby debut after barely a few days in Manchester, immediately putting James Trafford’s nose out of joint? Donnarumma arrives in England after conceding four to Israel while getting away with punching a corner into his own net amid scathing reviews of his performance.",

      "Liverpool ‘flop’ Florian Wirtz didn’t look like a £116m player before the international break, so he features among a struggling Big Six sextet needing to step up…",
      "",
      "Foden arguably produced the worst defence of a PFA Player of the Year award ever in 2024/25 (though there are three other credible contenders) and he’s yet to get going this season due to supposed fitness issues.",
      "Following the performances of Noni Madueke and other fringe men against Serbia, Foden faces a long road back to the England starting XI in a World Cup year, though he has more pressing matters at club level.",
      "Foden’s sensational 2023/24 campaign was his coming-out party, as it indicated he was ready to finally become Man City’s main man as he stepped up in the absence of injury-plagued Kevin De Bruyne. However, in a single year, he has gone from being a shoe-in to be the club legend’s long-term successor to fighting for his future at his boyhood club.",
      "The days of Foden exit talk being laughed off are long gone as he risks being left behind and in need of a new adventure to kickstart his career, a la Jack Grealish, if he cannot reignite his Etihad career. He has the necessary ability to quickly silence his critics, but he needs to get a move on, as Pep Guardiola’s patience will be running thin.",

      "",
      "Martinelli is another Big Six stalwart whose time is running out, as his contract situation and Arsenal’s summer business make his exit in 2026 increasingly likely.",
      "Bukayo Saka’s world-class contributions have far outweighed Martinelli’s in recent seasons as the two wingers’ trajectories have gone in opposing directions. While the England international has developed into one of the most complete wingers around, his teammate’s stagnation is a real worry as he’s become a weak link in Mikel Arteta’s side.",
      "Martinelli’s lack of growth pushed Arteta and Andrea Berta to focus Arsenal’s summer recruitment in wide areas, with big-money arrivals Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke finally providing quality competition.",
      "If Arteta’s decision on selection was purely based on form, Martinelli would be Arsenal’s third-choice left winger as he was fortunate to start against Liverpool before the international break. He can either rise in the face of adversity to re-cement himself or be reduced to being a peripheral figure en route to a 2026 exit. It’s really up to him how this goes.",
      "",
      "Under-fire head coach Ruben Amorim has protected Man Utd’s new No.9 since his £74m move to Old Trafford, though the few glimpses of him so far have not inspired optimism and it’s even been suggested that they ‘regret’ signing him over another striker. As Gary Neville said, he’s been “nowhere near”.",
      "Sesko built match fitness during the international break and will benefit from his 180 minutes for Slovenia ahead of being thrown into the fire against Man City, with a start surely certain as Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are injured.",
      "His Manchester derby performance should say a lot about his character and whether he can thrive at Man Utd or follow Rasmus Hojlund in fading into insignificance, having failed to handle the immense pressure.",
      "Sesko clearly has plenty of great attributes and there is a gem to be unearthed by Man Utd and Amorim in the coming months, but the young striker needs to do his bit too and show he has the bottle to live up to expectations.",

      "Having been backed by many to flop following his move to Spurs, Solanke enjoyed a steady, if not unremarkable, debut season at the north London side.",
      "The 27-year-old played a key role in Tottenham’s Europa League run and netted a respectable nine Premier League goals, but he has had a rough start to this season.",
      "The unexpected return to form of Richarlison under new boss Thomas Frank limited his minutes before he picked up a slight injury, with his situation further complicated by the deadline day arrival of Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "Given that Spurs fell into the Champions League by winning the Europa League, Solanke should have plenty of minutes as Frank’s side compete on all four fronts, but he’s gone from being their sole No.9 to being third in the pecking order in no time and could be cast out by a Big Six club for the second time in his career if his season continues in this current vain.",
      "",
      "Trafford is perhaps the only one of the many stars to snub Newcastle United in the summer who regrets his decision as he faces losing the No.1 spot at Man City in record time.",
      "Long touted as a future England No.1, Trafford is a model Pep Guardiola goalkeeper due to his brilliant ball-playing ability, but he was bullied by opponents when in the Premier League with Burnley, and his physical frailties have also been exposed at the start of this campaign.",
      "A flurry of early-season mistakes from Trafford and a unique market opportunity to sign one of the world’s best goalkeepers on the cheap encouraged Man City to sign Gianluigi Donnarumma on deadline day.",
      "Donnarumma is not your typical Guardiola goalkeeper, as he is renowned for his shot-stopping rather than his ball-playing. But, club chiefs, understandably, felt it was a no-brainer to snap him up when he became available, and his arrival means Trafford will be a No.2 for the remainder of his Man City career if he doesn’t grow into the role of No.1 at a big club.",

      "‘Wirtz will be a flop until he’s not’, explained eloquently by Ashmundo in Friday’s Mailbox.",
      "‘Wirtz cost an absolute fortune, so he’s going to be scrutinised at every turn, sorry about that. You can’t compare him to two of the best players to have played the game until he has reached those heady heights himself. He’s just as likely to be a Pogba, a Schevchenko or even a Robinho. Until such point as otherwise proven he will be an expensive flop in the eyes of all other fans. This is the way.’",
      "The debate surrounding Wirtz (and the Nottingham Forest circus) carried us through a tiresome international break, with the £116m summer signing harshly written off as being utterly useless already.",
      "Yes, Wirtz produced nothing of note in Liverpool’s opening three Premier League games and his outspoken critics will continue to sharpen their pitchforks for as long as his struggles last. However, the former British record signing has been a victim of Arne Slot changing his style, so it’s not entirely his fault that he’s looked out of place as the champions get accustomed to a fresh approach.",
      "Barring the odd exciting touch or pass, the Premier League is yet to see the best of this special talent, though goals and assists should come once he and a player in a typical No.10 role are bedded into this Liverpool side. By which point, his many naysayers would have done a Homer and retreated into the bushes.",

      "The Eagles have outscored Aston Villa in 2025 to lie fifth in a calendar year table that sees Newcastle United way down in a lowly ninth below David Moyes’ Everton.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United are somehow down in 15th position below even Wolves, leaving the Portuguese manager in a whole heap of trouble and fighting for his job.",
      "Glasner’s contract expires next summer and he is incredibly unlikely to sign another deal after leading the south London club into Europe.",
      "He did at least stay long enough to ensure that Marc Guehi remained a Palace player for the final year of his own deal, but Manchester United will be one of many clubs who will be keen to appoint him next summer.",
      "Former Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan has already named the man he expects to replace Glasner at Palace.",
      "“There was an interest in Cooper at Palace two or three years ago. Glasner is not going to be at Palace in a year’s time (laughing) – as much as I may want him to be,” Jordan told talkSPORT.",
      "“He’s not gonna be at Palace. He’s got a year left. I’d be gobsmacked. I hope he is and I hope I’m wrong.",
      "“But given the fact he’s barely been backed, given the fact it’s going to be very difficult for him to replicate what he achieved last year, it is a distinct possibility he’s going to be on his way from Palace.",
      "“Given the fact that Cooper was liked by Palace, it wouldn’t be beyond the wit of man to put him into Brondby, get Brondby going for a year and then move him out of Brondby into Palace, because Blitzer is the intellectual capital behind both.”",

      "Why is this important? Well it seems to me that all the other leagues will be watching with interest, it’s very much the canary down the coal mine. The current model for the Premier League is a complete anachronism; it’s 20th century distribution in a 21st century world. No content is distributed like this anymore; TV, music, film and even books are accessed using models far closer to what Ligue Un are doing. The idea of having 3 separate broadcasters, with 3 separate subscriptions, and it gives you access to only some of the content is just bizarre and bad for the fans. It does feel like it’s in its final throes.",

      "A new report claims Manchester United could sign an ‘elite’ player for *only* £60m in January, though this is utter nonsense…",
      "Man Utd invested around £230m on new signings in this summer’s transfer window as they overhauled their attack and landed a new goalkeeper.",
      "The Red Devils desperately needed reinforcements in these areas, though they still have a way to go if they are to return to challenging for the Premier League and/or Champions League in the next couple of years.",
      "A huge change was promised, but the same problems remain as United are still ineffective in attack and easy to play through, while it remains to be seen whether unproven Senne Lammens can address their issue between the sticks.",
      "One glaring misstep in the summer was Man Utd’s failure to sign a new centre-midfielder as they are still crying out for a No.6 to partner Bruno Fernandes or Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "READ: Big Weekend: Manchester derby, Alexander Isak, Ange Postecoglou, West Ham",
      "They made an ambitious move for Carlos Baleba, though Brighton swatted their Premier League rivals away by setting their asking price at around £100m.",
      "It has been suggested that the Red Devils will ‘return’ for Baleba next year, though they are going to be left exposed until the Brighton star (or another centre-midfielder) joins the club in January/next summer.",
      "Baleba is also said to be among ‘three elite options’ for Man Utd, who are also reportedly targeting Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and former Wolves star Ruben Neves.",
      "Wharton would certainly be a better option than Neves and even potentially Baleba, as the Palace standout has been a revelation under Oliver Glasner.",

      "“His ability to dictate play from deep fits perfectly into Ruben Amorim’s tactical setup. They made an approach in the summer, but Palace rejected it outright.”",
      "This is fair enough, but an outlandish claim is made further into the article, with it boldly suggested Wharton’s ‘price has been cut to £60m’ after he ‘would have cost £100m’ in the summer.",
      "‘For January, Wharton will more likely cost around £60m as he could be keen to get a move to a club playing in Europe to boost his World Cup hopes with England.’",
      "Honestly, what complete nonsense.",
      "Crystal Palace proved with the Marc Guehi saga that they are willing to hold firm to eke out as much cash as possible when selling a key asset, and that was with a player only under contract until next summer.",
      "Wharton, meanwhile, is contracted to Palace until 2029, so Oliver Glasner’s side are under no real pressure to sell and certainly won’t be ‘cutting’ Wharton’s price anytime soon.",
      "Also, Wharton being in a World Cup year would surely make Palace wait until the summer, at least, to see how he fares in the hope that a buying club offers an extra few million.",
      "So it’ll be £100m, not £60m; sorry to burst your bubble, Manchester United fans…",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Altay Bayindir will start ahead of Senne Lammens against Man City in the Manchester Derby on Sunday.",
      "After bringing in Lammens from Royal Antwerp on deadline day, Onana was allowed to join Trabzonspor on loan until the end of the season.",
      "Reports have claimed that Amorim saw Onana’s exit from Old Trafford as key to his rebuild of the club and it was felt that the Cameroon international ‘was showing a lack of involvement and interest in working for the team in the final days before the international break.’",
      "It’s not yet clear whether Lammens has been brought in as number one or to challenge Bayindir but Amorim confirmed on Friday that the latter is starting against Man City on Sunday.",
      "READ: Missing Men: When Gary Neville fed the Goat in the final Maine Road Manchester derby",
      "Amorim told a press conference: “Altay is going to continue. It is a different league, a different country, different training, different ball. So we will try to maintain that and they will fight for the position but for me in this game is clear, Altay will start.”",
      "On Lammens, the Man Utd boss added: “He is a goalkeeper with a lot of potential. I know that we are in a moment where the goalkeeper needs to be really strong and have a lot of experience. We are also in the moment where we have to look at the present but also with a focus on the future – so it is a little bit of both. He’s a guy with a great potential that is one more option [for us] to play, and he will be ready.”",
      "When asked why Man Utd signed Lammens over Aston Villa’s Emi Martinez, Amorim continued: “We have an option that can give us different things in the moment but also has a great potential to be our goalkeeper for a lot of years so that was out choice in the end.”",
      "On why Onana had to leave Old Trafford, Amorim said: “I think we understood that this needed a change and sometimes it is hard to point out why. Sometimes it is the moment, the bad luck in some moments.",
      "“It is hard on him, on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers but I wish the best for Andre Onana.",
      "“He was really good at working and trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need a change.”",
      "Injured trio Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and Diogo Dalot, who cost Man Utd £136.5m in total, will be missing against Man City at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim said of the trio: “They are out for this game. I don’t know how long it is going to take. We need our guys to be a very competitive team but we have very good players who are eager to play, so we will be competitive on Sunday but they are out. They cannot help us in this game.”",
      "When asked how long they will be out for, Amorim replied: “I don’t want to say. If you talk to Cunha he will say he is able to play this game. So I don’t know. We will manage day-by-day. They are pushing really hard and that is a good thing.”",

      "After talks between Fernandes’ agent, Miguel Pinho, and the Saudi club, the Man Utd captain decided to stay at the Premier League club for the time being.",
      "Revealing why he opted to stay at Man Utd over a move to Saudi, Fernandes – who has also attracted interest from Al-Nassr and Al-Ittihad – said: “The president of Al Hilal called me a month ago to ask me about it.",
      "“There was a waiting period for me to think about the future. As I have always said, I would be willing to do it if Manchester United thought so.",
      "“I spoke to coach Ruben Amorim who, throughout that period, was very annoying to me not to go! The club said they would not be willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave, that it was not a financial issue.”",
      "READ: Missing Men: When Gary Neville fed the Goat in the final Maine Road Manchester derby",
      "Fernandes added: “It was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a fantastic person. We never discussed the amount [initially]. With my agent? Of course.",
      "“Then, I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what my personal goals were in my career. She was someone who always supported me a lot.",
      "“It was an easy move, even at a family level. I had Joao Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team, we have a great friendship.",
      "“But I want to maintain myself at the highest level, playing in the big competitions. and I feel capable of it.”",
      "In a fresh update on Saudi interest in Fernandes, Fabrizio Romano revealed earlier this week that clubs in the Middle East are ready to return for the Man Utd captain in 2026.",
      "Romano explained on his YouTube channel: “From Saudi, they want to return in the future. For 2026, keep an eye on Saudi because they will return. And then, it’s going to be up to Bruno to say ‘yes, I want to come’ or ‘no, I want to stay in Europe, no, I want to stay in Manchester United’.",

      "Although he failed to persuade Fernandes to join him in the summer transfer window, the report adds that ‘interest remains alive and could be revived by January 2026’.",
      "The report continues: ‘The English club is experiencing financial difficulties and could seriously consider selling one of its most valuable assets if an attractive offer comes in. Fernandes is entering the final stretch of his contract, increasing the pressure to define his future.’",

      "The Premier League roars back after the international break with an absolute cracker of a weekend in store.",
      "There’s a Manchester derby where the Heavyweight Crisis Club belt is on the line, there’s the return of Ange Postecoglou, there’s the prospect of Alexander Isak and all manner of other shiny late-summer signings making their debuts, and in the Championship the long-awaited return of a south-coast derby to the league schedule after a 13-year absence.",
      "It is, in short, a very Big Weekend. Enjoy.",
      "A Sunday afternoon treat in store for us all in one of those games absolutely guaranteed to provide narrative out the wazoo no matter what happens.",
      "The fixture computer has been cruel indeed to Manchester City, compelling them to play their first two home games against the teams who inflicted the most embarrassing league defeats upon them at the Etihad last season.",
      "History has already repeated itself thanks to Spurs’ alarmingly controlled and tension-free 2-0 victory a few weeks ago, and City really cannot afford any kind of repeat of the late nonsense United pulled on them in a 2-1 win during the depths of City’s late 2024 despair.",
      "Whoever loses this really is in big trouble.",
      "If it’s United, then the difficulty of the fixture list will provide only scant mitigation for a poor league start (not to mention the Grimsby unpleasantness) in which Ruben Amorim has been lucky to nick a point against Fulham and even luckier to beat Burnley at home.",
      "He already sits atop the reformed Sack Race now Nuno Espirito Santo has been Marinakised and has both Chelsea and Liverpool to worry about in the weeks ahead.",
      "If it’s City, then the early crisis club mantle passes to the blue half of Manchester after three straight defeats and a title challenge petering out in mid-September and renewed questions about whether Pep Guardiola has the energy or desire to follow through on building himself another great City side on the back of all 24/25’s relative struggle.",
      "The most damning thing for City would be the fact that those three straight defeats would have come without a meaningful title rival in sight; that looms with next week’s trip to the Emirates which really would start to look like a fixture that could end City’s Premier League season before we’ve even reached the second international break.",
      "Or it could be a draw, in which case no firm answers can be reached but they’re probably both f*cked.",
      "So yeah. A Sunday afternoon treat for absolutely everyone, except for anyone who supports at least one and very possibly both of these clubs.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings: 14 places between Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "",
      "Here he comes. He’s back. Angeball is inevitable.",
      "Nottingham Forest insisted they really didn’t want to get rid of Nuno Espirito Santo and had no intention to do so right up until the moment they, alas and alack, felt they simply had no choice given the breakdown in trust for which they were in no way responsible. Which all means the negotiations to appoint a replacement they hadn’t given a moment’s thought to previously were conducted in record time, with Ange Postecoglou appointed mere hours after Nuno’s midnight axe.",
      "Really, it’s just another reminder of what an efficient, well-run club Nottingham Forest are these days. That’s just the speed at which they can get things done.",
      "And another example of how efficient and clear-headed Forest are is in the way they’ve gone straight out and snaffled themselves a manager to provide seamless, frictionless continuity given the obvious similarities in the way he and Nuno operate.",
      "Yes, if unfortunate circumstances outside your control just after the end of the transfer window force you to replace the manager who last season delivered success wildly beyond any reasonable expectation, then really all you can do is go out and appoint the closest thing you can find to what you’ve lost.",
      "Or, of course, there’s the other option, which is to look at what’s worked so well for you and that departing manager and the squad you’d built for him over the last 18 months, and then appoint literally the most polar opposite manager it is possible to imagine, one whose tactics led a bigger and wealthier and far more established club to 17th place last season.",
      "It’s a genuinely brilliant slice of nonsense, this, and one that has absolutely no downside. It’s a plan so stupid that it might in fact be genius and actually work, in which case: great. There really are few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works.",
      "But do you know what is one of the few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works? Angeball when it doesn’t.",
      "If you’re not enormously excited by the prospect of Nikola Milenkovic playing a high line then we really are very different people.",
      "At the other end, though, Forest absolutely do have the attacking tools to cause teams serious pain when given freedom and licence to roam and with chests swelled with pride by one of Ange’s patented inspirational team talks.",
      "There’s a reason everyone who has played for Postecoglou seems to adore the bloke. It’s just who he is, mate.",
      "And of course the fixture computer has sent him to Arsenal for his first game back in the Premier League.",
      "It’s unlikely Ange has had time to get all his ideas across to his new charges, which for this game might well be for the best. It is a bit of a free hit for him anyway. Just pump the players’ tyres and send them out there. Get any kind of result and it sets him up for potentially the sort of instant ‘WTF?’ impact he had in those very early games at Tottenham.",
      "Lose, and he can just come out in the post-match interview and say ‘Warra trophy, mate’ and he still wins. Perfect.",
      "",
      "Always a highlight of this first post-interlull matchday, of course. We’ve all been starved of delicious Barclays for an agonising, drawn-out fortnight but when it comes back it comes back strong with all those late summer signings set for debuts, from Isak against Burnley to his assorted replacements for Newcastle, to Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani at Spurs, or Harvey Elliott for Villa, and the quite brilliant fact we really don’t actually know with any compelling certainty who will be in either goal for the Manchester derby.",
      "But Isak is clearly the star attraction here. Given that he’s short of match sharpness and had precious little time with his new team-mates due to confirmation of his move coming so late in the window and having to head pretty much straight off to international duty with Sweden, it’s very possible – likely even – that he is only on the bench for Liverpool at Turf Moor.",
      "That’s only a minor consolation for Burnley, though, who will have to deal with a still-elite attack posing nightmarish threats from every direction while also knowing that just as the fatigue of chasing Wirtz and Ekitike and Salah around for an hour or so really starts to kick in, they’re likely to have to deal with perhaps the Premier League’s best centre-forward stepping off the bench with sky-high motivation and myriad points to prove. Very best of luck to you.",
      "",
      "West Ham’s 3-0 win at Nottingham Forest just before the international break was perhaps the single most discombobulating result of that entire 30-match intro to the new Premier League season.",
      "Kneejerk assessments had been made of West Ham in the previous fortnight, and the consensus was clear: they were rubbish, and many people feared for them, they really did. We did. We do.",
      "But the chaotic final 10 minutes at the City Ground changed everything. It provided cover for Forest to do what they obviously wanted to do to Nuno, for one thing, but also sent the Hammers into the international break looking a very different beast and with potentially a very different season to the one everyone had prescribed for them.",
      "There is still the sense that it was just a freak nonsense. The goals coming in a rush at the end as they did certainly adds to that sense.",
      "So the challenge for Graham Potter and his players is to immediately disprove that theory. To immediately use it as a springboard to launch a season that had started so miserably.",
      "And for that reason there really are few better fixtures to follow it for West Ham than Tottenham at home. Spurs fans have long mocked West Ham for this game being the Hammers’ cup final, noise which quietened when West Ham inconveniently reached and won an actual cup final while Spurs were languishing in trophyless banterland.",
      "Last season’s Europa League win means that noise will return for a fixture that has a compelling history of high-level nonsense, one that has featured dramatic late winners for Spurs from names as varied as Paul Stalteri, Eric Dier and Gareth Bale, to Manuel Lanzini halting Tottenham’s bid to put the pressure on Chelsea in 2017 and more recent match-winning exploits from Michail Antonio and Jesse Lingard.",
      "West Ham haven’t lost at home to Tottenham since 2019, when Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge of Spurs produced a chaotic 3-2 win that was in no way whatsoever a sign of things to come.",
      "The last three have ended in 1-1 draws, and even that would be enough to give West Ham something to work with moving forward. Which really didn’t look likely after those two miserable opening defeats and pitiful Carabao exit.",
      "",
      "The real El Clasicoast returns as a league fixture for the first time since a 2-2 Championship draw in April 2012, and 13 years in which assorted miseries have befallen both clubs. Especially Southampton, but especially Portsmouth.",
      "A Premier League team in 2010 became a League Two one by 2013 and it’s been a long slow climb back to the second tier and renewed acquaintances with their local rivals.",
      "Southampton themselves were in League One during Portsmouth’s final Premier League season, and just seven years later were completing a fourth successive season in the top flight’s top eight under managers like Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman.",
      "They then fell off, bobbed around a bit and last year, as Portsmouth finally dragged themselves back up into the Championship, Southampton tumbled back into it after the second worst Premier League season in history.",
      "And it’s Portsmouth who’ve now made the better start to this season ahead of the short trip to St Mary’s.",
      "",
      "Juventus bid to make it three wins from three at the start of the Serie A season against an Inter side whose opening-day high of a 5-0 win over Torino was followed by a real back-to-earth-with-a-bump of a home defeat to Udinese after taking an early lead.",
      "Juventus haven’t, in truth, been wholly convincing against either Parma or Genoa, but two wins from two games without conceding a goal is never to be sniffed at.",
      "We’ll have a better idea about where both these teams might be heading this season by Saturday evening.",

      "The newly-promoted Lionesses host their first ever WSL match this weekend, with life not getting much easier after a chastening defeat at the hands of Arsenal last week.",
      "There are plenty of reasons to think this weekend might go differently, though. World-record signing Grace Geyoro could come straight into the side, while a thin-looking United squad could well be a touch weary after a 1-0 midweek defeat in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier against Brann.",
      "That result also leaves Marc Skinner’s side likely to have one eye on the crucial return leg next week and vulnerable to a London City side who will have laser focus and history-making on their mind.",
      "Should City be approaching this derby with even more trepidation than United? Ruben Amorim has an opportunity to shift the spotlight across Manchester…",

      "Andre Onana is the latest Erik ten Hag signing to leave under Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim, with the goalkeeper joining Trabzonspor on loan.",

      "But he is cleaning up an unholy mess left by his predecessor. A mess that was, admittedly, enabled by the Man Utd hierarchy.",
      "The new-ish Red Devils hierarchy has already made several mistakes. One was keeping Ten Hag after a worst-ever Premier League campaign in 2023/24. Another might well be picking Amorim as his replacement less than four months after his contract extension.",
      "There may be a vastly different boardroom, personnel-wise, but the same mistakes the old hierarchy made with Ten Hag have potentially been repeated with Amorim. And if his fate is the same, a club in transition could end up in an even bigger mess than the one the Portuguese inherited.",
      "READ: Amorim sent resignation warning as Rangnick the only Man Utd manager of six still standing",
      "In Ten Hag’s first summer at Man Utd, he was backed with a monstrous, club-record transfer window, spending £227million on Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro, while Christian Eriksen joined on a free transfer and Martin Dubravka on loan.",
      "Man Utd had their foreshadowing moments, such as the 7-0 defeat at Liverpool and the Europa League meltdown against Sevilla, but overall, it was a positive first season for Ten Hag, who guided the Red Devils to third in the Premier League, the FA Cup final, and Carabao Cup glory.",
      "The club clearly got giddy and backed Ten Hag with more of ‘his own players’. Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount, Andre Onana, Sofyan Amrabat, Altay Bayindir, Jonny Evans and Sergio Reguilon all joined for a combined £166million.",
      "Ten Hag was clearly obsessed with signing players he had previously managed, or at least those with Eredivisie experience.",
      "That approach was again evident in a 2024 summer full of uncertainty surrounding his future, as Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui were among those to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Fast forward to January 2025: Amorim is two months into the job, not being backed with heavy spending because Man Utd’s hands are tied, but supported with the signing of wing-back Patrick Dorgu — a clear sign that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his board are buying into their head coach’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Six months, two domestic cup exits, a Europa League final defeat, and a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League later, they did it again.",
      "Amorim was backed with an enormous transfer kitty as the club remained confident in his managerial ability and in a formation that’s still not working.",
      "But while he has been supported with new signings and patience, he has also been tasked with finding solutions for a host of underperforming players signed by his predecessor.",
      "Onana has now followed Ten Hag signings Antony and Hojlund out under Amorim’s watch.",
      "Those are three extremely expensive mistakes. There are suggestions that Ten Hag preferred other strikers, like Harry Kane, over Hojlund, but there’s no doubt the Dutchman desperately wanted Antony and Onana, both of whom he managed at Ajax.",
      "The goalkeeper situation was one Amorim wanted to address in the summer but knew it was easier said than done with more pressing issues in attack and a restricted budget.",
      "A pre-season injury suffered by Onana got the ball rolling, as Man Utd ended up signing Senne Lammens on deadline day, with the 29-year-old falling from first to third choice in just two months.",

      "The showing of faith from Amorim comes after Andre Onana's season-long loan move to Trabzonspor was confirmed and the club completed a deadline-day move for Senne Lammens.",
      "The 27-year-old was easily barged out of the way of the ball as Ricardo Calafiori scored the only goal in Arsenal's 1-0 victory at Old Trafford, despite a dominant United display on the opening day. Bayindir was also flung into the spotlight when he parried the ball into the path of Jaidon Anthony during United's 3-2 win over Burnley last time out.",
      "His performances led to some calls from fans to see Lammens given the nod for the derby; however, Amorim maintains that the club will be feeding players in differently to ensure players thrive at the club.",
      "\"It's not just the pressure of Manchester United, but it's a different club,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"We are building stability at the club to make new players better. If you go back into the past, this club had a really good base with Roy Keane, Gary Neville, all of these types of guys, but I remember world-class players like [Juan-Sebastián] Veron had problems.",
      "\"We had a situation in the past with goalkeepers where we spent a lot of time trying to get a goalkeeper and then Edwin van der Sar came and was like a different player in that position.",
      "\"It's not something that is happening now. It's happening now because we cannot win a lot of titles and that adds more pressure to every player, but we've had these kind of moments at this kind of club.",
      "\"We will try to build stability and a base to help all of these players and we are building that. So in this moment, it's really hard for different players to adapt to this club.\"",
      "Asked who the club's next Van der Sar is, Amorim said:",
      "\"This week I hope to see Altay Bayindir doing well like Van der Sar. Then in the future, they have to fight for the places. We as a team can help the goalkeepers be better. We are doing that.\"",
      "Amorim says it was the right time for both the club and Onana to part ways.",
      "Onana, like Bayindir, was beaten to the ball easily as Grimsby doubled their lead over Man Utd in normal time before United fought back to reach a penalty shootout.",

      "\"You look at the moment and the performance, it's not about Onana's last game, but you can feel the environment. We felt it was a good moment to make a change in that position.\"",
      "Amorim also believes that after the transfer window, he can see more things in the team that he likes. United signed the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, who helped take Man Utd's spending to £232.4m.",
      "Outgoings included Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho, who secured loan moves elsewhere and permanent departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho. Amorim believes his side are better and that owes to losing the Europa League final, which means fewer games and more time on the training pitch.",
      "\"It's going to take time, but we are better,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"I can see more things in my team that I like. More of the things I don't like in my [current] team are more mental because I know the quality is there. We proved in different weekends.\"",
      "\"I think it's hard for the fans, people and some pundits to understand because the Europa League win would have brought us more money to spend and change a lot of things in the team and more games to rotate the team for more players to be happy, but I think we need time.",
      "\"So for me it was the best thing about losing the final, if there can be a best thing. It was time to improve not just the team but also the club.",
      "\"We've shown that a little bit in the games, we play better, we are more dominant, we create more chances, we avoid more chances from the opponent. We are going to use every minute to improve our base. To have our way of playing to be ready for the adaptation, for them to understand every detail of their positions.",
      "Now we have a full week to have a schedule and show the mistakes and now you are showing what you did well in the last game. Now we have more days to focus on the strategy for the next game.\"",

      "Manchester City and Manchester United have a rebuild on their hands, but, despite indifferent starts, have they shown signs of promise going into the new season?;the Manchester derby takes place at the Etihad, live on Sky this Sunday, with kick-off at 4.30pm",
      "Friday 12 September 2025 17:02, UK",
      "The winds of change are sweeping through Manchester.",
      "Manchester City and Manchester United meet at the Etihad on Sunday as the validity of their respective rebuilds continues to be scrutinised.",
      "For the first time in four seasons, the Premier League trophy is in a different home. Tasked with bringing back what has been City's on six of the last eight occasions is Pep Guardiola, but he is in uncomfortable territory.",
      "United are all too familiar with the promise of a rebuild. Ruben Amorim represents the sixth permanent time of asking for a manager at the Old Trafford club to restore the glories of the past.",
      "While for Guardiola, after nine years - his longest spell at a club - he navigates another reboot to restore more recent success, for the first time in his managerial career.",
      "Still yet to provide proof that his footballing concepts can bear fruit, Amorim, on the other hand, must convince fans that a record low finish of 15th in the Premier League was a blip in his first full season at the helm.",
      "United have made an indifferent start to the new season. There was a sense of positivity despite defeat in the season opener to Arsenal. Old habits crept in as United gave away a lead at Fulham and Carabao Cup embarrassment at League Two Grimsby wearied both fans and Amorim himself of whether he could continue as the boss.",
      "After the penalty shoot-out defeat at Grimsby, the Portuguese boss suggested \"something had to change\", implying that it could not be the players, leaving the door open to speculation over his future. Days later, Amorim backtracked on his comments, putting them down to emotion, explaining, \"sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years\".",
      "That frustration perhaps could be borne out of the fact that United are doing the right things but are lacking the results and points to reflect their improvements. United have only scored one goal from open play this season, but the underlying numbers appear much more favourable for United.",
      "It is very early on in the season, but Amorim's side have generated the most expected goals, have had the most shots and created the most chances in the Premier League so far this term, reflecting a freer, flowing attack.",
      "United have also hit the post four times across their three opening fixtures as their new-look forward line attempts to improve on their return.",
      "Incomings in the form of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have made for a more expressive United in forward areas, but there has also been a greater emphasis on a more direct style with United also leading the Premier League in long passes completed.",
      "Signs of improvement extend to United's newly-found willingness to battle, a side of their game that has often been criticised. Only one side has bettered United this season when it comes to duels won and aerial duels won.",
      "Amorim will be desperate for his side's promising numbers to translate into victories. United's win over Burnley before the break was a much-needed one but the Manchester derby offers further opportunity to reflect proof of concept.",
      "Guardiola is the only current manager that Amorim has faced more than once in the Premier League while remaining undefeated.",
      "Amorim beat Guardiola twice during the 2024/25 season, the first as he led Sporting to a 4-1 victory in the Champions League days before taking up his post at Old Trafford. Amad then sealed a late comeback win for Amorim at the Etihad last December. The Manchester derby ended goalless when the two last met in April.",
      "City's unprecedented dip in form last season pushed the club into uncharted territory. Their lowest points total under Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term prompted a summer rebuild. But their woes have dripped into the new season with Guardiola making his worst start to a league campaign since 2008.",
      "Kevin De Bruyne's departure signalled a new era at the Etihad. Summer signings James Trafford, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders added to January acquisitions of Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Omar Marmoush, among others to create a new-look City under a new director of football, Hugo Viana.",
      "However, with just one win on the table in the Premier League so far, the 'new Man City' have made a stuttering start.",
      "Changes to the technical staff appear to have had some impact. Former Liverpool assistant Pep Ljinders has joined Guardiola in the dugout alongside Kolo Toure. Lijnders, Jurgen Klopp's former right-hand man, was famed for his part in Liverpool's dynamic, high-octane approach.",
      "Jamie Carragher, after City's resounding opening victory at Wolves, noted City's \"rock-and-roll\" approach, akin to Klopp's Liverpool.",
      "\"It felt like in the game, it's almost like a little bit of an obsession, certainly in the first half, about catching them offside,\" Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"We always know Pep's team like to push up. We get all that, but that was something a little bit different. It just makes me think of the influence of Pep Lijnders in terms of the offside.",
      "\"When you think of Liverpool as well, keeping back to Pep Lijnders, the amount of counter-attacking goals that Liverpool team would score with [Sadio] Mane and [Mohammed] Salah, breaking forward. When I looked at the goal from Reinders in the game. It was fantastic.",
      "\"But one of the goals was what you'd think of as a counter-attack, not maybe a Pep Guardiola goal. They win it, and then they're off.\"",
      "A change in approach has been evident. With Cherki now involved and the reintroduction of Oscar Bobb, there has been a slightly greater emphasis on individual flair, with City having completed the most take-ons of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Despite Rodri returning to fitness, City appear to have struggled to control games, giving up their lead over Brighton and being blown away by Thomas Frank's rampant Tottenham. It is that perceived lack of control that will be bothering Guardiola the most ahead of the derby.",
      "United head into the derby above City for the first time in five years, but that does not remove the feeling of trepidation that surrounds Old Trafford at the moment.",
      "The added context of key City absentees in the form of Marmoush and Cherki will offer confidence. As will Amorim's record against Guardiola and City's only win in their last four meetings, being the Community Shield shoot-out victory last season.",
      "Derby games are the proverbial great leveller, but when both sides have been equally uninspiring in terms of results, it becomes a must-win for both managers that could be indicative of the validity of their rebuilds.",

      "In the blue corner, Champions League winner and Euro 2020 hero Gianluigi Donnarumma has joined Pep Guardiola's squad, throwing James Trafford's spot in the starting line-up into question despite only signing from Burnley in July.",
      "In the red corner, Senne Lammens' £18.2m arrival from Royal Antwerp on Deadline Day sealed the immediate future of Andre Onana after a catalogue of high-profile mistakes, with a move to Trabzonspor now confirmed for the Cameroon international.",
      "Amorim has since confirmed Altay Bayindir will retain his role in the starting line-up for the derby, insisting it is time to show faith in the Turkey goalkeeper in the face of new competition from their newest recruit.",
      "Two bitter rivals sharing the same predicament with the goalkeeping position in full focus.",
      "\"Altay [Bayindir] is going to continue because we need to,\" Amorim said ahead of the game against City.",
      "\"This game is clear. Altay will start. It's a show of faith in Altay.\"",
      "The United boss has been forced to publicly back Bayindir yet again, after already seeing his starting credentials questioned following errors against both Burnley and Arsenal.",
      "The 1-0 defeat to Mikel Arteta's side arrived from a Riccardo Calafiori header after Bayindir failed to command his area, while victory was almost snatched away against Burnley when Bayindir spilled the ball back into his own penalty area for Jaidon Anthony to tap home.",
      "Bayindir now has the backing from his boss but needs to repay that faith with a solid display at the Etihad.",
      "Bayindir will need to take the opportunity ahead of him with Lammens now waiting in the wings, eager to impress.",
      "The numbers have backed up the signing of the 23-year-old. Whether the eye test matches his impressive statistics remains to be seen.",
      "No goalkeeper made more saves in Europe's top 10 leagues last season during his 30 appearances in the Belgian Pro League. He also had one of the highest goals-prevented metrics in Europe and made the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "A debut in the derby has been clearly been deemed too much of a risk by Amorim - but it will not be long before Lammens is given a chance to impress.",
      "Breaking into the AC Milan squad as a teenager, playing at the San Siro against rivals Inter at 16, two penalty saves in the shoot-out against England to guide Italy to the Euros title in 2021, Champions League hero and a two-time Yashin Trophy winner.",
      "A debut in the Manchester derby would not faze Donnarumma. He is made for the big occasion.",
      "There have been questions raised about whether the 26-year-old fits Guardiola's style of play, but the City boss has insisted he is not expecting the 26-year-old to replicate Ederson's ability with the ball at his feet.",
      "\"I always try to adapt to the quality of the players,\" said Guardiola at his press conference ahead of the derby.",
      "\"I wouldn't demand 'Gigi' do something he is uncomfortable with. We are talking about the best (goalkeeper) I have ever seen with distribution, short and long passes, in Ederson.",
      "\"We didn't take Gigi to do what Ederson has done. Gigi has another quality.\"",
      "That quality is shot-stopping. City have faced 15 shots on target across the opening three games, the most of any side in the top flight, meaning Donnarumma's strength in this area will be welcomed with open arms by Guardiola and his staff.",
      "United lead the league in shots taken so far this season (56) and come in at second behind Liverpool for shots on target (15). Right now, City need a goalkeeper to address that threat. Donnarumma is the perfect option.",
      "His ability on the ball and other topics of debate are a discussion for another day.",
      "On the other hand, you could argue Trafford deserves the opportunity to impress in the derby.",
      "He enjoyed a steady start to his return to City, two years after leaving the club to join Burnley, having kept a clean sheet in the season opener against Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "However, a major error against Tottenham leading to the second goal of the afternoon during a 2-0 defeat, as well as another loss to Brighton and Hove Albion, has cast an unwanted spotlight on the 22-year-old.",
      "\"He is a keeper for Man City. I can only play one keeper,\" Guardiola added on Trafford now facing competition from Donnarumma.",
      "Despite the error and the new arrival, Trafford can still stake his claim to remain between the sticks for City.",
      "Only Guglielmo Vicario has made more saves than the City 'keeper across the opening three games, while he also comes in at second for goals prevented in the top flight.",
      "Trafford is a solid shot-stopper, capable of the extraordinary, as his tipped save against Brighton showed.",
      "Donnarumma could provide healthy and high-quality competition for the academy graduate, rather than displacing him immediately.",
