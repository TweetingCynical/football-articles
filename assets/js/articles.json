      "Manchester United are preparing to face West Ham on Thursday as the Red Devils target another unbeaten run. Ruben Amorim’s side produced an impressive second-half display to earn a 2-1 away win over Crystal Palace at the weekend.",
      "It was the ideal response from United following their disappointing home defeat to 10-man Everton last week. That loss ended the team’s five-game unbeaten streak but Amorim’s side were able to swiftly return to winning ways at Selhurst Park on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly prepared to offload four members of Ruben Amorim’s squad during the January transfer window. ESPN has claimed that the Red Devils will listen to offers for Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, Manuel Ugarte and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "The report states that United will need to raise funds to pursue midfield targets in January. However, there is an added complication, as allowing players to leave early in the window could leave Amorim with a depleted squad while the Africa Cup of Nations is still ongoing.",
      "All of the aforementioned United players have struggled for game time so far this season. Zirkzee has returned to the starting XI due to injuries to other forwards, while Ugarte has started on just three occasions.",
      "England international Mainoo’s sole start came in the cup defeat to Grimsby and he has consistently been linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Meanwhile, Malacia is yet to feature this season.",
      "Manchester United will have Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui available for longer than expected ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations. The trio are set to represent their respective nations at the tournament, which begins on December 21, but a new FIFA ruling has allowed clubs to keep their players until December 15.",
      "The deadline had previously been thought to be a week earlier. The ruling means Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui will now be eligible to face Wolves away on Monday, December 8, a game they were previously scheduled to miss.",
      "However, it remains unclear whether the extension will apply to United’s home game against Bournemouth on December 15. Mbeumo will be at AFCON with Cameroon, while Amad will represent Ivory Coast. Mazraoui will also hope to guide Morocco to victory. The tournament is scheduled to run until January 18.",
      "Before the ruling, Amorim shared his thoughts on the situation: “We have the rules, when we have to release the players, so we will see. We are doing our job to try and maintain the players a little bit longer, but it is not just in our hands. We need to respect that, but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and protect the national team.\"",

      "Manchester United are set to allow three youngsters to head out on loan in January. Diego Leon, Ayden Heaven and Chido Obi are all said to be available for temporary moves next month as transfer talk heats up.",
      "United could be active in the winter window as they prepare to to lose players to the Africa Cup of Nations with the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad all set to depart. But while the Red Devils could be poised to lean on their academy in the wake of players heading off mid-season, the likes of Heaven, Leon and Obi could still head out.",
      "The young trio have struggled for opportunities under Ruben Amorim this term, and are now set to continue their development elsewhere for the short term, per reports.",
      "Leon, 18, arrived at the club in the summer but had big ambitions after leaving Cerro Porteno. The young full-back has not yet appeared in a competitive fixture for the first team and is being linked with a move to Nice, who would offer him the chance to gain valuable first-team experience for six months.",
      "\"I’m really happy, I think every player dreams of this,\" Leon told Versus before his move to Old Trafford. \"When you’re a professional, you have to adapt quickly, it is a massive opportunity.",
      "\"Everyone thinks I’ll go out on loan, but I don’t have that mindset. I’m going to kill it in pre-season and within one or two games, I’ll already be playing with them.\"",
      "Heaven has enjoyed more first-team action since joining from Arsenal, but his situation is also likely to be assessed. The 19-year-old has shown promise but has only earned 158 minutes on the pitch this term. Forward Obi, who also joined from Arsenal, broke into United's first team plans last season after dominant displays in the youth ranks. Amorim has since admitted he introduced the striker at an inappropriate time.",
      "Obi has been required to settle with the club's under-21s this term, having made eight appearances under Amorim last season. The striker has not appeared since the final day game against Fulham Amorim believes he did not foster the correct environment for Obi to thrive last term. “He played last year, but I think it was too soon,\" he said.",
      "\"We didn’t have a team we could put a young kid of 16 into and him not struggle. He’s one of the guys but he started too soon. Sometimes it’s hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that ‘I’m already here’. We need to be careful with that.”",

      "Barcelona's decision to make Marcus Rashford's move permanent is reportedly not as straightforward as it appears, with the club divided on the matter. The Spanish heavyweights have an option in Rashford's loan agreement that allows them to secure the English forward on a permanent basis this summer for £26m.",
      "Aston Villa had a similar option - albeit at a steeper price of £40m - when the Manchester-born striker spent the latter half of last season on loan under Unai Emery. Despite Rashford's impressive performances at Villa Park, they ultimately decided against activating the clause, and Barcelona face a similar dilemma come the end of the season.",
      "The 28-year-old seems to have quickly found his feet in Spain's second city. In his first 18 appearances for the club across all competitions, Rashford has netted six goals and provided seven assists.",
      "Initially, it seemed likely that Barca would exercise the buy option. However, the La Liga champions have now identified a concern, one that echoes the issues that led Manchester United to consider moving Rashford on.",
      "Spanish publication Sport reports that there are concerns within the club about Rashford's hefty salary - despite what would seem a bargain transfer fee for such an experienced player. The England international took a 25% pay cut and now earns around £240,000-per-week, with Barca covering his entire wages during the loan period.",
      "It's said that the attacker offers little in terms of high pressing, something which is a must-have in any Hansi Flick team. The report states that Barcelona's main concern is securing backup for Raphinha. United will be hoping for a swift resolution regarding Rashford's future.",
      "Should he return to United, he would most likely be loaned out once more or sold permanently, as Ruben Amorim doesn't consider him part of his future strategy.",
      "Last September, Flick was full of praise for Rashford. He commented: \"You have to look back a little. I've followed Marcus since Manchester United - he has speed, one-on-one skills and finishing.",
      "\"What I've seen in the first few weeks has been very good, and he has some more potential to show. It's great to have him on the team. He's an incredible, fantastic player. What I'm seeing is very good.\"",
      "Flick had also previously revealed to journalists: \"I told Deco this summer: 'Please get me a player like Marcus Rashford!' I'm very happy to have him here. Rashford was an opportunity in the transfer market and we had to take it. I'm glad we did.",
      "\"I spoke to him and said: 'I need you in my team.' This is a good step for Rashford. It will give him a lot of confidence.\"",
      "Yet despite Flick's enthusiasm, Barcelona don't possess endless resources. Indeed, quite the reverse has been the case in recent years, with the club constantly struggling to stabilise their books.",
      "Rashford's spell at Barcelona has enabled him to regain his place in Thomas Tuchel's England setup, and the 28 year old seems to be on track for next summer's World Cup. However, even Tuchel has emphasised that further improvement is required.",
      "The England manager stated: \"The numbers don't reach the potential. He needs to push himself with goal involvements. He knows that from me. I think he still has to make these decisions. He is still young enough to make these decisions, because otherwise he might be disappointed in 10 years with what he could have been and what he may have done.\"",

After a seventh consecutive defeat, frustration from fans boiled over, which resulted in Jeremie Boga and Terem Moffi being assaulted.",
      "Neither will train this week with Boga placed on leave for five days following the attack, while Moffi will be out of action until Sunday. According to a report by Truibuna, the duo were punched, kicked and spat on.",
      "It has also been alleged that racist slurs were thrown their way with Boga needing to be rescued by Yehvann Diouf.",
      "Nice were informed a hostile reception was waiting for the team bus at their training ground. Nonetheless, they still opted to return with two fan representatives initially allowed onto the bus to air their grievances at the club's recent struggles, however, things went sour very quickly as Boga and Moffi took the brunt.",
      "It has been reported that the reason for Boga being targeted was because Marseille fans were invited to their stadium earlier this month by him, with it alleged they mocked home supporters.",
      "As for Moffi, it has been claimed he was laughing with former Lorient present Loic Remy after the defeat on the weekend.",
      "Boga released a statement on the controversy surrounding his decision. It read: \"At no time, believe me, was it my intention to show disrespect toward Nice supporters. However, I understand the disappointment this may have caused. To all those I may have hurt, I offer my apologies.\"",
      "Nice opted to not comment considering the ongoing police investigation, but did release a club statement after the incident.",

      "\"The club understands the frustration generated by the succession of poor performances and performances far removed from its values.",
      "\"However, the incidents that occurred during this gathering are unacceptable. Several club members were targeted. OGC Nice offers them its full support and condemns these acts in the strongest possible terms.\"",
      "Nice currently sit tenth in Ligue 1 and are rock bottom of the Europa League standings have lost all five games. Following their best finish in seven years last season, Ratcliffe's club are seriously struggling",

      "Rasmus Hojlund has made it clear that team success with Napoli is his top priority, even with his ongoing drought in front of goal. The Manchester United forward, currently on loan at the Serie A club, is set to make a permanent move to Italy next summer.",
      "Hojlund, who made 95 appearances for United after joining from Atalanta in August 2023, netted 26 goals during his stint at Old Trafford, but struggled to maintain a consistent scoring record. Ruben Amorim's side agreed a £38.8 million deal with Antonio Conte's team, which would see Hojlund make a permanent switch after his loan spell, provided the Italian club secure a Champions League spot.",
      "Last season saw Napoli crowned as Serie A champions, and they're keen to defend their title this season. They're currently second in the league table, trailing AC Milan only on goal difference.",
      "Despite a promising start in Naples, Hojlund has managed just four goals in 13 matches across all competitions, while also providing two assists. The 22-year-old bagged a brace against Sporting in the Champions League in October, but hasn't found the back of the net in the Italian top flight since scoring against Genoa in the same month.",
      "However, Hojlund has been instrumental in his last two games against Atalanta and AS Roma, setting up goals in both matches and helping his team secure a crucial six points in the title race. Speaking to DAZN after providing the assist for the winner against Roma, Hojlund commented: \"Obviously, I'd like to score a lot of goals again and start doing so soon, but it's important to always contribute to the team, and I'm happy to help.",
      "\"I try my best to be useful. I consider myself a - myself a team player: winning is more important than scoring goals.\"",
      "While nobody could doubt Hojlund's commitment during his spell at Old Trafford, his goal drought forced United into action in the summer transfer window. Amorim's squad bolstered their attacking options with the arrivals of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo, and the moves appear to be paying dividends with United now in contention for European qualification.",
      "Initially reluctant to depart United and eager to prove himself, Hojlund ultimately made the switch back to Italy, with Antonio Conte playing a crucial role in convincing him.",
      "\"Conte is a top coach,\" he explained. \"I came here because I knew this was an important step for me. Napoli is a great club and a wonderful place to live. It's exactly what I need right now in my career.\"",
      "Conte had previously heaped praise on the promising forward following his goal against Genoa in October, stating: \"He's a 22-year-old who was on the sidelines at Manchester United.",
      "\"He has significant room for improvement. He needs to work because he has the potential to become a star, and he's proving it.\"",

      "Rashford's latest outing for England saw him notch an assist in a 2-0 victory over Albania. Now, he'll be aiming to maintain his impressive form in Spain as he vies for a spot at the World Cup.",
      "Speaking about Rashford's performance in La Liga, Aguero told Stake: \"I think Rashford is doing very well. He's scored goals, provided assists and looks very well adapted to the team.",
      "\"He has been among those called up by Tuchel and has had minutes. Who will be starter only Tuchel knows. Just being in the squad is very important.\"",
      "Since joining Barcelona, Rashford has netted six goals and set up seven more in his first 18 matches across all competitions. The Catalan giants are currently leading La Liga, one point ahead of arch-rivals Real Madrid.",
      "Despite the thrill of moving to Spain's second city, Rashford had previously revealed what he was most looking forward to - playing at the Camp Nou.",
      "Upon finalising his loan move, Rashford expressed: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable.",

      "The legendary venue has been undergoing renovations since 2023. During this period, Barcelona hosted their 'home' games at the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium, which has a capacity of 55,000.",
      "The goal for the revamped Camp Nou is to boost its seating capacity to 105,000. However, for the first two matches back, attendance was limited to 45,000. The renovation project is estimated to have cost around £1.25 billion.",
      "Last month, Rashford returned to a Premier League pitch when Barcelona took on Chelsea in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge, a match that Enzo Maresca's team won comfortably 3-0. Back in September, the 28 year old had shone on English turf when he scored a spectacular double at St James' Park in a 2-1 victory over Newcastle.",
      "Barcelona are not scheduled to play any more English teams in the Champions League group stage, but a knockout round encounter remains a possibility, with Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool all in fine form.",
      "On the domestic front, Rashford will be focused on helping Barcelona clinch consecutive La Liga titles. If his stellar performances in Spain continue, a permanent move could well be on the cards.",

      "Players mocking managers has become something of a regular occurrence at Manchester United. Patrick Dorgu is the latest Red Devils star unable to resist a social media dig at his boss after 'liking' an Instagram post that questioned Ruben Amorim's tactics last month.",
      "Dorgu was dropped for Sunday's 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace, although Amorim insisted the decision was purely football-related, highlighting the Dane's nervousness in possession in recent games. He said: \"He needs to be calmer playing the game. You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touched the ball. I can feel it, the anxiety.\"",
      "Regardless of the reasons for Dorgu's dropping, players making gestures about their managers is unhelpful at best and divisive at worst. But it's not charted territory for a United boss.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho landed himself in hot water with Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, for similar behaviour. Garnacho had 'liked' a post on X which criticised Ten Hag for substituting him at half-time during United's 2-2 draw at Bournemouth during the 2023/24 season.",
      "Ten Hag played down the issue but confirmed the player had apologised. The Dutchman said: \"Alejandro is a young player, he has to learn a lot. He apologised for it and after that we move on.\"",
      "Garnacho clearly didn't learn from his mistake - or just didn't care - when he slammed Amorim's decision to leave him on the bench for last season's Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "Perhaps knowing his United career was coming to an end anyway, he fumed in a post-match interview: \"Up until the final, I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know.",
      "\"The final will influence [my decision] but the whole season, the situation of the club. I'm going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens afterwards.\"",
      "To compound the issue, Garnacho's brother and agent, Roberto, supported his comments with a pointed social media message. He posted on Instagram: \"Working as no-one else, helping every round, coming from two goals in the last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe hahahahahaha.\"",
      "It was therefore a surprise to no one when Garnacho left for Chelsea in a £40million in the summer. While the Argentine has struggled to establish himself as a first-team regular, he is part of a Blues squad that looks capable of challenging Arsenal for the title.",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim is still striving for consistency at United ,with the 1-0 loss to 10-man Everton and the excellent 2-1 win at Palace summing up their season so far. United host West Ham on Thursday.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay does not appear to have any regrets about his move away from Old Trafford. He issued a 13-word statement after winning the Serie A Player of the Year award at the Gran Gala del Calcio awards on Monday night.",
      "\"Coming to Napoli was an easy choice, I came to the right place,\" he said after winning the award, as reported by The Sun. McTominay was a key figure in Napoli's Serie A title success last season, with 13 goals and six assists in all competitions for Antonio Conte's side.",
      "His fine form at the Diego Armando Maradona Stadium saw him win the Serie A MVP award for the 2024–25 campaign. The Scotland international's first season away from Old Trafford was a huge success and he's carried that on into this season, helping Scotland qualify for the World Cup in 2026.",
      "Speaking at the award ceremony on Monday night, the former United midfielder would hail his special bond with Napoli after his move in 2024. He said: \"It’s sensational, it’s incredible to be here and win this award.",
      "“Thank you to everyone, the team, the staff, and my teammates. My bond with Napoli is special, there are so many special places here.\"",
      "The 28-year-old, who made 255 appearances for United and scored 29 goals, was also named in a star-studded Serie A top XI. Current Manchester City midfielder Tijani Reijnders was named in the squad along with Inter Milan stars Alessandro Bastoni and Federico Dimarco.",
      "United supporters have been questioning the decision to sell McTominay after his brilliant start to life in Italy, with the club bringing in just £25million from his sale. Former United boss Erik ten Hag cited the need to comply with PSR as the reason behind the midfielder's departure.",
      "\"He was so important for our team,\" Ten Hag said. \"He was at Manchester United for over 22 years. But unfortunately, it’s the rules. You have to discuss the rules to do sales, and obviously homegrown players, academy players, bring more value.",
      "\"It’s not the right thing to do but, for everyone, for all parties, it’s a good deal. For Scott, he is happy with it.",
      "\"Of course, for Napoli. (They are getting) a very good player. But also for us (it’s a good deal too).\"",
      "However, the reported £25million deal now looks a bargain for Napoli and McTominay would have been an ideal candidate to play in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. McTominay will be back in action with Napoli in the Coppa Italia clash with Cagliari on Wednesday night.",

      "Premier League clubs including Manchester United and Liverpool have been handed a boost with a new FIFA ruling allowing them to keep players for an extra week ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations. The tournament starts on December 21 with several Premier League players involved.",
      "FIFA have said that clubs do not have to release their players for the tournament until December 15. The deadline is a week later than had initially thought.",
      "It means that players including Mohamed Salah will be available for Premier League games over the weekend of December 13-14. Arne Slot, speaking on Tuesday morning, admitted: \"He'll go on December 15.\"",
      "The Kop boss added: \"The way we have worked is that there's a communication between all three - the player, the club and country. That's nothing new. But FIFA have said December 15 is last day player has to be released.\"",
      "If the deadline will allow Manchester United's Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to play in their clash against Bournemouth on December 15, is still to be seen.",
      "It's not only Liverpool and United who could benefit. The Premier League side most impacted by the tournament is newly-promoted Sunderland. The Black Cats have as many as seven players expected to feature. They could all now be available for the Wear-Tyne Derby against Newcastle United on December 14.",
      "Three teams who will not be impacted at all by the tournament are Arsenal, Chelsea and Leeds United. The trio have no players in their squad who will represent their countries in the competition.",
      "Speaking ahead of his team's Premier League game against Everton last week, United boss Ruben Amorim said that the club was working to keep the players at the club for as long as they could.",
      "“We have the rules, when we have to release the players, so we will see,\" he said. “We are doing our job to try and maintain the players a little bit longer, but it is not just in our hands. We need to respect that, but we will try to do everything to protect the club, protect the players and protect the national team.\"",
      "He also took a positive view on the absence of the players for the tournament.",
      "“It is a circumstance that we already knew, but it is an opportunity for other players,\" he said. \"We also have the Under-21s and we need to also send a message in that time, so we will see.",

      "Manchester United are back in victory lane after securing a hugely valuable 2-1 win at Crystal Palace on Sunday. However, even Selhurst Park decider Mason Mount wasn't expecting to convert the decider.",
      "United skipper Bruno Fernandes made the surprise decision to tee up Mount for the winning striker rather than have a crack himself. And it was a call that even caught Mount off-guard as he recounted his moment of triumph in south London.",
      "Fernandes' free-kick finesse is well-known among fans by this stage, but United's captain stepped aside for the crucial clincher at Palace on Sunday. Or rather, he stepped up to take control of the situation before watching on as Mount delivered when the team needed him most.",
      "Making his first start in more than a month, Mount was as surprised as anyone else to see the ball had been laid off for him to hit on the edge of Dean Henderson's box. One could tell by his reaction that his skipper had caught him unaware, not that the quality of his strike gave that impression.",
      "\"We always have a little conversation,\" said Mount while recapping his pre-set-piece chat with Fernandes. \"I said to him, 'I will roll it for you,' and then he said, 'You stay there,' and then I said, 'You shoot,' because obviously the sun was difficult today and was causing a few problems for us first half with long balls and I thought it would be difficult for Deano [Henderson] to see the ball in goal.",
      "\"And then he said: 'You stay there,' and rolled it over and you can see with my reaction to getting on the end of it... He obviously said it but really quick and that's why it helped out the situation. They didn't see it coming, they didn't see us talking, they were late to react, and it is about finding that little bit of space in the wall, that little disruption, and then hit the target.\"",
      "He did precisely that, and the splintered Palace wall couldn't protect Henderson's near post as the decider bobbled home. The result was enough to move United up to seventh and just four points behind bitter rivals City in second place.",
      "Speaking of the Manchester rivalry, United and City appear to be on a collision course next year concerning the signature of Elliot Anderson. That's after it was reported City are ready to step up their interest in the Nottingham Forest star.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side have been linked with a steady string of midfield recruits over the last year. And after the buzz surrounding the likes of Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba has died down, Anderson has taken over as United's supposed No. 1 recruit.",
      "However, the Daily Mail reported City are escalating their interest to ensure Anderson doesn't fall into the clutches of fellow admirers United or Liverpool. It's suggested Forest want in excess off £80million for the player, though a January move looks highly unlikely.",
      "Newcastle begrudgingly sold Anderson to Forest last year in order to comply with Premier League spending laws. A little more than one year on, and it looks as though the 23-year-old could fetch up to three times that fee.",
      "United could well part ways with Casemiro in the summer when his contract, which has a 12-month extension clause, is due to expire. There are also major question marks around the future of Kobbie Mainoo, whose sale could help United challenge City in the race for Anderson.",

      "The Argentina international has steadily been rebuilding his fitness over recent weeks and was included among the substitutes for last week's Premier League loss to Everton.",
      "More than 24 hours following the final whistle in south east London, Martinez has shared a post with his 6.8 million Instagram followers to reflect on his United comeback.",

      "\"They were months of suffering, uncertainty, anguish, imbalance... where the lack of energy was nothing to beat me, but I was lucky enough to count on my family, friends, teammates, fans, the club and the national team, to recharge the heart.",
      "\"Just thank you, everyone.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha has confirmed his return to Manchester United training after a two-game absence due to a head injury. Ruben Amorim had previously stated that he expected the Brazilian star to be fit for their upcoming match against West Ham United this Thursday, and with Cunha now back in training, it seems likely he'll be available.",
      "In a recent press conference, Amorim confirmed Cunha's potential return date, stating: \"I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham United], not this one [vs Crystal Palace].\"",
      "Without their summer signing, United suffered a disappointing defeat to ten-man Everton, but bounced back impressively with a 2-1 victory away to Crystal Palace last Sunday. Goals coming from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount at Selhurst Park could mean Cunha starts on the bench for his comeback game.",
      "Amorim will undoubtedly be pleased to have Cunha back in his squad though, and it's clear the player himself is also delighted. Via an Instagram story with Cunha in full training gear at Carrington, he stated: \"Back back back.\"",
      "In terms of a possible fresh injury blow, there was concern over Bruno Fernandes as he was seen limping towards the end of the win over Palace. However, Amorim seemed to confirm that the Portuguese midfielder would be fine to play in future matches.",
      "\"It was a kick, I was shouting at him because he needs to learn we make a substitution in the end, he needs to talk to the bench,\" he said. \"But he said it was just a kick, so everything is OK.\"",
      "The Portuguese manager will certainly require his captain's presence during the upcoming hectic period, as United face their most congested fixture list since their Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town.",
      "After hosting the Hammers, United make the trip to Molineux to face Wolves next Monday night before welcoming Bournemouth for another evening fixture a week later. Their final match before Christmas sees them take on Aston Villa, followed by a Boxing Day encounter at St James' Park against Newcastle United.",
      "Lisandro Martinez is expected to make his first start in more than nine months during this run of fixtures, having made a brief substitute appearance in last Sunday's match against Palace.",
      "Meanwhile, Benjamin Sesko remains sidelined with a knee complaint sustained during the Tottenham Hotspur fixture, while Harry Maguire continues his recovery from a muscle injury picked up in that same encounter.",
      "Amorim provided updates on both players during last week's press conference, indicating that while returns could be imminent, neither player is quite match-ready.",
      "\"Sesko is going to take a little bit more time. It will take a little bit longer, and we are taking care of him,\" he said. \"Harry is the same [he will need more time].\"",
      "However, despite these cautious remarks, the Slovenian international has not experienced any complications and remains on course to feature in the Wolves fixture later this month.",

      "And while he has been in better form recently, that has not been enough to see Onana earn a reprieve when it comes to Cameroon. Onana has been left out of his nation's squad for the upcoming AFCON tournament.",
      "The 29-year-old has collected 53 caps for his country so far and played every minute during the African side's World Cup qualifying campaign that ultimately ended in failure. AFCON gets underway on December 21, with Cameroon set to take on Gabon, Ivory Coast and Mozambique in the group stage.",
      "Onana's axe comes on a dramatic day for Cameroon, with manager Marc Brys having been sacked just days before the tournament gets underway.",
      "Onana has made 11 appearances for Trabzonspor so far this season in all competitions. His performances have however reportedly been good enough for club chiefs to make a move for him on a permanent basis.",
      "Speaking earlier this season, Amorim said on his goalkeeper's loan departure: “We saw Andre had a very, very good season at Inter. The quality is there. But we are in the club and sometimes, in the moment, things can get harder and harder.",
      "“You can be really experienced but in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail. I think we understood that this needed a change. Sometimes it’s hard to point why. It’s the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.”",
      "Onana started his career with Dutch side Ajax before moving to Italian giants Inter Milan. He went on to become one of Europe's standout goalkeepers during his time in Serie A.",
      "His form was good enough to convince the Red Devils to pay £43m for his services in 2023. He spent two seasons as United's number one, albeit high-profile mistakes blighted his game at Old Trafford.",
      "He was eventually allowed to leave the club this summer and was replaced by Senne Lammens, who joined United from Royal Antwerp. The Belgian has enjoyed a bright start to life at Old Trafford despite just one clean sheet in his opening seven games.",

      "A clumsy challenge by Leny Yoro on the Palace striker handed him an opportunity to break the deadlock from the penalty spot. Mateta coolly converted his effort, with Senne Lammens diving the wrong way, but replays revealed the ball had accidentally brushed his left foot.",
      "VAR directed Rob Jones to announce to the stadium that Mateta would be permitted to retake the penalty. He said: \"After review, Crystal Palace No.14 touches the ball accidentally twice as the ball goes into the net. The final decision is a retaken penalty.\"",
      "\"What they decided now is because it's accidental and he's scored it's a retake. If he missed, it would've been an indirect free-kick. I think it's only fair. He doesn't mean to slip.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Jay Bothroyd has explained why United should feel aggrieved by Mateta being granted a second opportunity after his blunder. \"I don't agree with that,\" he added.",
      "\"You step up to take a penalty and you plant your foot and touch the ball, it's bad technique. If you take a bad touch, it's just a bad touch. He's planted his foot ahead of the ball and has cut across it.",
      "\"That's his fault. He shouldn't get the opportunity to take it again for his mistake.\"",
      "Had this situation occurred last season, it would have been deemed a missed penalty by Mateta, but Julian Alvarez's contentious double-touch in Atletico Madrid's Champions League shoot-out defeat to Real Madrid prompted Ifab to enter talks with UEFA.",
      "The regulation has since been amended to specify if an accidental 'double-touch' spot-kick finds the net, then it should be retaken rather than disallowed. Fortunately, it didn't prove too crucial, with Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount both finding their mark to swing the match in United's direction.",
      "The triumph at Selhurst Park provided the ideal response to their home defeat against Everton on Monday night, despite enjoying a man advantage for more than an hour. With Palace having featured in France just days before, Amorim acknowledged that factor contributed to their success.",
      "He said: \"It was small details that helped. The pace and intensity was better in the second half. I could see that Palace were getting tired at the end of the first half and knew they would suffer if we scored.",
      "\"We went on to control the game well away from our goal and in the opposition's half. We controlled the game well, but just have to be careful about what we did in the first half.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United Under-21s rocked up to Leigh Sports Village on Tuesday night with high profile academy names Shea Lacey, Chido Obi, Sekou Kone and Diego Leon missing from the squad. The question now is what happens to those players in the January transfer window.",
      "Obi has not made a first-team squad this season, Lacey was on the bench for successive Premier League games against Everton and Crystal Palace, and Diego Leon and Sekou Kone are in between the U21s and senior side. The early expectation is Lacey and Obi will be kept in the building, but loan offers will be considered for Leon and Kone, who would benefit from playing senior football in the second half of the campaign.",
      "There are other candidates for a loan who started against Anderlecht on Tuesday night in the Premier League International Cup, such as Jacob Devaney, Gabriele Biancheri, Jayce Fitzgerald and James Scanlon. That would take the potential loan departures to six. The selection process at United ahead of the winter window involves evaluating players who may have stagnated in academy football and determining whether a change of scenery would be beneficial.",
      "Devaney, who captained the U21s from the base of the midfield on Tuesday, has delivered consistently strong performances this season, and excelled for Ireland's U21s against England during the November international break, emerging with credit against the likes of Jobe Bellingham, Ethan Nwaneri and Lewis Hall.",
      "That display suggested he could rise to the challenge of a loan spell further down the English football pyramid. Biancheri would also benefit from a spell away because he isn't getting much from U21 football. He had the thankless task of leading the attack against Anderlecht, and looked understandably frustrated as he drifted throughout the first half with no service up front.",
      "The Welshman has trained with the senior national teams of Wales and Canada (he's eligible to represent both), experience which would stand him in good stead if he leaves on loan.",
      "Scanlon was born in the Midlands but represents Gibraltar on the international stage, and he scored a brilliant goal against the Faroe Islands in a World Cup qualifier last summer. He is another who should be considered for a loan, along with Fitzgerald, who has slightly plateaued after being named in senior squads against Chelsea and PAOK last season.",
      "Scanlon and Biancheri offered little in the final third in the first half against Anderlecht, but United struggled as a collective, conceding multiple chances against an aggressive Belgian side. U21 manager Travis Binnion pleaded with his side to \"keep the ball\" after spells of Anderlecht pressure, encouraging the youngsters to give themselves a breather and a foothold in the contest.",
      "It was communicated ahead of the fixture that Binnion would not be permitted to speak to the handful of local reporters who made the trip to Leigh. That is not on Binnion, who has always been hugely generous with his time, but instead a strange decision from the club.",
      "United didn't keep the ball much in a disappointing first half, but they were ahead at the interval, taking the lead on the stroke of half-time thanks to a powerful header from Devaney.",
      "The Anderlecht coach, dressed in a Winter Olympics-esque tracksuit, could not believe his side had fallen behind given his side had squandered four great chances and their wastefulness was punished.",
      "They were deservedly level just minutes into the second half when forward Enzo Sternal pounced on a spilt shot and equalised. The Anderlecht staff celebrated as if it were a goal in the World Cup final.",
      "Terry van de Ven fired the visitors into a 2-1 lead shortly afterwards. More exaggerated celebrations followed and Binnion shook his head on the touchline. Then Anderlecht scored a third goal. And then a fourth.",
      "What Binnion will learn from the game is up for debate. There are conversations ongoing about which players will leave on loan, and brain power should be put into arranging spells away in the January window.",
      "It's easier said than done to find an appropriate loan for academy players, especially in the winter window, but there are at least six players who won't gain much from continuing to play youth games.",
      "It will be fascinating to see which academy players have left by the end of January.",

      "Manchester United Under-21s lost 4-1 against Anderlecht in the Premier League International Cup.",
      "The competition features 16 English academy teams and 16 of the top development squads from European nations.",
      "The teams are split into four groups, each comprising four English sides and four teams from Europe, which means United will face European opposition in every group match.",
      "The two best-placed teams in each group qualify for the quarter-finals.",
      "The U21s got off to a winning start in the competition when they played Athletic Bilbao in September, winning 2-1 thanks to goals from James Scanlon and Gabriele Biancheri.",
      "But they were unable to build on that result against Anderlecht.",
      "Recap what happened at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "That's the final whistle here.",
      "A game to forget for the youngsters.",
      "Thankfully, we're now into the final 10 minutes of this game.",
      "Anderlecht have another. They have been dominant tonight.",
      "That's game over at Leigh - the youngsters haven't been at the races this evening.",
      "Anderlecht have taken the lead and their coaching staff are celebrating wildly again.",
      "The away side wasted plenty of chances in the first half and deserved their equaliser.",
      "Anderlecht are deservedly level through Sternal.",
      "Armer has replaxed Kamason for the second half.",
      "That's the whistle for the break at Leigh Sports Village.",

      "Devaney (he's having a good season) with a decent header.",
      "It wasn't a shot on target, but that's the first proper chance of the game for United.",
      "Their coach must think it's the World Cup final with the way he's acting on the touchline.",
      "Binnion was not happy and just told him to calm down.",
      "United haven't created one chance and we're 33 minutes into this game. Anderlecht have been wasteful, though, and haven't taken their opportunities. Binnion is encouraging them to \"have a spell\" on the ball for a breather.",
      "Bethtume has just sent a shot wide of the post... Anderlecht have created enought to be ahead.",
      "J. Fletcher is playing at left-back tonight, and he's being challenged in that position.",
      "Was just given a yellow card, albeit it seemed like a strange decision.",
      "United are struggling here - that's another big chance wasted from Aliya Ndao.",
      "That was the shout from Binnion after a spell of pressure from Anderlecht.",
      "The away side have started as the better team, dominating the ball and asking questions in the final third. We're missing some high profile academy names and United have started poorly.",
      "Anderlecht sent a shot around the post just there - that was close to going in.",
      "Aggressive start from Kukonki from central defence.",

      "Just 10 minutes to kick-off at Leigh Sports Village.",
      "Tonight's game is due to kick-off at 7pm, so we're not far away now.",
      "We’re obviously missing some high profile academy names this evening, but it will be good to get another glance in person at Kukonki at centre-back. He’s progressing nicely in that role.",
      "Lacey was named in the first-team squad for the first time against Everton last week, and injuries opened the door for him to be named on the bench again at Selhurst Park. The youngster has long been tipped to reach the first-team and it’s been great to see him finally around the senior set-up on matchdays. It seemed likely he would play for the U21s tonight, but he's absent.",
      "XI | Murdock, Kamason, Mils, Kukonki, T. Fletcher, Fitzgerald, J. Fletcher, Devaney (c), Scanlon, Biancheri, Mantato.",
      "Subs | Byrne-Hughes, Armer, Helafu, Ibragimov, Thwaites, Lusale.",
      "It’s interesting that Obi hasn’t been included in a single senior squad this season. He made eight first-team appearances last season and featured during the pre-season tour of the United States in the summer, but he has exclusively played in academy fixtures this term. There was a feeling internally at United that Obi was exposed too soon to the first-team. His promotion last season was necessary due to injuries, but it was decided to allow him to develop away from the spotlight, for at least the first half of this season. He is not in the squad tonight due to a knock.",
      "Hello and welcome to today's Manchester United Under-21 live match blog.",
      "The U21s will take on Anderlecht in the Premier League International Cup at Leigh and we'll bring you build-up to the game, team news and live updates throughout.",
      "Travis Binnion's side have made a strong start to the season and got off to a winning start in this competition in September when they beat Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford.",
      "Binnion will hope his side can continue their momentum tonight."

      "When Kobbie Mainoo was playing for England in a major tournament final at the age of 19, Carlos Baleba had just finished a quiet first season at Brighton, starting only 15 Premier League games. In the North East, Elliot Anderson started just 10 games for Newcastle that season, having only just broken into the England Under-21 squad.",
      "Adam Wharton was at least with Mainoo in Germany during Euro 2024. However, while Mainoo came into the team and started every knockout game, Wharton was left kicking his heels, unable to get on the pitch during the tournament.",
      "Fast forward 18 months, and Baleba, Anderson and Wharton are all being touted as £100million players who might hold the key to transforming Manchester United's midfield. In an ideal but probably unrealistic world, two of them might end up at Old Trafford next summer.",
      "This wasn't how it was supposed to pan out for Mainoo. Anderson is now a key cog in England's midfield and Wharton started in place of the Nottingham Forest man in the Three Lions' last World Cup qualifier. Mainoo, on the other hand, hasn't played for his country since September 2024.",
      "The problem for Mainoo is that the gap is growing. In the summer of 2024, everyone expected the Stockport-born youngster would be the solution to United's midfield woes, but under Ruben Amorim, that doesn't look likely right now.",
      "This season, Anderson has played 1,170 minutes of Premier League football, Wharton has 869 minutes in the league and Baleba has 701 minutes. Mainoo? Just 171 minutes. Development is often a numbers game, and Mainoo is being left behind.",
      "He hasn't started a single Premier League game so far this season and you have to wonder when that is going to change. He isn't going to get any better as a player for 15 or 20 minutes here and there, and nothing that is happening in training seems to be convincing Amorim at the moment.",
      "Mainoo's future is rightly a hot topic amongst United fans. A number of academy graduates have been moved on recently and the 20-year-old has often been the only link keeping the club's proud 88-year record of having an academy product in every matchday squad going.",
      "There is also a feeling that he is being underused by Amorim and deserves more than a chance. But if that isn't forthcoming, then a loan move in January might well be the best option for both parties. Mainoo's development has stalled because he isn't playing football.",
      "It will probably sting the player himself to see contemporaries being linked with a move to United to fill a position he had seemed to nail down in the 2023/24 season. If he wants to prove to Amorim that he can still be a player of the quality of Baleba, Anderson or Wharton, then he needs the game time to do so.",
      "If that isn't forthcoming at United, then letting him go elsewhere to get games in the second half of this season might well be the solution. It doesn't have to be the prelude to a permanent departure, but it could allow Mainoo to rebuild his form and confidence, and give him a platform to show that he can be part of Amorim's midfield rebuild as well.",

      "It was no surprise to see Luke Shaw offer a hug and a few words of encouragement to Lisandro Martinez when the Argentine replaced him at Crystal Palace on Sunday. If anyone in this Manchester United squad knows what it is like to go through an injury nightmare, it is Shaw.",
      "Martinez was making his return to action after almost 10 months on the sidelines following an anterior cruciate ligament injury and replaced Shaw as United looked to see out a morale-boosting win at Selhurst Park. It was the fourth time in a couple of years that Martinez has suffered an injury that has kept him out for a prolonged period of time.",
      "The Argentine will hope those days are now behind him and in Shaw, he has an example of how fortunes can change. The England international has seen his Old Trafford career regularly put on hold as a result of fitness problems, but at the age of 30 he is back to his best.",
      "Shaw is as fit as he's been in his United career and has started all 13 Premier League games this season. After missing almost all of last season through injury issues, it was a renaissance nobody really saw coming.",
      "That run in the team will almost certainly continue against West Ham on Thursday night, with Martinez unlikely to be considered fit enough to start just yet after so long out injured, but it's only a matter of time until the 27-year-old is back in the side. Despite his own injury issues, to many, he will be one of the first names on the teamsheet.",
      "A back three of Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt and Martinez looks strong, with Shaw and Harry Maguire in reserve. The likelihood is that Martinez and Shaw will be competing for the same spot on the left of the back three, as the only left-footed central defenders.",
      "With not many games to go round, one of them could end up being frustrated, although as we've seen, Ruben Amorim is happy to swap his centre-backs during games.",
      "Another option is to use Shaw at wing-back. He was excellent there for England during the European Championship in 2021, although those fitness problems have seen his morph into a centre-back more recently.",
      "In Amorim's system, a lot is demanded of the wing-backs and Shaw will be asked to cover more ground playing there than he would as a centre-back. It would be a more substantial test of whether he has truly overcome his injury problems.",
      "Speaking in November, Amorim left the door open for Shaw to play there. It's something of a problem position for United, with neither Diogo Dalot nor Patrick Dorgu really convincing there. Amorim will also lose Noussair Mazraoui and Amad as wing-back options from mid-December when they travel to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "“Yes, he can play there. It is the load that the player does in that position is different. Of course, he can play there; he’s a smart player and fit at the moment,\" said Amorim.",
      "With Martinez fit and the left-footed centre-back, Shaw could be tried at wing-back. That would allow Dalot to play on the right and would leave Dorgu and Tyrell Malacia in reserve.",
      "It's an approach Amorim could consider over the next month or so. The way Shaw has been playing, he will want to keep him in his team, even if Martinez returns to his best.",

      "This week presents a relatively unique experience for Manchester United, who for the first time since the end of August have a midweek game and a short turnaround between fixtures. The embarrassing Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby further cleared an already quiet schedule for a team not in Europe this year, and United have benefited from the lack of midweek games to drill down into Ruben Amorim's plans on the training pitches at Carrington.",
      "They have played only 14 games this season, compared to the 20 contested by Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle. A gap of just four days between Sunday's win at Crystal Palace and Thursday's Old Trafford date with West Ham is unusual for a team that has become accustomed to the pattern of long lead-ins to games. They have had at least six days to prepare for every match since the start of September.",
      "However, the fixture list is arguably still kind to United, who will play six games in December. At a time when their rivals are maxed out with midweek games, they still have plenty of recovery time. The quartet of City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle have a Carabao Cup quarter-final alongside their European commitments and can expect to be playing twice a week well into the New Year.",
      "United's week could have been worse. After playing Palace on Sunday, they could have played on Wednesday night rather than Thursday. They could easily have played Wolves away on Sunday rather than on Monday night. In both instances, the live TV selections have given them an extra day of rest.",
      "After the Monday night trip to Molinuex, United have another week off before the home game against Bournemouth. They then have six days until the pre-Christmas game against Aston Villa at Villa Park.",
      "There are then five days until the Boxing Day game against Newcastle and four days until the game against Wolves. Both of those fixtures are at Old Trafford. The first game of 2026 comes five days later and is a dash over the Pennines to face Leeds.",
      "Plenty of Premier League teams will have more draining and more demanding Decembers. Of United's six games, only two are away, and those trips are 75 miles to Wolves and 85 miles to Villa.",
      "That's not to say United will be without their problems this month. They will likely lose Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo from the middle of December to the Africa Cup of Nations and will be one of the clubs most affected by AFCON call-ups.",
      "However, Amorim's side should still view the next few weeks as an opportunity. While their rivals are playing in Europe and the Carabao Cup, they will have their feet up.",
      "They also enter the run with momentum back onside. The shocking defeat to Everton is their only defeat in the last seven and with games against two of the bottom four up next, they really should be extending that streak.",

      "Manchester United youngster Chido Obi was absent from the Under-21 squad against Anderlecht in the Premier League International Cup because he is recovering from a minor injury. Obi last played for the U21s against Notts County in the EFL Trophy on November 4. He is expected to be out for close to a month.",
      "The U21s have played Solihull Moors and Anderlecht since the resumption of domestic football following the November international break, but Obi has continued to be sidelined. Obi has contributed five goals and two assists in 12 appearances this season. The 18-year-old has played exclusively in academy fixtures and has not been included in a senior squad.",
      "Ruben Amorim handed Obi first-team opportunities last season. The young striker made eight senior appearances and impressed during the post-season trip to Malaysia and Hong Kong. Obi started the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds and was involved during the United States tour, but the decision has been made to keep him in the academy.",
      "\"Yeah, of course, he played last year,\" Amorim said recently about whether Obi could step up to the first-team again. \"I think it was too soon, we didn't have a team. That we can put a young kid with 16, that he will not struggle, or will struggle a little bit, was completely necessary to do that.",
      "\"The perfect conditions. We have the opportunity and we seek that opportunity for the kids, so he's one of the guys, but I think he started too soon. And sometimes it's hard to deal with that, with the kids, because they think that I'm already here. No, you are here for necessity and we need to be careful also with that.\"",
      "\"And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games. If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do.",
      "\"The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",

      "There have been bumps along the way - the defeats to Grimsby Town, Manchester City and Everton were particularly shocking - but United are in a strong position as they head into the winter.",
      "Crystal Palace felt like a must-win game given the context of the last few weeks. United started November with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, and then lost to Everton in a lifeless display, so they could not afford to end the month with a defeat at Selhurst Park.",
      "United welcome struggling West Ham to Old Trafford on Thursday night, and the fixture is a superb opportunity to record back-to-back league wins for just the second time this season.",
      "The in-house target for this campaign was to secure a spot in European football. Club sources deliberately did not specify the Champions League, but United must be aiming to return to that competition.",
      "That means winning back-to-back games regularly throughout the campaign. West Ham have won just once on the road this term, and United can't squander such a presentable opportunity.",
      "Matheus Cunha is expected to return to the squad to face West Ham. Cunha suffered a 'minor injury' in training last month, but it was serious enough to keep him out against Everton and Crystal Palace.",
      "Cunha's absence was a blow and the presumption is that he will return to the starting team upon his return, although that would mean one of the goalscorers from last weekend would lose their place.",
      "Amorim stuck by Joshua Zirkzee when most would have dropped him to face Palace. Zirkzee didn't offer much against Everton, but he was given another chance to show what he can do.",
      "That looked like a bad decision in the first half. Zirkzee followed every good touch with a loose touch and wasn't a goal threat, but he popped up quickly following the interval to score a superb goal.",
      "Zirkzee is not a natural goalscorer, yet he found the net like a prolific forward, brilliantly taking the ball down and lashing a volley beyond Dean Henderson, who was guarding the front post.",
      "The finish was so good that it was almost as if a Zirkzee doppelgänger had come out to play the second half. The Dutchman has not been associated with such goals during his up and down time in Manchester.",
      "\"It was really important,\" said Amorim of Zirkzee's goal. \"But again, it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half he struggled on the duels and he won some duels in the second half.",
      "\"We improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. That is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We play better because Josh played better in the second half.\"",
      "Mason Mount made his first start for United since playing against Liverpool at Anfield, and the midfielder delivered another strong performance, working tirelessly and scoring to make it 2-1.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Mount and Zirkzee were the attacking trio and Amorim will have to decide who to drop between the Palace goalscorers if he wants to bring Cunha back into the side.",
      "It's not out of the question that Cunha starts on the bench. He was named on the bench against Chelsea in September after returning from an injury, and Amorim could ease him back into action again.",
      "However, Cunha returned from a muscle injury on that occasion, whereas the reason for his recent absence has been said to be due to a training ground accident, which shouldn't be as serious as a muscle issue.",
      "It will be a tough decision between Mount and Zirkzee if Cunha is immediately recalled. The Dutchman is the favourite to lose his place, but his second-half performance against Palace was impressive, and there is a train of thought that a forward shouldn't lose their place after scoring.",
      "Nonetheless, it's a welcome attacking headache for Amorim ahead of the West Ham game.",

      "It may have been freezing conditions near the away dressing room at Selhurst Park at full time, but the jovial mood among the Manchester United squad was keeping spirits warm. Captain Bruno Fernandes joked with Joshua Zirkzee to pull his trousers up while a beaming Luke Shaw spoke at length with veteran commentator Martin Tyler before heading to the team bus.",
      "Ruben Amorim was keen to continue the positive atmosphere as he took one look at the assembled cast of journalists waiting in the mixed zone and teased doing a preliminary press conference before the main event. In the end, he made his apologies and ran up the stairs to the Media Centre.",
      "Match winner Mason Mount's positivity was obvious as he strolled up to the journalists, joking that we were blocking him from exiting. When the laughter subsided, Mount took us into the conversation between himself and Fernandes shortly before the winner.",
      "He explained: \"We always have a little conversation. I said to him: 'I will roll it for you,' and then he said: 'You stay there,' and then I said: 'You shoot,' because obviously the sun was difficult today and was causing a few problems for us first half with long balls and I thought it would be difficult for Deano [Henderson] to see the ball in goal.",
      "\"And then he said: 'You stay there,' and rolled it over and you can see with my reaction to getting on the end of it...He obviously said it but really quick and that's why it helped out the situation. They didn't see it coming, they didn't see us talking, they were late to react and it is about finding that little bit of space in the wall, that little disruption and then hit the target.\"",
      "Sunday was the first time Mount has completed 90 minutes in the league since he was at Chelsea, coincidentally against the same opposition as this weekend. \"It felt like a long time,\" Mount laughed when asked about playing the full game.",
      "\"It is obviously a massive positive for me as well. I have been working hard recently, I feel really good now so to get that 90 minutes under my belt is really positive, it is all about recovery now and going towards the next game.\"",
      "At half-time it felt as though such a light-hearted conversation with Mount was not going to take place. United were poor in the opening 45 minutes and were deservedly behind at the break thanks to Jean-Philippe Mateta's re-taken penalty.",
      "While United fans may have been panicking, this was not the case for Amorim in the dressing room. Mount said: \"He was saying to keep going, stay calm do what we needed to do. We all knew what to do in that second half.",
      "\"They have just played recently so we felt they could drop off in that second half, there was chances there for us so just carry on what we are doing. Obviously difficult to go down 1-0 but we showed character to get back into the game in the second half.\"",
      "While not the perfect performance, the result is all that matters at this stage for the Reds. They are now back within touching distance of the top four and Mount was clear his desire is now to push on.",
      "He said: \"I have had niggles but nothing bad at all [this season]. I have felt good this season, I had a good pre-season under my belt, I have been working hard in training every week, not just me, but as a group we have been at it, it's up and down but we are in a lot better place me personally and a group.",
      "\"We need to kick on now, win more games and the most important thing is to win, difficult result in the last game but to come back today was massively important. So yeah it is time to kick on now and shoot for those top four positions.\"",

      "Barcelona’s decision over whether to sign Marcus Rashford permanently is reportedly not as simple as it may seem, with opinions inside the club split. The Spanish giants have an option in Rashford’s loan deal allowing them to sign the Englishman permanently in the coming summer for £26m.",
      "Aston Villa had the same option - albeit at a higher price of £40m - when the Manchester-born forward spent the second half of last season on loan under Unai Emery. Despite Rashford impressing at Villa Park, they ultimately chose not to activate it – and Barcelona could end up making a similar decision.",
      "The 28-year-old looks to have settled quickly in Spain’s second city. Across his first 18 games for the club in all competitions, Rashford has scored six goals and registered seven assists.",
      "Signs had pointed towards Barca triggering the buy option. However, the La Liga champions have now identified a concern, one of the very same issues that pushed Manchester United towards moving Rashford out of their squad.",
      "According to Spanish outlet Sport, there are worries inside the club about Rashford’s high salary. The England international took a 25% pay cut and now earns around £240k per week. During the loan, Barca are covering the entirety of his wages.",
      "The Spanish club are also unsure about Rashford’s tactical adaptation. The United loanee is said to offer little in terms of high pressing, something which is a non-negotiable in any Hansi Flick team.",
      "The report adds that Barcelona’s priority is finding cover for Raphinha. United will hope a decision on Rashford’s future will be made soon.",
      "If he returns to United, he would likely be sent out on loan again or sold, with Ruben Amorim not viewing him as part of his long-term plans.",
      "Back in September, Flick spoke glowingly of Rashford. He said: “You have to look back a little. I’ve followed Marcus since Manchester United — he has speed, one-on-one skills and finishing.",
      "“What I’ve seen in the first few weeks has been very good, and he has some more potential to show. It’s great to have him on the team. He’s an incredible, fantastic player. What I’m seeing is very good.”",
      "Flick also previously told reporters: “I told Deco this summer: ‘Please get me a player like Marcus Rashford!’ I’m very happy to have him here. Rashford was an opportunity in the transfer market and we had to take it. I’m glad we did.",
      "“I spoke to him and said: ‘I need you in my team.’ This is a good step for Rashford. It will give him a lot of confidence.”",
      "But despite Flick’s admiration, Barcelona do not have unlimited funds. In fact, the opposite has been true in recent seasons, with the club repeatedly fighting to balance their finances.",
      "Rashford’s Barcelona stint has helped him return to Thomas Tuchel’s England squad, and the 28-year-old appears on the right path for next year’s World Cup. But even Tuchel has insisted more is needed.",
      "The England boss said: “The numbers don’t reach the potential. He needs to push himself with goal involvements. He knows that from me. I think he still has to make these decisions. He is still young enough to make these decisions, because otherwise he might be disappointed in 10 years with what he could have been and what he may have done.”",

      "Matheus Cunha has confirmed he is back in Manchester United training after missing their last two games with a head injury. Ruben Amorim stated last week that he expects to have the Brazil international back to face West Ham United this Thursday and with Cunha back on the grass, he looks set to be available.",
      "Amorim had confirmed as such in a recent press conference when asked about a potential return date for Cunha. He said: \"I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham United], not this one [vs Crystal Palace].\"",
      "Without the summer signing, United suffered a very bad defeat to ten-man Everton but the response was emphatic this past weekend as they beat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park. Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount were both on target which could see Cunha on the bench for his return match.",
      "Nonetheless, Amorim will almost certainly be pleased to have Cunha back in his squad and its fair to say the man himself is also very pleased. Via Instagram stories, with Cunha in full training gear at Carrington, he said: \"Back back back.\"",
      "That fitness boost looked set to arrive alongside a major blow as Bruno Fernandes was captured on camera limping in the latter stages of the win over Palace. However, Amorim seemingly confirmed he would be fine to feature going forward.",
      "“It was a kick, I was shouting at him because he needs to learn we make a substitution in the end, he needs to talk to the bench,\" he said. \"But he said it was just a kick, so everything is OK.”",
      "And Amorim will certainly need his captain over the coming weeks as United face a busier schedule than usual with their first midweek clash since the Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "Following the visit of West Ham, United travel to Wolves next Monday evening before hosting Bournemouth under the lights again seven days later. Their last clash before Christmas comes against Aston Villa with a Boxing Day clash at Newcastle United following that.",
      "A first start in over nine months for Lisandro Martinez will likely arrive during that period after his brief returning cameo against the Seagulls last Sunday.",
      "As for Benjamin Sesko, he is still missing because of a knee injury picked up against Tottenham Hotspur while Harry Maguire is yet to return from a muscular problem suffered in that same game.",
      "Amorim delivered updates on both in his press conference last week which suggested that returns are on the way, but neither are quite ready just yet.",
      "\"Sesko is going to take a little bit more time. It will take a little bit longer, and we are taking care of him,\" he said. \"Harry is the same [he will need more time].\"",

      "Manchester United defender Diogo Dalot has \"so much more to accomplish\" in his career after making his 150th appearance in the Premier League against Crystal Palace on Sunday. Ruben Amorim questioned his options at left wing-back ahead of the trip to Selhurst Park, admitting Dalot and Patrick Dorgu weren't performing on matchdays as well as they were during training.",
      "Dalot was recalled to the starting team to face Palace and delivered an improved performance. The Portugal international was the United player with the most duels won and was responsible for winning the foul that led to the second goal, a display which earned praise from Amorim.",
      "When asked whether Dalot's display was the benchmark for a player in that role, Amorim said: \"It's of course defending and attacking. If you have certain characteristics, the pace, you can go right or left because you also can play with your left.",
      "\"You need to use that in every single game in the Premier League and not just one game and then we drop a little bit the level. But it's the same thing that I said with Patrick. I know they have a lot of quality. They just need to be relaxed sometimes and show that and show the intensity and the pace that they have.\"",
      "The game saw Dalot make his 150th appearance in the Premier League, which he said is a source of \"pride for playing at the highest level for so many years”.",
      "Dalot added: “I’m very happy to reach this beautiful milestone in the biggest league in the world. My journey has been one of constant growth as both a man and a player, and I’m proud of what I’ve achieved knowing that I’m only 26 and still have so much more to accomplish in my career. I’m enjoying every moment.”",
      "Dalot started in wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, but he struggled against Nottingham Forest, and Dorgu was recalled to face Spurs before the international break.",
      "The 26-year-old is more comfortable on the right, but has played predominantly at left wing-back this season.",
      "When asked after Liverpool if the victory was one of the biggest wins of his time at the club, Dalot said: \"Probably, yeah, I could say so because of the moment, the pressure that everyone created on us to have back-to-back wins, coming here against a team that was going through a difficult phase.",
      "\"So a game like today can go both ways. The team that wins today will come on top, so very important for us, but again, I don't want to get too carried away because next week we have to keep going.",
      "\"At a club like this, you're always expecting two, three or four wins in a row. It was important for us to know we're capable of doing it. We know already, but we needed to prove it on the pitch and to do it against a team like Liverpool, there is no better way for a Man United fan, a Man United player, to do that.",
      "\"So really happy. Today is a very good day for the club. We've been through a lot, some difficulties, but today is to enjoy.\"",

      "After VAR demanded a retake due to a double touch, the forward successfully converted the penalty.",
      "However, after half time, United capitalised on their fresher legs. They levelled the score unexpectedly when Bruno Fernandes' free kick found Joshua Zirkzee, who calmly slotted the ball into the net.",
      "The game took a dramatic turn moments later. Fernandes set up a free kick for Mason Mount to strike home through a sea of players, and the Reds managed to maintain their lead, securing a crucial three points away from home.",
      "One supporter, MURED, outlined a lengthy catalogue of concerns, saying: \"Same problem every game. Bruno and Case can't cover the ground to help defence. One of centre-backs needs to cover, where middle can't cover. Wing-back forward so far up and can't come back in time. CP plays the same system and plays a lot better.",
      "\"Get rid of Zirkzee. I don't know what he is good at. With his height and weight, at least he can contain the ball, but he can't do it and easily loses the ball. Also, at least, we need to buy 2 middle players.\"",
      "While Turf7 believes: \"Mateta, is the striker Utd should have gone for at the start of the season. Someone with experience of the Premier League and plays the game for fun.\"",
      "Futch, looking at the positive: \"Guys, we won. Too many whiners on here. What should we do? Sack Amorim and start again. In my humble opinion, I believe he will work for us. I believe (maybe naively) we will get a Champions League place this year and be back competing next year. Don’t understand why so many of you want Amorim out.\"",
      "Glazerclowns agrees: \"Well done lads. Hardly convincing, but we would have lost this game last season.\"",

      "Leny Yoro has taken to social media after his mistake in Manchester United's 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Sunday. The Frenchman made a clumsy foul on compatriot Jean-Philippe Mateta who scored from 12 yards out to put Palace ahead.",
      "After replays showed the ball had accidentally struck his left foot, Mateta was given the chance to retake the penalty and made no mistake with his second attempt. The rules changed following controversy in Atletico Madrid's Champions League last-16 second-leg tie against Real Madrid in March.",
      "At the time, Julian Alvarez slipped as he converted during a penalty shootout, and his standing leg made slight contact with the ball. He was not allowed to retake the spot-kick and Real went on to win the shootout to progress to the quarter-finals.",
      "Following the International Football Association Board's (IFAB) intervention, a 'double-touch penalty' must be retaken rather than disallowed, if the ball goes in from the original kick.",
      "As a result, Mateta put his team ahead in the 36th minute, before Ruben Amorim’s side responded with goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount. Yoro was taken off six minutes before the hour mark and was comforted at full-time by Mason Mount.",
      "Taking to Instagram after the game, Yoro reflected on the difficult game he had at Selhurst Park. \"Challenging days - Mindset locked in - Work on.\"",
      "\"Proverbs 24:16: For though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again.\"",
      "Luke Shaw replied with two love heart emojis while Bruno Fernandes responded with a gif of Yoro celebrating.",
      "Meanwhile, Amad, Bryan Mbeumo, Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs de Ligt, Diogo Dalot, Patrick Dorgu, Lisandro Martinez, Kobbie Mainoo, Senne Lammens and Mason Mount all liked the post - showing their support.",
      "\"This is a first in the Premier League because the law was amended because of [Julian] Alvarez in the Champions League,\" he explained. \"What they decided now is because it's accidental and he's scored it's a retake. If he missed, it would've been an indirect free-kick.",
      "\"I think it's only fair. He doesn't mean to slip.\"",
      "Jay Bothroyd has outlined why Manchester United may feel aggrieved at Mateta being handed a second chance following his error. \"I don't agree with that,\" he added.",
      "\"You step up to take a penalty and you plant your foot and touch the ball, it's bad technique. If you take a bad touch, it's just a bad touch. He's planted his foot ahead of the ball and has cut across it. That's his fault. He shouldn't get the opportunity to take it again for his mistake.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A five-game unbeaten run helped lift the early-season pressure on the Portuguese head coach, and United are now just three points outside the top four with a home clash with struggling West Ham to come. Amorim reflected on his first year in the job ahead of the win over Crystal Palace on Sunday.",
      "\"I think it's not hard to understand what the fans want, first of all, but of course it was a surprise. It's tough, the league is really tough, and everything about our club is so big, it's so different from the other clubs, even the other big ones, so you need to understand that, you need to be really strong mentally.",
      "\"I understand also that we still have a lot to change, because sometimes the small things can become big things, the way we work, behave, all these things, so it was a little bit of a surprise, and it was tougher than I was expecting.\"",
      "Victory at Selhurst Park saw United bounce back from their most disappointing performance of the season against Everton a week ago. Jean-Philippe Mateta put Palace ahead on Sunday from the penalty spot, but second-half goals from Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount ensured United got back to winning ways.",

      "Terry Gibson says Conor Gallagher's return to the Premier League hinges on whether he's content with his role at Atletico Madrid, and whether he wants to compete in the English top-flight again.",
      "The England midfielder, 25, has excelled under Diego Simeone since making the switch from Chelsea last summer, totting up six goals and six assists in 69 appearances thus far. And as a result of finding his footing with the La Liga giants, Manchester United have recently been linked with making a move for the midfielder.",
      "The Reds have struggled in their engine room for a couple of seasons, with Casemiro's ageing legs leaving him unable to cover the ground he once did during his Real Madrid heyday - while Bruno Fernandes' suitability to a deeper role has been cast into speculation by pundits, evidently more compatible in the No.10.",
      "And with Manuel Ugarte failing to gel under Ruben Amorim, as well as Kobbie Mainoo seeing his future at Old Trafford cast into speculation, United have been linked with a wealth of talent in the January window, including Gallagher. Reports suggest that the Premier League titans are eyeing up a loan deal for the 25-year-old.",
      "\"Because it appears every game, Atletico have a fantastic squad, arguably the biggest, strongest squad in La Liga, and he's suffered because of that. And when he plays, he never lets them down.",
      "\"Koke has been playing ahead of him. Koke has his attributes; he's played 700 games, at the weekend, for Atletico Madrid. And Simeone just can't let go of him. So it's a security blanket for Simeone.",
      "\"Koke has been a wonderful player, but Conor Gallagher does offer a little bit more, now. He gets around the pitch a lot quicker than Koke does and he has a goal-scoring threat. He's been happy to play in a wider midfield position.",
      "\"Would he play in this game? (vs Barcelona on Tuesday). He started in the game against Inter Milan. Probably not then. That means that there will be rotations and changes. But I think that he's really pushing hard for a place on a more regular basis.",
      "\"He's been fabulous. A bit overlooked because we've got Marcus Rashford and we've got Jude Bellingham. He's been overlooked when it comes to the English contingent that are playing in La Liga. But he's been really good.",
      "\"I guess it all depends on Conor Gallagher. Whether he's content with that role in Atleti's team, which a lot of big players have to be at Atletico Madrid. And would he want to make a return back to the Premier League? But he's been good.",
      "\"It's actually good to talk about him because, as I say, he does get overlooked when it comes to the other two big hitters. Tyrhys Dolan gets overlooked. He's probably been arguably the best English player in La Liga this season.\"",
      "It comes as Gallagher will hope to make his mark when Atletico Madrid travel to Camp Nou to take on Hansi Flick's Barcelona on Tuesday, December 2. There, he will meet with fellow Englishman - and United loanee - Rashford, who has impressed during his time on Spanish soil this season.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "FC Barcelona are uncertain about signing loanee Marcus Rashford permanently and could send him back to Manchester United at the end of the season, according to reports in Spain.",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona on loan from the Red Devils in July and has made 18 appearances for his new club.",
      "The 27-year-old has registered six goals and nine assists this season, helping him return to the England squad as he stakes a claim for a spot in Thomas Tuchel’s 2026 World Cup squad.",
      "After falling out of favour under Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, Rashford shone on loan at Aston Villa during the second half of last season, but upon returning to Old Trafford, he was informed by the Portuguese head coach that he still wasn’t in his plans.",
      "Barcelona were happy to take Rashford on loan for the season and negotiated a buy option believed to be worth around €30million (£26.3m).",
      "That would be viewed as a bargain if not for the England winger’s mammoth £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Rashford’s wage is one of the reasons Barcelona are reluctant to sign him permanently, and Catalan journalist Alfredo Martinez says no decision has been made by the La Liga champions.",
      "“There are voices for and against (his staying),” Martinez explained (quotes via Sport Witness).",
      "“Some don’t want him to stay because Rashford isn’t the type of player who presses high up the pitch, and besides, he has a very high salary. Barcelona is looking, among others, for a left winger, a player to provide cover for Raphinha.”",
      "The Rashford news cycle is…interesting. When he’s fit and flying, there isn’t much noise, but a few poor games in a row and the knives come out.",
      "Spanish media were quick to realise the weight his name carries, reporting back in September that Barcelona wanted to ‘send Rashford home’ after being unconvinced by his performances.",
      "Rashford didn’t help himself with a disciplinary issue before a La Liga game against Getafe later that month, but it wasn’t blown out of proportion and he was swiftly reinstated by Barca boss Hansi Flick.",
      "There were plenty of reports about Rashford’s future in both England and Spain at the time, coinciding with some damning criticism from Manchester United legend Paul Scholes.",
      "While there have been some questionable reports about Rashford’s conduct and relationship with Flick, the Englishman has kept his head down and is enjoying his football in Catalonia.",
      "Since the start of October, he has registered four goals and five assists. But Martinez won’t let good stats get in the way of a good story.",
      "Rashford wonder goal 📽️#UCL pic.twitter.com/pZlOg6E2bb",
      "— UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) September 19, 2025",
      "That being said, it’s not impossible that Barcelona genuinely aren’t convinced. But what’s even more likely is that Barca are playing a game to get Rashford for less than the €30m buy option.",
      "Despite Rashford’s good form in Spain, it’s obvious that his Manchester United chapter is over as long as Amorim is in charge, and United’s hierarchy have been very patient with him so far, hinting that there will only be one winner in that battle.",
      "It’s reported in Spain that Barca are scouring the market for alternatives, yet a recent report from the Daily Mirror claimed club president Joan Laporta was delighted with the terms of the buy option, believing it’s a ‘genuine bargain’.",
      "In truth, nobody knows. Not even Laporta knows if it’s a done deal yet. However, what is certain is that Rashford’s name will always be used and exploited for clicks.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona loanee Marcus Rashford has been ‘offered’ a swap deal involving Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Rashford may not get his permanent move to Barcelona in the summer but PSG have ‘tested’ the Man Utd waters with an intriguing swap offer amid interest from Arsenal.",
      "Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford reportedly had a ‘serious row’ with Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick after Tuesday’s 3-0 loss against Chelsea.",
      "Former Tottenham scout Bryan King has told the club the value of the transfer of Marcus Rashford would be “great” as the Spanish media have responded poorly to his latest ...",
      "Barcelona reportedly feel Chelsea star Pedro Neto fits perfectly into their system, as there’s uncertainty over the future of Marcus Rashford despite praise from boss Hansi Flick.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford is emerging as a transfer target for Chelsea as they look to rival Barcelona for his signature, according to reports."

      "The third-best player in the league so far, Rice’s rating (7.30) is matched by Gabriel, but the England star edges it on account of having played more minutes. Rice is becoming the complete midfielder, even if the battle between him and Moises Caicedo was won by… Reece James.",
      "Villa had a rough summer but their best signing may have been the contract extension penned by Kamara in July. His first goal of the season, the winner against Wolves, was Villa’s ninth from outside the box, more than they have scored inside the area. Which feels… unsustainable.",

      "Santos superstar Neymar “could really boost” Man Utd if they could sign the Brazil international in the January transfer window, according to Louis Saha.",

      "Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all joined and there has been some improvement but Man Utd are still a long way away from the finished article under Amorim.",
      "Neymar, who returned to boyhood club Santos in January from Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, has been linked with Man Utd a lot in the past and Saha reckons he could provide the Red Devils a “boost’ as a winter move for the Brazilian is mooted.",

      "READ: Manchester United ‘shouldn’t be happy with band aid victory’ after Amorim’s Everton abomination",
      "“It’s sad, because I love Neymar. I thought a couple of years ago it’d have been a perfect move because he can still be an amazing player. He could really boost United with his inventiveness and talent.",
      "“I think perhaps the way he has had his career guided needed to be challenged in the past. I don’t know how he can set about putting things right and rebuilding anymore. United need players who will sacrifice themselves for the team, who are in love with the club. I’m not sure Neymar is the man to offer that to United at this point in his career.”",
      "When asked whether Man Utd should go into the transfer market again in January, Saha added: “If they find the right target, yes. If they don’t, they have to take the hit and miss out this winter. The market has not been the easiest one for many years. So they need to take their time, and not act just for the sake of it. They need real purpose in the transfer market.",
      "“They have to be very deliberate about who they recruit. You need to find the right people, the right players. Players need to have a bit of fire to play for Manchester United.",
      "“They need to want to play for Man United more than anything, and this is what they have really done well in the summer. They signed players who really want to play, and don’t think about themselves only.",
      "“So there are elements of joy to see that they’re completely in line with the mission, and the challenge ahead. They’ve stopped looking at players who just see United as a stepping stone. That doesn’t work. I think if they find the right players, they can act, but they don’t need to add players just for the sake of it.”",
      "Neymar has been linked with a transfer to England, Major League Soccer and various other places and former USMNT star Brad Friedel has suggested he could link up with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at Inter Miami.",
      "Friedel told Goal: “If Neymar is fit, then I think it works, I really do because he’s still a huge name in certain parts of the US. The trouble is if he’s not fit and he’s injured a lot, then it becomes a negative media-driven reality. I can understand arguments on both sides for sure.",
      "“I would assume, and these are smart guys, it would be a tiered contract based on performances and being fit. Having spent some time in Miami, before Messi came you wouldn’t have really known that Miami had a team. From the time that he came, there are pink and black shirts everywhere. If Neymar came, it would add to that.”",

      "Before that goal, Villa were winless through five games. The goal they’d scored in a disappointing 1-1 draw at 10-man Sunderland the previous weekend was the only one they’d managed in five limp efforts.",
      "And then they found themselves 1-0 down at home to Fulham on matchday six with an entire season – an entire project – seemingly circling the drain.",
      "But from nowhere, Watkins lifted a shot over Bernd Leno to bring Villa level. They went on to win 3-1, and have won six of seven Premier League matches since.",

      "But that record is about to collide head on with the Busy Festive Period, the glorious month of December in which even titchy little clubs like United with no other competitions to worry about find themselves facing another game every three or four days and no real clue who they’ll be playing from one game to the next and then also playing the same team twice in the space of about a fortnight for some reason.",
      "Can Shaw really continue to be relied upon in every game? The extreme levels of weariness on display against the 10 men of Everton last week rather suggest not.",
      "",
      "Let’s be entirely fair about it; this one would have been far more valid a month ago than it is now. In a way, the sight of a previously struggling Gibbs-White scoring in three straight games should perhaps make us rethink this entire feature. Maybe they all just need more time. But we’re not doing that. We are not in the business of learning things here.",
      "None of the other players on this list have Gibbs-White’s mitigation, for one thing, of starting the season on the back of a deeply bizarre summer in which he thought he was joining Tottenham (lucky escape etc. and so forth ho ho ho) only to then sign a new contract announced in a video alongside Mr Marinakis that definitely wasn’t unsettling or strange at all.",
      "The recent goals have coincided with Forest’s recent resurgence under Sean Dyche, but they do still also mask to some extent a significant reduction in Gibbs-White’s role as this team’s creative spark. Having hit double figures for assists last season, he has just one to his name so far in this campaign.",

      "Perhaps the clearest indicator of the difference between Bournemouth last season and Bournemouth this season is the fact Senesi has already racked up more Premier League minutes in 25/26 (1158) than in the entirety of 24/25 (1107).",
      "He’s not been bad, per se, it’s just that as the one constant in a defence that has now shipped 12 goals in four winless games, it does start to draw attention. Feels like maybe it’s time to try something else.",
      "And Andoni Iraola has no choice now anyway; the defeat at Sunderland from 2-0 up was disastrous for many reasons, but disciplinary chaos was high on the list. For the second Premier League game in a row, Senesi picked up a booking in injury-time, taking him to the five-card suspension threshold which will see him join Lewis Cook and David Brooks on the naughty step for the midweek Everton game.",
      "Veljko Milosavljevic, this is your time to shine.",

      "So anonymous even in the impressive victory at Tottenham that Spurs fans didn’t even remember to boo him for being Arsenal. In fairness they were a bit preoccupied booing their own players, but they did still remember when Emile Smith Rowe came on. And Emile Smith Rowe has sadly become a byword for anonymous.",
      "Iwobi has started every single game for Fulham this season as he closes in on reaching the 100 Premier League appearances landmark for a third top-flight club, but hasn’t contributed either a goal or assist since the 3-1 win over Brentford in September, which is eight games ago now.",
      "",
      "Harsh and vindictive to single Joao Gomes out, but Wolves are at the stage where trying almost anything they haven’t already attempted feels like it doesn’t really have any significant downside. What’s the worst thing that can actually happen next to a team with two points from 13 games?",
      "Basically, nobody wants to be the player with the most minutes in a side that has lost 11 Premier League games before the advent calendars come out. You do start to look like a bit of an albatross, even if that’s not really very fair.",
      "Statistically, though, the evidence suggests that instead of dropping Gomes, Rob Edwards should actually make him captain. Wolves’ points per game rockets from 0.15 all the way up to 1.00 when Gomes has the armband. Although one game is admittedly a small sample size.",

      "And again. Is this particularly fair? No. But have Leeds lost six of their last seven Premier League games meaning that at this time only Wolves are less sh*t? Yes.",
      "So we’re once again in ‘can’t really make things worse’ territory. There are three contenders in the Leeds squad and our airily dismissive snap judgement is that Bogle has been less good than Joe Rodon and they’ve already tried leaving Gabriel Gudmundsson out in the Man City game, with, well, quite confusing results given he came on just after Leeds had somehow got that game back to 2-2.",
      "But that ultimately futile comeback after leaving out a previous ever-present surely only shows proof of concept for trying it again, doesn’t it? Against a team that maybe isn’t Man City? When you need a tenth name for a feature: yes, yes it does.",

Fair point but that undermines the “whole coaching them all week” point you made. What was he coaching them? Because it wasn’t urgency against a team that played in Europe on Thursday. We were the team who looked like we had played in midweek such was our apparent apathy and lack of urgency. Why do we need to sacrifice a whole half for the manager to get this team to do what he had a whole week to prepare for?",
      "Also if looking at your bench and choosing the only non-youth team player who can play striker because of an injury is management then I’m expecting a call up any day now. I will concede that the Mount pick was good but again those two goals came from two moments of individual genius from dead ball situations. Like I said up until the 76th-ish minute the only touch we had in the opposition box was Zirkzee’s goal.",
      "And this domination you’re talking about was not part of the game I watched because we were under siege in the last ten minutes or so and Opta (however much weight you’d like to give them) showed that except for 15 minutes, it was Palace who were the more threatening team. We were lucky not to be 3-0 down at half time with Mateta just squeezing one wide and that Palace shot from a long throw in that went straight at Lammens.",
      "Sorry mate. I really do want to celebrate a United win but this win had some SERIOUS caveats attached to it and we as United fans shouldn’t be happy with a band aid victory after that Everton defeat where Amorim REFUSED to change shape and left us with 5 at the back against ten men.",
      "Andreas Hasle makes some excellent points and I agree with almost his whole email. One thing I absolutely agree has to be changed in the PL and football in general is the after shot tackle as he mentions about Konsa. How a player is allowed to absolutely plough into an attacker and face no censure after the player has taken his shot is completely ridiculous. I don’t know why it’s allowed and honestly it’s ridiculous and dangerous. But I suppose asking for refereeing consistency and accountability is tilting at windmills in the extreme",

Anything Mikel. Please.",

I wondered before the game if having two away matches back-to-back would help – all other recent losses away have been followed by a home match, so the tired line was repeated about ‘putting things right’ which you can’t do by retreating back to your comfort zone. We’ll never know but psychologically I wonder if going straight to another hostile stadium and tough opponent was what changed the mentality from seeking comfort to sharpening focus.",
      "The Pope decision being taken out of Howe’s hands due to injury was helpful. Burn being trusted at CB showed us again that he is an outstanding defender in the right position, but that cannot be full back where Hall was excellent and brings so much to the attack that Burn cannot. Thiaw is just in that kind of form top CBs can get into – imperious in defence but in the right place in attack – peak Van Dijk, Dias & Gabriel have shown how much impact that kind of defender can have at both ends of the pitch, we have to keep him fit.",
      "Miley took a lot of ball playing stress off Bruno who looked like Home Bruno in this outing. I wasn’t reading too much into Tonali not playing as he needs a rest but if Bruno is left to do all the playmaking we’ve seen that doesn’t work, Miley helped balance that and Joelinton was very impressive in the 2nd half. Now we know we can rotate in midfield we need to see more of it.",
      "Woltemade’s finish was filthy, but like the City game he played better overall, had more chances and if anything looks more of a threat than those earlier games where he was scoring maybe from one chance. And Elanga gave what was comfortably his best performance. He should have done better with that first chance in the first few seconds of the game, but tactically he was very good and that was key to a very good team performance. Getting his first assist will help I’m sure.",
      "Only downside is how dependent we are on Hall and Livramento staying fit in order to play as we did against Everton and against City. Lovely when they are together but if either is out our other options at FB cannot offer the same mobility, drive and dynamism. We need another left back as Burn should not be the first choice back up.",
      "What I love about Howe is that he does change things. He might wait a bit too long and he seems reactive rather than proactive, but he will adapt. Contrast that with Amorim who won’t change a thing regardless of circumstances and I can only give my opinion that Howe will outlast Amorim as a top coach. I wrote in a couple of weeks ago saying this period will make or break the season and Howe’s reputation and I stand by that, but we’ve got a home match against a Spurs team who are at a very low ebb tomorrow, win that and its three league wins back-to-back, with another home game against Burnley at the weekend.\nJames, Leeds",

      "They need an upgrade on Scott McTominay, who’s consistently proved himself not quite good enough for a club that still stands alone as The Greatest In English Football History, and for Casemiro, who’s just been told to “leave the football before the football leaves you” by Jamie Carragher.",
      "Names are put forward, but all pale in comparison to a man who’s who’s not good enough for PSG but is still very good (promise), as proven by him thriving at Sporting under a manager not yet attractive enough to unseat Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford.",
      "Burnley’s Sander Berge and Wolves’ Joao Gomes are on their radar, but chief among the alternatives is Atalanta star Ederson. If only the Serie A side weren’t asking for just as much as PSG want for an evidently superior midfielder in Ugarte.",
      "In quite the catalogue of midfield recriminations at Manchester United, the summer of 2024 is a doozy. Pushing McTominay to Napoli for him to be named Serie A MVP while winning the Scudetto and signing Ugarte in his stead is extraordinarily poor judgement by their own extraordinarily low standards.",
      "Eventually PSG dropped their price for Ugarte to what was at the time thought to be a €50m bargain but has since proven to be a gross overpayment for a footballer who’s at best a midfield passenger rather than the fighter the United hierarchy were hoping for, and more often than not an ally to opposition teams in their routine bypassing of the Red Devils midfield.",

      "“I think it’s a big, big few weeks for Kobbie Mainoo in determining how he feels about his role at the football club, how he feels about staying or going.",
      "“These next few weeks are going to be telling in that department. So watch this space.”",
      "There’s a whole lot of “ifs” in there and we’ve essentially seen a dry run for AFCON in the last two games. With two forwards – Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko – not available to play, Mainoo has still only played 32 minutes off the bench in the defeat to Everton, and came on in the last minute in the victory over Crystal Palace.",
      "With Cunha posting a picture of himself in training with the caption ‘back back back’ and Joshua Zirkzee coming up trumps in that win over Palace with a very fine finish, the nailed-on front three when Mbeumo and Amad depart will see Mason Mount and Cunha either side of Zirkzee, who may or may not drop out of the team when Sesko returns from injury in a couple of weeks’ time.",
      "A report last week claimed Mainoo has ‘said yes’ to Napoli ahead of the January transfer window and the Serie A side are ‘growing positive’ about securing his services, with Mainoo is said to be ‘specifically open to a loan deal’.",
      "And even if Mainoo was given ample opportunity over the Christmas period to prove his worth to United, there’s simply no way he will retain a spot in the team ahead of Mbeumo when he returns or Cunha in one of those inverted No.10 spots.",
      "Because as Amorim has already made very clear, he doesn’t see Mainoo as a player for one of those positions. It’s him or Bruno Fernandes, and it will always be Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Arsenal could make a January transfer window move to sign Man Utd midfielder Kobbie Mainoo, according to one respected journalist.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has claimed Arsenal star Bukayo Saka is “unplayable” after the Gunners’ 1-1 draw at Chelsea on Sunday.",
      "England international Kobbie Mainoo is reportedly edging closer to leaving Manchester United, who have already ‘sealed’ a January signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are still backing Ruben Amorim as they are preparing to let eight players leave and make four priority signings.",
      "Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo has been told that he should be “furious” at Ruben Amorim as he is in a “horrible” situation at Old Trafford.",

      "Man Utd have made a record-breaking ‘offer’ to sign Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde ahead of the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils spent over £200m on five new signings in the summer transfer market with priority given to improvements in attacking areas.",
      "After being the fifth lowest scorers in the Premier League last term, Man Utd brought in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko to try and solve their goalscoring woes.",
      "But many Man Utd supporters and former players thought failing to sign a new midfielder in the summer was a massive mistake after their issues last term.",
      "The Red Devils did make enquiries for Atletico Madrid’s Conor Gallagher and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba but in the end nothing concrete came from those talks.",
      "And now reports in Spain indicate that Man Utd want to ‘repeat the Casemiro deal’ – which seems a bit strange considering he’s mainly flopped at Old Trafford – by making an ‘offer’ for Real Madrid midfielder Valverde.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Foden, Frank, Sunderland, Paqueta, Arsenal and more…",
      "Man Utd are offering ‘a fixed fee of €100 million plus €20 million in add-ons to try and lure one of the most complete, physically imposing, and decisive players in world football away from Real Madrid’.",
      "The €120m (£105m) fee would be a record-breaking deal for the Red Devils, whose biggest ever purchase was the £89m they paid to Juventus for Paul Pogba in 2016, and INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘want to build a project with Valverde as its cornerstone and don’t hesitate to place him among the most expensive signings in the club’s history.’",
      "There could be a lot of change at Man Utd over the next couple of transfer windows as the Red Devils look to cut their current wage bill – but former Man City financial adviser Stefan Borson doubts it will reduced as much as some think.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “I don’t think United are going to cut £100m off the wage bill. Wage bills always come down slower than people think. United have already cut the wage bill quite aggressively.",
      "“Every team has got players who are surplus to requirements who you go, ‘Well, of course, we’ll sell these players in the summer and then the wage bill will just collapse and we’ll have a tiny wage bill’. It just never works that way.",
      "“First of all, you can’t always get rid of these players. Some of them come back.",
      "“There’s an interesting situation with Sancho.",
      "“I think he’s got a one-year option that United talked about exercising, but they probably won’t exercise it, so maybe he’ll go for free.",
      "“I think they will probably sell Mainoo, but then that’s more of a profit and not really a massive wage saving because he won’t be on top-tier wages.",
      "“They’ll probably end up keeping Casemiro rather than shipping him out. They’ll probably end up keeping Bruno Fernandes. They’ll probably end up doing a deal to keep Maguire. They might be on reduced salaries, but they’re not going to go to zero. They’ll just trim 25 per cent off.”",

      "But let’s be honest: you’re only here to see which arbitrary section Arsenal have been put in so you can properly word the furious comments that will never be read.",
      "",
      "Chelsea indiscipline probably ought to be addressed at some point but the genuine growth and maturity in their manager and players in such a short space of time has been impressive.",
      "The Blues have had four players sent off since that abhorrent response to an early red card against Manchester United in September and collapse after a red card against Brighton the following week.",
      "That is a problem in itself, and many of those were late on with games already largely settled.",
      "But this was a substantial development. Chelsea lost their best player after 38 minutes against the best team in the league and perhaps world, yet were still the better side thereafter as a result of the coming-of-age of those who managed to stay on the pitch, and the decisions the manager made in response.",
      "",
      "Even Regis Le Bris can’t be sure “what we can achieve this season”. But there is one certainty with Sunderland: “This team has a strong character and they want to fight.”",
      "That much was evident against Bournemouth, which in itself was a neat microcosm of their season. Sunderland have salvaged more points from losing positions than any Premier League club in 2025/26, and here were three more rescued in historic fashion.",
      "Never before in 621 Premier League games had they come from two goals down to win. Yet even when Bournemouth capitalised so ruthlessly on a couple of individual errors in the first 15 minutes it never really felt as though Sunderland were out of it.",
      "As Le Bris said, they have mastered how to “change the dynamic”, to “reset” and to “find solutions”, either from the dugout or on the pitch through the guidance and experience of Granit Xhaka, Nordi Mukiele, Reinildo or any of the numerous other leaders emerging in this squad.",
      "It is a neat trick – remarkable for a promoted club under a manager new to the Premier League, really – to be able to compartmentalise situations and setbacks and respond so emphatically. Sunderland following all three of their defeats so far with a win in the next game (a feat only Arsenal can match and they’ve lost just once) is no happy accident.",
      "",
      "It sums up their early-season malaise that consecutive Premier League wins have lifted Fulham from 15th to 15th. But the complexion of their campaign has transformed: they are closer to a Champions League qualification place than the relegation zone in terms of points.",
      "Marco Silva has landed on a happy balance: the defence is settled; the Iwobi-Berge midfield axis is working; the competition for places in the attacking positions buzzing behind and around the centre-forward is healthy; and Raul Jimenez is still playing that line-leading role impeccably.",
      "When they start as rapidly as in north London and fortune favours that bravery, it is difficult to work out quite why they have struggled so fundamentally this season.",
      "Silva credited “the Nigerian boys” for fostering “a great atmosphere” within the squad, and singled out one soaring Super Eagle.",
      "Samu Chukwueze has been Fulham’s best and most decisive player in consecutive games. He leads the entire league for touches in the opposition penalty area per 90 of those who have played more than a handful of minutes, and Spurs could not handle him.",
      "That £21.9m loan option might just be explored; the outcome of Silva’s ongoing contract negotiations could depend on it.",

      "Recent evidence of that promotion has been scant. Foden did impress in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund last month but his last proper scruff-of-the-neck performance might have been as far back as Brentford in January, or the final day of 2023/24.",
      "Foden started something Manchester City inexplicably couldn’t finish and ultimately needed him to. Pep Guardiola has been calling seemingly all season for someone to help Erling Haaland with those bags and finally his prayers were answered.",
      "The previous latest goal to put Manchester City in the lead in the Premier League this season was scored in the 61st minute against Burnley. Some stoppage-time heroics – and Foden being the one to conjure such majesty – was long overdue.",
      "",
      "Rough calculations suggest Nick Woltemade scoring from an Anthony Elanga pass is the second-most expensive goal combination of two summer signings this season behind Benjamin Sesko setting Bryan Mbeumo up against Brighton in October.",
      "Newcastle signing Woltemade and Elanga in part because both those players chose Manchester United instead adds another delicious layer of narrative.",
      "Another interesting Woltemade line: his six domestic goals so far have all been assisted by different players. Newcastle diversifying their supply line is no bad thing.",
      "",
      "Has Amorim got Man Utd on the Arsenal path to Premier League dominance? Probably not; can’t even instinctively tell you the name of their set-piece coach for a start.",
      "But they are definitely on the right track towards, well, something. Which is more than can be said for the last few years.",
      "The Everton defeat was an abomination, but it seems increasingly like the exception to a new rule the club is trying to implement. Even against Palace they were poor for large periods of the game and could have been further behind at half time.",
      "Yet that only reinforces how things are changing slowly under Amorim. Where once they would have been swept away by that sort of storm, this group is learning how to weather it and emerge for the better.",
      "That was the first time they had ‘won’ a second half in the Premier League all season, and it earned them three valuable points with two more players stepping up from the periphery.",
      "",
      "Returning to the scene of his lowest day as Brighton manager must have been difficult but Hurzeler underlined how quickly he learns his lessons; oh to be 32 again.",
      "Brighton had far less of the ball than in that 7-0 thrashing by Nottingham Forest in February, but more shots and, ultimately, purpose.",
      "The painfully long overdue dropping of Carlos Baleba allowed a promising Gomez-Ayari midfield partnership to blossom from the start, before Hurzeler reinforced his position as the leading substitute maker in the Premier League through the introduction of Stefanos Tzimas to seal victory.",
      "Brighton have scored eight goals from the bench in the Premier League this season, at least three more than any other club. That attacking depth is probably the best in the division.",
      "",
      "Of bloody course some of his half-time team talk consisted of citing specific games from February 2025 and December 2023 as a warning to his players about complacency. And of bloody course it worked.",
      "Not sure how Villa are fourth with seven wins in their last eight Premier League games, but having checked a few times over they certainly appear to be.",
      "",
      "Should the best 45 minutes of Leeds’ season override what was probably their worst immediately beforehand, as well as the three hilariously insipid defeats which preceded it?",
      "There is a case to argue that the second-half transformation the visitors underwent at the Etihad actually emphasised why Farke should be sacked rather than strengthening any few remaining arguments for him to stay. Why did it take so long to try something like this?",
      "For so long Leeds have needed a variation on a tired, failing blueprint, with the desire for a different approach painfully obvious. The minute Farke reverts to his beloved 4-3-3, the axe should swing.",
      "But this was finally proof that he can adjust and adapt, even if it was entirely forced by the prospect of a defeat so chastening that unemployment was the only feasible outcome at half time.",
      "When the barrel is staring down at you so forebodingly, it’s almost easier to chuck Dominic Calvert-Lewin on, stick two up top, call for more physicality and go for it with nothing to lose. The real test will be how he sets up from the start against Chelsea in midweek.",
      "But even if Farke, as still expected, is deemed not to be the man who can liberate Leeds, he will always have that second half and what was presumably a barnstorming but beautifully softly-spoken team talk.",
      "",
      "His middle name is Dave. What more do you want? Fine…",
      "",
      "They realistically belong in the undefined, murky, grey area between winners and losers, such is the nature of a draw against an opponent reduced to 10 men for about an hour.",

      "",
      "Another deeply problematic response to another inadequate performance and result, with another historically mid-table manager being crushed by the scrutiny and weight of expectation higher up the ladder.",
      "That was an opportunity Frank earned but one he has equally wasted thus far. The temptation with coaches overachieving further down the food chain is to wonder what they might be capable of with better players, greater facilities and more resources; the mistake is in forgetting to contemplate whether their style and philosophy can be successfully transposed at a grander level.",
      "The overwhelming evidence is that what worked so wonderfully for Brentford simply cannot at Spurs. Fulham have joined Bournemouth in recording their only Premier League away win this season at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. It remains the only venue Wolves have scored in or taken a point from as visitors in 2025/26.",
      "Frank can moralise over what makes a “true Tottenham fan” if he wishes, but it might be an idea to show he is capable of becoming a true Tottenham manager at some point.",
      "",
      "Far be it from anyone to speculate and pontificate about how others should act in such a high-pressured situation. But also needling away at the referee in such a sustained manner as to receive two bookings and ultimately a red card for double dissent, having endured almost two years of an investigation over alleged deliberate cautions which Paqueta himself has claimed derailed his career and impacted his mental health, feels inadvisable. Like, specifically so. As outlined by his legal team.",
      "It was also a bit strange to see Alisson, Cody Gakpo and Curtis Jones make roughly as much effort calming Paqueta down and keeping him away from Darren England as the Brazilian’s West Ham teammates.",
      "Put it this way: if I was Paqueta, I simply would not pick up two suspensions in three games. Even if I did play for West Ham.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola did acknowledge “a part where we have to look at ourselves”, pinpointing Bournemouth’s poor record at conceding from set-pieces in particular.",
      "But not sure claiming the referee “absolutely lost control” when it was he and his side who so specifically did as such really works as a post-match narrative. Being beaten after leading 2-0 and investing time in anything other than introspection only ever comes across, as Iraola said, like the actions of a “bad loser”.",
      "Bournemouth have conceded more goals than all but the bottom four. That’s not poor Tim Robinson’s fault.",
      "",
      "The true consequences of Idrissa Gueye’s actions might have been delayed, but only for so long.",
      "David Moyes and Ruben Amorim actively praising the literal fight shown by the midfielder at Old Trafford always seemed at least slightly disingenuous. Everton holding out for that win reflected well only on the players who managed not to slap a teammate, and abysmally on the hosts who failed to take advantage.",
      "Everton were considerably worse with 11 men against Newcastle than 10 on Monday. Gueye’s absence sapped their energy and solidity and without that flashpoint to bring them together, it was as disjointed a performance as the Hill Dickinson has seen.",
      "With the Senegalese out for two more games and then away on international duty at AFCON soon after, this was a humbling insight into how that period could look for Everton.",
      "Tim Iroegbunam had been quietly impressive but floundered when thrust into that role, making a single tackle before being substituted at half time.",
      "Yet beyond him there is no obvious understudy to Gueye or solution to the problems he leaves behind. It turns out that being so dependent on a 36-year-old might not be the best idea. Or that ‘James Garner’ is not the answer to every question mankind has ever posed.",
      "",
      "No club in the entire Premier League has a worse defensive record in any quarter-hour segment of games from 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75 and 76-90 than Burnley in the final 15 minutes.",
      "Scott Parker’s side have conceded ten goals in those closing stages, with draws against Manchester United, Liverpool, West Ham and Brentford turned into defeats.",
      "Be it substandard game management, poor resilience, inadequate concentration levels or lacklustre fitness – and all four seemed to be a factor against Brentford – that is a trend of dropping points that Burnley really cannot afford to let fester.",
      "",
      "Alvaro Morata’s Pro Evo counterpart continues to imbue about as much confidence as the real thing would in central defence.",
      "Morato’s crime of not being Murillo is forgivable. But the numbers are stark: in his nine most recent Premier League starts dating back to last season, Forest’s record is W0 D2 L7 F5 A18. And some of that run includes when they were good.",
      "The last league game Forest won with Morato starting was the 7-0 at home to Brighton in February; this was not quite the same. After marking thin air for the first goal – with others far more culpable – his brace of weak header back to the keeper and curious choice of backheeling the ball into the path of Stefanos Tzimas will have had the City Ground sports science department quadrupling their order of cotton wool to wrap Murillo in.",

      "All eight of the points they have dropped from winning positions this season have come in games after playing in Europe midweek. That solitary win came in August.",
      "As the schedule has congested since then, the lack of proper squad depth has been exposed. Glasner has made the fewest substitutions of any manager who has been in place all season; he is still six behind Vitor Pereira.",
      "",
      "Seven defeats in eight Premier League games, and now one win in 19. The last player to score a top-flight goal under Edwards was Alfie Doughty, who spent most of the weekend on the Millwall bench.",
      "It cannot possibly have been an appointment made on the proviso that Edwards might actually achieve safety, and there have been improvements in the two Wolves matches he has overseen.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",

      "Manchester United have no chance of signing Elliot Anderson for a cut-price fee, while Manchester City’s hijack is another blow for Ruben Amorim…",
      "Anderson is on a list of ten non-Big Six stars primed for a transfer in 2026, but he is far more likely to leave Forest in the summer than in January.",
      "The former Newcastle United star has had an extraordinary rise since departing his boyhood club, establishing himself as one of the finest defensive midfielders in Europe and a near-certain starter for England at next summer’s World Cup.",
      "Anderson‘s sudden rise is a huge boost for England as he provides a fix in a problem position, and Man Utd appear to hope that he can have the same effect on Amorim’s team.",
      "It is clear for all to see that the Red Devils are crying out for a top-tier No.6 to be Casemiro’s long-term replacement, and Anderson is widely reported to be a preferred target with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and/or Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton.",
      "READ: Has Amorim got Man Utd on the Arsenal path to Premier League dominance?",
      "Man Utd’s willingness to test Brighton’s resolve over £100m-rated Baleba in the summer proves they are aware that they need to sign a new defensive midfielder soon, with Anderson standing out as a perfect fit.",
      "Unfortunately for Man Utd, a January deal involving Anderson has never been likely. This is presumably why they are also reportedly looking at Wolves’ Joao Gomes as a potential low-cost target until they can sign a midfielder of a higher level and price bracket in the summer.",
      "With Anderson, Forest are bound to put financial obstacles in the way of a winter exit as they will know it would be foolish to sell their best player while they are far from safe from relegation and are hoping to progress deep into the Europa League.",
      "Anderson, too, should be against a January move because he would be in a far stronger negotiating position and would have more options once he’s presumably shone as a key player for England at a World Cup.",
      "So it was confusing when it was reported last month that the Red Devils are ‘confident’ of signing Anderson in January for a cut-price fee worth around £70m.",
      "Unsurprisingly, this nonsense report has now been exposed by an update from journalist Sacha Tavolieri, while Man City’s interest is another blow for Man Utd.",
      "Tavolieri claims Man City are ‘in love with Anderson’, while he is ‘giving priority’ to Pep Guardiola’s side over other teams. Also, the ‘only snag’ for this deal is something anyone with their head screwed on was already aware of.",
      "‘The only snag is that Evangelos Marinakis’ demands are far higher than City’s valuations so far, and they have refused to offer Nottingham Forest the £100 million.",
      "‘Whatever happens, Anderson will remain in London in January. His departure is only conceivable after the 2026 World Cup.’",
      "Man Utd (and others) put Newcastle United in their box in the summer window, though Arsenal, Chelsea, Vikor Gyokeres and Liam Delap proved where the Red Devils are in the pecking order, so Anderson’s reported transfer stance is justified.",
      "And while it is conceivable that United outbid City to gain favour for Anderson, it would still take a large portion of next year’s budget to sign him, and they have no hope of landing when a new midfielder is ideally required in January.",
      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100m for Elliot Anderson after Man City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd will not be signing Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd are now ‘confident’ that they can seal a cut-price deal for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd legend Paul Scholes thinks Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson would be a “really good signing” for Ruben Amorim’s side.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have already ‘decided’ who is at the ‘top of the list’ as they look to sign a new midfielder in 2026.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly entered the race to sign Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson with the Gunners ‘not backing down’ over his price tag."

      "Premier League • England",
      "Ruben Amorim has made it clear to the Manchester United board that he does not want to offload Joshua Zirkzee in January and believes the Dutchman has now earned the right to prove his worth to the club – while the Portuguese’s thoughts on letting Kobbie Mainoo move on can also be revealed.",
      "The Dutch forward has not had an easy time of things since moving to Old Trafford in a £36.5m (€42.5m, $49.5m) deal from Bolonga in summer 2024. While he scored on his debut, a 1-0 win over Fulham at the start of the 2024/25 campaign, Zirkzee has netted only eight times in his 56 appearances for United, while just three assists show he’s not really good enough to play as a No.10 either.",
      "However, the 24-year-old spent the recent international break preparing for his big opportunity in the team as Manchester United reacted to Benjamin Sesko’s injury.",
      "Amorim has always admired Zirkzee on a technical level, but has been unsure how to fit him into the team’s plan.",
      "However, after spending a lot of time coaching the player and working on his game in a programme designed to not just work out his role for the club but how they could unlock his full potential within the current set-up, United and Amorim are now starting to see their efforts bear fruit.",
      "And while Zirkzee has been linked with a move away – and Roma are confirmed admirers of the player and are very much open to a January deal if an arrangement could be agreed – this spell was always viewed as a pivotal period in determining his future.",
      "If it had gone badly, then United were willing to open up to a departure. However, he scored a good goal in the 2-1 win against Crystal Palace on Sunday, and sources are now suggesting that Amorim is now very much keen to keep him for the rest of the season.",
      "IN-DEPTH 🔴⚫ Five strikers Man Utd could target in the January transfer window as Zirkzee Plan B",
      "An exit has never been pushed by the boss because he is concerned about the lack of depth and likes the fact that Zirkzee understands his game plans.",
      "And with Zirkzee on the scoresheet and helping United overturn a 1-0 half-time deficit to win 2-1 at Selhurst Park, Amorim was quick to praise the Netherlands international.",
      "“It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball, so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.”",
      "The game also saw Kobbie Mainoo enter the action as a 90th-minute substitute, meaning he has still only played 170 minutes of action in the Premier League this season – and all eight of his appearances have come off the bench, with none as a starter.",
      "Also strongly linked with a January departure, the midfielder still faces a fight to get a move to another team in January, with Amorim only willing to sanction his exit if a replacement is signed first.",
      "Zirkzee, meanwhile, had played just 82 minutes combined across this Premier League season leading into the last international break, but has played the full 90 minutes of their last two games.",
      "As a result, Amorim is aware that it only takes one injury for the situation to change; hence the manager’s unwillingness to let the 20-year-old midfielder leave without a fight.",
      "Get the inside story first by joining our TEAMtalk Facebook channel to receive the latest breaking and exclusive news straight into your Messenger inbox.",
      "On the subject of potential new midfielders, United have been given a golden opportunity to sign Atletico Madrid star Conor Gallagher, as speculation ramps up over a potential January switch to Old Trafford.",
      "As reported by TEAMtalk transfer insider Fraser Fletcher, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson top the shortlist.",
      "But the trio will all command fees north of £70m, perhaps even as high as £100m, so their potential signings will likely have to wait until next summer.",
      "Wharton, meanwhile, showcased exactly why United should move for him with an outstanding first-half display in Palace’s 2-1 defeat to the Red Devils, and with sources able to shed light on the likelihood of a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "In other news, a shock report claims United have presented a ‘contract offer’ to Antoine Semenyo, after holding a meeting with his representatives on Wednesday last week.",

      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appears to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "We do wish Maresca would admit they can win the league, though. He talked himself out of a title challenge in self-fulfilling fashion last year; don’t do it again, man.",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Six wins in the bag already and comfortably more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United eased some nerves at Selhurst Park, but the significant raising of the threat level for a Thomas Frank Sack at Spurs has them looking a bit nervous once more.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances which now incredibly sees Frank-less Brentford above Frank’s Tottenham.",
      "Brentford go to Tottenham at the weekend in a fixture with narrative out the wazoo with a very real chance now of being Frank’s last game at Spurs.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now seven wins in eight Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Four wins in five games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if that defeat at Newcastle and near disaster against lowly Leeds do highlight the very real risk of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top five after 13 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair. Were oddly rubbish against Brighton, though.",
      "",
      "Still among the least sackable managers in the top flight despite Bournemouth now being in the depths of one of the familiar lows that have always existed alongside the highs under Iraola.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, but he must still be in credit overall given the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer. It’s hurting him and Bournemouth now – only the bottom four have conceded more goals – but mid-table comfiness remains an impressive effort on the back of such a challenging summer.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Time to stop trying to work out if Man United are good or rubbish. They’re just meh. Arguably that’s even worse, really, when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About. But trying to look for clues in the tea-leaves of their results is completely futile when they do things like win three games in a row and then come unstuck at Nottingham Forest or fail even to win at Tottenham like literally everyone else is able to do at the moment.",
      "Losing at home to 10-man Everton and then winning from a goal down at Crystal Palace just highlights the pointlessness of trying to read anything into what Manchester United are doing. It’s just a bunch of stuff that happens.",
      "What does that mean for Ruben Amorim? That he’s probably fine. They’re slightly less bad than they were, and he wasn’t sacked then. So probably won’t be now.",
      "",
      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Dr Tottenham have sorted things right out.",
      "That’s good news, because we remain firmly wedded to the idea that both Fulham and Silva would be worse off without the other.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after runs of four straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. And after a brutal, disastrous week, it’s really now starting to look like it’s the bad days.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until now we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "Spurs go to Newcastle – where their recent record is utterly horrific – this week before welcoming Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend. Entirely conceivable now that the Bees could put their former manager out of a job in that one.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, and he’s now passed the point where ‘credit in defeat to Manchester City’ does anything more than delay the inevitable ahead of Chelsea, before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United beating Palace ‘had some SERIOUS caveats attached. And Thomas Frank and Arne Slot show why there will not be another Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘seriously considering’ a Tottenham Hotspur target replace head coach Ruben Amorim for three reasons.",
      "Arne Slot, Ruben Amorim, Thomas Frank…they will all be thrown from the top-floor window of the Premier League’s gaudy, gold skyscraper of excess.",
      "Safe, boring football, set-piece goals and solid defending, you say? Are Ruben Amorim’s Man Utd the new Arsenal?",
      "Ruben Amorim has sent a message to the Man Utd bosses after dropping an ‘anxiety’-ridden star vs Crystal Palace following a social media put-down.",

      "Tuesday 2 December 2025 22:36, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League midweek...",
      "Arsenal keep rolling in an efficient and relentless manner.",
      "Mikel Arteta's men are now unbeaten in 17 matches in all competitions, their longest streak under the Spaniard, and they're doing it with a defensive base that is as sturdy as anything in Europe.",
      "In fact, Arsenal boast the most clean sheets (7) and joint-fewest defeats (1) across all competitions in Europe's major leagues - elite numbers that tell you precisely where their authority lies.",
      "And Brentford are exactly the sort of team Arsenal tend to keep at arm's length.",
      "Arsenal and under 3.5 goals has landed in nine of their last 15 Premier League outings. That's the pattern. Professional wins.",
      "No need for fireworks when discipline and dominance will do, and that bet is on offer at Evens with Sky Bet.",
      "Ezri Konsa has quietly become one of the Premier League's most adept players at winning fouls. The numbers make the case: Konsa has been fouled at least twice in six of his last 11 starts, and across the season he's averaging 1.6 fouls drawn per game.",
      "Konsa's role under Unai Emery is tailor-made for drawing pressure. He steps into midfield, he drives into space and he becomes the trigger point for opposition presses.",
      "Konsa is on offer at 5/4 with Sky Bet to draw two or more fouls - it's a price that hasn't fully caught up with the player's true foul-drawing ability.",
      "Crystal Palace are giving off uneasy vibes - even for a fixture of this winnable magnitude.",
      "On the pitch, they remain a team with so much going for them but the mood music in the background is beginning to change. Oliver Glasner isn't exactly hiding his frustration with the lack of ambition being shown above him, and when a manager starts sounding such soundbites, it rarely stays contained.",
      "You don't need a psychology degree to know how quickly that can seep into a dressing room. Players can sense uncertainty. And suddenly a team that should be bullying lesser opposition becomes tentative and starts to feel that extra workload in their legs the world has been talking about.",
      "A draw looks on the cards, with Burnley on the double chance at Evens with Sky Bet looking a bet with potential.",
      "Wolves and their increased threat from set pieces under Rob Edwards remains a betting angle to explore.",
      "Yerson Mosquera has the attributes to be a big threat from such situations - he's tall, athletic and aerially competitive - and those qualities have been spotted by Edwards, based on how prominent Mosquera was in Wolves' set-piece structure in the defeat at Villa.",
      "The defender had two shots there and was denied a goal by a save-of-the-season contender from Emiliano Martinez. If Edwards rinses and repeats those set-piece routines, then Mosquera is great value in the shots market where he's Evens with Sky Bet to have one or more shots.",
      "Football seasons aren't defined by the headline fixtures like beating Liverpool at home and grabbing a point with 10 men against Arsenal. Those moments can create momentum and belief but they don't win titles. What does define a challenger for top honours are the awkward and gritty away days where the favourites must prove their resilience rather than their brilliance. And Chelsea's visit to Elland Road falls into that category. Win here and a title push could be on.",
      "If Chelsea are genuine title contenders then these are the games they must navigate. It's easy to raise your levels for Liverpool and Arsenal, it's far harder to reproduce that clarity when you're getting hunted by a team whose primary motivation is to make your evening a miserable one. This could be a fiddly fixture for Chelsea. The draw looks the bet at 3/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "If you've been riding the Liverpool goals conceded train in recent weeks, Sunday's 2-0 stroll against a meek and mild West Ham shouldn't spook you off the scent.",
      "One clean sheet against a side seemingly allergic to progressive passes doesn't suddenly fix what has become a very clear trend in that Liverpool are conceding big chances - and plenty of them. Only West Ham, Burnley, Manchester United and Everton are conceding more than Liverpool (23).",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have shipped 16 goals.",
      "The aura of defensive invincibility that Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate once radiated has dimmed.",
      "Sunderland tick the exact boxes Liverpool have struggled with in that they're energetic, press with enthusiasm and attack space quickly when it's there. They don't need to dominate the game to score. All this adds up to both teams to score and over 2.5 goals being a nice slice of value at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen to score at 3/1 with Sky Bet is a generous gift from the traders at Sky Bet. An early Christmas present perhaps.",
      "Bowen is the spark in this West Ham side. He leads the way for shot-creating actions, progressive carries, ball progression and shots on target - Bowen does it all. When West Ham manage to pose a threat, it often goes through him.",
      "Manchester United have kept just two clean sheets in their last 21 games and there remain big structural issues in defence, with no authority in key areas.",

      "Arsenal vs Brentford - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Arsenal were not themselves at Chelsea. They were off the pace at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Several misplaced passes in the build-up phase and they lost the duel battle to Chelsea. They lost two-thirds of their first 24 duels in the opening quarter of the game, while they only won one of the first 10 aerial duels.",
      "There were several factors behind it. Chelsea played well - having had an extra day to prepare after their midweek European action - while the absences of William Saliba and Gabriel filtered throughout the team to create an unconvincing display.",
      "It has also been a busy schedule. \"It's been a big week,\" said Mikel Arteta after overcoming the triple header of Spurs, Bayern Munich and the Blues last week. So is it time for the Arsenal manager to rotate?",
      "Wednesday night's visit of Brentford may be a good opportunity to give minutes to those who need it, but more crucially rest those who have been called upon a lot.",
      "For example, Ben White could come in for Jurrien Timber. The likes of Martin Odegaard, Noni Madueke and Viktor Gyokeres are aiming for first starts after injury. Even Christian Norgaard, against his former club, and Ethan Nwaneri could be called upon.",
      "Brentford's record against the bigger sides makes them a decent test so there cannot be wholesale changes. But one thing the Bees are good at is winning duels via first and second balls. Arsenal will need fresh legs more than on-pitch quality.Sam Blitz",
      "Liverpool vs Sunderland - Wednesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "It cannot just be a coincidence that Liverpool kept their first Premier League clean sheet since they beat Aston Villa a month ago - and only their third all season in the top flight - in their much-needed win at West Ham United on Sunday in a game that also saw Joe Gomez make his first league start in almost a year, incidentally also in a victory at the London Stadium.",
      "Despite a series of calamitous recent defensive displays, including a 3-0 loss to struggling Nottingham Forest, followed by a 4-1 defeat to PSV Eindhoven - both at Anfield - in the lead-up to the game, Liverpool head coach Arne Slot had been stubbornly resisting calls to start Gomez, who has been carrying a slight knee niggle of late.",
      "But the versatile 28-year-old returned on the right-hand side of the champions' defence in east London, with the Reds immediately looking more assured at the back, with no visiting player making more interceptions, while he also created their second goal for Coady Gakpo.",
      "Fitness permitting, expect Liverpool's long-serving player to still be in the hosts' starting line-up when high-flying Sunderland visit Anfield.",
      "Richard Morgan",
      "Burnley vs Crystal Palace - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Only two Premier League teams have missed more than 25 big chances this season - Crystal Palace are one of them.",
      "With 26, Palace have a major problem with converting the big opportunities they are managing to create.",
      "Oliver Glasner bemoaned his side's lack of business, calling for some level of sympathy as his side tired in their defeat to Manchester United. However, in their ascendancy, Palace failed to capitalise on a rampant first half, which could be costing them more than their squad depth.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta, who took his tally of big chances missed up to 12 against United, is only behind Erling Haaland for big chances spurned.",
      "Creativity was the main concern for Palace when Eberechi Eze moved on to pastures new in the summer. However, creating isn't what's holding Palace back; it's their inability to score.",
      "Burnley will provide the sternest test of Palace's ability to find the back of the net. Scott Parker's Clarets have the league's highest expected goals against with 28.79, meaning - on paper - there will be ample opportunity to exorcise their big-chance demons.William Bitibiri",
      "Wolves vs Nottingham Forest - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Wolves are in trouble. As we enter the final month of the year, they remain winless. It's a dismal start that has seen their foreheads pressed against the barrel of a relegation to the Championship.",
      "Defeat at Forest would mean that they have lost seven straight matches in the top flight.",
      "The last time the club fell to that many defeats was during the 2011/12 season, during Terry Connor's infamous reign, which was an all-time low in a relegation season.",
      "The records are likely to compound if fortunes fail to turn at Molineux. Wolves are on target to lose 32 matches this season.",
      "Derby County in 2007/08, statistically the Premier League's worst team, had six points recorded by this point while Wolves have two. They are on track to take Derby's crown.",
      "Only once has a team recorded lass than two points at this stage in Premier League history and that was Sheffield Wednesday, who had one and were ultimately relegated. While the chances of a Wolves survival remain slim, fans will hope to retain some semblance of respectability starting with Forest on Wednesday.William Bitibiri",
      "Leeds vs Chelsea - Wednesday, kick-off 8.15pm",
      "This is a fixture packed with history - and plenty of thumping tackles and intensity. The 1970 FA Cup final replay was the most fearsome of all but expect another boiling hot atmosphere at Elland Road when the sides meet again on Wednesday.",
      "Can Enzo Maresca's side keep their heads in the pressure cooker?",
      "The midfielder will be suspended for the Leeds trip but ill-discipline is becoming a theme for this Chelsea team. There have been six red cards shown to Chelsea players this season. Their four in the Premier League is twice as many as any other side.",
      "Even Maresca has served a suspension after being sent to the stands for his jubilant celebrations of Estevao's last-gasp winner against Liverpool.",
      "It's a concern which really came into focus at the back end of last season, when Nicolas Jackson saw red at Newcastle, Chelsea were beaten, and the race for a Champions League place was went right down to the wire.",
      "Against Arsenal, Chelsea battled valiantly with 10 players. A point gained? Or was it two dropped, given how they had started the derby with 11?",
      "There's a lot to like about the team Maresca has built at Chelsea - but they can be their own worst enemy and must keep the focus to maintain their positive start to the season at Leeds.Peter Smith",
      "Brighton vs Aston Villa - Wednesday, kick-off 7.30pm",
      "Brighton's unbeaten home record faces its toughest test yet with the visit of in-form Aston Villa.",
      "Both sides started the campaign slowly, earning just one win between them from their opening five games, but now they're firmly in the race for European football.",
      "Villa recorded their fifth clean sheet of the season on Sunday and have the second-best defensive record in the division, although at the other end of the pitch, they're not having so much joy.",
      "They're second bottom for xG while Ollie Watkins has scored just once and was dropped for the victory at Wolves, with Donyell Malen preferred. The quick turnaround may see Watkins reintroduced from the start.",
      "There's been no such issues for Brighton striker Danny Welbeck, who has only been getting better at 35. His seven goals, combined with the efforts of Yankuba Minteh, have powered Fabian Hurzeler's side up the table.",
      "The winger has the second-most assists and touches in the opposition box in the league, with only Jeremy Doku and Mohammed Kudus having completed more dribbles. Villa's defence will have to be at its best.David Richardson",
      "Man Utd vs West Ham - Thursday, kick-off 8pm",
      "Manchester United may have picked up a crucial away win at Selhurst Park on Sunday, but Old Trafford will be expecting far more come Thursday night.",
      "The embarrassment that was the defeat to 10-man Everton will still be at the forefront of the minds of the fans and Ruben Amorim.",
      "The performance and the way Everton kept out a limp Red Devils provides Nuno Espirito Santo with the blueprint for how to get a result. That means there has to be a marked change from the hosts, perhaps even in personnel.",
      "United are expected to dominate the ball against the team who have had less possession in all but two of their away Premier League games this term. The anomalies being against promoted sides.",
      "Amorim will need players on the pitch who can break down the Hammers. That may present an opportunity to Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The 20-year-old has only been afforded 171 minutes in the Premier League this season. It is a far cry from the role he had at the time of scoring the winning goal in the 2024 FA Cup final.",
      "However, United have consistently struggled with breaking down low blocks and Amorim won't change his system.",
      "If his stubbornness on the front is going to persist, the dice needs to be rolled one way or another.",
      "There is a question as to whether the defensive presence of Casemiro is as vital for this game compared to against the likes of Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle later this month.",
      "Keeping the Brazilian fresh for those must be a priority, so the door may open for Mainoo to make his first league start of the season and show once and for all he is deserving of more from Amorim heading into 2026.",

      "Mason Mount saved Manchester United from a further inquest when he fired home in a  2-1 comeback victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.",
      "The midfielder rifled in from a well-worked set-piece after being teed up by Bruno Fernandes.",
      "That goal, Mount's second of the season, came minutes after Joshua Zirkzee ended a year-long wait for a Premier League goal with a finish from what looked like an impossible angle.",
      "With a combined xG of 0.05, United completed a second-half turnaround in a game that, before the halftime whistle, offered very little hope for Ruben Amorim's side. The Portuguese boss was critical of their display in the early exchanges in his post-match, saying his side \"cannot play like that in the Premier League\".",
      "Crystal Palace:  Henderson (4), Munoz (5), Richards (6), Lacroix (6), Guehi (6), Mitchell (5), Wharton (6), Kamada (6), Pino (6), Sarr (5), Mateta (7)\n\n\nSubs:  Lerma (5), Nketiah (4), Uche (6), Hughes (6), Devenny (6).\n\n\n Man Utd:  Lammens (5), Dalot (5), Yoro (3), De Ligt (6), Shaw (6), Amad (6), Casemiro (5), Bruno Fernandes (7), Mbeumo (6), Mount (8), Zirkzee (8).\n\n\nSubs:  Mazraoui (6), Martinez (n/a), Dorgu (n/a), Mainoo (n/a)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match:  Mason Mount",
      "United were outclassed and outfought by Palace in the opening 45 minutes despite showing early promise when Dean Henderson denied Casemiro an early goal with a smart stop. Amorim watched on as his side generated just 0.01 expected goals without set-pieces.",
      "In a run of play that summed up United's sorry showing, Leny Yoro clumsily brought down Jean-Philippe Mateta in the area to give away a sure penalty.",
      "Having initially sent Senne Lammens the wrong way, Mateta had to do the same again after being adjudged to have touched the ball twice by VAR.",
      "More chances followed for Palace in the first half with Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw called upon to make huge interventions to prevent further damage.",
      "Amorim could be seen anxiously pacing in the mixed zone during the half-time break, taking a moment before what would have been his most significant talk to his players, hoping to avoid a repeat of Monday's hopeless showing against the 10 men of Everton.",
      "Whatever he said worked, helping United end a run of three without a win to move up to sixth, above Palace who are denied a place in the top four. Amorim also becomes the first United boss to win at Selhurst Park since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2020.",
      "Manchester United must figure out a way to overcome their Jekyll and Hyde complex. Ruben Amorim's side were nowhere near it in the first half at Crystal Palace.",
      "They lacked energy, belief and any ideas as they were under the pump at Selhurt Park. But then a moment of magic from Joshua Zirkzee changed it all.",
      "Across the season, United's starts have been fairly positive and where United have typically found their joy.",
      "However, they have failed to sustain their early displays. In recent performances, United have been far more effective in the second half; their problem, though, is their slow starts.",
      "The defensive numbers are where the difference is stark. Across United's first 11 games this season, in the first half, they had an expected goals against of 5.71. This changed in the second half where that number nearly doubled to 11.07.",
      "However, in their last two games, at Palace and in defeat to Everton, United have a first-half expected goals against of 1.26, while after the break, this number massively decreases to 0.26.",
      "It's important to note that in both games United fell behind in the first half, therefore were naturally more attack-minded in the second period.",
      "However, there's a clue in the numbers that Amorim's team are a different side when they go ahead early, like they did eight times in their first 11 league games, compared to when they concede early on.",
      "Perhaps there are signs of complacency in their leads that Amorim has to fix while also finding a way to motivate faster starts.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"It [Joshua Zirkzee's goal] was really important.",
      "\"But again, it was not just the goal, even the runs behind. In the first half, he struggled in the duels, and he won some duels in the second half.",
      "\"And we improved a lot because of the quality of Josh in the second half. And that is important for him to understand. That is not just the goal. We played better because Josh played better in the second half.",
      "\"I just said to the players [at half time] we need to be more alive, and you can feel that. So if you are more alive, you are in more places, you are near the ball more often and I think everyone did that.",
      "\"But we also need to understand that the opponent was tired in the second half. And when you increase the rhythm and the opponent gets tired a little bit, suffers a goal right away, you feel that we had the control of the game and that's it.\"",
      "Asked whether he felt his side would come back, Amorim said:",
      "\"I felt that because I had the feeling, if you see the last plays of the game, they were struggling so much to take the ball out of the box.",
      "\"And you can feel it, the way they move, that they were getting tired for the second half.",
      "\"We talked about that and again, our pace in the first half, intensity, we cannot play like that in the Premier League.",
      "\"So we increased that and I had the feeling, we had the feeling that if we score one goal, this is going to change completely.\"",
      "\"Ismaila Sarr has been, by far and away, one of Crystal Palace's standout players since he arrived at the club from Marseille in August 2024. The numbers speak for themselves: 66 appearances, 20 goals, 10 assists.",
      "\"But he may well have played his last game of the year for Oliver Glasner's side.",
      "\"The Senegal forward went down under a challenge from Luke Shaw inside the first four minutes at Selhurst Park and made a motion with his hand as if to suggest he had twisted his ankle. He lasted just over half an hour more, before being replaced by Eddie Nketiah.",
      "\"Asked about Sarr's condition in his post-match press conference, Glasner said: \"The ankle is quite swollen, so I think he will miss a few games, maybe the whole time until he goes to AFCON.\"",
      "\"Senegal start their AFCON campaign on December 23, when they face Botswana in Tangier, Morocco. If Pape Thiaw's side make it as far as the final, Sarr would not return to domestic action until late January or early February.",
      "\"Glasner has already made it clear Palace must strengthen in January, with an attacker at the top of his shopping list - and now it appears to be even more imperative than before.\"",
      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner:",
      "\"What disappointed me? Almost everything.",
      "\"Conceding two goals from set-plays, three of the last four goals being conceded from set-plays. That makes it really frustrating, because I think we played a very good first half, and deserved to have the lead.",
      "\"I can't remember a big chance from open play in the whole game.",
      "\"We are not fresh enough in many games and the energy level dropped, but I think we made it just harder for us because we conceded these two goals.",
      "\"In the situation we are in now, it looked like it was tough, but I think, at the end, we tried everything.",
      "\"We had a few set-plays as well, an even better situation, the free-kick. But we missed it, they took it, and so that's why we lost it.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United are \"soft\" defending their own box, adding there is little time afforded at the club to find consistency and wins - so they must happen now.",
      "At Nottingham Forest on November 1, Man Utd conceded twice in two minutes at the start of the second half. They went on to draw 2-2, the same result they had against Tottenham the following week.",
      "Against Everton on Monday Night Football, David Moyes' side - who played with 10 players for most of the game - scored with their only shot on target to beat Man Utd 1-0.",
      "This season, Amorim's side have scored and conceded the same amount of goals - 19 each - and the head coach has criticised his team's defensive play.",
      "Speaking ahead of Sunday's Premier League game against Crystal Palace, he said: \"We have some results of not letting a lot of teams in the final third, but we are being really soft near the box so we need to improve that.",
      "\"Especially against Forest - we took a lot of crosses, we didn't press well in that moment. Against Everton, they had 10 men, we cannot suffer a goal but we suffered a goal with the only shot on target.",
      "\"We are there near the box, we have more players than Everton, we should be better. More strong on the duels and Crystal Palace are very strong on duels and when they have to defend, they are really strong.",
      "\"Those things can change how you see teams, but we need to improve in a lot of things. We need to close our goals because we are scoring goals. It's an issue, it's not about the defenders, but about the team and the way we feel our danger near the box.",
      "\"It's not just the numbers. It's Nottingham Forest, to suffer two goals in two minutes after half-time, that's a concern.",
      "\"You are controlling the game against Tottenham and you have the same amount of guys when they score. We are in a good position, but we need to be better and more aggressive. That is my biggest concern.",
      "\"It's the way you see the game and understand that if you're better in this moment, you should have more points and the narrative will be different.\"",
      "After a run of three successive Premier League wins, Man Utd have not won a league game in November, and will be hoping to put this right at Selhurst Park this weekend.",
      "Amorim also pointed out that the pressure to win at Man Utd is more intense than at any other club, and it will take time to find consistency with wins - something not afforded to many.",
      "He added: \"I think it's clear it will take time especially in the Premier League when every club is prepared for everything. They are improving a lot.",
      "\"We need to win now. If not, something is going to change and we know that. We just need to be better.",
      "\"Look at our games - could we have won last game? Yes. We had everything to win it. Same thing against Forest, they were suffering, we had three unbeaten and we didn't win. Tottenham the same.",
      "\"It's the urgency of winning. It's not good to be at United and not winning - there is no time here. That's why I'm frustrated all the time. We know we need time, but there is no time here so let's do everything to win games.\"",
      "There were also questions over Kobbie Mainoo, who is yet to find himself with a regular starting spot at Man Utd. He was one of England's shining lights at Euro 2024, but his lack of game time at club level has seen him on the periphery of contention for next summer's World Cup.",
      "On Monday, he played half an hour against Everton, and while Amorim does not rule him out as a starter in the future, his focus is on positive results.",
      "\"This is a team sport. I have a lot of players in my squad, they want to be in the World Cup,\" he said.",
      "\"I put Kobbie [on against Everton] because he's really good near the box. Between Bruno [Fernandes] and him, he can find spaces near the box and score goals so that was my idea.",
      "\"I will use Kobbie and the rest of them to try and win. I'm not focused on one individual, I'm focused on all my players and I know how special it is to play at a World Cup.",
      "\"My job is to win as a team and focus as a team. Kobbie Mainoo is in the same situation as the other guys - if I feel that's best to win the game, I will do it.",
      "\"I see him as a starter like the other guys. I just have to make a choice and in the end, it's not been Kobbie. In the future, I don't know. I just want to win games, I don't care who is playing.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim dismisses direct comparisons between his Man Utd and Crystal Palace ahead of Sunday's trip to Selhurst Park because, he says, 'we play in a different way' despite shaping up in same 3-4-2-1 formation but he admits Oliver Glasner's side 'are doing things better than us'",
      "Friday 28 November 2025 16:38, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United need another attacking wing-back like Amad Diallo to become better playing in his system.",
      "The United boss came under fire for refusing to adapt in Monday's dismal defeat to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford, bringing his 3-4-2-1 formation back into the spotlight ahead of Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace, who have enjoyed success playing in the same shape.",
      "Amorim, chasing a goal against Everton after Idrissa Gueye's red card, replaced left wing-back Patrick Dorgu with Diogo Dalot, naturally a full-back, in a like-for-like change that left United devoid of any attacking threat down that side.",
      "Palace's attack-minded wing-backs, Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell, have been a cornerstone of Oliver Glasner's success, while United only have Amad Diallo in that mould and Amorim admits that will have to change for the team to improve.",
      "Asked if wing-back is an area he wants to strengthen, Amorim said: \"We need time to improve the characteristics of the team. I've said that over the last year.",
      "\"To give an example, in the last game [against Everton], we should have an Amad with the right foot to put on the other side to play against 10 men.",
      "\"It is these characteristics that in time we will try to get to be a better team. If we are the perfect set-up to play in this way, not yet. But like any team, we need time to put the right characteristics into every position.\"",
      "The United boss dismissed direct comparisons with Palace ahead of Sunday's game but acknowledged Glasner's side are outperforming them at the moment as they sit in 10th.",
      "Although Palace are fifth in the table, they are only two points better off than United, who could go above them with a win at Selhust Park.",
      "\"We play in a different way. You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",
      "Palace possess a top wing-back in Daniel Munoz, and the Colombia international has previously spoken of his desire to play for Manchester United.",
      "Speaking earlier this month to AS, he said: \"I think there's a lot of talk about one club or another. For me, it would be a dream to play for one of those clubs, whether it's Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester United.",
      "\"I think I'm working towards that; every day I give it my all so that maybe one day I can catch the attention of these clubs.",
      "\"Right now, I'm focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. I'm not really aware of what's being said; I don't have any information about whether these teams want me or are interested in me.",
      "\"We'll see when the winter transfer window approaches.\"",
      "Glasner defended Amorim's system ahead of the game and said he had seen an improvement in United this season.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front. Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Amorim admits he would have preferred to bring on a more attacking alternative to Dalot at Everton with no other options available on his bench, but stuck with the same shape nonetheless.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he said. \"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Luke Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "At Sporting, Amorim's wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table? It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach.",

      "Sunday 30 November 2025 09:19, UK",
      "Just when there was a bit of momentum at Manchester United, and doubts about Ruben Amorim's much-maligned formation were vanishing - then came the loss to Everton.",
      "It was a game that put the Amorim project back to square one in terms of how much faith there is in this specific era. Gary Neville said the complacency shown by United will erode confidence in the team - but there was just as much criticism about the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Despite playing over 75 minutes with an extra player after Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Amorim chose to stick with his preferred formation - keeping three centre-backs and two wing-backs on the pitch.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" asked Neville, while Jamie Carragher added: \"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that. You don't need three [centre-backs] there.\"",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Crystal Palace, where Oliver Glasner has made a success of that 3-4-2-1 formation. The Eagles sit in the top five - where United want to be - having won a trophy via the FA Cup, which has eluded Amorim in his year in charge thus far.",
      "Glasner's formation has even survived the departures of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, highlighting how the system thrives on more than a few top-level players - it is a collective structure that works. How United need that at the moment.",
      "\"We have found a system where we are very balanced, where we can threaten the opposition goal and also be very consistent in our defence,\" said Glasner last month. \"That's why we stick to it.\"",
      "So why does it bring success for Palace, but less so for Man Utd? Using the Palace boss' own words, we take a look at Glasner's formation from back to front.",
      "The back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi have marshalled things brilliantly in front of Dean Henderson - one of the statistically best goalkeepers in the division.",
      "Palace have the Premier League's second-best defence in terms of goals conceded - and are one of only two backlines to let in a single-digit goal tally after a dozen Premier League games. The other team is league leaders Arsenal.",
      "The central areas are the most important part of the pitch for Glasner, as it is the most vulnerable area for any side. \"The centre determines the game. It starts with the back three - you're talking about the core,\" he says.",
      "One of the reasons three centre-backs is a good system in the modern Premier League era is the way wide centre-backs protect the 'half space'.",
      "It is the area where most dangerous attacks emerge from via defence-breaking passes or runs - these areas are also described as the 'pockets'.",
      "As Glasner says: \"The half runs, which is where most of the assists are coming from, in defence you have to protect these areas.\" And Palace appear to have the right profiles in those centre-back positions.",
      "No Premier League defender has more interceptions this season than both Richards and Lacroix, while only six defenders have won more possession in the defensive third this season than Palace captain Guehi.",
      "Even Neville spoke about the importance of positioning the three centre-backs on Monday night against Everton. \"Matthijs de Ligt is much more dominant and certain in that central role,\" he said. \"When Harry Maguire plays, De Ligt goes into the right channel where he gets caught out and doesn't look comfortable.\"",
      "Palace have perfected their back three, but on the basis of recent displays, United need a bit more work.",
      "The four in Palace's midfield are divided into two areas: the wing-backs and the two sitting midfielders.",
      "The flying wing-backs of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell are critical to this Palace team because of the intensity they bring.",
      "Munoz is the most intense player in the Premier League, clocking nearly 14.5km per game at high intensity this season - nearly 1.5km more than the next-best player.",
      "It is not a singular thing to Munoz, it is part of Glasner's instructions. That's because Mitchell, on the opposite flank, sits fifth for current Premier League players in the same metric. Palace are the only team in the Premier League with two players in the top dozen top-flight players in this category.",
      "What is more striking is how Palace's wing-backs compare to Man Utd's wing-backs. For example, Munoz runs further per game at high intensity than Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai combined.",
      "Meanwhile, Mitchell is streets clear of what United's left-wing-back options, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, produce.",
      "Then comes the importance of the two sitting midfielders - rotated between Adam Wharton, Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma - who set the tone for Palace's play.",
      "\"The central midfielders, we call them the quarter-backs,\" says Glasner. \"They are responsible for the speed of our attacks, if we go forward or keep possession. So they are important.\"",
      "Palace and United's midfield set-up is similar. In Wharton, the Eagles have their own version of Bruno Fernandes - a player who sits and tries to break the opposition's lines.",
      "\"That's why the manager wants me there,\" said Man Utd captain Fernandes on Monday night. \"To have more of the ball and control the tempo of the team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] knows I can run a lot, press high and get my body back there when we need to get to the box and defend.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the other sitting midfielder - Kamada for Palace or Casemiro at Man Utd - sits and shares defensive duties with the other player.",
      "For Palace, the system works defensively as well as offensively. Kamada sits in the top five midfielders this season for tackles won per 90, with a slightly better record than Chelsea's Moises Caicedo.",
      "But for United, how Casemiro and Fernandes cope in midfield as a two has been much-maligned. They were cut wide open at times against Everton on Monday, with Gueye showing signs of frailty within the opening minutes.",
      "But even after the Everton midfielder's red card, the Toffees still had joy playing around United's midfield two - with the winning goal coming from direct passing through the middle of the pitch.",
      "But it is not just Palace's sitting midfielders who play Glasner's side progress the ball centrally - the two No 10s also help to create overloads in the most important area of the pitch.",
      "\"We try to play with the two No 10s narrow, with the striker - so we can maybe have eight players in the centre to combine together,\" says Glasner. Those eight players being three centre-backs, two sitting midfielders, two attacking midfielders and one striker.",
      "\"You can't pass with one touch if players are 30 or 40 yards away from each other in the distances,\" Glasner added. \"You need connections on the pitch.\"",
      "The two No 10s, normally Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino in this Palace team, are helping them to break through the middle of the pitch by creating a four-man box with the sitting midfielders. No matter if you face a team with two or three in midfield, you will always have an overload.",
      "But they also assist in pinning opposition teams back. \"Some teams mark our No 10s with their No 6s [defensive midfielders] - so they're pretty much playing with a back six,\" says Glasner.",
      "If a busy striker like Jean-Philippe Mateta can occupy multiple centre-backs at once - as he tends to do - then the two No 10s need to be marked by midfielders. If they aren't, the likes of Sarr and Pino have more space.",
      "All those eight players being central can create a very congested area in the middle of the park, but Glasner has plans for that. \"If the opposition closes the middle, then somebody can drop out and you can overload the wing,\" he says.",
      "Palace's front three is a perfect system set up by the right profiles. \"You need pocket players, you need runners - the mix makes it,\" he says. The pocket players are Sarr and Pino, the runners are Munoz and Mitchell.",
      "It allows Mateta to do what he does best - be physical and hold the ball up. Mateta ranks top for the number of hold-ups in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"You need the right players for it,\" says Glasner about his attack. \"You can't ask all the players making runs in behind if they are used to playing in the pockets.\"",
      "United tried to address these forward areas in the transfer window, forking out big fees for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They fit the United structure in places, as has been seen this season in bright attacking moments. But any injuries - such as Cunha and Sesko's this past week - and there are holes. And they are holes that Palace do not seem to have.",

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",

      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",
