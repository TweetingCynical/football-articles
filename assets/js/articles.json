      "Manchester United are set to sign young star Godwill Kukonki to his first professional contract. The 17-year-old will put pen to paper on a deal at Old Trafford having made a promising start under Ruben Amorim, per the MEN.",
      "The towering youngster stands at 6ft 5ins and has already left an impression on United's Portuguese head coach. Kokonki is said to have impressed Amorim in the boss' first training session and travelled with the squad to face Ipswich.",
      "The teenager went on to make the squad against Arsenal in December and made squads in the Europa League when United defeated Lyon. Kukonki also made the end of season tour of Asia and started in the 3-1 win over Hong Kong and came off the bench in defeat to ASEAN All-Stars.",
      "The England under-17 international can play in the centre of defence or at left-back. Kukonki played 14 times for United's under-18 side and in the Premier League 2 play-offs as United defeated Everton and West Ham before losing in the semi-final against rivals Manchester City.",
      "Amorim was quickly impressed with Kukonki's physicality upon his arrival and commended the defender's maturity. \"He's 16,\" said the boss to MUTV.",
      "\"But he impressed me a lot, so it's also a sign to the youth players that they can be here.",
      "\"If something happened with the first-team squad, they have to step up and I think he's ready, he's very adult to handle the demands of the Premier League.\"",
      "After making the bench for the first time against Arsenal, Kukonki said on social media: \"Valuable experience with the squad. Thanks to the manager and the staff for this opportunity. Thank God.\"",
      "Kukonki's early opportunities came amid a major injury crisis in defence for United after Amorim's arrival. Lisandro Martinez, Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw all picked up issues to put them on the sidelines.",
      "It is said Kukonki's ambition is to push for his United debut despite his tender age after making his way through the age groups at the club. The Stoke-on-Trent born prospect has already drawn early comparisons with Manchester City defender Josko Gvardiol.",
      "Kukonki could still become the youngest defender to ever represent United at a senior level in the league. No United defender has ever played in the Premier League before turning 18.",

      "It means there's no European football at Old Trafford but, throughout the dismal run of results, there was always those highlighted that Amorim had not enjoyed prolonged time with his players on the training pitch and was working with a squad he'd inherited.",
      "Those frustrations were magnified by the fact Amorim played a unique 3-4-3 system, which he didn't have the players to do, yet stuck to his beliefs anyway. Ashley Young insists now is the time for the manager to lay down an early marker to prove he is the man to take the club forward.",
      "All the excuses that were used last term are no longer applicable and the ex-United man wants to see marked improvement on last year.",
      "\"I think it has been said you'll have to give him time, how many transfer window? Who knows. You've got to set your marker as soon as you start this season. I don't think anyone can give him anymore excuses, it is now or never. He's got to have a good pre-season, workout what his best team is, what players fit into the system. Unless he's going to change, but you can't see him change the formation.\"",
      "The frustration for Amorim will be the lack of players he's got through the door thus far. Only Matheus Cunha has been signed with the impressive Brazilian joining from Wolves. The club have since turned their attention to Bryan Mbeumo but have seen a number of bids turned down by Brentford.",
      "They begin their Premier League campaign with a heavyweight clash against Arsenal on August 17 and Amorim will hope to have more new arrivals to pick from with the deficiencies in his squad continually exposed throughout the last campaign.",

      "Former Liverpool defender Markus Babbel believes Florian Wirtz is the signing of the summer, despite the enormous fee it took to prise him away from Bayer Leverkusen. The Reds stunned the Premier League and the rest of Europe when they bagged the much-coveted German superstar.",
      "The Premier League champions were eager to make a statement after sealing their 20th top-flight crown and so pulled out all the stops to seal a deal for the ambitious 22-year-old.",
      "After months of speculation, and fighting off the likes of Bayern Munich and Manchester City to land his signature, Wirtz joined Liverpool last month in a deal that could be worth a British-record fee of £116 million.",
      "Babbel, 52, is a former Germany international, who played for Liverpool from 2000-2004 and helped the Anfield side under the late Gerard Houllier win four major trophies.",
      "Despite the eye-watering fee, the four-time Bundesliga champion believes the deal represents excellent value for his former club due to the Wirtz's clear class - claiming that even if Liverpool's bitter rivals Manchester United signed the playmaker, he would still echo the same sentiments.",
      "\"Florian Wirtz is easily the best signing of the summer transfer window so far,\" Babbel told Gameshub. “That was the deal of the year in my opinion and that isn’t just because the Premier League champions signed him; if Man United had made the deal, it would be no different – he’s a fantastic player that will add so much value to the team.",
      "\"No one was talking about Liverpool getting the deal done either! Everyone assumed he’d join Bayern Munich, Man City or Real Madrid. But it was always clear to me from the start that he’d be heading to Liverpool to play under Arne Slot and alongside some of the best players in Europe, such as Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah.\"",
      "He added: \"I would be surprised if a club managed to pull off a signing as good as Wirtz to Liverpool. For me, there’s no doubt that he’s the best signing of the window.\"",

      "In terms of exits, Emi Martinez is expected to leave Villa Park this window. The 32-year-old World Cup winner has been a goliath between the sticks for Villa, but Manchester United and Atletico Madrid have been mooted as likely destinations.",
      "Should Martinez, who left the Villans' final home game in tears last season in what looked like a goodbye, head out the exit door, then securing the signature of a competent replacement will be a priority.",
      "Chevalier is valued at around £40m and kept 11 clean sheets in Ligue 1 last season, the second most in the French top flight, as his side finished in fifth.",
      "One area where the Villans are not lacking is at left-back. Lucas Digne arrived from Everton in January 2022, and while at times he has looked sub-par, his set-piece abilities and pinpoint crosses can be lethal.",
      "Last summer, Ian Maatsen was brought in from Chelsea. He had spent the previous campaign on loan with Borussia Dortmund, where he made the Champions League final.",
      "Emery rotated both, favouring Digne, who seems to come alive in the face of competition, last season, but rumours suggest the French full-back could be leaving Villa Park in the coming months, with Atletico Madrid a potential suitor says The Times.",
      "The 31-year-old is in the final year of his current contract, and while he has been consistent for Villa, getting his wages off the books and receiving a fee for a player who may walk on a free next summer could be smart, considering that Maatsen is waiting in the wings.",
      "With Jhon Duran sold in January, Villa favourite Ollie Watkins led the line for most of the season and mustered 16 league goals, an impressive total despite being three less than he managed the previous term.",
      "Unlike Digne, he is contracted to Villa until 2028, but, having reached the age of 29 and with the likes of United sniffing around with big money to offer, he has been linked with a move away from the West Midlands.",
      "A fee of £60m has been bandied around, but the role that Watkins plays under Emery, not even taking into consideration his goal output, should render him relatively priceless. Watkins is a workaholic.",
      "While his finishing can leave a lot to be desired at times, the ground he covers not just through the centre but also out wide is vital to Villa's play. With no Rashford to force him onto the bench, he could string together some impressive performances next season in Europe and domestically, while replacing him with an unknown entity could hinder what is a vital campaign.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "The summer transfer window has kicked into gear, with bids flying in left, right and centre. Arsenal are pushing forward with a £50million move for Chelsea winger Noni Madueke after hitting a wall in talks with Sporting CP for Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "Their north London rivals Tottenham have sealed the £55m arrival of Mohammed Kudus. And Manchester United are still yet to reach an agreement with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "With seven weeks left before deadline day, there's plenty of time to negotiate down asking prices. After all, you don't get if you don't ask.",
      "Where else can you start but with Arsenal's laughable £40m+£1 stunt. After hearing about a supposed release clause in Luis Suarez's Liverpool contract, the Gunners submitted an offer that was one Great British pound over the sum in order to activate it in 2013.",
      "They were left with egg on their face when it turned out that it only required a potential move to be merely discussed, and wasn't a fully-fledged release clause. The bid was therefore swiftly rejected.",
      "It was much to the humour of Reds owner John W. Henry, whose iconic tweet remains on the platform, now X, to this day: \"What do you think they're smoking over there at Emirates?\" Suarez, meanwhile, was convinced to commit to Anfield for another year by Steven Gerrard, before joining Barcelona in a £75m deal the following year.",
      "Doing business with one of your closest and fiercest rivals is never going to be straightforward, and there's often going to be an extra charge compared to if the player is being sold abroad. But Chelsea went the other way when they made a very cheeky attempt to sign Luka Modric from Spurs in 2011.",
      "They opened with a bid of £22m for Modric, who'd moved to White Hart Lane from Dinamo Zagreb for £16.6m three years earlier. His boss Harry Redknapp fumed: \"That is ridiculous. There are people being sold for £20m who are not fit to lace Luka's boots.\"",
      "Stamford Bridge chiefs did respond by upping their offer. But they were unable to hijack Real Madrid's move 12 months later, with the Croatian heading to the Spanish capital for around £30m – a sum that proved to be a steal.",
      "Clint Dempsey was coming off the season of his life in the summer of 2012 having scored 23 goals and registered seven assists in all competitions for Fulham. So you can forgive them for not rolling over when Liverpool came calling to the tune of just £3m.",
      "The Reds were very much in the midst of their banter era and their refusal to go any further than £4m once again left their rivals laughing at them. Although they did maybe dodge something of a bullet.",
      "Dempsey ultimately joined Spurs on deadline day for £6m. A return of 12 goals and seven assists was respectable enough, but he headed home to his native USA after just one season to join Seattle Sounders.",
      "Perhaps this should have been taken as a sign of things to come... United have been quite frankly tragic in the transfer market for over a decade, dating back to Sir Alex Ferguson's departure.",
      "When David Moyes took the reins, he was keen to bring with him some of Everton's most prized assets. His former club were in no mood to help him out when they received a £28m offer – for both Marouane Fellaini and Leighton Baines!",
      "\"Those bids were immediately rejected out of hand as derisory and insulting,\" a spokesperson for the Toffees slammed. It says it all about United's transfer nous that they then signed just Fellaini on deadline day for just £500k less than the joint bid.",
      "While all of the above have been intentionally insulting, Manchester City can be slightly excused here on the basis that they accidentally bid £30m for Lionel Messi. Although it does make it all the more embarrassing on their part.",
      "Former City executive Garry Cook explained the mix-up in ‘The Manchester City Years’ by Gary James. Sheikh Mansour had just completed his £210m takeover of the club in August 2009, with chiefs – located in Manchester, London and Abu Dhabi – scrambling to sign a forward before the window slammed shut.",
      "After failed swoops for Fernando Torres and Dimitar Berbatov, Cook explained: “He (an executive) made a comment like, ‘It’s all getting messy.’ Via the telephones and other communication lines, this somehow translated into, ‘Get Messi.’ An offer was made for Lionel Messi of about £30million. Needless to say, it was rejected.”",
      "Cherry picking a relegated club's top talent is always a fun exercise for the Premier League's big boys, who know full well the selling club are bent over a barrel. But there's still a line – and Spurs well and truly crossed that two years ago.",
      "Leicester City had one of the most stacked squads a relegated Premier League team has ever seen, and James Maddison and Harvey Barnes were both destined for big moves. £50m for both of them, however, was never going to fly.",
      "Maddison did end up signing on the ever-shameless Daniel Levy's dotted line, but he cost £40m alone, while Newcastle signed Barnes for £38m. Hey, you were nearly two thirds of the way there lads.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Now, Gyokeres, who is said to have already agreed personal terms with Arsenal, faces disciplinary action. And Sporting do not appear willing to allow the player's decision to ease their own negotiations with the Gunners which have already required a cooling off period.",
      "Nottingham Forest captain Ryan Yates has spoken out on Tottenham’s attempts to sign Morgan Gibbs-White, who could see those at the City Ground launch a legal fight.",
      "He said: “I feel as though that, until something is done, until a player signs on the dotted line for another club, it is just speculation. I don’t know what more to say on the Morgan situation, because it has all happened so quickly.",
      "“As a player, you just accept it is a business. I do not know the ins and outs of what has happened, because it all happened so quickly. Morgan is a fantastic player and somebody who has been hugely influential for us in the Premier League. But this is football.”",

      "Juventus have agreed a £17.3m deal with United for Jadon Sancho as the player looks for a way out of Old Trafford following Chelsea's decision to send him back after his loan move.",
      "According to La Stampa the Red Devils were holding out for closer to £25m for the former Borussia Dortmund man, who cost them £70m back in 2021, but have decided to ease on their demands in a bid to get the flop out the door.",
      "Sancho refused to budge on his £350,000-a-week wage when Chelsea considered signing him, meaning they pulled out of a deal as they refused to pay that much. His salary could still prove a major sticking point when it comes to negotiations with Juventus."

      "Haaland and Kane are cause for great regret. United missed out on the former in December 2019 and did not have the nerve to go for the latter two years ago. Since Haaland moved to Borussia Dortmund, the only reputable strikers United have bought were Edinson Cavani and Cristiano Ronaldo, aged 33 and 36 at the time of their arrivals. Each only cut it for one season.",

      "Zahavi has long had links with Chelsea and Gol International represents the club's forward, Christopher Nkunku. Chelsea floated the possibility of a swap deal involving Nkunku and Garnacho again last month but United are not keen on the France international.",
      "High-profile intermediaries occasionally become involved in negotiations to engineer a transfer if representatives are inexperienced. Jorge Mendes played a small but significant role in Bruno Fernandes' move to United from Sporting in January 2020.",
      "Cambeiro has represented Garnacho since he moved to United from Atletico Madrid's academy in October 2020. Cambeiro and De Lucas, who spent one season at Chelsea in 2002-03, visited Stamford Bridge in January when the Club World Cup winners considered submitting a bid for Garnacho.",
      "Chelsea have signed winger Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund and are on the verge of selling Noni Madueke to Arsenal. Garnacho is one of four wingers United want to sell before the transfer window closes on September 1.",

      "Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are also planning to leave United this summer. Rashford has conducted individual sessions at United's Carrington training complex and arrived eight minutes after head coach Ruben Amorim left on Friday. Rashford arrived via the rear entrance whereas Amorim drove out through the front.",
      "Antony is prepared to take a pay cut to end his three-year stint at United while Sancho's representatives have held discussions with Italian clubs."

The most important thing for me is to play for a club that really wants me. It’s one of the biggest leagues (Premier League) in Europe. I spent several years there without being able to play a single match. So, of course, it’s something I’d like to do. It would be great revenge.",

      "However, Garnacho's aim is to stay in the Premier League and is unwilling to move to the Middle East at this stage.",
      "There is a clear reason behind that, and it all stems from the valuation Sporting have for Gyokeres.",
      "The Swede was under the impression that should a bid of £52m plus £8.67m in add-ons was to be submitted, he would be allowed to leave the Lisbon club.",
      "While Varandas agrees that holding out for his £85m release clause would not be possible, he is also unwilling to let the striker leave for that little.",

      "Sporting president Frederico Varandas sent a clear message to the striker on Saturday:",
      "We're calm. Everything can be solved with the closure of the market, a hefty fine and an apology to the group. If they don't want to pay Viktor's fair market value, we'll be very comfortable with that for the next three years. If the geniuses who are devising this strategy think that this puts pressure on me to make it easier for him to leave, not only are they completely wrong, but they are also making it more complicated for the player to leave. No one is above the interests of the club. Whoever they are.",

      "Bryan Mbuemo is exactly the sort of player Ruben Amorim wants at Manchester United, according to his former coach. The United manager is looking to make Mbuemo his second major signing of the summer after Wolves forward Matheus Cunha, with negotiations for the Brentford star ongoing.",
      "United know what they are getting in a proven Premier League talent and Mbuemo may see similarities in Amorim to the coach he had back at the beginning of his playing career. Rui Almeida trained him when he was a teenager coming through the youth team at Troyes in France's second division.",
      "The 19-year-old would last only a year there before Brentford snapped him up in the Championship, and Almeida did not need long to see the qualities that would stand Mbuemo out among teammates.",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",
      "Fans can order their Men's, Women's and Kid's shirt today.",
      "\"In my opinion, he had two or three things to stand out - his physical capacities but also he thought really fast - before the ball arrived to him he already had two options in his mind. From a young age, we told him that each training had to be like a final and he caught that and got that for his life.",
      "\"He trained like every session was really important. That maybe separated him and took him to another level from other talents that we had at his age.",
      "\"His decision-making in high pressure was really different and we saw that. After that, he was fast and dribbled and his shooting was very good also but at the time we told him, Bryan you always play right winger because he had a great left foot but I told him the challenge if he wanted to improve was to learn to play in the other positions.",
      "\"We put him as a second striker and a a striker and from there he has done so well at Brentford. If Ruben takes him, he will play all the sides of the 3-4-3.\"",
      "Almeida has had a varied coaching career, as may be expected for somebody who began at just 26. A few years in his native Portugal were followed by seven in France before jobs further afield in Algeria, Saudi Arabia and most recently Morocco.",
      "He is six months into life at Difaa El Jadidi, and enjoying life in a country that is only growing interest in football ahead of hosting the 2030 World Cup.",
      "\"I like the experience of the last six months and they invited me to stay,\" he said. \"With the World Cup coming, they are improving a lot of things. The league is very competitive, Morocco came third at the last World Cup even if many of the players are in different leagues like many countries, but recently the level is increasing. This year they will start eight new stadiums in the league so the facilities are improving.\"",
      "Almeida has always kept an eye out for the players he has coached along the way though, and has been thrilled to see how well Mbuemo has done in the Premier League. As United close in on a move, Almeida believes they will be signing a player who can combine well with Cunha as well as do the teamwork that is crucial to Amorim's ethos.",
      "\"Manchester United fans have been waiting for a title again for a long time so there will be pressure, and Bryan will need the team behind him to help him but he will also help the team to do good things. One thing that you always need and I see Bryan doing at Brentford is he is a team player.",
      "\"He's very good individually but he works a lot for the team, he runs a lot for the team and defends a lot for the team so I think he is a player that Ruben likes a lot.",
      "\"I also think he's a good complement for Cunha. Sometimes in teams you need good complement for players. They are different players and teams need that difference in the forwards.\""

      "The jury remains out on his position as manager after a difficult start to life in the Old Trafford dugout and after a lot of trust was placed in him ahead of the 2025/26 season, United have to have a strong transfer window.",
      "United have so far sealed the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, as well as teenagers Diego Leon and Enzo Kaya-Biyik, but are yet to sell and of their wantaway players.",
      "They have also seen two bids rejected for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo as they look to agree a deal with the Bees to sign the 25-year-old, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season.",
      "Cunha has been added to the squad, but Alejandro Garnacho and Marcus Rashford were at Amorim's disposal when he was appointed and they're not part of his plans for the new season.",
      "Antony and Tyrell Malacia were also at Amorim's disposal before leaving on loan to Real Betis and PSV respectively in the January window. Their returns to Carrington have been delayed as they look for new clubs.",
      "United finished 15th in the Premier League and, yet, they have a weaker squad in the third week of July than at the end of last season, which must concern Amorim behind closed doors.",
      "Simply put, United need to get a move on in the summer transfer window because they're close to letting Amorim down.",
      "There has been no breakthrough in negotiations with Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo and it's hoped he'll be on the plane to the USA. Another signing would be ideal by then to give Amorim time to work with his new additions, although sales are required to unlock funds for further incomings.",
      "Selling is just as important as buying in the transfer window and serious concerns will be raised if one of the five castaways (Garnacho, Rashford, Sancho, Antony and Malacia) aren't sold soon.",
      "After wrapping up the signing of Cunha so early on in the window, United would have hoped to have achieved more by now. Cunha had not officially finalised his move to Old Trafford by the time they submitted their opening offer for Mbeumo, highlighting just how keen they were to get their business done nice and early.",
      "It would have been unrealistic to suggest United could have got everything done by now, especially when sales are so important this summer, but they would have hoped for more than just Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "With the start of the pre-season tour now less than a fortnight away, supporters are within their rights to feel slightly concerned. United finished 15th last term and desperately need to add fresh blood to Amorim's squad.",
      "The longer this current lull persists, the more restless supporters will become. However, if United get a deal over the line for Mbeumo before too long and go on to secure the services of a striker, all should be forgiven.",
      "The signing of Matheus Cunha so early in the transfer window was an excellent start to United's summer business but since then everything has gone a bit stale.",
      "The wait for Bryan Mbeumo continues to lumber on and the longer that wait continues the more frustration will grow among supporters.",
      "United need to sell players to buy beyond Mbeumo too and while elite forwards continue to fall off the market, the delay in offloading the likes of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia becomes more damaging.",
      "Something needs to give this week and United need to make progress on a signing or a sale to kickstart their business before Saturday's opening pre-season friendly against Leeds United."

      "Mantato is considered a rising star in the academy and the MEN reported in November that his chances of breaking into the first-team had been increased by Amorim's arrival because he has the ideal blend of qualities to play at wing-back.",
      "Mantato formerly played at left-back in academy fixtures, but he's gradually progressed to predominantly play on the right wing, meaning he's got quality in defensive and attacking areas.",
      "Godwill Kukonki was been given a taste of the senior set-up last season, despite only turning 17 in January, and he is seen as someone who would excel playing in Amorim's system.",

      "Shea Lacey missed time on the pitch in the first half of last season due to injury, and he was carefully handled at the business end to ensure he is primed for a clear run at the new campaign.",

      "Former Premier League star Markus Babbel has hailed Florian Wirtz as the standout signing of the summer, despite the hefty sum required to snatch him from Bayer Leverkusen. Liverpool caused a stir across the Premier League and Europe by securing the sought-after German prodigy.",
      "Manchester United's rivals have made several signings in the transfer window after winning their 20th top-flight title. However, Wirtz is by far the most high-profile deal, completing a move worth up to £116million.",
      "After extensive speculation and edging out competition from Manchester City, Liverpool snapped up Wirtz last month in a move that could set a new British transfer record. Former Liverpool and Germany defender Babbel believes that the club have not overpaid for Wirtz and argued that his opinion would be the same if he had joined United.",
      "\"Florian Wirtz is easily the best signing of the summer transfer window so far,\" Babbel told Gameshub.",
      "\"That was the deal of the year in my opinion and that isn't just because the Premier League champions signed him; if Man United had made the deal, it would be no different – he's a fantastic player that will add so much value to the team.",
      "\"No one was talking about Liverpool getting the deal done either! Everyone assumed he'd join Bayern Munich, Man City or Real Madrid. But it was always clear to me from the start that he'd be heading to Liverpool to play under Arne Slot and alongside some of the best players in Europe, such as Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah.",
      "\"I would be surprised if a club managed to pull off a signing as good as Wirtz to Liverpool. For me, there's no doubt that he's the best signing of the window.\"",
      "United have signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m as part of their rebuild this summer and the club are pursuing a deal for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo. In addition, teenage prospects Diego Leon and Enzo Kana-Biyik have also joined the club. However, United fans will hope that Wirtz's ambitions at Liverpool fall flat.",
      "During his five-year stint at Leverkusen, Wirtz emerged as one of the world's leading talents, prompting the substantial fee Liverpool paid for him. Following his introduction as Liverpool's most expensive signing, Wirtz shared his aspirations: \"I would like to win everything every year.",
      "\"In the end, we want to be successful. Last season they won the Premier League so my goal is for sure to win it again and also to go further in the Champions League. I'm really ambitious.\"",
      "Wirtz described his decision to join Liverpool as the \"next step\" in his career trajectory, expressing his enthusiasm for the new challenge: \"I'm really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts.",
      "\"I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League. I will see how I can perform there. I hope I can do my best.",
      "\"I just thought that it was the right point in my career to make the next step and of course I wanted to get to a club that is from the top three in the world. In my opinion, Liverpool is one of them. I just saw myself in the best hands in Liverpool.\""

      "However, the reports linking Rashford with a move to Barcelona are not going away and their sporting director, Deco, went on record about Rashford when he spoke to BBC Sport last month.",
      "Deco insisted Barcelona will \"not sell our best players\". He said Barcelona were in the market for \"two, three or four signings\", without needing to enter the market \"like crazy\" thanks to a solid base.",
      "And when asked if Barcelona's plans included the option of signing Rashford, or Liverpool forward Diaz, he added: \"We have been focusing on renewing contracts, after that, we'll discuss players to come.",
      "\"Of course, these two players, like you mentioned, they are good but have contracts in their clubs, so we won't speak because it's not fair. But when you decide to go to the market, for sure, we find some names. In my opinion, we don't need to bring many players.\"",
      "Deco continued: \"When I speak with the agents of the players, everyone wants to come or stay. So this is important. The image of the club is still good. We are proud because Barcelona is still such a big club, and the way we are playing football makes players want to come.\"",
      "In the meantime, Rashford has returned to Carrington to train on his own in the afternoons, despite the club granting extra time to the players who want to explore a departure.",
      "Rashford is also without a squad shirt number after United decided to give the No.10 shirt to new signing Matheus Cunha. Some fans believe that was disrespectful, and others just want to see Rashford out the door.",
      "Regardless of those different opinions splitting the fanbase, it's sad to see the most successful United academy graduate of recent times end his time at his boyhood club on a sour note.",
      "Rashford will hope for a move to Barcelona to turn a negative situation into a positive, but Liverpool could have an influence this summer and essentially hurt United in the transfer window."

      "Sporting Lisbon are proving to be a difficult nut to crack as they try to receive the best possible price for their talisman, Viktor Gyokeres, this summer.",
      "Arsenal's negotiations with the Portuguese club have nearly hit a dead end as Sporting president Frederico Varandas continues to push for a total deal priced at £69m. The issue from Gyokeres' side, which is currently resulting in the player effectively going on strike, is that he was under the impression he could leave for just under £60m.",
      "Varandas has confirmed that Sporting will be launching disciplinary action against Gyokeres for failing to report for the start of pre-season. Such behaviour may feel uncommon practice, however Sporting do have precedent for dealing with clubs like this and Manchester United have already been told the formula to succeed.",
      "Cast your minds back to the January transfer window of 2023 and Tottenham Hotspur seemed certain to be signing Pedro Porro from Sporting. All was agreed and a medical was booked in London for the full-back.",
      "However, as The Athletic reported at the time, the deal was on the verge of being called off as Varandas made a last-minute ploy for more money by reneging on the offer that was already agreed. This unconventional move is not too far removed from what the Sporting president is doing with Gyokeres.",
      "Eventually, Spurs were able to get their man through help from Porro who admitted he did not turn up to training on deadline day so that he could force Sporting's hand. United will hope the Swedish centre-forward is not having to resort to such tricks come the end of August if they are trying to sign him but the lessons from the Porro deal are a timely reminder for the Reds.",
      "Sooner or later, Sporting are going to have to fold on Gyokeres. They simply cannot afford to have a player in their squad who is willing to not turn up to training until a move away is completed.",
      "It makes no sense for Varandas to keep a player against his will and while, at the moment, he is happy to hold his line due to the lack of competitive fixtures, he will have no choice but to compromise as we edge closer to the regular season beginning. Should United want Gyokeres, they must remain patient and trust that negotiating with Sporting will become easier as the transfer window progresses."

      "Before Cunha had even finalised his switch to M16, United had tabled an opening offer for Mbeumo. After seeing their £55m offer knocked back, United returned with a second bid just over a fortnight ago, understood to be in excess of £60m.",

      "In addition to wanting to sign Mbeumo, United also want to sign an out-and-out centre-forward. The addition of a proven goalscorer this summer is paramount after ending last season's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference of -10.",
      "Having signed Cunha and setting their sights on Mbeumo, getting an established No.9 through the door would be the cherry on the icing on the cake for United. The elephant in the room, however, is that they are reliant on sales this summer to fund new additions.",
      "United are prioritising the sales of Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony this summer, and are also open to selling Alejandro Garnacho at the right price. The quartet are not currently training with the first-team squad at Carrington.",
      "Alongside Tyrell Malacia, the quartet informed United of their interest in leaving the club just over a week ago. United have valued Rashford at £40m, Antony is available at £32.58m and Sancho is believed to be up for grabs for somewhere between £20m-£25m.",
      "Garnacho, however, is valued higher. He scored 11 goals and registered ten assists for United last season and has three years left on his contract, meaning United should be striving to command as high a fee as possible for the talented Argentine.",
      "The 21-year-old was the subject of a £40m bid from Napoli in the January window, but United rebuffed their offer as it fell short of their valuation. The Reds should be demanding £50m at the very least for a player of Garnacho's quality and potential.",
      "With an asking price of somewhere between £50m-£60m a rough guideline for Garnacho, United will be determined to secure as high a price as possible for the youngster. He has made 144 appearances for the club, scoring 26 goals, meaning it is an impressive record for a player that only celebrated his 21st birthday earlier this month.",
      "If United are successful in their attempts to sell Garnacho, and command a fee of £50m or more, it will mark the first time since the sale of Romelu Lukaku in August 2019 they will have secured £50m or more from a sale.",
      "The Belgian joined the Italian club six years ago for almost £74m, making him the second most expensive sale in United's history behind Cristiano Ronaldo, who swapped Old Trafford for Real Madrid back in 2009.",
      "United's track record in the seller's market leaves a lot to be desired, with the Reds often struggling to squeeze every penny out of the buying club when it comes to a sale. It is an area of the business that still needs to improve.",
      "But with the club desperate to bring in new faces this summer, they need to raise every penny they possibly can via sales. Getting north of £50m for Garnacho would be a huge step in the right direction."

      "According to a report by The Telegraph, goalkeeper Andre Onana has suffered a hamstring injury in training this week and could miss 'six to eight weeks' worth of action, ruling him out of the upcoming tour of the United States.",
      "Furthermore, it means he is at risk of possibly missing the start of the new Premier League season. United face Arsenal in their season opener at Old Trafford on August 17.",
      "Despite's United intentions to sign a new goalkeeper this summer, Onana reported back to Carrington for the start of pre-season training earlier this week under the impression he will remain head coach Ruben Amorim's first-choice goalkeeper this season.",
      "Onana has attracted interest from AS Monaco already this summer, but wants to stay at Old Trafford. It is understood he will only consider leaving if United want to sell him.",
      "Amorim wants to recruit a goalkeeper this summer that can challenge and compete with Onana for the No.1 spot.",
      "Despite making several high-profile errors last season, the Cameroonian often started by default amid doubts about Altay Bayindir's suitability as United's second-choice goalkeeper. The Turkish international, who joined the club from Fenerbahce in September 2023, has made just 11 appearances for United, conceding 20 goals.",
      "United made the decision to offer a new contract to veteran shot-stopper Tom Heaton last month, tying him down to a new one-year deal, meaning he is highly likely to remain third in the goalkeeping pecking order this season.",
      "With that in mind, United are likely to target the addition of a new goalkeeper with a view to replacing Bayindir and taking second spot in the pecking order. The former Fenerbahce man is likely to be sold this summer.",
      "However, news of Onana's injury means Bayindir could be needed for a little while longer yet. He will expect to be a regular throughout pre-season.",
      "On the flip side, United could use Onana's injury as an excuse to try and source a new second-choice goalkeeper as quickly as possible, with a view to getting him up to speed ahead of the start of the season and potentially starting the campaign in goal.",
      "United are rightly prioritising attacking signings this summer and are still optimistic about making Bryan Mbeumo their next signing. Talks with Brentford are too far down the line for United to suddenly prioritise the addition of a goalkeeper over the Cameroonian.",
      "But should the Reds make a breakthrough in their pursuit for Mbeumo sooner rather than later, their priority after getting him through the door may have to become the addition of a goalkeeper.",
      "As already documented, United wanted to sign a shot-stopper this summer to challenge Onana, meaning news of his injury setback could see that particular objective become more important than first thought.",
      "United are unlikely to want to go into the start of the season, should Onana fail to recover in time, with Bayindir between the posts amid the possibility of him getting injured and putting pay to any hopes they have of selling him before the end of the window.",
      "Instead, it would be much wiser for United to try and source an upgrade on the Turkish international, as per their original plan, and attempt to embed a new shot-stopper in the team in pre-season with a view to the chosen candidate generating some healthy competition for Onana to become Amorim's No.1."

      "It’s money month, the time of year when the season sort of starts again with friendlies and fake tournaments, but not really. It’s also a despicable time when the ugliness of top-flight football arrogantly bestrides the world in pursuit of tiny amounts of extra money.",
      "If your side does well, it cheers you for the new campaign; a few poor results and everyone is disgruntled. And it usually proves no guide to what happens in the season.",
      "ITV even showed Preston v Liverpool. It still seemed more significant than the CWC obviously, but I seriously wonder about the fitness of footballers who last played internationals a month ago. We’re familiar with player burn-out as a concept, though it’s usually only used as an excuse for defeat, not a reason for victory. You’ve been playing for the best part of 11 months; you’re not going to lose anything in a month that a friendly against Preston would revive. Surely light training is all that’s needed.",
      "Back in the day, the time off would last from mid-May until mid-August, a time which would be spent drinking and eating gravy dinners, so players would need to run up sand dunes – vomiting as Big Jack shouted profanities – to get fit again, but I doubt that’s the case now that they measure everything all the time and they live off chicken and pasta.",
      "I watched Middlesbrough play and lose to Port Clarence Reserves in the 70s, but clubs have now realised there’s money in pre-season games and pretending they’re competitive. So this Saturday you could watch Gateshead v Sunderland or Matlock v Derby or Dartford v Charlton amongst others. I’m not sure anyone except the most loyal obsessive bothered, but it’s a part of a great tradition. And of course bigger clubs are playing in fake tournaments all across the world so they can earn enough to pay for a reserve full-back from Austria.",
      "But then Premier League clubs are different, moral-free beasts with no conscience. The Guardian reckons the 20 clubs are unconscionably taking a planet-breaking 175,000 summer air miles in just a few weeks, the idiots. Manchester United are flying 24,000 miles to show off their mediocrity and are even playing Leeds in Stockholm. City are spending 15,000 miles in the air and face Palermo in Sicily to contest the inaugural Anglo Palermitan Trophy which commemorates the Sicilian club’s maiden fixture against a team of British sailors in 1900. At least they’re used to wasting energy competing in insignificant tournaments. You’re playing for fans in the country you’re flying to, are you? As they die in the heat or are swept away in floods, I’m sure they’ll appreciate it..",
      "Time was they’d play a relatively near lower-league side to help them earn much-needed money from the gate receipts for games that were much in demand. Games like the one v Preston are rare. You can see Liverpool play Milan in Hong Kong though. Or Newcastle play Arsenal in Singapore. No game against Blyth Spartans in Blyth, then? Nah, that’s just legacy thinking.",
      "Personally I loved the pre-season friendly. Boro went through a phase of playing Hibs thanks to Tony Mowbray’s connections and they were always great pish-ups that Hibs certainly took seriously.",
      "There is a better solution, though it would deny these clubs money to fritter away. Scottish football, which I know most of you don’t care about, and to be fair does have the tradition of terrible decisions by the SFA, got it right for once and has had a much better idea with the Premier Sports Cup. The group stage involves 40 clubs – the 37 SPFL clubs for 2025/26 who are not involved in European competition plus Bonnyrigg Rose (relegated to Lowland League), Brora Rangers (Highland League winners) and Brechin City (Highland League runners-up).",
      "Teams are drawn into eight groups of five based on final league positions in 2024/25 and it fires the starting gun on the new season this weekend. They realised that the League Cup retains some credibility so they set up a league stage, where they get to play actual competitive games instead of friendlies and football-starved fans lap it up in the ‘foreign’ July heat, heading towards a final in December.",
      "It is often the one trophy that the Glasgow big two don’t actually always win, though Celtic are the current holders and it has value because of that alone. The CWC has shown the pointlessness of playing in tournaments no one believes in.",
      "Why doesn’t England swallow its ego and copy Scotland instead of treating it like a poor, pish-stinking old relation? It’d get the competition done earlier, providing an early meaningful start to the season. They’re obviously not opposed to playing in July. However, the gate receipts are probably dwarfed by money gained playing in these fake overseas tournaments. So once again, we see how local, domestic football suffers because of the insatiable lust for money, no matter how small, in a way it once never was.",
      "Pre-season pulls back the curtain and shows the most important thing to top clubs. It’s not football or even fitness. It’s just money. Nothing else. The hateful club execs, desperate to justify their lavish wages, just care about money. 175,000 miles. Climate change doesn’t discriminate in favour of football clubs, y’now. You die too. Good luck paying to offset that. And more to the point, you’re effectively killing and ruining the lives of your own fans. Yeah, that makes good economic, if not moral, sense.",
      "Even that doesn’t stop the stupids or deniers. More money, more money, more money. Stop buying players! We’d rather see a local kid come through. No? They’re all crap? Well, that’s down to you. But you’d rather fry in 33 degrees of heat to get one place higher in the league? Morons. It’s 27 degrees here on the west coast of Scotland, it’s unnatural. And when you get skin cancer you can thank the Premier League for not giving a shit and putting a few quid above the health of the planet and its people. F*cking idiots.",
      "So craven for a little bit more money, they are even prepared to exploit not just the Earth but their own assets to the maximum and then some, even at the risk of breaking those same assets, the way they’re breaking the planet. To a rational mind it makes zero sense and is the economics of the madhouse. Protest this obscene situation because they are willingly blind to it. On the contrary, they think they’re clever.",
      "Further down the pyramid, it’s still as it ever was as your local centre-half takes a break from laying bricks to kick your fancy striker up in the air, but it’d be nice if it actually mattered and since they’re already playing, why not? Keep pre-season local.",
      "Does the environment not matter? Obviously not. What a terrible example to future generations who will have to live with and combat their selfishness, if they live at all.",

      "3) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus has shot Spurs up into the top three here and Morgan Gibbs-White will get them closer to Liverpool.",
      "",
      "2) Liverpool – £194.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and Jeremie Frimpong has cost £29.5m. We have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts. And now Milos Kerkez has joined for a cool £40m.",
      "",
      "1) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less."

      "According to reports, Manchester United have suffered their ‘latest blow’ as they are set to miss out on another summer transfer target.",
      "This summer is vital for the Red Devils as they need to do plenty of business after finishing 15th in the Premier League and failed to win a trophy in 2024/25.",
      "However, Man Utd have endured a frustrating start to this summer’s transfer window, with Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon their only signings. They are also struggling to offload their unwanted talents as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Antony remain contracted to the Premier League giants.",
      "In recent weeks, Ruben Amorim‘s side have been focused on signing Matheus Cunha, but this has turned into a prolonged battle as they are yet to meet Brentford’s asking price of around £65-70million.",

      "United initially prioritised a move for Liam Delap and this deal looked likely, but the striker eventually decided to join Chelsea after they qualified for the Champions League.",
      "Man Utd are also set to miss out on Viktor Gyokeres, with the 2025 top scorer in Europe contender making it clear that he prefers a move to Premier League rivals Arsenal.",
      "It has been suggested that this could lead the Red Devils to turn to the free agent market for a new striker, with Juventus star Dusan Vlahovic mooted as an option.",
      "The 25-year-old grabbed 17 goals and five assists in 44 appearances across all competitions during the 2024/25 campaign, but it has been reported that the Turin side are looking to get him off the books due to their financial difficulties.",
      "Vlahovic is only under contract until 2026, but with bids yet to arrive, recent reports have indicated that the Serie A giants are considering cancelling his contract so he can be involved in a free transfer.",
      "This represents a decent option for Man Utd, but The Sun claim they have suffered their ‘latest blow’ as ‘bargain striker’ Vlahovic’ is set to ‘snub’ the Premier League giants for AC Milan.",

      "‘The 25-year-old has been in the headlines for months, with United among a host of clubs reportedly monitoring his situation at Juventus. However, while United were thought to be favourites for his signature, Vlahovic is now set to stay in Italy.’",

      "Very good chance we’re projecting a little bit here, but if there were a theme to this summer’s Premier League transfer business thus far it would be Okay, You’ve Had Your Fun.",
      "Everyone enjoyed themselves, didn’t they, watching unlikely and less familiar teams compete for European spots? And everyone really enjoyed watching Tottenham and Manchester United be astonishing levels of sh*t for astonishing periods of time, right up until Spurs somehow unSpursed themselves at the best/worst possible moment.",
      "But we get the impression now that it’s not just Spurs and United themselves spooked by last season’s ineptitude. Some of the other big clubs might have been hit by the realisation that this could happen to them if the Premier League’s middle-class weren’t brought to heel.",
      "Let’s not pretend that the biggest clubs buying the best players from the other clubs in the league is a brand new phenomenon, but we’re not even at the middle of July yet and the heart has been ripped out of several of the upstarts who made last season so different.",
      "And it’s the big clubs doing that ripping. Four of the traditional Big Six are currently Europe’s four biggest spenders this summer, and all of them have moved to take some of the best players from elsewhere.",
      "Liverpool have Milos Kerkez. Chelsea have Joao Pedro. Tottenham have Mohammed Kudus, even if they have managed to Spurs their pursuit of Morgan Gibbs-White up. Man City have got themselves a Rayat Ait-Nouri.",
      "Arsenal will be very much in the top five once they and Sporting stop their absurd game of chicken and just get a deal done for Viktor Gyokeres as we all know they eventually will once everyone can agree a way to proceed that allows everyone to feel like they’ve won. They’ve also got themselves a Christian Norgaard to continue the theme anyway.",
      "Man United sneak into the top 10 as well after signing Wolves lunatic Matheus Cunha, and again the only reason they’re not higher is because Sir Jim Ratcliffe hasn’t yet decided precisely which and how many unimportant disposable meatbags he needs to sack to scrape together enough coppers to get himself a Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Is it too early to officially Fear for Brentford? We really think it might not be. They must have known the day would come that Thomas Frank tried his luck at somewhere bigger and also probably stupider, and he will certainly be doing those things.",
      "One of the most interesting things we thought we might learn next season was just how good Frank is, and that this would involve not just what he did at Spurs but what Brentford did in his absence. How much of Brentford’s success has been down to him personally? How able is he to replicate that in a very, very different environment?",
      "But Brentford appear to be about to take on that challenge in even more extreme circumstances than anyone could have imagined. They approach the dizzying uncertainty of life without their inspirational manager – and several members of his backroom staff – also without Norgaard, who did so much to make them tick, as well as almost certainly Mbeumo and quite possibly Yoane Wissa.",
      "And promoting a manager from within represents an admirable but enormous gamble. The desire for some continuity may be understandable, but when you don’t have continuity of players we do wonder how prudent a move that actually is.",
      "The good news for Brentford is that they are far from alone. Wolves have lost Cunha and Ait-Nouri. Brighton have lost Pedro. Forest are about to lose Anthony Elanga and Gibbs-White. Bournemouth have lost Kerkez and Dean Huijsen – even Real Madrid are helping out their big-club mates – while Palace will surely be stripped of some combination of Marc Guehi, Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton and very likely the Europa League.",
      "West Ham’s situation is slightly different, with the sanctioning of Kudus’ sale even to the worst possible place very likely a pretty smart, hard-headed decision to generate significant funds for their squad rebuild by offloading a player who doesn’t quite fit with the new manager’s plans. But it’s still another chastening reminder of how the land lies.",
      "These clubs have all trod this path before and at least some of them will be absolutely fine and possibly even improve for smartly reinvesting that cash in new, cheaper players who go on to become the next big-money signings for the larger beasts.",
      "Last season’s upsetting of the Premier League applecart came about in large part because the money sloshing around the Premier League is such that even the division’s proletariat now find themselves with spending power to outgun pretty much anyone outside the superclubs anywhere else.",
      "But right now it’s an uncomfortable time for a lot of the Premier League’s middle-class as the old order seeks to re-establish itself at their enormous expense."

      "Marcus Rashford’s dream move to Barcelona may never materialise as the Spanish giants have reportedly selected an alternative, Ademola Lookman.",
      "Rashford’s time at Manchester United is realistically over, but both he and the club are struggling to find an exit route.",
      "The 27-year-old spent half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but has made it clear that he favours a move to Barcelona, with the Catalan club looking to strengthen their attacking depth.",
      "Initially, it looked as if Rashford’s move would not come to be with Barceloan going all out to sign Nico Williams, only for the 22-year-old to go sign a ten-year deal with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Rashford then would have been hopeful about his chances, but a report from Spain suggests Barcelona are going after an alternative, former Everton winger Lookman.",
      "Sport, a newspaper based in Barcelona, says head coach Hansi Flick ‘likes’ the 27-year-old and that he could be available for less than €50 million.",
      "“The Blaugrana have other options on the table, such as Rafa Leao, and are also reportedly keeping a close eye on the situation of Atalanta star Ademola Lookman,” journalist Lluis Miguelsanz said. “He’s a player Flick likes, but his situation isn’t encouraging because relations with his entourage are currently strained.",
      "“Lookman has been trying for years to make the big leap from Atalanta to a top-flight Champions League club, but so far no one has taken the step to sign him.",
      "“The Italian club took a chance by signing him from Leipzig for €10 million, and he’s exploded onto the scene. He’s been gaining international prominence and is now a more mature player, although he needs to take a definitive step to establish himself at the elite level, as his performance is still very inconsistent.",
      "“He’s a pure winger, fast and capable of scoring goals. And he can play in all attacking positions, something Barça highly valued in Luis Díaz, the leading candidate to fill that position if financially possible. Atalanta would be willing to negotiate his sale for less than €50 million because his contract expires in 2027 and he hasn’t renewed yet, and Tottenham are strongly interested in signing him.”",
      "One stumbling block, though, could be Lookman’s choice of agency and their involvement with an ongoing issue at Barcelona.",
      "“The major handicap is that Lookman shares a representation agency with Marc-André ter Stegen, and problems with the goalkeeper are brewing.",
      "“The German will push hard to stay at Barça, and this could create an awkward situation for all parties, which could significantly impact relations with Lookman’s entourage. For now, Barça only has information about his situation, like that of many wingers, but nothing has been done about it.”",
      "Meanwhile, transfer reporter Fabrizio Romano says Rashford is “very open” to the Barcelona move and is “basically waiting for Barca.”",
      "“Marcus Rashford would be very keen on a move to Barcelona. Marcus Rashford is very open to that opportunity. I always told you since January and I keep repeating that Rashford would love Barca move and he’s basically waiting for Barca move because he has many opportunities.",
      "“Rashford is losing the number 10. He was informed 24 hours before about that, through his agents of course, but let me say that it’s not just Marcus Rashford desire to leave Manchester United.",
      "“All of this also starts from Manchester United desire to part ways from Marcus Rashford since January and continuing this summer. So it’s not only Rashford who wants to leave United but there is also United who are pushing the opportunity to sell Marcus Rashford or to find a solution for him this summer.",
      "“When I say Man United it’s the management, it’s the coach Ruben Amorim. So all parties are going to the same direction for Marcus Rashford to leave.”",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",

      "20) 🆕 Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – PSG to Liverpool\nThe story goes that Liverpool will ‘consider’ a move for Kvaratskhelia if they receive a ‘substantially’ better offer from Barca or Bayern for Luis Diaz, who they see as ‘a more proven player’ than the Georgian star, who only joined PSG in January before winning the lot. We know we ought to be more mature and offer a more considered response, but all we’ve got is: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, finally, appear to have chosen a lane, one that takes them to Gyokeres’ door. We would never rule out a sharp U-turn, but Sesko’s hopes of joining Arsenal this summer have never seemed as slim as they appear right now.",

      "18) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nDespite speculation that Juve preferred a permanent move for Francisco Conceicao, many reports suggest a deal has been agreed with United and it’s now down to Sancho to decide if how much he might be prepared to sacrifice to kickstart his career. The signs so far: not much…",
      "",
      "17) 🔼 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nJuve’s problem here is similar to United’s with Sancho: they owe the player another year of a huge salary. But Vlahovic may be prepared to forego it if Juve simply cut him loose and allow him to find a contract elsewhere as a free-agent. Which would certainly suit United.",
      "",
      "16) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Nottingham Forest\nBrentford won’t sell Wissa and Mbeumo, which surely means Forest’s failed bid for the former will give Manchester United a kick up the backside in their pursuit of the latter…right?",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which don’t appear to be going well.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Sean Longstaff – Newcastle to Leeds\nAh. It was initially thought Newcastle had accepted what was thought to be Leeds’ best and final offer, worth £10million plus add-ons, but it seems not. The Toon clearly feel they can squeeze more out of Leeds. Though probably not the £50million Man Utd were once quoted by Mike Ashley.",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nArsenal have met with Eze’s representatives and the player is said to be keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates. Arsenal’s next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full, not as a part-exchange deal involving players we can’t be sure actually exist.",
      "",
      "11) Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nSunderland have expressed an interest in signing Petrovic, who impressed on loan at Strasbourg last season, but it’s Bournemouth who are in the driving seat. Andoni Iraola needs a new goalkeeper and his side have made an offer, according to Fabrizio Romano, who says the Serbian goalkeeper is ‘keen on the move’. You can’t blame him; it’s an opportunity to become the No.1 at a mid-table Premier League team.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before now, with a big chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. The beauty of missing your own deadline is you can simply set another. And another if need be. The latest guess for when United want Mbeumo on board is July 22 when they fly off to the United States.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who will be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now. That Galatasaray are now ready to meet Napoli’s demands for Victor Osimhen ought to speed this up.",
      "",
      "7) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal.",
      "",
      "6) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we’ve almost given up trying to keep up. The latest: Arsenal have offered £56million, with £4.3million then £8.6million in add-ons, which could take the total to £69million. But Sporting aren’t interested in bonuses; they are insisting on £60million up front. Just pay it, FFS, Arsenal and complete that jigsaw. They will. We think. Won’t they?",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now mulling over an opportunity to join Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Jordan Henderson – Ajax to Brentford\nNo romantic return to Sunderland, who are a bit busy signing everyone else, Henderson is reportedly close to signing for Brentford to replace Arsenal new boy Christian Norgaard. Thomas Tuchel will be chuffed, and so will Arne Slot, since Henderson will probably refuse to tackle any Liverpool player out of #respect.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nChelsea have agreed a fee with Arsenal – £52m, says Orny – and the winger has been given permission to fly back before the Club World Cup final to have a medical with the Gunners. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle have finally reached an agreement with Forest worth £52million plus add-ons and Elanga is apparently in the North-East for a medical."

But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",

      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",

      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",

      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Spurs claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker left the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",

      "There were flashes of something exceptional over those 80 Hammers appearances under three different managers, but that wonderful first season being shown tapes of Steven Pienaar by David Moyes had faded long before Spurs swooped.",
      "Thomas Frank identified the Ghanaian as his priority signing, Kudus picked out Spurs as the only club he wished to join, West Ham swallowed their pride to fund much-needed squad improvements and Arne Slot looked on longingly.",

      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "Chelsea are a proper team and Premier League champions in waiting after winning the Club World Cup, while Cole Palmer has entered the Ballon d’Or chat…",
      "Joao Pedro and Mohammed Kudus have joined the increasing legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m, with more deals to come.",

      "Marcus Rashford's preferred destination this summer is Barcelona and with the Catalan side missing out on Athletic Club's Nico Williams and Liverpool fending off bids for Luis Diaz, the Man Utd forward's prospects of a Spanish switch have increased...",
      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "However, Sancho has more concrete interest from Europe so far including Juventus, Napoli and former club Borussia Dortmund.",

      "Brentford director of football Phil Giles says Bryan Mbeumo would be happy to stay at the club if a deal cannot be agreed with Manchester United.",
      "The two clubs have held talks, and Mbeumo is said to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite added interest from Tottenham, who have appointed his former boss, Thomas Frank.",
      "\"There is significant interest in Bryan. His current preference has been well publicised,\" Giles said.",
      "\"He had an unbelievable season, and we expected interest in him. From what I understand, he is also, if needs be, happy to stay at Brentford next year as well.",
      "\"We've spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It's not a given that he's going to depart this summer.",
      "\"If we get the right offer, there is the potential for a deal to be done, but there is only so much we can say now on that.\"",
      "Speaking for the first time since taking the helm at Brentford, Keith Andrews echoed Giles' stance on Mbeumo, saying it would be \"ideal\" if the forward was to stay.",
      "\"It's a massive boost if he stays,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"He's such a talented player. Someone I enjoyed working with, I worked closely with him last season around set pieces, so that will be the ideal scenario.",
      "\"I want the most talented players in the building. I'm very understanding of the way football and this football club work when it comes to transfers, but ultimately, I want the best players in the building.\"",
      "\"Of course, he will be a miss,\" Andrews said.",
      "\"It's a move for him that would be amazing to go to a club of that magnitude and play Champions League football. I would miss him as a person because I value him very highly.",
      "\"Christian has been pivotal in the recent history of the football club; he's worn the armband now for years. He's someone that I admire, really understand his quality and what he brings both on and off the pitch.\"",
      "The potential departure of Mbeumo and Norgaard's impending move to north London will leave Brentford with gaps to fill in their squad. Asked about whether the club will look to the market to bolster positions, Andrews said:",
      "\"It's always been about players in the building for me; that has to be the priority. There are players in the building now that have huge scope to kick onto new levels. I firmly believe that and the club has also demonstrated every season, if players leave, players will come in and the trust I have in that department is really strong.\"",
