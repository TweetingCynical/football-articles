      "Benjamin Sesko and Joshua Zirkzee celebrate after Manchester United's win against Fulham(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Joshua Zirkzee showed a moment of class as he became the first Manchester United player to rush over to Benjamin Sesko following his match-winning goal against Fulham.",
      "Sesko, 22, has struggled during his challenging introduction to life at Old Trafford since his £74million transfer from RB Leipzig last summer, but he rose to the occasion with a match-deciding moment, netting in the 94th minute to seal United a thrilling 3-2 triumph on Sunday afternoon.",
      "The Slovenia international, who had managed just five goals in 20 appearances prior to Fulham's visit, came on as a 74th minute replacement for Matheus Cunha and had to bide his time until injury-time for his moment of glory. Indeed, mere moments after Fulham had equalised at 2-2 through Kevin, Bruno Fernandes teed up Sesko to blast the ball into the top corner and claim all three points.",
      "As Sesko spun away to celebrate in the South-West corner, Zirkzee, who had been preparing on the sidelines, was the first United player to sprint across to the striker to join the celebrations, embracing him and demonstrating his joy.",
      "This caught some United supporters off guard as Sesko and Zirkzee have been competing for starting opportunities throughout much of the campaign.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "However, in that instant, Zirkzee showed his quality and personality by congratulating Sesko and placing his hand on his shoulder before the remainder of his United colleagues reached them. Even after the final whistle sounded, Sesko and Zirkzee shared another moment together and stood united side-by-side.",
      "Both Sesko and Zirkzee were named amongst the substitutes for the Fulham clash, as interim boss Michael Carrick chose Bryan Mbeumo to lead the line, flanked by Matheus Cunha and Amad Diallo.",
      "When Carrick decided to shake things up in attack, Cunha was withdrawn and Sesko got the nod ahead of Zirkzee, who didn't feature at all.",
      "Zirkzee has been the subject of transfer speculation this month and hasn't played a single minute since Carrick took charge last month.",
      "He was left out of the matchday squad entirely for the Manchester City and Arsenal fixtures, only making the bench against Fulham because of Patrick Dorgu's injury problems.",
      "Benjamin Sesko and Manchester United celebrate(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The Netherlands international's most recent outing for the Reds was in the FA Cup loss to Brighton during Darren Fletcher's final match as caretaker boss.",
      "Meanwhile, Sesko has now netted six times for United, earning glowing praise from Carrick after the game. \"A huge moment,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"I'm so, so pleased. Everyone in the changing room, players, staff, delighted for him, absolutely delighted for him. And the reception he got when he came back in the changing room, told us everything. He's even confident, to be honest.",
      "\"We've worked with him a lot in different ways over the last couple of weeks. He's bright in training. He's looked dangerous, he's done extra.",
      "\"The coaches have done a lot of bits on the side and Travis [Binnion], particularly, he's done a lot of work one on one with him.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Michael Carrick was delighted for Benjamin Sesko(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick hailed the work his coaching staff have done on the training ground with Benjamin Sesko after he scored a dramatic winner against Fulham. Sesko came off the bench and produced a confident finish to win the match 3-2 in the 94th minute on Sunday.",
      "The Slovenia international has struggled for consistency since joining United in a £74million transfer from RB Leipzig in the summer. He has scored six goals in 21 appearances so far and been outshone by fellow summer arrivals Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "But it was the 22-year-old who earned the plaudits against Fulham after he managed to put a early miss, when he planted a header onto the post, behind him. Sesko gathered Bruno Fernandes' cross and fired into the top corner on the swivel to move United into the top four of the Premier League.",
      "His goal cancelled out Fulham's late burst from Raul Jimenez and Kevin, and ensured some praise from Carrick, although the interim United boss also made a point of shouting out Travis Binnion, who has been promoted from under-21s coach to the first team staff following Ruben Amorim's sacking.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"Huge moment. I'm so, so pleased,\" Carrick said post-match. \"I think everyone in the changing room, players, staff, absolutely delighted for him and the reception he got when he came back in the changing room, kind of told us everything.",
      "\"He's been confident, to be honest. I think he's been fantastic. We've worked with him a lot in different ways over the last couple of weeks. He's been bright in training, he's looked dangerous, he's done extra. The coaches have done a lot of bits on the side, and Trav particularly has done a lot of work one-on-one with him.",
      "Travis Binnion earned praise from Michael Carrick after the win over Fulham(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"Ben's a big talent and he's got so many positive things and today's a huge goal because that feeling as a striker you have to score a winner in front of the Stretford End like that, it's kind of what you dream of really and after missing a chance, which is what it is for strikers to miss chances to go again, and put that away, absolutely so, so pleased from him. He really deserves it.\"",
      "Binnion made the step up from the under-21s to the first team when Darren Fletcher was made caretaker when Amorim was sacked in early January. He has retained the promotion in Carrick's staff and has clearly been working with Sesko in recent weeks.",
      "He first joined United in 2019 from Sheffield United's academy to take charge of the under-16s, before eventually taking charge of the under-18s and then the under-21s in the summer of 2023.",

      "Marco Silva was furious with the officials after defeat at Old Trafford(Image: AFP/Getty Images)",
      "Fulham manager Marco Silva was furious with the officials after his side slipped to a dramatic late defeat against Manchester United. Benjamin Sesko scored an injury-time winner for United after Fulham had fought back from 2-0 down in a gripping finale at Old Trafford.",
      "Goals from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha had United 2-0 up and cruising on Sunday afternoon before Silva's side roared back. Raul Jimenez netted from the penalty spot after Harry Maguire's foul before Kevin curled a stunning finish into the top corner to equalise in the 91st minute.",
      "However, United went straight up the other end, with Bruno Fernandes picking out Sesko to score on the swivel in the box. His goal ensured United continued their 100 per cent record under Michael Carrick's management, but left Silva raging.",
      "United's opening goal came from a free-kick that was awarded following consultation from VAR. Initially referee John Brooks had awarded United a penalty for Jorge Cuenca's challenge on Cunha in the box.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "But VAR replays showed Cuenca had got the ball. Yet rather than overturn the penalty, Brooks changed his call to a free-kick outside the box because Cuenca had pulled Cunha's shirt. Fernandes curled a cross in and Casemiro planted a powerful header past Bernd Leno to open the scoring, with Silva subsequently receiving a yellow card for his protestations.",
      "He added: \"The penalty was given by the tackle. After, because the decision was so bad, they found a different foul.",
      "John Brooks changed his decision from a penalty to a free-kick after a VAR review - much to Marco Silva's annoyance(Image: Matt McNulty/Getty Images)",
      "\"I feel my players, I feel our fans but we have to respect and the people in charge. I know why the penalty was given. VAR went in a completely different direction to find something to find a free-kick that was not the reason why the penalty was given.\"",
      "Asked if he had spoken to Brooks, Silva replied: \"I don't want get more cards because I want to be on the touchline. I don't want to speak more.\"",
      "There was further involvement from VAR in the game, with the officials at Stockley Park intervening to rule out Cuenca's goal in the second half which would have made it 2-1. The Fulham defender scored after two deflected shots, only for Samuel Chukwueze to have been found to be marginally offside.",
      "One decision did go in Fulham's favour, however, with Jimenez awarded a penalty after Maguire took him out while trying to block his shot. His cool effort from the spot got the away side back into the match, but ultimately counted for little.",

      "Mikel Arteta's side bounced back from a home defeat to Manchester United against Leeds United on Saturday, travelling to Elland Road and winning 4-0. This marked Arsenal's 16th win of the current top-flight campaign.",
      "Deadline day is now on the agenda with the January window reaching an end and the Gunners have kept a very low profile transfer-wise so far. A handful of young players, including Ethan Nwaneri, have left on loan though not a pound has been spent.",

      "Diomande is one of Europe's highest-rated young attackers and was signed by Leipzig in 2025 from La Liga side Leganes. Since then, his blazing speed has caught the eye of other European giants.",

      "Benjamin Sesko was the hero for Manchester United(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Benjamin Sesko scored a dramatic late winner as Manchester United maintained their perfect 100 per cent record under Michael Carrick and moved into the top four. United appeared to have thrown away a third straight Premier League win before Sesko found the top corner in injury time.",
      "Amad Diallo and Joachim Andersen had efforts saved at either end before United took the lead through Casemiro's powerful header from Bruno Fernandes' free-kick after VAR overturned a penalty decision.",
      "It was 2-0 when Casemiro produced a cheeky no-look pass to find Matheus Cunha and the Brazilian smashed a powerful finish into the roof of the net from an acute angle. Jorge Cuenca saw a goal ruled out by VAR for a narrow offside before Sesko sent a header onto the post with his first touch after coming on as a substitute.",
      "Jimenez brought Fulham back into the game from the penalty spot after being wiped out by Harry Maguire and Kevin came off the bench to curl in a stunning equaliser. But Sesko latched onto Fernandes' cross to make it 3-2 in the 94th minute.",
      "Here are the talking points from a cracker at Old Trafford.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "United had two shouts for a penalty in the early stages of the match and both times Cuenca had actually got a toe on the ball. The Fulham defender slid in to challenge Bryan Mbeumo first, with the United forward's appeal turned down by referee John Brooks.",
      "But minutes later Brooks pointed to the spot when Cuenca challenged Matheus Cunha next to the byline. Replays showed that the Spaniard had clearly touched the ball, so Brooks was forced to change his decision. Interestingly, VAR changed the penalty decision to a free-kick outside the box, due to the fact Cuenca had pulled Cunha's shirt, much to the annoyance of Marco Silva, who was booked in the aftermath.",
      "It proved a crucial decision as Fernandes delivered the ball into the box and Casemiro climbed high above Cuenca to plant a powerful header past Bernd Leno to make it 1-0.",
      "John Brooks changed his decision from a penalty to a free-kick after a VAR review(Image: Matt McNulty/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick had the luxury of naming the same starting XI in his first two matches in charge against Manchester City and Arsenal, but he had to make a first change to face Fulham, with Patrick Dorgu out with a hamstring injury.",
      "Dorgu had been a revelation on the left wing against City and Arsenal and there wasn't a like-for-like replacement available. His answer was to bring Cunha into the line-up and ask for his forward line to rotate, with no-one naturally inclined to play on that flank.",
      "The result was that United caused overloads in the middle of the pitch, leaving Fulham right-back Timothy Castagne often with no one to mark. Cunha's goal was a good example, the Brazilian finding space in the right channel - on the opposite side to where he was stationed - before smashing into the top corner.",
      "Matheus Cunha scored after being brought into the starting XI (Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "We were assured that semi-automated offside decisions would speed up the game and mean fewer lengthy delays. That hasn't felt like the case and there was once again an arduous wait at Old Trafford in the second half as Fulham waited nervously to see whether they had a route back into the match.",
      "It came in scrappy fashion with the Fulham defender putting the ball in the net after Raul Jimenez's free-kick and Samuel Chukwueze's effort had both been blocked. After over four minutes, the VAR decided that Chukwueze had been fractionally offside when Jimenez's free-kick was struck.",
      "Jorge Cuenca saw a goal ruled out by VAR(Image: AFP/Getty Images)",
      "Fulham were let into the game by Maguire's sliding challenge as he desperately tried to block Jimenez's shot on goal. In the event, the Fulham striker had already hit it straight at Senne Lammens and he was undoubtedly then fouled by the centre-back.",
      "Jimenez kept his cool, producing a stuttering run-up and a precise finish into the top corner to make it 2-1 in the 85th minute. His effort was admired by Lammens, who shared a word with the Mexican.",
      "Kevin then picked out the top corner to make it 2-2, but United didn't let their heads drop and Sesko kept his cool to win it.",
      "Raul Jimenez kept his composure from the penalty spot(Image:  Carl Recine/Getty Images)",
      "Carrick was brought in as an interim boss until the end of the season. United's hierarchy have been at pains to make it clear that they will be going for a big name manager in the summer. But the more games that Carrick wins, the more the positivity grows, the more they will be under pressure to seriously consider their ex-midfielder.",
      "Because these performances are night and day compared to the final stages of Ruben Amorim's reign. Gone is the dreaded 3-4-2-1 formation. All the players are in their best positions. They look fluid in attack and much more solid in defence - despite the late wobble here. And they just keep on winning.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Angel Gomes looks to have secured a Premier League comeback during the January transfer window. The England international left Old Trafford for French side Lille in 2020 before moving to Marseille on a free transfer last summer.",
      "The 25-year-old made an impressive start to this season but has featured for merely eight minutes of Ligue 1 action throughout December and January. Predictably, transfer speculation around Gomes emerged with a late winter window move now on the way.",
      "According to reports, Wolves have now reached an agreement in principle for the midfielder on loan until the season's end. He has reported that a €1million (£866,000) fee will be paid for the remaining months with a purchase option worth approximately €7m (£6m).",
      "Whether that clause gets triggered may hinge on various factors including Wolves' anticipated relegation. Molineux staging Championship football next term appears likely as they sit 17 points from safety.",
      "Joao Gomes' future is also probably influencing this transaction with the Brazilian midfielder tipped to depart in the summer. He allegedly surfaced as a target for United with connections to Atletico Madrid and Napoli also materialising.",
      "The academy graduate Gomes was heavily tipped to make a remarkable return during summer 2024, with the player himself having previously discussed such a possibility.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe back in November 2022, he acknowledged: \"Do I imagine myself coming back one day? Obviously, it's home.",
      "\"I would love to come back. But you never know in football. I just have to keep my feet on the ground, and keep playing, making the most of it. I can't predict what will happen in the future.\"",
      "Despite his forthcoming transfer to Wolves, Gomes could yet return to United given the need for reinforcements in his preferred role at Old Trafford, with no certainty the purchase option in his Wolves deal will be triggered.",
      "Angel Gomes has hinted at a possible return to Manchester United(Image: Dave Winter/Shutterstock)",
      "Casemiro's departure has been confirmed at the conclusion of his contract, which would create a vacancy in the club's strongest starting XI. Manuel Ugarte represents another alternative but has struggled to secure regular football during his spell at the club.",
      "Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba have all been touted for substantial transfers to United in recent months.",
      "An approach to Brighton was lodged for the latter during the closing stages of the summer window, though the Seagulls' nine-figure valuation prompted United to withdraw. Speculation emerged about a fresh bid whilst Baleba was competing at AFCON, but Brighton chief executive Paul Barber swiftly refuted that.",
      "\"No call from Old Trafford,\" he told talkSPORT in early January. \"No call from anyone connected to Manchester United. We have no plans or desire to sell Carlos in this window, or in any future window, but we know he's a talented player and he's got a lot of options ahead of him in the future\".",
      "\"For us right now, he's an important player in the second half of the season and we're looking forward to getting him back from AFCON.\"",

      "The Red Devils are looking to make it three wins from three under Michael Carrick and thought they'd been given the chance to take the lead inside 20 minutes when the referee, John Brooks, pointed to the spot. Matheus Cunha went down under a challenge from Jorge Cuenca.",
      "The Fulham defender went to ground and was penalised, but replays quickly showed that Cuenca had got the ball before taking the man to ground. He and his team-mates protested and VAR was quick to jump in and reviewed the incident.",
      "It was then fed into the official that Cuenca hadn't committed a foul in the box, but they did go back and penalise the Fulham star for a tug on the shirt, but that offence began outside the area.",
      "The referee announced inside the stadium: “After review, the Fulham 15 commits a holding offence outside the penalty area. The final decision is a free kick to Manchester United.”",
      "From the resulting free-kick Bruno Fernandes hoisted a delivery into the box, with Casemiro rising highest to head home and give the Manchester outfit the ideal start. Marco Silva was booked for his protests with his side needing to come from behind.",
      "Silva has been among the names loosely linked with the job at Old Trafford, which will become vacant in the summer. He is out of contract at Fulham and may consider a fresh challenge. But the role at United could yet go to Carrick if he continues with his blistering start.",
      "Casemiro put Man Utd in front from the resulting free-kick",
      "Before the contest United supporters had been protesting outside the ground, taking aim at the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Two marches - one from the Hotel Football end of the ground and one from the top of Sir Matt Busby Way - converged at The Trinity statue on the forecourt of Old Trafford.",
      "The turnout wasn't as big as previous protests, but still involved a few thousand supporters. Carrick was also confident that it wasn't going to impact on his players, who are on a roll having beaten Manchester City and Liverpool over the past fortnight.",

      "There has been even more talk around the future of Marcus Rashford.(Image: JOSE JORDAN, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Out-on-loan Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has reacted to his latest goal for Barcelona as the question marks swirl around his long-term future at the club. The England player is spending the campaign on loan with the Catalan giants, who hold a £26million option to secure his services permanently.",
      "Nevertheless, recent speculation indicates that Michael Carrick would be eager to recall Rashford to United and reintegrate him into their first-team setup. That's should he land the managerial role al Old Trafford on a full-time basis when the campaign ends.",
      "However, it's suggested that the player himself would prefer to stay put with Barca. His most recent social media activity hinted that might could be the case.",
      "Rashford found the net during Barcelona's 3-1 triumph away at Elche on Saturday, netting the club's third strike of the encounter to wrap up the points. Posting on Instagram following the fixture, Rashford shared images from the match, accompanied by the message: \"Good night in Elche. 10 goals in blaugrana feels good.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The strike marked Rashford's second in consecutive outings - following his effort in Wednesday night's 4-1 victory over Copenhagen in the Champions League. Prior to that clash, the England international acknowledged that he's required some time to settle into life at Barcelona.",
      "\"But it's our way of playing, it brings an intensity to the game. I think when we play at this intensity it's difficult for teams to match us.",
      "\"For me it takes a little bit of learning to get used to, because you can't let them rest on the ball. And whoever is closest to the ball always has to put pressure.",
      "Marcus Rashford continues to impress for Barcelona. (Image: Alex Caparros - UEFA, UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "\"So it's a little bit different to what I'd done before. But this is the style of defence we play and when it works it's really good.\"",
      "Since completing his loan switch to Barcelona during the summer, Rashford has featured in 32 matches across all competitions. He's netted 10 goals and contributed 12 assists, as well.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United manager Michael Carrick is familiar with Hayden Hackney(Image: Craig Thomas)",
      "Manchester United boss Michael Carrick is understood to be a big fan of Middlesbrough midfielder Hayden Hackney. Following speculation linking the 23-year-old with a switch to Old Trafford, Hackney has now spoken about what lies ahead.",
      "Carrick has taken charge of his former side for a second time following Ruben Amorim's sacking and has already secured wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. His previous role saw him spend nearly three years as Middlesbrough manager.",
      "Throughout that period, the 44-year-old worked closely with Hackney. The midfielder has attracted top-flight interest for a while now, and Carrick's arrival has only intensified speculation connecting him with United.",
      "However, Hackney has now broken his silence on a possible January switch, clarifying his situation at Middlesbrough and putting paid to any last-minute plans Carrick might have had.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "After 30 Championship fixtures, Middlesbrough occupy a share of top spot with Premier League promotion within reach. They edged past Norwich 1-0 on Saturday in a crucial encounter, with skipper Hackney scoring the decisive goal.",
      "Speaking afterwards, Hackney was questioned about his future and left little doubt about his transfer intentions. Asked whether he would be departing before the deadline, he replied: \"No. I'm really happy.",
      "The 23-year-old scored his side's winner against Norwich(Image: Getty)",
      "\"The manager [Kim Hellberg] has got me playing the way I enjoy playing, getting the best out of me. So yeah, I'm really enjoying it. This is what I've wanted to do ever since I was a kid: play for Middlesbrough.",
      "\"And where we are in the league at the minute, as long as we just keep going, we feel confident. Winning promotion with Middlesbrough would mean everything to me. I don't know how I'd be, but I know I'd be over the moon. That is the dream.\"",
      "This development will serve as a minor setback for Carrick, who has previously heaped praise on Hackney. During his time at Middlesbrough in 2024, Carrick lauded the midfielder's qualities.",
      "\"You couldn't ask for much more from Hayden,\" Carrick remarked two years ago. \"He's grounded, he's humble, he's down to earth and loves to learn. He loves the place and he loves the club as well. To have that, added with the talent he has got, it's the perfect scenario. I think it just shows his consistency really, over a long period of time.",
      "Hackney played under Carrick(Image: PA)",
      "\"It's not easy when you're a younger player, but he's certainly done that. There is a level of talent out there in and around football and sometimes it might not be that different player to player, but levels can be jumped, or not, if your head is not in the right place and you don't go about your business in the right way and treat your profession with respect.",
      "\"Hayden certainly does that. He's been exemplary really since I've been here and I really enjoy working with him. He's desperate for more, desperate to learn, and he's a real credit to his family, to himself and to the club.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford was on the scoresheet for a second game in a row(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Marcus Rashford is continuing to prove his worth to Barcelona as uncertainty surrounds his future ahead of the summer transfer window. The Manchester United forward, currently on loan at the LaLiga champions until the end of the season, is making a strong case for a permanent move with his impressive performances.",
      "Rashford netted Barca's third goal in their 3-1 victory over Elche on Saturday, helping to restore their four-point advantage over Real Madrid at the summit. After replacing Raphinha in the 46th minute, the 28-year-old was a constant threat and got his reward by firing home from close range, just moments after squandering a one-on-one opportunity.",
      "Despite the win, Barca manager Hansi Flick criticised his team's failure to put the game to bed, stating: \"We can't keep missing these chances. It's good that we created so many chances, but we needed to finish off the game in the first half and score many more goals.",
      "\"This is always our focus. We want to win every match. It's good to see this, and we're happy to play with confidence and play so well.\" If the Catalan club opts to sign Rashford permanently, there have been tentative suggestions that a deal could involve Marc Casado, who Man United are reportedly interested in acquiring.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "However, whilst any talk of a swap deal has been dismissed by Hansi Flick, who insisted the young midfielder won't be departing the club, the future of the United loanee remains uncertain. Rashford's strike against Elche, along with the lift he provided when introduced, has now become a talking point amongst Spanish journalists.",
      "Writing in Marca, Fernando Carnerero commended Barcelona's determination to see out the match despite squandering numerous clear-cut opportunities against Elche. The opposition's threat on the break presented a genuine challenge for the visitors, but that was nullified by Rashford's goal which followed a \"great run\" by Lamine Yamal.",
      "He wrote: \"Barca missed another chance to seal the victory when Rashford went one-on-one with the Englishman, but his shot went well wide. Flick's men were still playing with fire with 20 minutes remaining. Elche had another good opportunity, but Álvaro Rodríguez couldn't quite reach it and Eric García cleared it for a corner.",
      "\"However, Alejandro Muñiz signalled for a goal kick, and from that corner came Rashford's goal to make it 3-1 after a great run by Lamine Yamal. The goal was vehemently protested by the Elche players and resulted in a yellow card for Sarabia.\"",
      "Javier Gascon from Mundo Deportivo may have criticised Rashford for spurning a golden chance before his goal, but conceded redemption arrived through his strike which sealed Barcelona's triumph. The Spanish publication also provided individual player ratings for everyone who took part in the match, including Rashford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He was described as an 'opportunist' following his performance during the 45 minutes he was on the pitch. The report stated: \"He came on after halftime to attack the spaces.",
      "\"Like all his teammates, he missed an unforgivable goal in a one-on-one with Peña. He made amends, scoring the third goal with a clinical finish into an empty net. Peña then denied him a fourth goal.\"",
      "The England international received high praise from Santi Gimenez in his assessment for AS too. The journalist identified Rashford's second-half introduction as the turning point that reignited Barcelona's hopes.",
      "He stated: \"But it was Rashford who breathed life into Barcelona thanks to another moment of brilliance from Lamine Yamal, who, from outside the pitch, prevented the ball from going out of play with a header, controlled it and assisted the Englishman, who unleashed a furious shot into the net, fuelled by the frustration of someone who, like so many others, had missed sitters.\"",

My wife still reminds me of that regularly.\"",

      "It's been over 20 years since Wayne joined United in 2004, later becoming the club's greatest-ever goalscorer with 253 goals in 559 appearances. When he hung up his boots in 2021, he also held the distinction of being England's all-time top scorer.",
      "With his dad having carved out such a remarkable legacy, Kai's young career naturally invites comparison. Yet Wayne and Coleen have always been mindful of the pressure their sons would face and refused to force football upon them.",
      "That is why Kai was allowed to sign for Manchester City aged seven, having admitted he wasn't enjoying himself at United. He ultimately left City when Wayne relocated to America to play for DC United.

      "Cole Palmer's switch to Manchester United appears to be dead in the water despite intense speculation linking him with the club this week. Reports suggested he was unsettled in London and, being a United supporter, a transfer to Old Trafford appeared feasible.",
      "However, as The Mirror revealed, United won't be pursuing the England international, instead focusing on landing a world-class defensive midfielder. The club already snapped up Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha last summer so they're well-covered in attacking midfield positions.",
      "Yet there was a period when Palmer nearly put pen to paper with United. Speaking on the Talk of the Devils podcast last year, academy coach Colin Little disclosed what he understood about a potential Palmer transfer.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"I know Cole Palmer's family quite well, I know his dad and his uncle,\" he said in 2025. \"We (Man United) were close to getting Cole Palmer when he was about 16, believe it or not.",
      "\"He was umming and ahhing, and I knew he was a big United fan. He was at that age where you're allowed to leave, 16 is it? They were umming and ahhing, Man City, about it.",
      "\"I think City, in the end, made him a good enough offer, but really he was always a United fan, and it was close, I remember speaking. I think City needed to show him a bit more love and that kind of stuff. We never quite got it over the line, but it would've been nice if we did, wouldn't it?\".",
      "Palmer will be staying put for now(Image: Photo by Franco Romano/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Palmer put pen to paper on a nine-year deal with Chelsea upon his arrival in 2023, meaning he remains contracted to the club until at least 2033. Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior has addressed the rumours directly this week.",
      "\"There's no reason for assurance. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere. There's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation. That's where I'm at,\" said Rosenior.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. I've had numerous conversations with him. Our thoughts are on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him.",
      "Cole Palmer was linked with a move to Manchester United(Image: Photo by Giuseppe Maffia/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "\"He loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player. You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth. There's no point in having a discussion about it.\"",
      "\"But I've scored away and a few here today, so I'm buzzing. I just try and take each game as it comes and show the Chelsea fans and everyone what I came here to do, and that is just play football.\"",

      "A former Manchester United star recalled his decision to leave Old Trafford(Image: Stu Forster/Getty Images)",
      "Louis Saha has enjoyed considerable success since retiring from football, but his final moments at Manchester United were agonising. Two of the striker's former clubs are poised to meet this weekend, having moved from Fulham to United in January 2004.",
      "The France international made an immediate impact under Sir Alex Ferguson, finding the net seven times in 12 league outings during the remainder of his debut campaign. He bagged 42 goals across 124 appearances throughout his Old Trafford stint, helping secure two Premier League crowns.",
      "Saha also witnessed the club's thrilling Champions League final triumph over Chelsea in 2008. However, the forward was absent from the matchday squad for the Moscow showpiece.",
      "Missing out on the Champions League final left Saha convinced his United career was finished. The French striker had been suspended for the 2006 World Cup final and had once more been denied a place on football's biggest stage.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Speaking about the Champions League final to FourFourTwo in 2019, Saha said: \"It was the worst. I'd worked really hard to come back from injury, and I'd also learned from my mistake at the World Cup.",
      "\"It took me four or five years to realise how painful it was, when I wrote my book, because when I finally tried to explain how it felt, I realised how much damage it did to my confidence. It was after missing that final that I talked to the manager and said, 'I need to leave.'\"",
      "He added: \"It became very religious for me when I missed the Champions League final as well [as the World Cup final]. I thought, 'Why has God given me these platforms to perform, but then taken it away from me?' It was the first time I ever cried about football. I couldn't bear it – I was in pain for two or three weeks.\"",
      "After his Champions League disappointment, Saha completed a switch to Everton that summer. During a three-and-a-half-year spell with the Toffees, he netted 35 times in 115 appearances, including an early strike in Everton's FA Cup final loss to Chelsea in 2009.",
      "Louis Saha was an instant hit after signing for Manchester United in January 2004(Image:  Ben Radford/Getty Images)",
      "Looking back on his Everton transfer, Saha said: \"It was the right move at the right moment for me. I loved Manchester United - I had a lot of injuries but the manager was always there for me. He taught me to be loyal and have respect. Those things remain within me today.\"",
      "Stints at Tottenham Hotspur, Sunderland and Lazio followed before Saha hung up his boots in 2013. Since retiring, the 47-year-old has built substantial wealth through his company AxisStars.",
      "He co-founded the enterprise with Katie Hamer and the firm, which enables connections between \"professional athletes and entertainers, their peers and trusted partners,\" is believed to be associated with more than 500 former athletes. As CEO of AxisStars, Saha has reported a net worth of around £4.3billion.",
      "Saha scored five in 24 games during his final season at Manchester United (Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "A profile of Saha on the AxisStars website states: \"Since hanging up his boots, Louis has moved into the world of business where he has used his experience to develop propositions to support athletes and other people in the public eye, in their careers.\"",
      "Saha enjoyed three-and-a-half seasons at Fulham before his United switch, with his 27 goals helping the west London outfit secure Premier League promotion in 2001. He had found the net 13 times in 21 league outings at the beginning of the 2003/04 season, prompting United to make their move.",

The ex-United midfielder was named as the club's interim head coach until the end of the season after Ruben Amorim was sacked.",
      "Carrick, 44, has had an impressive start to his Old Trafford reign with victories over Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two matches at the helm. With the January transfer window approaching and Carrick's contract set to expire at the end of the season, it's possible he won't be involved in any player transfers during his short tenure.",
      "This summer is a crucial one for United, who will appoint a permanent manager tasked with deciding the futures of several players currently out on loan, including Rashford. The 28-year-old forward joined Barcelona on a season-long loan last summer and has openly expressed his wish to secure a permanent deal with the Spanish heavyweights.",
      "With Rashford currently due to return to Manchester at the end of the season, club legend Teddy Sheringham stated that past issues with former managers won't affect a potential reunion with his childhood club.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "In an exclusive interview, via Mr Q, the former forward shared his thoughts on whether he'd like to see the club's loaned players return. He stated: \"I think there are a few players like that, Sancho, Rashford, and Hojlund, who are out on loan at the moment.",
      "\"When a new manager takes over, everyone has a clean slate.\" Rashford and Carrick played together at United for three seasons and Sheringham believes that the public doesn't fully understand the relationship between the interim boss and the loaned players.",
      "He elaborated: \"You don't know the situation or what relationship Michael Carrick has with all these players. He might have a way of making them perform. So it's great that they're still attached to Manchester United and that Michael Carrick has that option and has them at his disposal.",
      "Marcus Rashford is on loan at Barcelona(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"Get them back in and see where their mindset is. They're obviously good players, so give them another chance if they want it and all is forgiven. That's the way I see it.\" With Carrick's immediate positive impact on the United squad, there's been speculation about whether the club's hierarchy could offer him the permanent job if the good results continue.",
      "Sheringham conceded that the club might opt for an experienced manager, but he feels that Carrick's approach is exactly what United need. The former England striker expressed: \"Listen, they might go down either line, but I like the fact that Michael Carrick is in there.",
      "Michael Carrick has enjoyed a stellar start to life with Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"He knows the club, understands the supporters and what they want from a football team. He has the backing of Sir Alex Ferguson and can tap into his experience. I know it's very early days, but I think it's a really good fit.",
      "\"I like his demeanour around the place, and I presume he's strong enough to handle things when they start getting tough. He's been there and done it, and seen it all as a player, so I wish him the best of luck.\"",

      "“I think for the front guys we have to put as much pressure on the ball as possible because the problem is when players have time on the ball to pick the passes and to see what our backline is doing,” he said.",
      "“If they do have time then the backline have to adjust. But it’s our way of playing, it brings an intensity to the game. I think when we play at this intensity it’s difficult for teams to match us.",

      "“For me it takes a little bit of learning to get used to because you can’t let them rest on the ball. Whoever is closest to the ball always has to put pressure. So it’s a little bit different to what I’d done before. But this is the style of defence we play and when it works it’s really good.”",
      "Flick has regularly heaped praise on Rashford and hinted that the final decision over his future will lie with Sporting Director Deco.",
      "He said: \"Marcus' performances have been really good until now, so we have to manage it, but it's Deco's job to do things for next season.",
      "\"We have to wait. We have months to go. For me, of course with Marcus we have a player on the top level, but also with our situation, and what I appreciate a lot from him [is his desire to be here].\"",
      "Rashford played with Michael Carrick during the latter stages of his playing career",
      "As for the January window, United look set to stand pat, not making any major moves with key departures also unlikely. Joshua Zirkzee had been linked with a potential return to Italy, but Carrick has said he wants him to remain at the club.",
      "\"Josh is just trying to work to get fit and get around the group,” he explained on Friday. “It has been great to have him back training with the group for the first time.",
      "“That is as far as it goes, for me and for Josh. I am looking forward to working with him. That's it, nothing else has been needed to be said.\"",

      "Amad: Deserved an assist when Sesko headed his cross against the post. An excellent performance on the wing, used the ball well and had the beating of his man every time. 9",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Good free-kick to set up Casemiro's goal. Fulham's big defensive midfielders gave him a bit of a going over at times but stuck to the task well. Brilliant late assist. 8",

      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Marco Silva's side threatened through the middle at Old Trafford and Casemiro and Mainoo had plenty of work to get through, but Carrick was delighted with what he saw from the Stockport-born youngster, who is enjoying a stunning renaissance under this management.",
      "\"Kobbie’s performance was very, very good today in so many ways again,\" he said. \"You could see that the way Fulham play and overload the middle times in the movements, and there was a lot of work for Kobbie and Cassie to do, particularly in the middle of the pitch.",
      "\"So that was without the ball, and I thought he's terrific in that. And then with the ball, I’ve spoken about it before, about the ability to just cope, he's not really fazed by it. He just plays his game. He understands what's needed and it's the moments of quality.",
      "\"It's kind of what we come to expect from him in many ways and what I come to expect, but you forget how young he is still. He's still got loads to come, but seeing him today and playing with that kind of confidence and belief. That's a real joy to watch, to be honest, for any young player.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick also reserved praise for Harry Maguire, who continued his own impressive return to the side with an excellent display against Fulham, with the 32-year-old's experience once again invaluable.",
      "Maguire's performances could yet earn him a new contract, while he is also trying to force his way back into Thomas Tuchel's England squad for the World Cup this summer.",

      "\"He is what he is; he's such a big presence and he’s been there, seen it and done it. Similarly, I think that helps within the group when we've got some young players who are still learning.",
      "\"So I think he's had a big influence with that, and just that composure, as I say, to understand the moments and not be fazed by it, being a big presence there with him and Licha, particularly at the back, give us the foundation to build on.",

      "Manchester United celebrate Benjamin Sesko's winner",
      "Welcome to Carrick time. Michael Carrick played in plenty of those sorts of games for Manchester United and now he knows what it feels like to manage one as well.",
      "For the second week in a row, Carrick's United reacted to a late equaliser by going up the other end and scoring an even later winner. When Kevin hit a stunning leveller for Fulham in the 91st minute at Old Trafford, United hearts sank.",
      "They had thrown away a commanding position in the final five minutes, and players slumped to the turf. But an afternoon to forget for VAR had led to nine added minutes, and for United at their best, that is always more than enough time. To rehash a phrash we've heard a lot of recently, this is in their DNA. We weren't even halfway through that time when Benjamin Sesko controlled Bruno Fernandes' cross and arrowed a shot into the roof of the Stretford End net.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "It sent Old Trafford wild, but Carrick and assistant Steve Holland were the calmest men in the building. United's subs had torn off down the touchline to celebrate the goal, and with the noise threatening to take the roof off, Holland raced after them, telling Leny Yoro he was needed to come on and see out the win.",
      "United survived a nervy finale that took us into the 102nd minute to secure Carrick a third successive win. That already matches the longest winning run of the Ruben Amorim era and Carrick was again serenaded by the Stretford End at full-time.",
      "He was also wrapped in another embrace by the outstanding Casemiro, who scored one and set another up as part of an excellent midfield display alongside the tenacious Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Carrick knows a thing or two about what it takes to play in midfield for United. If Casemiro is the here and now, Mainoo is once again the future. The veteran relishing his prolonged farewell tour and the boy from Stockport who could have easily left the club this month have quickly re-established an impressive partnership.",
      "This was Mainoo's best performance since returning to the team. He began January thinking he would have to leave United to play first-team football. Now he is one of the first names on the teamsheet.",
      "One thunderous first-half tackle on Raul Jimenez set the tone for a display that mixed steel with real quality. He dictated the tempo when it required controlling and the speed of his play was integral to creating space for United.",
      "Mainoo might not be Casemiro's direct replacement, but he does again look like a long-term fixture in this midfield, which wasn't the case a month ago. He always backed himself to outlast Amorim and days like this make you realise what a relief it is that he was right.",
      "For all that the dramatic finale will dominate headlines, this felt like a step forward for United at home, where they have been passive against this level of opposition for too long. They played with tempo and invention, led by the brilliant Amad, who gave Antonee Robinson an afternoon he will want to forget.",
      "Fulham were angry with the manner of United's opener. John Brooks pointed to the spot when Jorge Cuenca appeared to foul Matheus Cunha, but replays showed the centre-back took the ball. Discussions between Brooks and VAR James Bell revealed that Brooks said the penalty had been given for holding. Bell adjudged that to have happened outside the box, and told the referee to award a free-kick instead.",
      "Cuenca did have a hand on Cunha's shirt at one point, but it felt soft. United were grateful for their handout. Fernandes' delightful free-kick was lofted onto the head of Casemiro, who headed beyond Bernd Leno for his first goal since confirming he will leave the club at the end of the season.",
      "A sign of United's ambition in possession came early in the second half when Diogo Dalot suddenly found himself in the kind of position you would expect to see Fernandes. Dalot timed the pass perfectly for Bryan Mbeumo's run, but Leno smothered the shot.",
      "United were managing to sustain attacks, however, and the pressure eventually paid off. Cunha's emphatic finish in front of the Stretford End came after a spell when Fulham just couldn't get out. Every time they threatened to clear their lines they were pounced on, with Dalot and Mainoo particularly impressive in winning the ball back.",
      "That eventually allowed Casemiro space to pick a pass 25 yards from goal. He weighted his delivery to Cunha so well that his countryman didn't have to break stride before slamming the ball into the roof of the net.",
      "That should have been that for United and Sesko missed a chance to kill the game off when he headed Amad's cross against the post just seconds after coming on. That miss threatened to be costly when Fulham scored with five minutes to go.",
      "Maguire was a little unlucky in conceding the penalty, taking Jimenez out as the Mexican got his shot away. The striker made no mistake when sending his penalty into the roof of the net.",
      "Then Kevin cut in from the left and curled a sensational finish into the far corner, sending Fulham's travelling supporters wild. It looked like being more dropped points at Old Trafford for United, until Sesko's sensational intervention.",

      "Sesko came off the bench to register his best moment for Manchester United since joining from RB Leipzig for £73million in the summer, turning on a Bruno Fernandes cross and producing a fine finish in front of the Stretford End.",
      "The 22-year-old found some form under Darren Fletcher but had been on the bench for all of Carrick's first three games in charge. But after scoring three times in two starts under Fletcher, he showed the pause hadn't robbed him of momentum.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Sesko sent a header against the post soon after coming on, a chance he should have scored and which would have put United 3-0 up against the Cottagers. That miss could have proved costly as Marco Silva's side scored two late goals to snatch what looked like being a point.",
      "But United went up the other end, and Fernandes found Sesko for the winner, with Carrick crediting his staff for the work they have done with the youngster, for who he believes that could turn out to be a big moment in his United career.",
      "Sesko received a standing ovation when he returned to the dressing room and Carrick felt that showed what his teammates think of him.",
      "\"Huge moment. I'm so, so pleased. I think everyone in the changing room, players, staff, absolutely delighted for him and the reception he got when he came back in the changing room, kind of told us everything,\" said Carrick.",
      "\"He's been confident, to be honest. I think he's been fantastic. We've worked with him a lot in different ways over the last couple of weeks. He's been bright in training, he's looked dangerous, he's done extra. The coaches have done a lot of bits on the side, and Trav particularly has done a lot of work one-on-one with him.",
      "\"Ben's a big talent and he's got so many positive things and today's a huge goal because that feeling as a striker you have to score a winner in front of the Stretford End like that, it's kind of what you dream of really and after missing a chance, which is what it is for strikers to miss chances to go again, and put that away, absolutely so, so pleased from him. He really deserves it.\"",
      "Binnion was promoted to Carrick's first-team staff from his role as Under-21s head coach at United and his work with Sesko paid off, judging by the young striker's calmness in front of goal to net the winner and secure a third straight win for the new-look coaching staff",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"I knew today was going to be a really tough game,\" added Carrick. \"You’re getting questions all week about what you're going to do about breaking down a low block. Fulham were never going to do that.",
      "\"They've shown that this is a really, really good team. So we knew today was going to be a big, big challenge, and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.",
      "\"Even at 2-0. They were 5-1 down against City and ended up coming back to 5-4. We knew that going into the game. I think the character to show that once we've had that big setback, it was a huge setback in the 90th minute, to do that on the back of what we did last week, off a setback, it’s probably the most pleasing thing, to keep the belief, keep the confidence.",
      "\"The rest of the game we can play better at times, we can do things a lot better in certain moments, but I can't fault the players, the spirit is taking us through today and it's a good feeling when it does.\"",

      "Then, following a VAR check, Brooks informed supporters inside the stadium that a free-kick, positioned just outside the right side of the area, was going to be awarded instead of a penalty. This came after it was viewed that Cuenca had a hold of Cunha's shirt and fouled him before the two players made their way into the box.",

Indeed, just moments after Fulham had made it 2-2 through Kevin, Bruno Fernandes set up Sesko to hammer the ball into the top corner and snatch all three points.",
      "And as Sesko wheeled away to celebrate in the South-West corner, Zirkzee, who had been warming up, was the first United player to run across to the forward to celebrate with him, grabbing him and showing how delighted he was. That came as a surprise to some United fans as Sesko and Zirkzee have been battling for first-team minutes throughout most of the season.",

      "The Premier League have explained why VAR made the decision to rule a Fulham goal out against Manchester United on Sunday. Marco Silva's side thought they had pulled one back in the 65th minute when Jorge Cuenca tapped home from close range after Samuel Chukwueze's shot was blocked.",
      "The ball had fallen to Chukwueze inside the box after Raul Jimenez's free-kick hit the wall, and the former's snapshot was blocked by Lisandro Martinez before Cuenca was there to prod into the back of the net. However, following a long check, VAR decided to rule out the goal as it was viewed that Chukwueze was offside in the build-up.",
      "Replays showed that Chukwueze's shoulder strayed beyond the last man - Amad Diallo - and therefore VAR stepped in and ruled the goal out, despite a delay of around four minutes.",

      "With United leading 2-0 thanks to goals either side of half-time from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha, Fulham did eventually pull one back in the 85th minute and it came from the penalty spot. After Harry Maguire fouled Jimenez inside the area, the Mexican pulled himself back up to score from 12 yards.",

So with expectations skyrocketing and an opponent seemingly running away with the Premier League title, what were the chances of Carrick being able to mastermind another sensational victory?",

United smothered the defence when the home side ventured into their half which made it impossible for the Gunners to play through the lines.",
      "Once United regained possession, Amad and Dorgu burst out of their holding roles to join the attack. Just as it was against City, the Reds were happy to not have the ball.",
      "Before the game, we all knew where United could be outdone - set pieces. The Reds are no strangers to scoring from corners and free kicks this season but it is Arsenal who have managed to perfect the craft.",
      "The Gunners tried a number of routines to unpick the Reds with only one working, (we will get onto that). But one tactical decision Carrick employed to counteract the Arsenal threat, was to give Harry Maguire a free role defensively.",
      "As Maguire is easily United's strongest header of the ball, it made sense to have him focused on watching its flight rather than being bogged down in a tussle with one of Arsenal's strapping centre halves. Speaking of which.",
      "United were caught out by one set piece in the game and were punished but, for the most part, they defended them well. Arsenal's tactic was to pile their aerial threats around Senne Lammens to cause chaos.",
      "When they attempted that, United's rebuttal was to try and do everything in their power to leave Lammens free so he could punch clear. The one time United were not able to stop the opposition, they conceded.",
      "Fortunately for the Reds, they were willing to embrace the battle and the scrappier side of the match. They played Arsenal at their own game and were victorious.",
      "Harry Maguire and Gabriel exchange a war of words during Manchester United's victory over Arsenal",
      "It was not that long ago Jamie Carragher was on Monday Night Football expressing how Casemiro's legs had gone and football had left him. Sunday was yet more proof this long goodbye could be a brilliant swansong for the Brazilian.",
      "On paper, you would think Kobbie Mainoo was most likely to be the box-to-box midfielder in the United system but in reality, it was Casemiro pushing up towards the No.10 position when pressing and then dropping deep when Arsenal were on the front foot.",
      "When United were in possession and on the attack, Casemiro did well to shuttle play out onto the flanks from an advanced role. The Brazilian's passing range is underrated but few would have predicted him being capable of playing such a physically demanding position so well - but he did.",
      "What we saw too often last season was United's centre-forward - usually Rasmus Hojlund - struggling at the top of the pitch trying to perform the pressing duty solo. There are few players in the modern game who can do that for the entirety of a match.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo is much more mobile and willing to do the unseen work but even he cannot do it for a full 90 minutes. The Cameroonian shared this responsibility with Amad and this allowed the forward to recharge his batteries so that when the time came, he was ready.",
      "The first goal proved United were more than just a team willing to sit back. When Gabriel received the ball, he was met with a wall of players in front of him.",
      "United were helped by Martin Odegaard not dropping back to support the defender but the initiative of Casemiro and Mainoo to step up and ensure the attack and midfield pressed as one was impressive. By the time Martin Zubimendi played the loose ball straight into Mbeumo's path, there was little more he could have done to avoid that outcome. It was a masterclass in pressing from the Reds.",
      "In the first half, Lammens overshot a long ball upfield towards Mbeumo and the Arsenal defence easily mopped up possession. Instead of lambasting his goalkeeper, the Cameroonian could be seen showing appreciation for the idea and it became clear why.",
      "With the score locked at 2-2, Lammens went long again and this time reached his target of Benjamin Sesko. Other than Matheus Cunha, Sesko played the biggest role in the winner.",
      "His strength and ability to knock the ball down for Fernandes opened the Arsenal defence up. It still required a moment of genius from Cunha but without having the focal point at the top of the pitch, United would not have scored a third.",

      "\"He knows the feeling, he played here so many years. He knows the feeling for Manchester, he knows the feeling for United,” Cunha told BBC Sport.",
      "“He knows how the fans want to feel. He tried to show us every single moment, he tried to talk us to understand in moments and say 'everyone is against us', so I think we feel more together.\"",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates Matheus Cunha's goal with his coaching staff",
      "It was half an hour until midnight when the Manchester United coaches carrying players and staff arrived back at Carrington on Sunday. The ecstasy of their win at the Emirates was beginning to wear off, and another long week was stretching out in front of them.",
      "Michael Carrick and his staff had spent the journey home poring over footage from the game and preparing for the week ahead. Although the players have Monday off, the coaching staff were in, finalising session plans ahead of the weekend's game with Fulham. At 1pm, they strolled over to watch the Under-21s take on Brighton in the Premier League 2 at Carrington.",
      "That is the third academy game since Carrick took over and the third he has attended. The diligence of the 44-year-old and his staff has been noted around the building. Two weeks ago, the mood at Old Trafford was one of despondency. When United were knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton, the picture had become clear. There were 17 Premier League games remaining, and that was it. Another season of drift looked set for a long, drawn-out conclusion.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "There was no anger towards Darren Fletcher after that FA Cup exit. The Scot had been a safe pair of hands for a week after the chaos of Ruben Amorim's exit, but it felt like nobody was enjoying themselves any more. Not the players, and definitely not the supporters.",
      "Contrast that with the scenes in the away end at the Emirates on Sunday. Fifteen minutes after the final whistle had blown, there were United fans still there, slowly drifting towards the exit and the North London night. \"It's Carrick, you know...\" could be heard echoing back up into the stands.",
      "Inside the bowels of the stadium, Carrick was just about to speak to Norwegian broadcaster Viaplay when he was pulled away for a meeting with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. It wasn't a job offer yet, but if this carries on, one might not be too far away.",
      "Although you could argue this is just a continuation of his three-game spell as caretaker in November 2021. To the wins against Unai Emery and Mikel Arteta and a draw against Thomas Tuchel, he has added a victory against Pep Guardiola and another success against Arteta. It is shaping up as a seriously impressive coaching CV at the highest level.",
      "United got the Carrick era off to a winning start against Manchester City",
      "Carrick has been unflappable since taking the reins from Fletcher. He is unobtrusive, low-key and has his feet planted so firmly on the floor that it's a surprise it isn't a challenge to lift them when he needs to move. He showed little emotion on the touchline on Sunday, only coming to life in front of the away end at full-time, with his two children among the 3,000 or so away supporters.",
      "It might have felt strange for them to be singing a song in their dad's honour, but then they might have been the only ones not doing so. Carrick has eschewed grand statements since his return. There has been no mention of chats with Sir Alex Ferguson, no real mention of his playing days or past glories. When it was put to him that United could do with a midfielder like Carrick now, he was self-effacing and made fun of himself.",
      "There has been no schmaltz or nostalgia since his return. This hasn't been a renaissance built on someone talking about the United DNA, but on someone delivering the United DNA. Two very different performances have produced the same result.",
      "This is a triumph of substance over style. It's been built on the training ground as much as Carrick is taking the plaudits now, he knows the work of Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion is essential to what they have delivered in the space of two weeks.",
      "For 14 months, Ruben Amorim wanted more time on the training pitches, but when he got what he wished for, he made little use of it. Whether the blame for that lies with Amorim or his experienced backroom team, it's clear that this thrown-together coaching set-up under Carrick is maximising the time they have.",
      "They had three sessions to prepare for Manchester City and delivered a game plan to dominate the derby and play front-foot, counter-attacking football. They then had a full week to come up with a strategy for the trip to Arsenal and delivered an approach that blocked space and offered the hosts nothing from open play.",
      "You can see the players have brought into it. Holland deserves plenty of plaudits as well. He is the most experienced member of the coaching staff and the Mancunian has quickly won the respect of the squad.",
      "The challenge for Carrick and co will change now. They have delivered tactical successes in games in which they were outsiders, but against Fulham on Sunday, United will have the ball and need to dictate the game. That will call for a change of focus this week.",
      "Cunha celebrates his dramatic late winner against Arsenal",
      "Carrick said after the win at the Emirates that there were \"layers\" still to add to the game plan and things to improve. Some of that will be related to breaking down a low block. United's kryptonite recently has been beating teams at home that they should be beating.",
      "If they do that and do it with style, then the clamour for Carrick will only grow. The man himself is refusing to say whether he even wants the job.",
      "\"I am here to do a job,\" he said on Sunday \"When I came here less than two weeks ago, I said we would make every decision for the bigger picture.",
      "\"We are not getting carried away. It is two huge results, but we will keep our feet on the ground. I am enjoying it and I will continue to do what I can.\"",
      "That has been more than good enough so far, but a different kind of test awaits this week.",

United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory at the Emirates thanks to a late goal from Matheus Cunha, which condemned Arsenal to a first home defeat in the Premier League this season.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo equalised in the first half and Patrick Dorgu scored a stunning goal to fire United into the lead. Mikel Merino thought he'd salvaged a point for Arsenal when he scored with seven minutes remaining, but there was another twist when Cunha found the net to seal an away victory.",
      "Ratcliffe attended the game with Omar Berrada, United CEO, and Jason Wilcox, United football director. After full-time, the Ineos entourage was spotted making its way to the dressing room area within the Emirates. Lammens was asked whether Ratcliffe had popped into the dressing room to speak to the players, and he responded: \"No, I just saw him there when we came out of the dressing room.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"He was talking to the coach. It's nice to see them [United board] as well, like supporting the team as well, as they have. So it's always a good feeling and good support for them.\"",
      "Lammens has made a strong impact since signing for £18.2million from Royal Antwerp in the summer. \"I think it was one of the better ones, better feelings of my career,\" he said of the win over the Gunners.",
      "\"Away as well, yeah, whilst last week [against City] was at home, which is also really nice and really special. This one felt like a little bit more hard work. It wasn't always the best play from us, but they also games you have to win if you want to be at the top.",
      "\"So today we did that, I think just hardworking, defending together, and then at the end, the subs like Cunha made a difference, and also, the people who come in give our team energy.\"",
      "Lammens claims the ball at the Emirates.(Image: 2026 Marc Atkins)",
      "Michael Carrick has overseen wins over Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games since his appointment as head coach, and Lammens put the team's improvement down to going back to basics.",
      "\"To be honest, there's not many special things he did. It's just like sticking to the basics,\" said Lammens. \"Football is basics. If you do the basics well, then the quality of us comes out, and I think we have players with the quality that can make the difference.",
      "\"But if you just do the basics right technically, we're standing right, defending good together. And just [playing] as a team, to be honest, he made it really clear what he wants from us and what he expects from us.",
      "\"And I think today as well, on the pitch sometimes it [the plan] didn't really come out, but if you fight as a team and if you keep believing in it, then you can still get the win.\"",
      "When asked about Carrick's post-match message to the players, Lammens said: \"To be honest, the same things. It wasn't the prettiest game, but those were the most difficult ones. Last week was, I think, in every aspect, a good game. I think we play really well. Today was not always perfect.",
      "\"But like I said before, if you work hard as a team, you can always win. And now it's up to us. We're there, top four, to stay there and to even look above us. Those games against those top teams, you have to win.",
      "\"But now the coming weeks, when they expect more from us, when we are the favourite to win, then you also have to pull through and those are also really important games.\"",
      "United welcome Fulham to Old Trafford next weekend. \"They are sometimes the most difficult ones, the ones you have to win, so to speak,\" he said. \"It's still a long way from the end of the season, so we don't want to look at the end. Like at the table, but yeah, we know we're there [top four].",
      "\"We know we can play against those better teams, so now we have to win against those teams who are maybe a little bit more difficult to play against, playing against low blocks. If you want to be a great team, you have to win against those teams as well.\"",

Arsenal equalised through Mikel Merino, but there was another twist in the tale when Matheus Cunha came off the bench to make it 3-2 with a superb shot from the edge of the box.",
      "Michael Carrick has started his interim gig with wins over Manchester City and Arsenal. United have moved to fourth in the table, which means they are now in a promising position to qualify for the Champions League. Here are the moments you might have missed...",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Dorgu shocked himself",
      "Dorgu scored one of the finest goals of the season and didn't know what to do with himself as he celebrated. The 21-year-old was just as stunned as everyone in the crowd at his strike.",
      "There were limbs in the away end as Dorgu made his way over to the corner. Once he'd been mobbed by his teammates, Dorgu shook his head at the TV camera, as if he was thinking, 'how did I do that?'",
      "The Dane has gone from strength to strength over the last few weeks and his confidence is flowing. He had the audacity to take a swing from the edge of the box, and the execution was perfect. Arsenal goalkeeper Raya had no chance as the ball kissed the crossbar on its way into the net.",
      "Carrick made a bold decision to start Dorgu in the Manchester derby and he vindicated that selection by scoring. Dorgu would have felt 10ft tall in training this week, and he probably wouldn't have attempted the shot without that belief.",
      "The importance of corners",
      "Before facing United, Arsenal had scored 24 goals from set pieces in all competitions this season - the most by any team in Europe's top five leagues. They have earned a reputation as being deadly from set-plays during Arteta's tenure, and it was clear that United had been prepared for that threat.",
      "Casemiro cleared the first Arsenal corner of the game, winning the header amongst a scrum of bodies, and Maguire reacted by enthusiastically applauding him as if he'd scored a goal.",
      "Every corner felt like an event, and there was a sense of anticaption around the ground when United conceded a set-play. The players fed off that energy, and Dalot whipped up his teammates as United prepared for Arsenal's second corner of the match, which was successfully cleared.",
      "Carrick prepared his side in training to deal with set-pieces. United conceded from two corners at the Emirates in December 2024, and work had been done to ensure they would not suffer the same fate.",
      "However, it's still difficult to stop Arsenal from corners, even when you prepare to face their threat. They piled bodies into the box, and Senne Lammens was crowded when Merino scored to make it 2-2.",
      "Casemiro appreciation",
      "Casemiro turned to the bench and first pumped when Mbeumo equalised in the 34th minute. United celebrated in the corner, and Casemiro briefly considered saving his legs before deciding to join in.",
      "It was announced earlier in the week that he will leave United upon the expiry of his contract. The Brazilian is hugely popular with matchgoers and was serenaded by the away section.",
      "United are set to sign a replacement for Casemiro in the summer transfer window, and it will be a good sign if his successor becomes half as popular with fans.",
      "Mbeumo's trademark",
      "Mbeumo scored his ninth goal of the season to fire United back into the game, and he used the same celebration as he did against Liverpool at Anfield, outstretching his arms.",
      "He used the same celebration when he scored against Tottenham in November, and it feels like it's becoming Mbeumo's trademark to wheel it out when he scores against 'big' clubs.",
      "It must be irritating for opposition fans to see Mbeumo celebrating in front of them like that. The 26-year-old has been a brilliant signing and possesses the kind of confidence that you need to represent United.",
      "Carrick was composed",
      "Luke Shaw received tactical instructions from Carrick while United celebrated their equaliser. Carrick moved his hands while he was locked in conversation, and he appeared to ask to move the ball quicker.",
      "Some managers may have got carried away in the euphoria of the goal on the touchline, but Carrick remained composed and used the time to pass on instructions after spotting something that could be improved.",
      "Remarkably, Carrick did not even show emotion when Cunha scored to make it 3-2. Instead, he began a dialogue with his backroom staff. There was finally a release of emotion from the 44-year-old at full-time.",

      "Michael Carrick told his Manchester United players to keep their feet on the ground and stay humble after they backed up a derby day win by beating Premier League leaders Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, with Matheus Cunha's late winner securing a stunning victory.",
      "United have beaten the Premier League's top two in Carrick's first two games in charge and now sit fourth with 15 games of the season to go. That puts Champions League qualification well within their grasp, but the 44-year-old is refusing to get carried away.",
      "Carrick has had an immediate impact since replacing Ruben Amorim, and these wins have sent out a statement about their intentions this season after a disappointing run of results in December, but one of the former United midfielder's strengths has been a calm demeanour, and he isn't about to misplace that now.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Although the away end revelled in a victory that hurt Arsenal's title chances, Carrick was focusing on the impact he could have within the club, rather than the statement it can send out to the rest of the league, and he is determined to make sure his players do not get carried away.",
      "\"I think it's more about the feeling that gives us as a group,\" he said. \"And the players and certainly the supporters, you know? That's my concern, how that can bring us together and lift us in a real positive manner.",
      "\"I'm not getting carried away. We've got some bigger games coming up, because every next game's the bigger game. So we're not getting carried away, we've got really important things coming up that we need to kind of keep improving with.",
      "\"Two massive games. There's a lot of emotion and a lot of energy and a lot of confidence that you can take from that, but be humble and understand how we've got these results, that's really important moving forward.\"",
      "United fans were chanting 'we're gonna win the league' as they left the Emirates but Carrick didn't flinch when told that in his post-match press conference, instead returning to a theme of focusing on Fulham next week rather than getting sucked into looking at the bigger picture.",
      "\"I know from our perspective it's just moving forward to the next game,\" he said. \"It's been less than two weeks that we've been together, so it's just keep getting good habits really, and good routines. The boys have been fantastic with that.",
      "\"I don't think we can look too far ahead. We certainly won't be anyway. We'll finish where we finish by the results we get. I know that's kind of obvious, but looking too far ahead can come back and bite you really so we've taken this week by week and game by game.",
      "\"We'll certainly continue to do that, but we've got to ride it. You've got to use the emotion, you've got to use the energy, you've got to use the confidence, but be humble enough to understand how we could just achieve these two big results and it doesn't just come easy. So we need to continue that and bottle it and use it again.\"",

      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "Beating Manchester City and Arsenal is fun. Very fun, in fact. It is a true statement and emphasises tactical nous against the best managers. But it’s your Fulhams, your Crystal Palaces, your Evertons that Michael Carrick has to beat.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s record against the ‘Big Six’ clubs wasn’t horrible. He won at the Etihad. He won at Anfield. He won at the Emirates (albeit after penalties). He beat Newcastle and Chelsea at Old Trafford this season. And in last season’s Europa League semi-finals, he smashed Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "But his final game in charge was a score draw at Leeds United after losing at home to 10-man Everton, failing to beat Wolves, potentially the worst side in Premier League history, at home, and also drawing at home to an awful West Ham side. There seemed to be a new nadir every month.",
      "What Carrick has done effectively in his opening two weeks is the cliched Back To Basics thing. People often say managers must Go Back To Basics without actually knowing what that entails. Rondos and starting Kobbie Mainoo, apparently.",
      "Arsenal were punished by an effective counter-attacking team capable of taking their chances, big and small, a week after a convincing win over Manchester City.",
      "READ: 16 Conclusions from Arsenal 2-3 Man United: DNA, bottle, retro kits, Carrick, Arteta, Mbeumo and more",
      "On Sunday, Fulham faced Michael Carrick’s Manchester United as underdogs. It was the first time in three games the Red Devils were expected to win under Carrick’s watch, and they dealt with the pressure to pass a very important test by the skin of their teeth.",
      "United were absolutely not perfect, as the 3-2 scoreline suggests. They still gave up plenty of chances and conceded three times, one of which was ruled out by the narrowest of offsides.",
      "Carrick’s United are direct, even with Bryan Mbeumo up front by himself. They feed off second balls and counter effectively. Sometimes they defend well too. Other times, the club’s modern-day DNA comes through.",
      "Raul Jimenez’s late penalty set up a nervous ending and United did sh*t the bed as Kevin’s beauty levelled the scoring. But it was that good old United DNA that saved them as substitute Benjamin Sesko popped up with a fantastic 94th-minute winner.",
      "It was an important test for Carrick but also an important lesson. Chelsea and Liam Rosenior learned that resting your best players is dangerous, and Carrick learned that taking them off, even at 2-0, is also pretty dangerous.",
      "Casemiro, Ruben Amorim’s biggest success story, continues to impress and staked a claim for the club to extend his contract beyond this summer with a goal and an assist. However, the control United had was lost when he came off. The Brazilian has come a long way from that night at Selhurst Park, becoming an indispensable player who apparently can’t miss any minutes whatsoever.",
      "His goal was an outstanding back-post header from a Bruno Fernandes free-kick following a Jorge Cuenca shirt-pull on Matheus Cunha, which United initially thought was going to be a penalty after Cuenca’s sliding tackle on Cunha. The replays suggested a goal kick was more likely, and we’re sure Marco Silva will have something very interesting to say.",
      "Goal contributions aside, it was a commanding midfield performance from Casemiro. He and Mainoo provide a lovely balance in the middle of the park, and with Bruno Fernandes in front of them? Chef’s kiss.",
      "For Carrick, it has genuinely been a case of playing your best players in their best positions and standing in the technical area with your hands behind your back as a well-functioning XI do their thing. And from now on, he will play his best players for even longer. Amazingly, that is a better idea than bringing on Manuel Ugarte.",
      "While it was a scare for United and could have prompted a very different reaction from us, Carrick’s perfect start continued. It was comfortable for the most part against weaker opposition in good form, which tells us more about Carrick and United’s credentials than wins against the Premier League’s top two, especially when these were the fixtures the previous manager struggled with most.",
      "It’s two wins from two at Old Trafford and an away win against the league leaders, who hadn’t lost at home all season before United’s brilliant 3-2 victory. That also happened to be the first time Arsenal and their rock-solid defence have conceded three goals in a match since December 2023.",
      "Two whole calendar years without conceding three goals in a game is quite something. For all the talk of Arsenal capitulating, Carrick deserves huge credit for that victory, not just the brilliant start he has made.",
      "Aston Villa might want to look over their shoulder as Carrick’s United soar. The players look confident and settled. Everyone is contributing. The partnerships are working well all over the pitch. For once, it actually looks like a football team enjoying themselves and a group of players who genuinely like each other.",
      "They are simply functioning after looking completely and utterly lost a month ago. Carrickball is cooking. That’s what the cool kids say, right?",
      "Man Utd interim boss Michael Carrick wants to bring Marcus Rashford back to Old Trafford from Barcelona if he gets the permanent job, according to reports.",
      "Spurs haven’t won in five Premier League games so we all know what they’re about to do to Manchester City, while the Michael Carrick era properly begins.",
      "Gary Neville admits he is “absolutely startled” after Michael Carrick won his opening two games as interim Manchester United manager.",
      "Ian Wright has questioned why Man Utd legend Gary Neville has insisted that Michael Carrick “shouldn’t get” the permanent job at Old Trafford.",

It was criminal that Slot dropped him as soon as Isak was fit; that decision also coincided with our horrendous down turn in form but I suspect that correlation rather than causation. If he were to do so again then I think fans would riot. Hugo has earned that spot right now and it should be his to keep; everyone else in this team needs to find a place around him in my opinion.",

In the end Trippier just took it off him. Is he fully devoid of confidence or just downing tools until Slot is gone? His lack of output combined with Gakpo is probably why we have struggled so much this season. Today Gakpo had these flashes driving into space but then had zero output or clue of what to do every time. He seems so out of sync with the team; once he raced into the box and then to the byline and crossed it at chest level for a defender to clear when he could’ve rolled it on the floor two touches earlier into feet for a finish.",

      "Here, thanks to football analysis experts Gradient Sports, we present the best shotstoppers in the Premier League.",
      "Across a vast range of metrics, Gradient grades every player out of 100, measuring execution and outcome to offer the most insightful and accurate view of individual performance.",
      "This is especially useful when it comes to judging keepers, rather than assessing them on clean sheets or simple shots-saved percentage.",
      "So, according to the grades, here are the Premier League stoppers (who have started a minimum of five matches) ranked for their shot-stopping prowess…",
      "The Argentina keeper has had a somewhat erratic season so far but Martinez has still saved 75% of the shots on target he has faced – better than any other Premier League regular.",
      "Dubravka was an inspired summer signing and without him, Burnley would be further adrift. The 37-year-old has been the busiest keeper, facing 32 shots on target more than anyone else.",
      "Much to the disgust of James Trafford, Pep Guardiola changed tack completely and brought in a big guy to guard his goal. Donnarumma has the lowest saveable goals conceded with 15.8%.",
      "The giant Georgian just scrapes in having played five games when Alisson was injured and Liverpool were caving in after a flying start. Apparently, half of the 10 goals Mamardashvili conceded were saveable, but he performed above expectation on a third of the shots he saved.",
      "Areola has come under criticism having initially been dropped to the bench at the start of the season but there are signs he is starting to recover some reliability during the Hammers’ recent upturn in form. Which won’t be a coincidence.",
      "Dispatched back to the bench recently, which seems harsh, according to the numbers. Maybe Spurs’ bench is comfier.",
      "Raya has faced 52 shots on target, at least a dozen fewer than any other regular No.1, considerably fewer than any other keeper, but the fact the Spaniard is fifth for shots saved above expectation indicates he has been a reliable presence when called upon.",
      "A very mixed season for Sels after sharing the Golden Glove last term. Sean Dyche toyed with replacing the Belgian but Big John blew it.",
      "You can’t blame Vicario for looking unsettled behind that Spurs side but he has been caught up in the chaos too often, even if the stats suggest he remains one the Premier League’s better shotstoppers.",
      "The numbers suggest Pickford has been something of a contradiction. He has made the third-highest number of big saves and is fifth for shots on target saved, but he has conceded the second-highest number of saveable goals (14). Still England’s No.1.",
      "The Netherlands No.1 continues to catch eyes, with Bayern Munich and Tottenham both credited with an interest in the Seagulls stopper. Scrapes into the Premier League power rankings top 30.",
      "A very middle-of-the-road season so far from Henderson, who needed his best yet if he hoped to dislodge Pickford in the England goal in time for the World Cup. May get plenty of opportunities to impress before then since Palace have sold their captain and best defender.",
      "MORE PREM RANKINGS: Best passers under pressure | Most tackle-proof players",
      "May have felt aggrieved to give up the gloves when Lucas Perri returned but Darlow is rightfully back in the Leeds goal. Not because he’s demonstrably better, rather he’s certainly no worse.",
      "There have been occasions this season when Leno was less than his usual reliable self, evidenced by the fact that no keeper has conceded more saveable goals (16).",
      "Anything less chaotic than Andre Onana was always going to make a huge difference to United and Lammens has been a calming, reliable presence. A top-class keeper? We’ll see…",
      "The Brentford stopper was conceding too many goals that perhaps he shouldn’t at the start of the season while settling into his first job as a No.1, but Kelleher looks more at ease in the role now.",
      "Petrovic, like Bournemouth collectively, began the season well but had a major wobble at the back end of the 2025.",
      "Performed slightly better than Pope but not enough to make Eddie Howe consider a permanent change.",
      "Hasn’t been consistent enough to silence the doubters, and the fact Liam Rosenior admits he is asking Sanchez to do things that may be unfamiliar with suggests Chelsea will be looking for a new keeper in the summer. There’s a good one going free in Italy.",
      "Below Ramsdale for shotstopping here, but many Newcastle fans were happy to see Pope return upon return from injury.",
      "Don’t shoot the messenger, Sunderland fans. We agree, Roefs has been superb.",
      "Alisson is usually a rock-solid presence for Liverpool but the Brazilian, not long ago viewed by many as the world’s best, has struggled to stop the Reds’ rot. Is it time to give Mamardashvili a longer run?",
      "Initially taken out of the firing line because of injury, then dropped after a series of soft goals culminating in the latest-ever Premier League winner.",
      "Dropped, then restored to the Wolves XI, though these numbers would query Rob Edwards’ logic."

      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has made a new ‘transfer decision’ amid interest from European and Saudi Pro League sides.",
      "Fernandes has consistently been Man Utd’s best performer in recent years as he is arguably their sole world-class player.",
      "United‘s captain has carried the broken club on his back during their recent dark times, but it has been widely reported that he could be on borrowed time at Old Trafford.",
      "Last summer, it was reported that Man Utd were looking to cash in on Fernandes to fund their rebuild, so a move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal looked likely.",
      "Fernandes eventually decided to remain at Man Utd, but he hinted in a recent interview that he is not completely happy with the board’s treatment of him.",
      "This has fuelled fresh speculation regarding a possible exit from Man Utd, with Saudi Pro League teams and Bayern Munich mooted as potential destinations for the midfielder, who has sparkled in Michael Carrick’s first two games as interim boss.",
      "READ: Ballard, Stach to Man Utd: Ten Premier League newbies poised for pillaging",
      "However, a new report from Football Insider journalist Pete O’Rourke claims Fernandes’ latest ‘transfer decision’ is that he has ‘no plans to move to the Saudi Pro League at this stage of his career as he aims to continue playing at the highest level possible’.",
      "“I think he can definitely stay beyond this summer. He’s under contract until 2027, and there’s an option in that deal, as well, to extend it,” O’Rourke told Football Insider.",
      "“If he was to become available, there’s no doubt that there would be clubs interested in him.",
      "“We know that obviously there has been interest from the Saudi Pro League before, but I’m not sure that Fernandes is ready to move there at this stage of his career. He still wants to play at the highest level.“",
      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham has admitted that he has concerns about Fernandes, even though it would be a “huge loss” if he moved elsewhere in the summer.",
      "“In terms of Bruno [Fernandes] you’re looking at two different things,” Sheringham told Bet MGM.",
      "“You’re looking at him as captain material and whether he’s an identity which is what the club stands for. I don’t think he’s that because he doesn’t lead by example in his manner on the pitch.",
      "“We’ve seen him throw his arms up in the air and all that which I don’t think is a good look and not something a captain should be doing.",
      "“Don’t get me wrong, the way he’s performed on the pitch over the last couple of years, he’s definitely a type of leader but I’m not sure he’s a captain.",
      "“There’s been a lot of speculation about his future. First of all, you don’t want to lose your top players and without a doubt, Bruno has been one of Manchester United’s top performers over the last two-and-a-half years in a team full of players who have been underperforming.",
      "“I don’t listen too much to speculation but, of course, he’d be a huge loss if he did move on at the end of the season.”",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid ‘want’ Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes and it’s claimed that he could replace Jude Bellingham.",
      "If you stop Bruno Fernandes, you go a long way towards stopping Man Utd. But the stats prove how hard it is to subdue the Red Devils captain…",
      "Man Utd would need an “astronomical offer” to convince Chelsea to sell Cole Palmer with transfer rumblings “getting louder”, according to reports.",
      "New information has emerged on Bruno Fernandes’ future at Manchester United, including a no-brainer decision and a ‘significant’ demand for a new contract.",
      "Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Man Utd in August gave a false perception of where each club was headed, so I have revisited ten of our conclusions from that game…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes could join Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal in the coming months via a ‘historic offer’."

      "That makes Sterling a free-agent but sees him lose his status as one of the Premier League’s highest-paid players.",
      "It also leaves Chelsea without an entry in the top 10, which is dominated by Manchester City and Liverpool.",
      "This ranking is based on base salary only – no bonuses included – with most figures sourced from Capology.",
      "",
      "10) Kai Havertz (Arsenal) – £280,000 a week\nArsenal had to give Havertz a little bump up when they signed him from Chelsea, where he was already on a quarter of a million per week. That sweetener adds up to £1.5million a year.",
      "",
      "9) Alexander Isak (Liverpool) – £280,000 a week\nIsak is being paid £14.56m a year, an increase of 133 per cent on the £120,000-a-week salary he was trousering at Newcastle. Which is not unreasonable since his agent can point to Isak’s status as British football’s most-expensive player. Which he will have to justify when he’s back from injury.",
      "",
      "8) Omar Marmoush (Manchester City) – £295,000 a week\nThe first of four Manchester City entries in the top 10 and perhaps one of the more surprising names on the list. His agent played a blinder when he moved to City because the striker was only on just north of £33,000 a week at Eintracht Frankfurt.",
      "",
      "7) Jack Grealish (Manchester City/Everton) – £300,000 a week\nIt is no surprise to see Grealish on such an extraordinary salary since it was negotiated when he became English football’s first £100million purchase, before Pep Guardiola had sussed that he didn’t fancy the star after all. Grealish joined Everton on loan, with the Toffees liable for £225,000 a week, making him their highest-paid player by a margin of £100,000 a week, while City top up the rest. So it’s especially sickening for the Merseysiders that he may miss the rest of the season.",
      "",
      "6) Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United) – £300,000 a week\nUnited probably wept weekly when similar amounts left their coffers to be deposited into Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford’s accounts but Fernandes is more than worth it to the Red Devils. Without him, things would have been even bleaker.",
      "5) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City) – £300,000 a week\nSilva is in the final season of his £15.6million-a-year salary at City. The Portugal star reportedly doubled his money when he signed a new contract in 2023.",
      "",
      "4) Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) – £350,000 a week\nVan Dijk is on almost double the salary he signed for when joining Liverpool in 2018. Few would argue the captain hasn’t been worth his money up to this season, but it is now a matter for debate.",
      "",
      "3) Casemiro (Manchester United) – £350,000 a week\nUnited almost doubled Casemiro’s Real Madrid wage and, at first, he looked good value for money. Then…he did not. The Brazilian is earning his coin again but only until the summer when there will be no renewal.",
      "",
      "2) Mo Salah (Liverpool) – £400,000 a week\nLiverpool fans were relieved earlier this year to see Salah end a season-long saga by putting pen to paper for two more years. A £2.6million-a-year pay rise was viewed as more than worth it to keep the Egyptian around – and to spare the cost of replacing him – but half a season later, we’re considerably less sure.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City) – £525,000 a week\nWe’re told that there were months of negotiations before Haaland signed his deal for 10 (TEN) seasons which makes us wonder: where the hell was his agents’ starting point?! It is obviously a very cushy deal for Haaland, but also a massive ‘f*** you’ from City to, well, everyone.",

      "But yes, obviously, Spurs are obviously going to win this game. Rarely if ever has the fundamental paradox of Tottenham-City games applied more than it does here, to wit: the less likely a Tottenham win logically appears to be, the more likely it is to happen.",
      "And right now a Tottenham win in any game – obviously this only applies to any game of proper football in a difficult competition, not tish and fipsy like the Champions League – is a highly illogical outcome.",
      "Spurs have just come through the gentlest imaginable run of fixtures, a January of almost cartoonish ease with which to get themselves back into contention for the European spots, and somehow come out the other side of it in the heat of a proper relegation battle having won not a single one of their last five Premier League games. They’ve lost back-to-back against two teams whose winless Premier League runs extended to double figures before their appointment with the good doctor, and coming minutes away from making that three on the bounce at Burnley.",
      "Meanwhile they’ve been casually winning games in Europe like it’s nothing. In the last three months, Spurs have now won twice as many Champions League games (4) as they have Premier League ones (2).",
      "A team that now, as an apparent point of principle, insists upon conceding at least two stupid and easily preventable goals in every single Premier League match they play has kept more clean sheets in the Champions League than anyone else.",
      "This is Spurs heritage. This is what they do. Spursy has never been purely about the spectacular ability for the disastrous and humiliating; it has always required the ability to occasionally and often entirely inexplicably hit absurd heights to make the pratfalls so much bigger and funnier.",
      "And for many years now, Man City have been a key punching bag along the way in the set-up for whatever nonsense Spurs are building up to. While for the last couple of seasons Spurs have perfected this wonderful new bit of being a clinical force in Europe but worse than ever before domestically, they’ve quite rightly never abandoned the ever-bankable ‘improbable victory over Pep Guardiola’s Man City’ bit.",
      "They’ve won their last two trips to the Etihad 4-0 and 2-0, and also knocked City out of the Carabao last season.",
      "This latest instalment is unfortunately at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where Burnley and Brentford remain the only Premier League teams this season to leave empty-handed, but does come with added banter potential from not just Spurs’ own stupid form but the fact last weekend’s results have got City right back on Arsenal’s coat-tails in the title race.",
      "It’s still a bit early in the season for it to become a true repeat of the great 23/24 final-week showpiece, especially with Spurs so uncomfortably close to the bottom three. But it is nevertheless a game that has either a win-win or lose-lose element to it for Spurs, depending on your outlook.",
      "And it gives us the latest chance to wheel out one of our very favourite stats. Since Wolves returned to the top flight in 2018/19, Spurs have taken 18 points from their 15 Premier League games against them. Over that exact time period, Spurs have 23 points from 15 Premier League games against Man City.",
      "Now we know Wolves were quite good for some of that time, but for a lot of that time City were the most relentless collector of Premier League points Our League has ever known. Yet Spurs hold a 7-6 winning record against them over a time period that includes only the very last not-very-good-actually bits of the Pochettino era and all the awful crud that’s followed. And we’ve not even mentioned the infamous Champions League quarter-final.",

      "Spurs aren’t the only team using the Champions League to mask their domestic failings, with Liverpool managing to even finish above the all-conquering European night Lilywhites after thrashing Qarabag to finish third in the standings and achieve some level of cathartic release after the loss of the most misleading unbeaten run on record with that late defeat at Bournemouth.",
      "And like Spurs, Liverpool now face a tricky game in which to try and port some of that European feel-good vibe to a misfiring Premier League campaign.",
      "They’re not exactly the same, sure. Liverpool are trying to win an undignified scrap for the Champions League placings and Spurs are trying not to get actually relegated, but the point stands.",
      "Newcastle are Saturday night’s opponents for Arne Slot. The lowliest of the English teams in the Champions League having finished all the way down in a perfectly decent 12th, and it’s fair to say that they used up a bit more gas in battling gamely if in the end not that meaningfully to a 1-1 draw against the holders PSG on Wednesday night.",
      "It was a result that left both of them outside the top eight, and burdens Newcastle with another couple of games in a crucial month as they now try to avoid finishing outside the top five in England.",

      "Unai Emery may be rueing his decision to start Ollie Watkins in a broadly meaningless final game of the Europa League league phase after Villa’s star striker limped off in the first half with what looked like a hamstring issue.",

It’s a rather neat marker of Villa’s rise that Abraham’s season at Villa Park in 2018/19 involved scoring 25 goals to get them out of the Championship, and he will have rather different targets for the remainder of this campaign.",
      "Watkins’ injury makes Abraham potentially an even more important signing even more quickly for a team whose sheer lack of alternatives goes some way to explaining why Watkins was being used in such a low-wattage game in the first place.",

      "With all six English teams in this season’s Champions League reaching the knockout stages – and five of the six finishing in the top eight to proceed directly to the last 16 – it now looks certain England will once again receive a bonus spot in next year’s competition.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season are all still involved as we head into the play-offs and last 16. Every other country has by now lost at least one of their teams.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay some price down the line when teams inevitably start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but England are streaking clear and creating a healthy buffer over their major rivals, all of whom have now started losing teams from their own equations while England power on with a full quota.",
      "With English teams securing five of the eight automatic spots in the last 16 of the Champions League via first, third, fourth, sixth and eighth-place finishes, England have pocketed a huge haul of final-position bonus points to further extend their lead here. Even play-off-bound Newcastle have added plenty more points to the kitty for finishing 12th.",
      "Aston Villa finished second in the Europa League standings for another huge bonus-point boost, with Nottingham Forest safely into the play-offs from 13th. Crystal Palace are in the Conference League play-offs. With all nine teams still standing, England are going to be scooping up plenty more points for a good while yet. It would already be a huge shock if one of those extra Champions League places doesn’t once again come the Premier League’s way.",
      "We only have a year’s worth of data under the current format to go on, but worth noting that third-placed Italy finished with 21.875 last year, which means England are already only about a point away from a total that would have been enough for a top-two finish last time out.",
      "Total points: 188.625\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLast 16: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL)\nPlay-off round: Newcastle (UCL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",

      "Unlikely to hold off the big leagues currently behind them, but Porto and Braga both finishing in the top six of the Europa League standings with Sporting seventh in the Champions League has thrown a good chunk of bonus points into the pot – and any points Portuguese teams rack up only have to be divided by five.",

I’ve said my piece, I think that he’s got the job, and then if he gets it in the summer then you go; ‘Listen, good luck to him’, but as a caretaker manager, it’s a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be.",

      "It turns out Manchester United chiefs are actually pretty good at transfers, and a veto of a Michael Carrick request will be another win…",
      "It has long been the perception about Man Utd that they have been very poor at transfers since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, and this is true to a certain degree.",
      "Man Utd have got a lot wrong in the transfer market, but there has been a turning of the tide since Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his recruitment team took over.",
      "Ratcliffe and co. have been far from perfect regarding other matters (i.e., with his brutal cost-cutting programme), but they have been pretty on the money with transfers.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is their only potential blot on their summer recruitment, while the doubts about the January 2025 signing of Patrick Dorgu have started to evaporate as he has thrived in an advanced role.",
      "And even better work has been done on outgoings: In the summer, Tyrell Malacia was their only ‘bomb squad’ member to stick around, with Man Utd managing to offload Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund on their teams with significant fees secured in all but one of these deals (Sancho is out of contract in the summer and will inevitably leave on a free transfer).",
      "READ: Why big Champions League night containing zero Man United was actually all about Man United",
      "This business enabled Man Utd to invest £230m on signings last summer, and they are well-placed to be in a position to spend even more in this summer’s window as cash will come in via the sales of Rashford and Hojlund, while they could also benefit from Mason Greenwood’s sell-on clause and Champions League qualification.",
      "United’s wage bill will be further boosted by the exit of Casemiro, who is confirmed to be leaving upon the expiry of his contract instead of accepting a pay cut to remain at the club.",
      "And the Red Devils also look to be going this correct route with Harry Maguire, who finds himself in the same boat as Casemiro in terms of contract.",
      "Earlier this week, The Daily Mail reporter Nathan Salt explained why Maguire is ‘increasingly unlikely’ to remain at Man Utd despite Carrick’s admiration of the England international.",
      "“He’s played well in the past two games – winning the man-of-the-match award at Arsenal – but it feels increasingly unlikely,” Salt said.",
      "“United have had ample opportunity to get Maguire on to fresh terms but there appears to be limited willingness at this stage to do so with his contract now around five months from expiry.",
      "“Carrick is a fan of Maguire but senior United figures are keen to see next season’s minutes go to Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, two young players that United believe will be the bedrock of the backline for years to come.”",
      "The Athletic’s Andy Mitten has since added that ‘Maguire’s future will likely boil down to money and the length of the contract being offered’, while he ‘needs to be playing every week and United’s view is that if he’s doing that, the case for a new contract is a much stronger one’.",
      "But the reality is that Maguire is unlikely to retain his current importance for much longer.",
      "Like Carrick, Maguire has benefited from circumstance, returning to fitness and form at a time when Man Utd are on a rare upswing and while Matthijs de Ligt is unavailable.",
      "Maguire has been really good for Man Utd in their last two games, but he is still unlikely to be ahead of De Ligt in the pecking order once Carrick (or his successor) has a fully fit squad, while Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven are also there to replace him.",
      "Had Casemiro signed a cut-price extension to remain at Man Utd, his wage would still have been among the highest in the squad and it would have been difficult to justify when he would have been a bit-part player behind Carlos Baleba and/or Elliot Anderson next season.",
      "And with INEOS setting a precedent regarding how they will handle ageing players and their expiring contracts, it should be expected that Maguire follows Casemiro out of the door for a new adventure with his head held high.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "This is one of those prices that makes you stop, wash your face with cold water and check you're reading it correctly.",
      "Aston Villa to win at 21/20 with Sky Bet feels very generous considering what this team have been telling us for months.",
      "Since going winless in their opening five Premier League games, Villa have been nothing short of elite. They've taken 43 points from 18 matches, title-challenger output no doubt and no side in the division have collected more points over that period. That's not a short hot streak either. It's a sample of results to respect. It's sustained excellence.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, remain a side you want to oppose on their travels. Only bottom club Wolves have suffered more away defeats in the Premier League this season (8). Home win.",
      "There is no better attacker of a set-piece in world football than Harry Maguire. And in a Premier League season where dead-ball situations are being mined relentlessly for goals, Maguire is going to get his feed soon enough.",
      "Back in the Manchester United starting XI, Maguire is playing with an authority that has shone brightly in the last two performances. That confidence can translate to when he ventures forward. Maguire's old-school dominance remains a potent betting weapon and the 7/1 with Sky Bet for him to score is worth jumping on.",
      "There's a strong whiff of needle about this one. There's lingering animosity in the air after the summer legal battles which ended in Forest replacing Palace in the Europa League and when you layer in the relegation context, emotions are likely to be running hot. That's usually when the card markets come alive.",
      "One match-up in particular looks primed to deliver.",
      "Neco Williams is expected to lock horns with Ismaila Sarr, and that's a tough afternoon for any full-back. Sarr is relentless in one-vs-one situations, drives straight at defenders and forces decisions at pace. The data is damning from a defensive perspective as Sarr has drawn 21 cards from opponents since the start of last season, with only Bruno Guimaraes responsible for more in the Premier League.",
      "Williams looks a bet material at 100/30 with Sky Bet to be carded in an edgy game.",
      "There's no escaping the strange relationship between these two. Spurs have won seven of the last 12 meetings and Pep Guardiola has lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (8) than any other opponent. On paper, that history screams Tottenham.",
      "And when you see Spurs at 100/30 with Sky Bet, the temptation is obvious. But Spurs at home remain impossible to trust.",
      "Instead of fighting the uncertainty, the smarter route is to isolate a player who can still profit from Spurs doing some things right and that's where Dominic Solanke to score at 11/4 with Sky Bet comes to the party.",
      "He's become something of a forgotten man, but Solanke is built to score in the Premier League. Goals in back-to-back games is a reminder of his talents.",
      "There's also a bigger-picture motivation edge at play. With England's forward depth in focus, Solanke knows he's fighting to be a potential Harry Kane understudy this summer for England at the World Cup.",
      "Sunderland remain the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season. That is wild.",
      "But trends do snap and, in betting, timing when to step in to profit from such a run ending is a key weapon to use when trying to profit in this game. It's 19/5 with Sky Bet to end here - a price on a Burnley win that is too big to pass up.",
      "The absence of Granit Xhaka is pivotal. We saw exactly how fragile Sunderland can be without their midfield reference point in their worst performance of the season away at West Ham. Without Xhaka's control, leadership and ability to dictate tempo, Sunderland lost structure, lost composure and were far too easy to play through.",
      "Burnley need wins now. So their approach will be positive and the market is dangling a very juicy carrot towards us regarding their win prospects."

      "Michael Carrick will go for a third consecutive win as Man Utd head coach against Fulham on Super Sunday and goalkeeper Senne Lammens has a big role to play; The Radar column also reveals the passing stats that set Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa apart",
      "Sunday 1 February 2026 07:04, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Lammens brings calm to Man Utd💪 Konsa's passing under pressure🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United beat Arsenal last Sunday with the help of two moments of brilliance from Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu. But their goalkeeper played his part too, albeit in typically understated style. Senne Lammens continues to impress.",
      "The 23-year-old, an £18m signing from Royal Antwerp, has looked good value ever since his debut in October, when he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford, instantly bringing a level of calm Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana lacked.",
      "Certainly, it is what Manchester United needed, and Lammens has brought plenty more besides. The various ways in which he has improved the side were neatly outlined at the Emirates Stadium as he helped Michael Carrick make it two wins from two.",
      "Firstly, there were examples of his shot-stopping ability, most notably in the first half, when he produced an outstanding reflex save to push Martin Zubimendi's close-range header over the bar. He later got down smartly to deny Bukayo Saka at his near post.",
      "The underlying data shows that, excluding own goals, Lammens has conceded 21 goals from chances worth an expected total of 23.74 since his arrival in the Premier League, giving him a chunky positive differential of nearly three goals prevented across 15 games.",
      "It is a considerable improvement on Bayindir, whose shot-stopping is deemed to be one of his stronger attributes but who had a negative differential for goals prevented across his six starts in the early weeks of the season, according to the same data.",
      "Lammens has proved useful with his feet as well as his hands, particularly over long distances.",
      "He sent 33 of his 36 passes long against Arsenal, having sent 11 out of 13 long in the 2-0 win over Manchester City. Overall this season, Lammens has sent the fourth-highest percentage of passes long among Premier League goalkeepers at 66.15 per cent.",
      "The increased emphasis on directness is a welcome change given the issues United previously encountered when trying to play out from the back under Carrick's predecessor Ruben Amorim.",
      "Lammens' passes, which are usually struck with precision and travel with flat trajectories, serve several functions, allowing Manchester United to bypass their opponents' press and secure territory higher up the pitch by winning headers or second balls.",
      "At the Emirates Stadium, Lammens was able to drop his passes over the top of Arsenal's defensive line repeatedly, meaning Gabriel and William Saliba had to contend with aerial duels and off-the-ball runs in behind simultaneously, often while back-peddling.",
      "Despite his relative inexperience, Lammens has handled the step up to a role once described by Neville as the most difficult in football impressively. He has gone from facing Beerschot and Westerlo to Manchester City and Arsenal in the space of a year.",
      "He had, of course, demonstrated considerable potential in Belgium. But if there was one area of uncertainty coming to the Premier League, it was how he might handle the aerial side of things.",
      "\"The most important and most difficult thing, especially as a goalkeeper, is the set-pieces,\" he added to Neville in December. \"That's unique to England, the physicality. They try to block you, they make it as difficult as they can for you.\"",
      "Lammens was beaten from one such set-piece against Arsenal, unable to claim Saka's corner before it was prodded over the line by Mikel Merino. But he otherwise stood up to the challenge well, confidently commanding his box in difficult circumstances.",
      "In fact, he finished the game having made more catches and punches than any other goalkeeper against Arsenal all season. His combined total of six was the fourth-highest by a goalkeeper in any Premier League fixture so far this term.",
      "It all adds up to a level of security in goal that Manchester United have not had since the departure of David De Gea. Onana made three errors leading directly to goals last season in the Premier League, according to Opta. Lammens, by contrast, is yet to even make one leading to a shot.",
      "Quiet reliability does not generate many headlines. Lammens is a calm character off the pitch as well as on it. \"I understand I might come across as boring,\" he said in an interview in Belgium in October, \"but that's the goalkeeper I want to be.\"",
      "And it is exactly the goalkeeper Manchester United needed.",
      "Ezri Konsa's second-half introduction from the bench helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League on Thursday. The centre-back brought his usual composure on the ball, completing all but one of his 20 passes.",
      "His reliability in possession is one of many strengths and it applies even in challenging circumstances. In the Premier League this season, Konsa has completed 448 out of 492 passes when under high-intensity pressure, giving him a higher accuracy rate than any other player in the division at 91 per cent.",
      "The 28-year-old is having an outstanding season, pushing his claim to an England starting spot alongside Marc Guehi at this summer's World Cup, helped by a level of technical ability and press-resistance to match his quality defensively.",
      "The last column examined the striker situation at Arsenal as Gabriel Jesus, Viktor Gyokeres and the returning Kai Havertz vie for the No 9 shirt, and explained why the latter is still top dog.",

      "Arne Slot has talked about Liverpool's issues against low blocks and they are not the only Premier League side struggling to break down deep-lying opponents; Between the Lines digs into the data to reveal the teams with the best and worst numbers",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Friday 30 January 2026 10:27, UK",
      "Low blocks are a hot topic in the Premier League.",
      "The term refers to a defending team sitting deep in a compact shape to protect their goal and restrict space in central areas, making it difficult for their opponent to create chances.",
      "Which teams come up against low blocks most frequently? And which teams are most and least effective when it comes to playing against them? Between the Lines digs into the numbers.",
      "Arne Slot was told to stop talking about low blocks by Steven Gerrard after Liverpool's Champions League win over Marseille.",
      "The data supports Slot's comments on low blocks.",
      "This season, Liverpool have a higher percentage of build-up phases of play against compact defences than any team in the Premier League, at 26 per cent.",
      "Arsenal are second, at 24 per cent, with Nottingham Forest and Newcastle third and fourth, on 23 and 22 per cent respectively.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Leeds have the lowest percentage of build-up phases against low blocks this season, at 14 per cent, just below Crystal Palace and Burnley at 15 per cent.",
      "Slot has bemoaned facing more low blocks than last season this term as Liverpool's opponents set up to frustrate them.",
      "Again, the data backs him up.",
      "Only Everton have experienced a bigger increase to the percentage of build-up phases against deep opposition this season.",
      "While Liverpool and Everton are facing low blocks more frequently, Manchester City are facing them less frequently.",
      "In fact, Pep Guardiola's side have the biggest negative differential among ever-present Premier League clubs this term, their percentage dropping from the highest in the Premier League last season at 27 per cent, to 21 per cent this term, putting them fifth.",
      "The dip reflects changes to the way they are attacking, as well as how teams are defending against them, with Guardiola having put more emphasis on directness this season.",
      "Aston Villa rank as by far the most effective team against low blocks.",
      "Helped by a succession of strikes from outside the box this season, Unai Emery's side have racked up 19 goals from phases of play against deep defences since the start of last term.",
      "It is three more than any other side has managed in the same timeframe, with Manchester City next on 16. Newcastle have also enjoyed some success, scoring 15 goals against low blocks.",
      "Excluding relegated and promoted sides, Brentford have scored the fewest goals against low blocks, with three.",
      "Aston Villa and Brentford also come out top and bottom respectively when factoring the number of times Premier League teams have come up against opponents in a low block.",
      "For context, Aston Villa's 19 goals since the start of last season have come from 1,717 build-up phases against compact defences, giving them an average considerably higher than any other Premier League side at 1.11 goals per 100 phases.",
      "Manchester City's 16 goals, meanwhile, have come from a far higher number of build-up phases against low blocks, at 2,676, giving them a much lower average of 0.60 per 100 phases.",
      "While Newcastle and Manchester United rank closest to Newcastle for goals per 100 build-up phases against deep defences, Liverpool and Arsenal sit closer to Brentford.",
      "Arsenal's issues become even clearer when looking at shot numbers.",
      "While Liverpool do at least get a decent amount of shots off against low blocks, their average of 9.9 per 100 phases of play putting them fourth among ever-present Premier League sides in the last two seasons, Mikel Arteta's side average the second-fewest, at just 7.8 shots per 100 phases of play.",
      "The data also suggests Chelsea struggle against low blocks, averaging only fractionally more shots than Arsenal at 8.1.",
      "Arsenal's lack of threat against low blocks was most recently apparent during Sunday's 3-2 loss to Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium, when the Gunners struggled to open up their opponent's defensive structure in open play.",
      "In contrast to Arsenal, Manchester United have averaged considerably more shots against low blocks than any other Premier League side since the start of last season, at 12.9 per 100 phases of play, showing they fare better at breaking them down.",
      "Why are so many Premier League strikers struggling this season? Last week's edition looked at the declining number of goals being scored by forwards and the reasons behind the trend.",

      "Cole Palmer is contracted at Chelsea until 2033; recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United; Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet has expressed a preference for joining Chelsea",
      "Wednesday 28 January 2026 07:38, UK",
      "Chelsea consider Cole Palmer \"untouchable\" amid links with Manchester United.",
      "Palmer is contracted until 2033 and is seen as a key player in the club's future.",
      "Recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United in order to return to the north west, but Chelsea believe the player is happy at Stamford Bridge - as does head coach Liam Rosenior.",
      "Asked if Palmer is 'untouchable' and happy at the club, Rosenior replied: \"Yes and yes. It's simple.",
      "\"Cole's an incredible player like [Moises Caicedo] sitting next to me and many players in the group.",
      "\"I'm not surprised at the timing [of the rumours]. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there's people are [looking to] unsettle. It's not true. Cole's here, he's very happy and I can't wait to see him on the pitch.",
      "\"There's no reason for an assurance [from Chelsea's directors]. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere, there's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation, that's where I'm at.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. We've had numerous conversations with him on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him - because he loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player.",
      "\"You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth, there's not point having any discussion about it.\"",
      "Palmer's season has been hampered by injuries to his groin, toe and, most recently, thigh which caused him to miss Sunday's victory at Crystal Palace, but he returned to training on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League fixture at Napoli.",
      "The 23-year-old has not provided an assist in the Premier League this season, scoring four goals in 12 league appearances, having netted 15 in 46 last term and providing 11 assists.",
      "Palmer joined Chelsea from Manchester City in a £40m deal in 2023, and has scored 41 goals and made 20 assists across his 81 league appearances for the Blues.",
      "Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet has expressed a preference for joining Chelsea despite interest from multiple teams.",
      "Talks are ongoing between Rennes and Chelsea about a deal for the 20-year-old French centre back.",
      "Ideally, Rennes want to keep him until the summer and it is proving to be a difficult deal to complete, especially in January.",
      "Clubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool are reported to be interested in buying the player in the summer.",
      "Rennes want €65m (£56m) but Chelsea have so far been reluctant to match the asking price.",
      "Chelsea have recalled centre back Aaron Anselmino from his loan at Borussia Dortrmund but it is not certain he will stay at Chelsea for the rest of the season.",
      "Chelsea had five centre backs in their squad for their win at Crystal Palace on Sunday and they have AFCON winner Mamadou Sarr on loan at sister club Strasbourg. Two other Chelsea centre backs are out injured at the moment - Levi Colwill and Tosin Adarabioyo.",
      "Other January centre back target options for Chelsea include Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi and Como's Jacobo Ramon.",
      "Senesi, 28, is out of contract this summer but Bournemouth would be extremely reluctant to let him leave this month. He is set to have the option of moving to some of the biggest clubs in Europe in the summer.",
      "Jacquet is highly rated by new Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior and played for Rennes when they beat Rosenior's Strasbourg side 4-1 in Ligue 1 in November.",
      "Axel Disasi is expected to leave Chelsea before the January transfer window closes.",
      "Multiple clubs are interested in England, Germany, France and Italy, with West Ham an option. Fiorentina are considering a move for Disasi, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "Disasi had previously been surplus to requirements under Enzo Maresca, but has been training with the first team since the arrival of Liam Rosenior.",
      "Raheem Sterling and Chelsea are close to finding a solution in the next few days which will end the long-drawn-out stand-off between club and player.",
      "Sterling has not played for Chelsea since May 2024 even though he has remained one of the club's best-paid players, earning a reported £325,000 a week.",
      "He spent last season on loan at Arsenal but he has been training away from the first-team squad since last summer when a move away could not be agreed during the window.",
      "Chelsea are now in talks with Sterling and his representatives and a solution is expected to be found before the window closes on Monday evening.",
      "He has 18 months left on a contract which could cost Chelsea £25 million if he was to stay until it runs out in the summer of 2027.",
      "Sterling does not want another loan deal so either a permanent deal will have to be arranged in the next few days or a compromise agreement reached whereby he would become a free agent.",
      "Either way, it is expected he will no longer be a Chelsea player after Monday - although he would be well within his rights to stay until his contract runs out.",
      "Sterling signed a five-year deal when Chelsea signed him from Manchester City in a £50 million deal in the summer of 2022.",
      "The deal was done just two months after Chelsea had been bought by new American owners and during a window when co-owner Todd Boehly was acting as the club's interim sporting director.",
      "Filip Jorgensen is expected to remain at Chelsea in this window.",
      "Chelsea's second-choice goalkeeper has been the subject of interest this month from clubs in England, Germany and Turkey, who are keen to offer him more regular football, but Chelsea are reluctant to let the Dane leave before next Monday's deadline.",
      "Chelsea signed Jorgensen from Villarreal for £20.7m in July 2024.",
      "Jorgensen played 24 times for Chelsea last season, predominantly in cup competitions, and was key to their Conference League success, but has been limited to just eight appearances this season.",
      "Jorgensen suffered an injury against Pafos last week and was not pictured at Chelsea training on Tuesday morning.",
