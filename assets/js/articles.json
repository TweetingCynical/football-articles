      "Benjamin Sesko was once hailed as a better player than Manchester City's Erling Haaland by a coach who has worked with both stars. Manchester United's search for a new striker looks to have led them to Red Bull Leipzig's star forward, Sesko, although they haven't ruled out a move for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.",
      "Sesko, 22, boasts an impressive record of 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig and has caught the eye of several top-flight English clubs. United are now poised to make their move for the much-admired striker, but face a battle for his signature with Newcastle.",
      "Former Red Bull Salzburg coach Rene Aufhauser once shared his belief that Sesko could even surpass Haaland in terms of potential. Haaland, now 25, had a stint at Salzburg from 2019 to 2020, while Sesko played for the Austrian side between 2020-2023.",
      "\"Benjamin is maybe the better football player, better to play with the team, technically maybe better at the same age,\" Rene Aufhauser said to The Mail in 2022, when Sesko was just 19. \"His natural movements are so good, he's 6ft 4in tall, fast and has very, very good physical ability.",
      "\"He's so smooth with the ball, very good technique, good finishing and he jumps so high. Very, very, good with the head. It's unbelievable.",
      "\"Erling [Haaland] was mentally a monster and (mentally) better at the same age,\" Aufhauser continued. \"This is the last five, 10 per cent that Benji has to get.\"",
      "While Sesko is younger, it's true that by 22 - the Slovenian's current age - Haaland had already scored his big-money move to City, where he won the Premier League in his maiden season with the Citizens. He has consistently been the league's most feared frontman since teaming up with Pep Guardiola, winning two top-flight titles and the Champions League.",
      "Sesko actually turned down United three years ago in favour of a move to Leipzig but is now eager to secure a high-profile transfer this summer. The Slovenian is contracted to Leipzig until 2029, but his agent, Elvis Basanovic, has kept the lines of communication open since United's initial approach and even visited their Carrington training complex.",
      "So, if United do make a play for Sesko, does he have what it takes to succeed in the Premier League? Aufhauser felt that the three-time Slovenian Youth Footballer of the Year still had some way to go before he could be considered the complete package.",
      "\"He needs experience at this level and also maybe to learn to handle and deal with disappointment,\" he said in 2022. \"Sometimes he wants to be perfect. He has to stay cool, stay calm and to wait for his next chance. This is maybe the biggest thing he has to learn.\"",
      "Fast forward three years, armed with three Austrian Bundesliga titles and a goalscoring tally that would make many of Europe's top strikers envious, it seems Sesko might just be poised to take the leap to United – potentially challenging Haaland as one of England's most fearsome forwards.",

      "Jadon Sancho could return to Borussia Dortmund this summer for just a quarter of what they sold him for four years ago as Manchester United remain determined to get him off their books.",
      "The forward is one of a number of players currently in limbo when it comes to their future. Sancho, like several of his team-mates, has returned from a loan spell away last term but is not directly part of the plans under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Sancho was at Chelsea last term and prior to that had a short loan stint at Dortmund, the club where he first made his name. The Daily Mail now reports that a third spell at the German club could be on the cards.",
      "United signed Sancho for just over £70million but he's been unable to deliver on that fee. As a result they're willing to sell up and a move to either Juventus or Dortmund is being talked up.",
      "The Manchester outfit would accept between £15m and £17m, which represents a mammoth loss. However that figure is necessary to tempt potential buyers given that neither Juventus or Dortmund have the finances to break the bank to land Sancho.",
      "United had a deal in place with Chelsea to make Sancho’s loan a permanent deal, worth up to £25m, at the end of last season, but the Londoners chose to pay a £5m penalty to rip up the agreement. The England international is also entering the final year of his contract.",
      "He currently earns £275,000-a-week, a figure he would need to take a massive cut on, and his decline since moving to Manchester has seen him fall out of the picture with the Three Lions. It was at Dortmund that he was first capped by his country.",
      "Last summer when the German club reached the Champions League final, with Sancho playing a key role, there was talk of a permanent switch but club chief Sebastian Kehl admitted that finances were an issue. “In the end, it will take money (to sign Sancho). A lot of money. Definitely more than we have at the moment, that’s clear,\" he said at the time.",
      "As well as Sancho United have the likes of Antony and Alejandro Garnacho at the club, but they are trying to shift them in the coming weeks. Amorim has maintained the club have their valuations and opened the door to them being reintegrated into the squad if they do remain.",
      "He said: The club have a number for these players. If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. I understand the clubs are waiting for the last minute but they can have a surprise. I’m ready to receive the players.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko has proven Alan Shearer wrong as he angles for a move to Manchester United. The Slovenian star has been heavily linked with both the Red Devils and Newcastle United as he looks set to leave RB Leipzig this summer.",
      "Sesko, who is valued at £64million, is set to move on after Leipzig missed out on Champions League football. United will be absent from European football completely this season following a torrid 2024/25 campaign, which culminated in a 1-0 loss to Tottenham in the Europa League final.",
      "After that game, Shearer ripped into Ruben Amorim and his team, blasting their tactics and the club's general direction. The Newcastle icon was adamant United would struggle to attract top players without the carrot of Champions League football.",
      "Speaking on the Rest is Football podcast, he said: “They’re going to have to recruit very well because clearly a lot of these players are not good enough or not suited to that style of play. They’re a million miles off it on and off the pitch and I don’t know how they get out of this.",
      "“How do they attract top players this summer and are they even going to be able to pay for them now they’re not in the Champions League? Why would big players want to go there?”",
      "However, contrary to Shearer’s view, it seems Sesko has not been put off by the lack of European football on offer at United amid reports he is favouring a move to Old Trafford over Newcastle, who have qualified for UEFA’s top club competition.",
      "According to Sky in Germany, Sesko has reacted positively to United’s interest. Amorim has already strengthened his forward line this summer with big-money moves for Bryan Mbeumo - who also picked them over a club playing in the Champions League - and Matheus Cunha, but the United boss still wants to add more firepower to his squad.",
      "Newcastle aren’t out of the race to sign the 22-year-old. The Magpies’ need for a quality forward has intensified after Alexander Isak made it clear he wants to leave the club amid interest from Liverpool.",
      "Newcastle are under no pressure to sell their star striker but are giving serious consideration to cashing in on a Swede, who was sent home from the club’s recent friendly at Celtic before being ruled out of their pre-season tour to Asia.",
      "Head coach Eddie Howe insists the final decision over Isak will be made by the club’s board. He said: “I wouldn't put a timescale on it. I think with these situations, it has to be right for the football club, and everything then is taken into context below that.",
      "“But the club will make the right decision with all the information that it has, and ultimately, to try and move the club forward in whatever way that is. Then it’s up to us to make good decisions the other way and try and improve the squad as best we can. That’s what we're trying to do, regardless of Alex's situation.",
      "“But I think there's a wider picture here. There’s a whole football club that has to make the decision. The ownership, together with the board of directors, especially with the money involved in modern day transfers. The manager of course has an opinion, but ultimately the decision will rest with the board.”",

      "Manchester United are stepping up their bid to sign a striker before the start of the new season – with Ollie Watkins now their first-choice target.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim wants a proven goalscorer to lead his side's attack, with Aston Villa and England striker Watkins seen as the ideal choice to fill the role. This summer United have adopted a policy of signing players with Premier League experience, as evidenced by the recruitment of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "United are continuing that strategy with a move for Watkins, but are understood to be unwilling to meet Villa's £60million valuation of the 29-year-old.",
      "There is hope among the United hierarchy that a compromise figure of £40m-£45m for Watkins can be reached with Villa and enable a deal to be struck between the two clubs.",
      "Watkins scored 17 goals last season, 16 in the Premier League, with Amorim wanting a striker who can go straight into United's team and start scoring regularly, without needing time to adapt.",
      "As well as Watkins, United are keeping tabs on RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, but the Bundesliga club want around £70m for him and Newcastle are in pole position to sign the 22-year-old Slovenian.",
      "United are exploring the possibility of deals for Watkins and Sesko, but a move for Nicolas Jackson has been ruled out due to Chelsea's £80million asking price for him.",
      "While Amorim is keen to get a new striker signed as quickly as possible to give him time to settle in and build up an understanding with his new team-mates, he accepts that negotiations could drag on.",
      "In order to fund a move for a striker, United must raise revenue from player sales, with the double sale of Alejandro Garnacho and Antony – both left out of the US tour squad - enough to cover the cost of a new front man.",
      "United are also trying to offload Jadon Sancho and Tyrrell Malacia, who joined Garnacho and Antony in being left behind by Amorim, while Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona has saved around £12m, with the Spanish giants covering his wages for the whole of next season.",
      "United's determination to sign a new striker casts doubt over the future of Rasmus Hojlund, who struggled last season, scoring just 10 goals from 52 appearances in all competitions.",
      "Villa sources insist Watkins is not for sale, but they wanted £60m from Arsenal in January, before changing their stance when Jhon Duran left to join Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr.",

      "Manchester United have been linked with a fresh move for PSG star Randal Kolo Muani, having previously targeted the forward in 2023. The club ultimately opted to sign Rasmus Hojlund ahead of Kolo Muani that summer, but the France international looks to be available once again.",
      "United were enticed by Hojlund’s long-term potential, having impressed during his time at Atalanta, resulting in an eye-catching £72million move to Old Trafford. After a slow start, the young Dane ended his debut season with 16 goals in all competitions, but he found the net on just 10 occasions last term.",
      "As United work on improving their frontline through the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, Ruben Amorim’s side have also been linked with a new number nine. Kolo Muani may have been snubbed in favour of Hojlund two years ago, but reports in Italy have claimed that United are targeting the PSG forward, who spent time on loan at Juventus last season.",
      "Gazzetta dello Sport has reported that United have entered the race to sign Kolo Muani. The France international completed an initial £65m (€75m) move to PSG in 2023 following a prolific spell at Eintracht Frankfurt, which had also caught United's attention.",
      "The 26-year-old has since struggled to cement his place at the French club but showed signs of his best form during his Juventus loan spell, scoring 10 goals in 22 games. Gazzetta dello Sport claims that Kolo Muani remains a top target for Juventus and discussions with PSG are ongoing, but United are also pursuing the forward.",
      "It is reported that United’s interest in Kolo Munai, who is claimed to favour a return to Turin, has become more concrete since missing out on Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal. Meanwhile, PSG are keen to complete a permanent sale for the forward, though Juventus are said to have proposed a £8.6m (€10m) loan fee ahead of a future £39m (€45m) deal.",
      "However, if United succeed in snapping up Juventus target Kolo Muani, it could have a knock-on effect for Hojlund. Gazzetta dello Sport claims that Kolo Muani heading to Old Trafford would lead Juventus to have an interest in signing Hojlund on loan.",
      "Hojlund does have Serie A experience from his sole season with Atalanta. The 22-year-old scored nine league goals for the Bergamo club before sealing his big-money move to United.",
      "The potential arrival of Kolo Muani would threaten Hojlund’s place in the pecking order. He is already competing with Joshua Zirkzee and youngster Chido Obi for a starting spot, while new signings Cunha and Mbeumo could also be viewed as alternative centre-forwards.",
      "Kolo Muani is in need of a fresh start, as it recently emerged that he has been made to train with the youth team as PSG looks to offload the forward. If a move fails to materialise this summer, he faces the unenviable task of competing with PSG’s Champions League-winning attack for game time.",
      "United have also been linked with moves for Aston Villa ’s Ollie Watkins and Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic. However, United boss Amorim recently played down the team’s need for new signings.",
      "\"In the moment we need to be careful when we sign a player,” Amorim explained. “If I start the season with this squad I will be happy.\"",
      "He added: \"You feel the bond between the players in the best teams. We remind ourself how special it is to be at the best club in the world. I really like to be in a group that is healthy. We are going to suffer but that feeling of bonding is really important. The spirit is positive.\"",

      "Lammens is one of the players United are considering after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Onana was dropped by Ruben Amorim during the 2024/25 campaign, only for his back-up Bayindir to fail to take his chance in goal.",
      "The situation has led to much speculation over potential targets this summer, with ambitious interest in Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma emerging. United even approached Villa over a loan deal for Martinez, only for their offer to be rejected out of hand, while Donnarumma is unlikely to swap Champions League winners for a side that finished 15th last season.",
      "Lammens, a 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper, is clearly a much more attainable target for United at this stage. He is reportedly available for a fee of around £13m-17m after Antwerp sporting director Marc Overmars signed Taishi Brandon Nozawa to replace him.",
      "He played the full 90 minutes in his side’s 1-1 draw against Royale Union Saint-Gilloise in the league at the weekend. But speaking afterwards, it is clear that Lammens is courting a move away from Belgium.",
      "“Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he told reporters. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here, in any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.”",
      "He added: “I certainly have enough confidence in myself. I think the most important thing is that my future team, whenever they arrive, has a plan in place. Ideally, that means playing immediately, but it’s also possible I’ll have to take a step in between.",
      "“As long as there’s a plan, it doesn’t matter whether I’m ready for the next step or not. Everyone has their own career, their own path. Even if I don’t take the right step right away, I’ll get there.",
      "“It could be within a few days, but also a few months or a year. I have people around me who help me with that, and that way I can focus on what I need to do.”",
      "Royal Antwerp manager Stef Wils won’t stand in his way if United do come calling. “He’s proven why,” he said, referring to the transfer interest. “He has everything a modern goalkeeper needs, and as a young lad, he still has room to grow in a major league. He exudes calm and inspires confidence in his defenders, a plus on high balls.”",

      "Manchester United still have a lot of work to do in the summer transfer window after signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United endured a miserable 2024/25 season and know they need major reinforcements if they are to turn things around. Cunha, a £62.5million addition from Wolves, and Mbeumo, who cost a potential £71m from Brentford, are big signings, but it has been slow going on other fronts.",
      "The most important is at centre-forward, where United missed out on Liam Delap to Chelsea, Hugo Ekitike to Liverpool and Viktor Gyokeres to Arsenal. They cannot afford another miss and have identified some new targets, including Benjamin Sesko.",
      "United know how difficult it can be to sign a striker, having missed out on at least three occasions already this summer to rivals. Well, another similar situation could be brewing with RB Leipzig striker Sesko and Newcastle.",
      "The Magpies lost out on Ekitike to Liverpool and need to replace Callum Wilson, even if Alexander Isak stays put. They are moving for Sesko and it appears to be a straight shoot-out with United, who are also interested.",
      "Local newspaper Leipziger Volkszeitung says Sesko’s agent is in talks with both Newcastle and United and it could come down to the choice of the Slovenian. In that case, Sesko would ‘undoubtedly’ pick Ruben Amorim’s side, despite the fact they can’t offer any European football and Newcastle are in the Champions League.",
      "Royal Antwerp goalkeeper Senne Lammens is keen on a move to Manchester United. Lammens is one of the players United are considering after a difficult campaign for Andre Onana, while Altay Bayindir didn't convince when he got a chance either. Ambitious moves for Aston Villa's Emi Martinez and Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma have gone nowhere, but Lammens is available for €15-20million (£13-17m).",
      "“Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he told reporters after sporting director Marc Overmars signed Taishi Brandon Nozawa to replace him. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here, in any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you’ve earned it.”",

Everyone has their own career, their own path. Even if I don’t take the right step right away, I’ll get there.”",
      "Al-Nassr appear to be coming to Manchester United’s rescue with a move for Antony. The Brazilian is one of the outcasts Amorim is desperate to sell, but a move back to Real Betis, following a successful loan spell, never materialised due to financial problems.",
      "Now the Saudi Arabian side have made their interest known. Fresh off the back of agreeing a deal for one Premier League flop, in the form of Chelsea’s Joao Felix, Al-Nassr also want to do the charity of signing Antony to join Sadio Mane and Cristiano Ronaldo up front.",
      "Antony would consider such a move, according to his agent, so it looks like a goer. Having already got rid of Marcus Rashford to Barcelona, this would leave Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho as the final unwanted players to offload.",

      "Luckily for United, Sesko has responded well, having been left impressed by what the Red Devils had to say. There is still some work to do on a deal though, with Leipzig wanting around £64m for their star forward.",
      "Meanwhile, boss Amorim has already spoken about what he wants from his new signings. He said: “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already.",
      "“Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.”",
      "Sesko, who has scored 39 goals for Leipzig over the past two seasons, has already revealed what could help him make a decision - a potential new club’s style of play. Speaking after he signed for Leipzig, he said: \"The thing is, I wasn't really involved in these kinds of conversations, but I think it was better to come here.",
      "\"It was very important for me to go to a place that plays a similar style of football. I already knew what I had to do and didn't have to go through a whole learning process again.\"",
      "He doubled down on that stance after penning a new contract with the German side last summer. He said: “Leipzig has given me a lot and continues to give me a lot every day. It’s a great club to develop at. In the future, I want to play for a club that suits me, that brings out the best in me. That’s the most important thing for me.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Radek Vitek has signed a new contract with the Red Devils before completing a loan move to Bristol City. The 21-year-old is a product of the club’s academy and has regularly been afforded chances to train with the first team at Carrington.",
      "But instead of joining the side on their pre-season tour, Vitek has penned a new deal until the summer of 2028 and straight away moved to Championship side Bristol City on a season-long loan. The Czech Republic youth international has previously had spells on loan with Accrington Stanley and Austrian side Blau-Weiß Linz.",
      "On completing his move to Ashton Gate, Vítek said: “I’m really excited, for me the Championship is a new level. More games is a big positive for me and I can’t wait to get to know all the players and staff better.”",
      "Vitek will now hope to earn more experience having been tipped for big things by Academy lead goalkeeping coach Tommy Lee. He said: \"Radek has done great out there in Austria.",
      "“He got an injury early on but recovered extremely well and played really well. He has got really good experience there. I think we often use Radek as an example to some of the younger goalkeepers in the Academy.",
      "“He is a player who maximises every part of the programme to ensure he is the best he can possibly be. Nutrition, gym, analysis. He is the consummate professional and that is going to take him, I believe, to the top level.",
      "\"He is a talented boy and that needs to be said. He's 6ft 6ins and that always helps! For the other lads, their challenge is to be as good as Radek and do everything he does and more. He is a great example of someone who does that.\"",
      "Vitek’s departure comes amid uncertainty within the goalkeeping ranks at Old Trafford. Current number one Andre Onana’s future is up in the air following a tricky couple of campaigns during his time with United.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side have been linked with a host of potential replacements including Aston Villa star Emi Martinez. United have already lodged a loan bid for the 2022 World Cup winner but that was rebuffed by the Midlands side.",
      "Senne Lammens of Royal Antwerp has also emerged as a potential option for United, albeit would be a far less experienced option that Martinez.",

      "Manuel Ugarte has vowed to show he is worth the £50million fee Manchester United paid for him.",
      "Ugarte, signed from Paris St Germain a year ago, endured a tough first season as United ended in 15th place – their worst Premier League finish. The Uruguay star failed to deliver on his huge transfer fee and was an unused sub for United's last two games of the season – including the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "But Ugarte impressed in United's 2-1 win over West Ham in the opening game of their US tour at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium. The 24-year-old pressed high, regularly won back possession and went on a fine run to set Amad up for a goal that was ultimately ruled out for offside.",
      "It was a positive start to pre-season for Ugarte, one which suggests he could start in midfield for United in their season opener at home to Arsenal on August 17.",
      "Asked if he will start the new season with more confidence, Ugarte said: “Without a doubt. I know the rivals, I know the team-mates [better]. All of this is important. Sometimes the connections take time to get to know each other.",
      "“I already know the league, the rivals, which is important. So I’m very happy, but we have to keep going.",
      "“Last year we made some changes. We changed our coach, we changed our formation. We got to know the Premier League.",
      "“This year I'm good, I'm very excited. It's important to perform well with United. You have to have responsibilities when you play for United. I'm very happy and we have to keep going.",
      "“We're very optimistic because we all work together. We try to be humble day by day, game by game and we will see this season.",
      "\"Without a doubt, we have to improve things. We're all very motivated, because we believe in the coach, we believe in what he wants and that is very important.”",
      "Ugarte said United's new signings – Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and young defender Diego Leon – had settled in and – in Cunha and Mbeumo - will improve the team with their proven quality in the Premier League.",
      "“All three players who came are very good people and good players,” said Ugarte. “It's important that everyone is together in the dressing room and we have to keep going.",
      "“We won [against West Ham], which was important, but we keep working, because we have a lot to improve. We have more games to play, but I think it's important to have humility.",
      "“We have to work day-in, day-out. We played well in midfield, we controlled the ball, we had the ball, we scored and we recovered well. We all have a good relationship, there is a lot of optimism in the team.”",

      "Marcus Rashford's humiliating debut for Barcelona comes almost 10 years after his first start for Manchester United, after which he was hailed by former team-mate Michael Carrick. Rashford joined the La Liga champions last week on a season-long loan move after becoming surplus to requirements under Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "After kicking off life in Catalonia by training with his new team-mates, Rashford then flew out on the club's pre-season tour of Japan. A 3-1 victory over J-League side Vissel Kobe followed in what was his first match for the club.",
      "However, it was an embarrassing baptism for Rashford, who came on at half-time before being replaced in just the 78th minute. His low-key bow for Barca is worlds apart from when former United star Carrick gushed over Rashford's senior debut for his boyhood club in February 2016.",
      "Rashford was only 18 when he was brought into the United starting line-up against FC Midtjylland in the Europa League as a last-minute replacement for the injured Anthony Martial. He quickly announced himself to the world as he scored twice in a 5-1 United win.",
      "Afterwards, in what is a far cry from the reaction to his Barca debut, Carrick lauded Rashford. \"It's great. You can't put a price on that for the younger lads, especially Marcus. It's incredible and brings back memories for me, when I made my debut,\" Carrick told MUTV.",
      "\"It's what football's all about, and what this club has been about for so long. For a local lad to do that and come through the system like that, I'm delighted for him.\"",
      "After his first minutes for Barcelona, manager Hansi Flick explained why the 27-year-old came off just over half an hour after coming on. \"He's [a] week behind the others,\" Flick said.",
      "\"He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him. It was a very good match, a good test for us. The first 30 minutes were fantastic.",
      "\"After that we lost a bit of control, but the second half was also very good. I'm pleased. What they do with the ball, how they pressed us, it’s really interesting. You can tell they have a clear idea, and it’s similar to ours.\"",
      "Rashford hadn't played for United since December 2024 after being dropped by Amorin. He spent the second half of the 2024/25 season on loan at Aston Villa.",
      "Barca have the option to make Rashford's deal permanent for £26million next summer after he was handed the No. 14 shirt, previously worn by Thierry Henry at the club. Since arriving, he has claimed that his new residence feels like home.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford told Barcelona's YouTube channel upon his unveiling. \"It's a club where people's dreams come true, they win big prizes. What the club stands for means a lot for me.",
      "\"I feel like I'm at home and a big factor in my choice to come here is because it is a family place and a good place for good players to showcase their skills. Another factor is because the conversations I had with [Hansi Flick] were positive.",
      "\"What he did last season was terrific. To lead such a young team to a very successful season and come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club and it's everything I wished. I'm eager to learn the Barcelona way.\"",
      "Next up for Barcelona is a friendly against Seoul in the South Korean capital on Thursday. Rashford will have a reunion with ex-United team-mate Jesse Lingard, who captains the K-League side.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford suffered one of the biggest humiliations a top-level footballer can endure on Sunday. The Manchester United forward completed what he hoped to be a dream loan move to Barcelona last week as he looks to get his career back on track.",
      "The deal, which was finalised in time for Rashford to fly to Japan with the rest of the Barca squad, gives the La Liga champions an option to buy the forward for £26million at the end of the season. Rashford’s first pre-season outing came against Japanese side Vissel Kobe, where he started the game on the bench.",
      "Flick brought the 27-year-old on for his much-anticipated debut at half-time, with Rashford showing glimpses of promise and working hard to track back in his new Blaugrana colours. However, he was quickly cut down to size as manager Hansi Flick took him off after just 33 minutes, moments after playing a key role in Barcelona’s second goal.",
      "Rashford and left-back Jofre Torrents made way for Gerard Martin and Pedro Fernandez, who scored Barca’s third goal. While the substitution would have stung Rashford, Flick explained that his decision was not performance related, saying: \"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury.\"",
      "Just seven days ago, Rashford had been part of United’s ‘bomb squad’ – the group training alone and made to use the club’s Carrington training ground only once the first-team squad had gone home for the day.",
      "One player who knows exactly how Rashford would have felt this weekend is former Tottenham midfielder Hossam Ghaly. He was signed by Spurs in 2006 and was used sporadically by then-head coach Martin Jol during the 2006/07 season.",
      "After being in and out of the squad, the Egyptian was brought on against Blackburn Rovers in the first half of the penultimate game of the Premier League season after an injury to Steed Malbranque. But, like Rashford, he found himself substituted 31 minutes after his introduction – only his substitution WAS due to a poor performance.",
      "Unlike Rashford, Ghaly responded in the worst possible way, furiously throwing his shirt on the ground while walking off the pitch. The act infuriated the Spurs faithful as jeers and chants of “You’re not fit to wear the shirt” rang around the stadium.",
      "Ghaly was disciplined by the club and left out of the matchday squad on the final day of the season, before making a public apology. He said: \"I am just so angry with myself. I have always considered it an honour to wear the Tottenham shirt and I never intended to show any disrespect.",
      "\"I knew things weren't happening for me out there, my play was terrible and I could hear the crowd jeering me.",
      "\"I was so upset at the fans' reaction. I have enjoyed playing in front of the club's supporters all season and I felt I had given my best all the time and played some decent football.",
      "\"It is always hard to accept being substituted after such a short period of time and I was upset and taken aback by the cheering. I am a player who plays with my heart.",
      "\"I know my reaction was totally wrong,\" he added. \"I have apologised to the manager and I also want to apologise to the fans. I hope they don't judge me on this incident alone. I have tried hard for the club this season.\"",
      "Despite his best efforts at reconciliation, it marked Ghaly’s last game for Spurs as he was sent out on loan to Derby County in January 2008. He returned to north London for the 2008/09 season but didn’t play a single game before his permanent departure.",
      "Harry Redknapp considered bringing him on during a January 2009 clash with Wigan, but the Englishman decided against it after hearing the fans boo Ghaly while he was warming up and preparing to come on off the bench.",
      "Rashford will want to avoid such a fate at Barcelona, though he will also hope that Flick does not make a habit of subjecting him to external ridicule. The England international has had his fair share of spats with United managers Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim in recent years.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "England midfielder Ella Toone was playing in memory of her late father as she helped the Lionesses win another European Championship. Nick Toone was diagnosed with prostate cancer the day after he watched Ella score in the 2022 final, as England beat Germany 2-1 at Wembley.",
      "In September of last year, Nick died three days short of his 60th birthday. \"For the past few months, I've been trying to figure it all out, trying to get unstuck,\" Ella wrote for the Players' Tribune in January.",

      "The Manchester United vice-captain continues to be inspired by her dad and topped off her most challenging season yet with another international trophy. Toone started all but one of England's matches on their way to the final and produced another lung-busting display against Spain.",
      "She was replaced by Beth Mead in the 87th minute, as the Lionesses dug in and took the game to extra-time and penalties before getting their hands on the trophy for the second time in three years. Post-match, Toone shared two emotional Instagram stories and revealed that her mum had been sat next to a spare seat at the final in Basel, Switzerland.",
      "\"Spare seat next to my mum tonight,\" she wrote alongside an image of the empty seat. \"If that's not a sign I don't know what is. I know you were there Dad. Love you cock.\"",
      "Toone also posted a selfie with Mead - who lost her mum, Jane, to ovarian cancer in January 2023 - with the caption: \"We did it for our angels in the sky. Forever with us & forever proud.\"",
      "Who was your Player of the Tournament for England? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",

      "Arsenal have completed deals for Viktor Gyokeres and Cristhian Mosquera and are now chasing Crystal Palace star Eberechi Eze, while Jack Grealish, Aaron Ramsdale and James Trafford could all be on the move soon.",
      "Danny Rohl has agreed a deal to leave Sheffield Wednesday with immediate effect.",
      "The Athletic says the German manager has told his players and staff that he is leaving the club amid the ongoing turmoil, which has seen late payments to staff.",
      "Under owner Dejphon Chansiri, the Owls have suffered cash flow issues, which have seen them lumped with a three-window transfer ban.",
      "Rohl did a fine job at the helm under tough circumstances and his exit leaves the Championship side in apparent freefall.",
      "Leandro Trossard is yet to sign the new contract that is being offered by Arsenal, according to The Athletic.",
      "Trossard, who has also changed agents, has previously been linked with a move to Saudi Arabia and is reportedly keen to keep his options open this summer. The arrival of Noni Madueke has increased competition for places and the deal, which would up his wages, but not increase his stay beyond 2027, isn't appealing right now.",
      "Tottenham could be new frontrunners to sign Rodrygo from Real Madrid.",

      "Traore has played under Nuno Espirito Santo at Wolves and could link up with him again as a replacement for Anthony Elanga, who joined Newcastle for £55million earlier this month.",
      "Ndoye would be a club-record purchase for Forest, eclipsing the £30m spent on Ibrahim Sangare. The 24-year-old Swiss international is in talks with Forest, where he is eyeing a five-year contract.",
      "The club need wingers after losing Elanga and selling Ramon Sosa to Palmeiras for £10m, while Jota Silva is also edging towards the exit.",

      "The Brazilian has been allowed to depart Asia and head home to the UK, where he will link up with his team-mates again upon their return.",

This summer United have adopted a policy of signing players with Premier League experience, as evidenced by the recruitment of Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",

      "The Italy international's current deal with PSG expires next summer and the European champions don't want to lose him for nothing. Luis Enrique's side will therefore listen to offers for Donnarumma after striking an agreement with Lille to sign Lucas Chevalier.",
      "PSG's move could spring United into action, with Ruben Amorim keen on a new goalkeeper of his own. The Red Devils are understood to be interested in Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens, who'd provide competition for Andre Onana.",
      "Although Onana has no plans to leave Old Trafford, the Cameroonian's form has been an issue for Amorim. The United manager even took the 29-year-old out of the firing line towards the end of last season after a string of mistakes.",
      "But instead of signing an up-and-coming shot-stopper like Lammens, the vastly experienced Donnarumma could be an option after privately discussing a move to England with his Italy team-mates. French outlet L'Equipe report that as PSG prepare to welcome Chevalier, both United and rivals Manchester City have registered their interest in Donnarumma.",
      "Chelsea have also been linked with a move while Galatasaray are said to have gone a step further by making a formal approach. It'd be a surprise if City put their hat in the ring after they struck a £27m deal with Burnley to re-sign James Trafford.",
      "The topic of Donnarumma's future was bubbling under the surface as the ex-AC Milan wonderkid helped PSG finally get their hands on the Champions League in May. As recently as last month, Donnarumma confirmed that it was his priority to stay in Paris.",
      "\"My priority is to stay at PSG, I don't think there will be any problems in the negotiations,\" Donnarumma told Sky Italia on June 9. \"We're a great team.\"",
      "Napoli have also been linked with Donnarumma but his agent, Enzo Raiola - cousin of the late super agent, Mino - dismissed the speculation by labelling it 'pure fantasy'. \"I've an excellent relationship with Director Giovanni Manna at [Napoli], but we've never discussed Gigio,\" Raiola told Radio CRC via Calciomercato.",
      "\"He feels good in Paris, we're at the European champion club, so we have no complaints. We are working on a renewal. I have never ruled out interest from the top Italian clubs, but there has never been a negotiation, let's see.",
      "\"He is still young, I have to squeeze him for at least another 10 years. At the moment, however, it is very difficult to see Donnarumma in the Italian championship, I'm not just talking about numbers but also about the sporting project.",
      "\"In Italy, beyond Inter who reached the Champions League final, there are Milan and Juventus who are struggling, they are in the process of reorganising: these factors are fundamental.\"",

      "They say it is the biggest humiliation a footballer can experience: being a substitute that, after getting on the pitch, is then subbed off. So why did Hansi Flick bring on Marcus Rashford for 30 minutes on his Barcelona debut - and then take him off again?",
      "Rashford, 27, appeared for the first since completing his season-long loan move from Manchester United in midweek, ending his exile at Old Trafford. The forward's transfer - which includes a £26million option to buy - was finalised in time for him to fly to Japan with the rest of Barca's squad, as they embark on a pre-season tour of Asia. First up was a clash with Japanese side Vissel Kobe in a friendly match which was initially suspended before organisers scrambled to make it happen.",
      "Rashford was named on the bench by Flick before the German changed his entire line-up at half-time. The United loanee showed promise during his 30-minute cameo, notably playing a crucial role when fellow new signing Roony Bardghji got on the scoresheet in Barcelona's 3-1 win.",
      "After defender Jofre Torrents won back possession on the left, Rashford collected the ball and played a perfectly-weighted pass through to Robert Lewandowski. Barca's No.9 then picked out Bardghji on the right, as the former Copenhagen hotshot produced an impressive first-time finish.",
      "Seconds later, Rashford was brought off. The England international and Torrents were replaced by Gerard Martin and Pedro Fernandez, scorer of Barcelona's third goal, in the 77th minute.",
      "Post-match, Flick was asked about his decision to haul both Rashford and Torrents off after half an hour each.",
      "\"Rashford hasn't played that much, and we also wanted to give Gerard Martin 15 minutes because he was playing after his injury,\" the Barcelona manager explained. Which, obviously, makes perfect sense for a player who, just seven days ago, was a member of Manchester United's 'bomb squad' training alone and made to use the club's Carrington training ground when the first-team squad had gone home.",
      "For Flick, these early days are about getting Rashford up to speed, slowly but surely, helping him adjust to what he wants. Do it correctly, and it's another match winner among Barca's collection of stars. Subbing him on and then off in a pre-season friendly? Not a problem for the manager nor his new player.",
      "Will Marcus Rashford be a success at Barcelona? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Flick was a 'key' reason why Rashford joined the La Liga champions, having led Barcelona to three trophies in his first season. \"He was another key factor for me to join Barca,\" the 27-year-old revealed during his unveiling.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive. He has proven to be one of the top coaches... He led a young team to such a successful season and has returned to the preseason wanting more.\"",
      "Rashford's team-mates are already looking forward to playing alongside him. \"Rashford is a very talented player,\" Lewandowski told reporters in Japan.",
      "\"We played Manchester United two years ago and he was in great form. He can help us and is able to play in different positions.\"",

      "Manchester United are aiming to gazump Brentford in the race for Metz wonderkid Idrissa Gueye after being left furious by the Bees. The Red Devils have already spent heavily this summer to bolster their frontline.",
      "The £63m signing of former Wolves star Matheus Cunha was followed by the £71m acquisition of Bryan Mbeumo, who eventually completed a switch to Old Trafford after weeks of protracted negotiations.",
      "And while United eventually managed to get their man, they weren’t left particularly happy with the actions of their colleagues at Brentford. Red Devils chiefs had been left furious with Brentford’s attempts to sell Mbeumo elsewhere, with Newcastle, Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal all reportedly interested.",
      "United have accused Brentford of attempting to convince the forward to lower his wage demands, while they also thought the Bees increased their demands once a deal was close.",
      "And given the hostility between the two clubs at the current time, United have threatened to make things even worse by moving for a Brentford target. According to The Sun, both sides are going head to head for Metz youngster Idrissa Gueye.",
      "The teenager has emerged as a key target for Keith Andrews this summer, who may be forced to match the French side’s asking price of £15m for Gueye to fight off competition from United and Burnley. It is suggested that the London side would be willing to offer the youngster instant Premier League football, while United see him as one for the future.",
      "Gueye, 18, is a product of the Metz academy and went on to score five goals in 17 Ligue 2 appearances last term. And he now faces a decision over his future, albeit United will hope that he follows in the footsteps of Mbeumo, who was only interested in signing for the Red Devils.",
      "“As soon as I knew there was a chance to join Manchester United, I had to take the opportunity to sign for the club of my dreams - the team whose shirt I wore growing up,\" he said.",
      "“My mentality is to always be better than I was yesterday. I know that I have the spirit and character to reach another level here, learning from Ruben Amorim and playing alongside world-class players.",
      "“Everybody told me about the environment that is being created here and how exciting the plans are for the future. This is a massive club, with an incredible stadium and amazing fans, we are all really determined to challenge for the biggest trophies.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "United have identified Aston Villa figurehead Watkins, 29, as their preferred target but the 22-year-old RB Leipzig frontman Sesko is also under consideration as they approach the final four weeks of the transfer window.",
      "Well-placed sources have suggested Watkins would be open to joining United, who want a new starting striker following the £133.5million investments to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Sesko rejected United three years ago in favour of joining Leipzig but is keen to secure a major move this summer. Sesko is under contract at Leipzig until 2029.",
      "The Slovenia international's agent, Elvis Basanovic, has remained in dialogue with United and visited their Carrington training complex and Old Trafford since holding talks about a possible move in 2022.",
      "Watkins turns 30 on December 30 but has entered the final two years of his Villa contract and has played in the Premier League for five years. The England international has scored 75 goals in 184 Premier League games.",
      "Former Brentford striker Watkins has started at least 30 Premier League matches in each of his five seasons with Villa and has only missed seven games through injury for the club.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim admitted the club had specifically targeted Cunha and Mbeumo due to their Premier League nous. Only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak have scored more league goals than Watkins in the past three campaigns.",
      "Villa were receptive to letting Watkins leave in the winter transfer window but ended up selling Jhon Duran to Al Nassr for £71million instead. Arsenal had a bid of around £60m rejected for Watkins.",
      "United sources concede Watkins would command a sizeable fee but are prepared to move for a more experienced top flight striker after first-choice target Liam Delap chose to join Chelsea.",
      "The club are still aiming to obtain fees for forwards Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho. A United source acknowledged they have extra \"headroom\" following Marcus Rashford's season-long loan to Barcelona, who are covering his salary in full.",
      "Villa and Watkins are also in the United States on their pre-season tour but are not involved in the Premier League Summer Series that United are participating in. Villa play their next games in St Louis and Nashville whereas United are in Chicago and next travel to Atlanta.",

      "Whisper it quietly, but this might finally be the season Manchester United finally see the best of Mason Mount in a red shirt.",
      "When United signed the England international midfielder from Chelsea in a deal worth up to £60million two years ago it was seen as a major coup to get one of their rivals' biggest talents.",
      "One of Mount's greatest abilities was his availability and managers ranging from Thomas Tuchel to Gareth Southgate to Frank Lampard all hailed him as a coach's dream.",
      "Erik ten Hag thought he was going to get the same feeling but, ironically, since joining United, his lack of availability has been a major problem. A number of unfortunate injuries have restricted Mount to just 30 Premier League appearances across his first two seasons in Manchester.",
      "However, he ended last season strongly and scored twice in United's 4-1 Europa League semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao and played a prominent role in the side.",
      "Speaking back in March, United boss Ruben Amorim described why he 'really loved' Mount and why his version of United needed a player like him in the team.",
      "\"I really love Mason Mount,\" he said. \"I see him and know how he suffered. I know how he does everything right - he eats right, his physical aspect is perfect. He’s trying too much. Maybe he is thinking too much about everything.",
      "\"He was European champion, he is a talent. When a player does everything like he does, he will always have the support of everybody here at the club. We will try to manage the load.",
      "\"You saw players who had a lot of problems in time but they can then stay fit and I believe a lot in Mason Mount. We need players like Mason Mount.\"",
      "Mount was signed as a deeper midfield option by Ten Hag but always thrived in a more advanced role at Chelsea. That is where Amorim sees him playing for United, too, but he will have fierce competition this season.",
      "Bruno Fernandes can play in that role while new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored 37 goals between them last season, have been brought in to play in that position.",
      "Mount has a fight on his hands but it is one he seems up for and insists he has ensured he's returned to pre-season feeling as strong as possible.",
      "\"I look at the end of last season and that was positive for me, to get back in the shape that I was in and be able to play and finish the end of the season off, to get a few goals, and to be back in and amongst the lads. That's the most important thing,\" he said.",
      "\"We're all in this together, and I think this period now is so important for us to spend together to train. But yeah, personally, I'm feeling really good. I feel like I'm in a really good place at the moment. I'm so excited for the start of the season.\"",
      "So far, Mount's body has held up in pre-season, having come off the bench in the draw with Leeds and the win over West Ham.",
      "With games against Bournemouth and Everton to come in the USA this week, the 26-year-old will be keen to make his mark ahead of what is a make-or-break season for him in the eyes of United fans.",
      "Amorim's system and support should get the best out of Mount. It is now time for him to deliver what United fans have waited two years to see.",

      "After missing out on Liam Delap, Manchester United have been chasing shadows in their pursuit of a striker this summer.",
      "Delap was identified as United's top striker target ahead of the summer transfer window. Following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship, Delap was available via a £30million release clause. Unfortunately for United, Chelsea won the race for his signature, signing him in time for the start of the Club World Cup.",
      "Although Delap did well for Ipswich last season, scoring 12 goals, signing him to spearhead United's attack after just one season as a Premier League regular would have been a huge risk, meaning it is somewhat bold to suggest missing out on him was a 'blow'.",
      "Nevertheless, missing out on him has delayed their striker search. The additions of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have bolstered their attack, but they are still missing the main piece of the jigsaw.",
      "Links connecting United with Viktor Gyokeres, who has now joined Arsenal, have been and gone, while reports linking them with Victor Osimhen have persisted for as long as one can remember. Exactly where United's striker search will end remains to be seen.",
      "However, according to widespread reports, RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko has made his way back onto United's radar. Former football director John Murtough met Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, to gauge the possibility of a transfer in 2022.",
      "According to Sky Germany, United, alongside Premier League counterparts Newcastle United, have entered discussions with Sesko's representatives.",
      "With Delap, Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike, who was also on United's radar earlier this summer, having all been snapped up already this summer, United's options are dwindling.",
      "United acknowledge they need to recruit a high-end striker to beef up Ruben Amorim's attack, and Sesko is arguably one of the very few left on the market that could be attainable.",
      "It goes without saying Leipzig will want a hefty-sized fee for the 22-year-old, who has four years left on his deal at the Red Bull Arena. He joined Leipzig from sister club Red Bull Salzburg in 2023 and signed a contract extension in June last year.",
      "Two seasons into his career in Germany, the Slovenian has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances in Leipzig colours. He scored 21 times last term.",
      "Sesko is by no means the finished article; he is still fairly young and finding his feet. In all honesty, United should be targeting someone more established and with a proven record in the Premier League.",
      "Nevertheless, Sesko is an option United are reportedly running the rule over once again. And when you remember who is leading their recruitment this summer, it should come as no surprise.",
      "Director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who joined United last year, has been empowered to oversee the club's recruitment network and is a key part of the football structure at Old Trafford. Prior to joining the Reds, Vivell had stints at Chelsea and Leipzig.",
      "After joining the Bundesliga club in August 2020, he became their technical director, meaning he was responsible for recruitment and scouting across all age groups. He had previously spent five years at Salzburg, so is well-versed in the Red Bull model.",
      "Having swapped Salzburg for Leipzig, Sesko followed in his footsteps in 2023, swapping Austria for Germany. Leipzig agreed a deal to sign him in 2022, but the deal did not come into effect until the following year.",
      "Vivell was responsible for Leipzig's recruitment at the point of signing Sesko, meaning he knows all about the striker. He will be advising United and giving them insight on what he could potentially bring to Old Trafford.",
      "Sales, of course, remain key to United's chances of being able to land a big-name striker, and Sesko will command a big fee, but Vivell could make all the difference if a transfer tug-of-war unfolds.",

      "Too many of Manchester United's recent superstar signings have failed to live up to the mark.",
      "Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in typically Zlatan Ibrahimovic style, was different. He arrived at Old Trafford in 2016, announcing his move on social media 24 hours before an official statement. He was in the twilight of his career but plundered 29 goals in 43 starts, helping United win the Europa League, albeit he missed the final through injury, and the League Cup, in which he scored twice as the Reds beat Southampton.",
      "Benjamin Sesko would have taken note. The Slovenia superstar is being linked with a move to United and the prospect of him following in Ibrahimovic's footsteps is one that would excite both Sesko and Reds supporters.",
      "The 22-year-old has forged a reputation as one of Europe's leading goalscorers in recent seasons, transferring the form he showed breaking through at Red Bull Salzburg to the Bundesliga with RB Leipzig. United were first linked with a move for Sesko two years ago and speculation he could join this summer has ramped up in recent days.",
      "He was nothing more than a promising junior when Ibrahimovic was strutting his stuff at Old Trafford but a young Sesko, who is a keen basketball fan and was initially pressed into football as a goalkeeper by his dad, himself a former stopper, before becoming a forward, was enthralled by the Swedish superstar.",
      "“Zlatan Ibrahimovic was my idol,” he said in an interview in 2023. “I’m not saying I play like him but he was having fun, enjoying himself on the pitch, doing what he wanted to do. It makes me really happy when I see that kind of player. Every single video I could find, I was looking at him.”",
      "One of those videos will likely have been the League Cup win in 2017 when Ibrahimovic netted a late winner to hand United the trophy. Sesko has spoken of an interest in playing in the Premier League: \"Of course it would be nice to play there,\" he mused shortly after signing for Leipzig.",
      "His stock has risen considerably since and it's easy to see why. Sesko is a towering forward with an eye for goal, aerial ability, and a thunderous strike, but he offers much more than 'the big man up top'.",
      "He is a willing channel runner, often retreats into midfield to pick up the ball and progress play while his dribbling ability makes him a danger from deep.",
      "He has 27 goals in 47 league starts for Leipzig, numbers that provide a belief he could cut it in the Premier League. And at United, as a focal point of an attack and with a new-look creative force behind him, he could thrive.",
      "If United were able to complete a deal for Sesko, it would significantly enhance a squad that has struggled for goals in the past two seasons and potentially provide a long-term solution.",
      "In his first interview as a Red, Ibrahmiovic said: \"I don't like to compare the past with the present.\"",
      "In Sesko, United would get a reminder of the past with a bright future ahead.",

      "Lammens is one of the goalkeepers on United's radar but continues to be Antwerp's number one. He played in the 1-1 draw with Royale Union Saint-Gilloise and was asked about his future.",
      "\"Manchester United are one of the best clubs, yes,\" he said. \"But you never know. It could also be a different club, or who knows, I might stay here.",
      "\"In any case, I try to keep my feet on the ground. When teams like that come along, I think you've earned it.\"",
      "Wrexham boss Phil Parkinson has cleared the air regarding Christian Eriksen's proposed move.",
      "News broke last week, via MailSport, that the Championship side had enquired about signing the Denmark international, who is now a free agent after leaving United.",
      "The 33-year-old is still considering his options, but for now, it appears as if a move to Wales is off the cards.",
      "\"There was a call, a bit of dialogue over the summer, but it's not gone any further than that,\" Parkinson said.",
      "\"But obviously he's a majorly talented player and very well respected throughout football.\"",
      "Manchester United goalkeeper Radek Vitek has signed a new deal at Old Trafford until 2028.",
      "The 21-year-old will additionally join Bristol City in the Championship for the 2025/26 season.",
      "The move represents Vitek's third loan move away from United, following a successful stint with Blau-Weiss Linz in Austria.",
      "Vitek also spent time with Accrington Stanley back in 2024.",
      "Manchester United are set to sanction a summer loan move for midfielder Toby Collyer.",
      "The 21-year-old is one of five central midfielders available to head coach Ruben Amorim, and it is thought his temporary exit could open the door for a new addition.",
      "Although he didn't manage to get himself on the scoresheet against West Ham United at the MetLife Stadium on Saturday night, Rasmus Hojlund played well.",
      "He spearheaded United's attack and was very unfortunate not to give the Reds the lead inside the opening 50 seconds, smashing an excellent effort against the woodwork.",
      "Hojlund made several intelligent runs against the Hammers and was a general nuisance. Of course, the caveat is that pre-season games are very different to competitive fixtures.",
      "Nevertheless, Hojlund should be encouraged by his display. Of course, he is fighting to keep his place in the starting XI ahead of this coming season amid United's desperate need to sign a new striker.",
      "Even if Hojlund, for example, scores four goals in United's final three friendlies, the club will still need to sign a striker. On the flip side, a successful pre-season campaign for the Dane could elevate his stock and trigger more interest from elsewhere.",
      "Furthermore, a good pre-season could convince United to retain him and keep him as their second striker. That is the role he should have been signed to fill back in 2023.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund is reportedly being watched closely by those at AC Milan.",
      "Corriere dello Sport claim that Milan are searching for a striker who will provide competition with Santiago Gimenez.",
      "Hojlund is said to fit the bill, with Darwin Nunez and Juve star Dusan Vlahovic also of interest.",

      "Manchester United have begun background talks with RB Leipzig over a proposed move for Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Fabrizio Romano expressed that on Monday, United's hierarchy opened up conversations about trying to beat Newcastle United to his signature. In a video uploaded to YouTube, he said:",
      "Man United also in the recent hours on Sunday night, on Monday morning made new contacts with Sesko's camp. Not directly with the player, but with agents of the player to start conversations about eventual numbers, the contract, the project, the vision. So Man United are starting to move, Newcastle have already presented their project and are prepared to match the financial request.",
      "Any deal is seen as slightly complicated due to the finances involved, given the Red Devils still need to seek exits for the likes of Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "His price remains set at £60-70m this summer, with add-ons perhaps taking a deal closer to the £80m mark.",
      "Following the signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha already this summer, United's next task is to try and find a striker.",
      "They are desperate to secure a new No.9 this summer and they have been linked with countless names in recent weeks and months.",
      "But after signing two Premier League proven attackers to strengthen their No.10 options, it would be no surprise if United followed suit in their search for a natural No.9.",
      "Liam Delap was attainable via a £30million release clause but ended up at Chelsea, meaning that has forced United to look elsewhere for a goal-getter.",
      "In truth, there are a limited number of Premier League strikers United could realistically try and sign before the end of the window, and even then sales remain vitally important. Ollie Watkins of Aston Villa and Crystal Palace ace Jean-Philippe Mateta are probably the two most attractive options right now.",
      "Nevertheless, the signings of Mbeumo and Cunha show that United want players with Premier League pedigree.",
      "United are being linked with a move for Randal Kolo Muani.",
      "Evening Standard says the 26-year-old PSG man would be available for permanent transfer this summer.",
      "The France international scored eight goals in 16 appearances for Juventus, with his loan deal proving fruitful.",
      "Ruben Amorim has a whole host of options on his current shortlist, which includes Benjamin Sesko, Ollie Watkins and Jean-Philippe Mateta.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is a name that simply will not go away this summer.",
      "The RB Leipzig forward has been linked with United, Newcastle and Arsenal, and his future is still not set in stone.",
      "Ruben Amorim wants a new number nine and appears to be waiting for further outgoings before sanctioning his next addition.",
      "TBR Football have today stated that Sesko would 'prefer' a move to Old Trafford over one to Newcastle.",
      "It remains to be seen, for now, whether the talented Slovenian ends up.",
      "Another one you may have missed over the weekend is the story linking United with Aleksandar Mitrovic.",
      "Caught Offside have claimed that the Reds are planning a surprise move for the striker. He has scored 68 goals in the last two seasons in Saudi Arabia and it's been said he would accept a pay cut to move to Old Trafford.",
      "A fee of £20m has been touted."

      "Attention turned to Rabiot and a £15million fee rising to £20m was agreed with Juventus. However, the move collapsed and sources indicated it was due to the Frenchman's ‘obscene’ salary demands.",

      "In an interview with L’Equipe, Veronique Rabiot has now opened up on the collapsed move.",

      "“We discussed the terms and in the end, they said to me, 'If we don’t qualify for the Champions League at the end of next season, Adrien’s salary will go down.' I found that really over the top and very disrespectful.",

The 22-year-old has scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Red Bull Leipzig and has attracted interest from several Premier League clubs, with United now seriously considering a swoop for the player.",
      "Ex-Red Bull Salzburg coach Rene Aufhauser once believed that the towering striker had even more in his locker than Haaland had. Haaland, 25, played for Salzburg for one season between 2019 and 2020, while Sesko lined up for the Austrians from 2020-2023.",
      "\"Benjamin is maybe the better football player, better to play with the team, technically maybe better at the same age,\" Rene Aufhauser told The Mail in 2022, when Sesko was just 19. \"His natural movements are so good, he's 6ft 4in tall, fast and has very, very good physical ability.",
      "\"He's so smooth with the ball, very good technique, good finishing and he jumps so high. Very, very, good with the head. It's unbelievable.\"",
      "\"Erling [Haaland] was mentally a monster and (mentally) better at the same age,\" Aufhauser added. \"This is the last five, 10 per cent that Benji has to get.\"",
      "While Sesko is younger, it's true that by 22 - the Slovenian's current age - Haaland had already scored his big-money move to City, where he won the Premier League in his maiden season with the Citizens. He has consistently been the league's most feared frontman since teaming up with Pep Guardiola, winning two top-flight titles and the Champions League.",
      "However, Sesko was involved in 18 goal contributions for Leipzig last season as the club struggled in the Bundesliga, ultimately missing out on the Champions League.",
      "United boss Ruben Amorim is now believed to have pivoted to the player, while still keeping an eye on Aston Villa's Watkins. Newcastle United are also firmly in the hunt for Sesko, too, with the Magpies looking for a striker to replace Alexander Isak should he leave amid heavy links to Liverpool.",
      "Sesko actually rejected United three years ago in favour of joining Leipzig but is now keen to secure a major move this summer. The Slovenian is under contract at Leipzig until 2029, but his agent, Elvis Basanovic, has remained in dialogue since United's first inquiry and even visited their Carrington training complex.",
      "If United make a move for Sesko, does he have what it takes to make the grade in the Premier League? Aufhauser was of the opinion that the three-time Slovenian Youth Footballer of the Year had some way to go before becoming the finished article.",
      "\"He needs experience at this level and also maybe to learn to handle and deal with disappointment,\" he said in 2022. \"Sometimes he wants to be perfect. He has to stay cool, stay calm and to wait for his next chance. This is maybe the biggest thing he has to learn.\"",
      "However, three years on, with three Austrian Bundesliga titles to his name and a goalscoring record to put several of Europe's leading strikers to shame, it looks as though Sesko could finally be ready to make the jump to United - and even rival Haaland as one of England's most formidable strikers.",

      "Marcus Rashford has been shown support by Manchester United stars past and present after making his first appearance for Barcelona.",
      "United confirmed last week that Rashford had signed for the La Liga giants on a loan deal for the season ahead. The agreement also includes the option for the transfer to be made permanent next summer.",
      "It was on Sunday when Rashford made his first appearance for Barcelona in a friendly match against Vissel Kobe in Japan. Rashford was introduced at half time before being substituted in the 78th minute.",
      "After the game, which Barcelona won 3-1, Rashford took to social media to post a message about his debut. The on-loan United star posted to his 19.4million followers on Instagram several photos from his cameo in Japan, accompanied with the caption: \"First minutes in a Barca shirt! Vamos.\"",
      "The post has since received more than 1.7million likes, including several from United stars past and present. Joshua Zirkzee, Bruno Fernandes, Antony, Diogo Dalot, Tyrell Malacia, Harry Maguire and Rasmus Hojlund all liked the post from Rashford.",
      "Rashford's post also received some likes from former United players, including Juan Mata, David De Gea, Anthony Martial, Donny van de Beek, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Christian Eriksen.",
      "There were some questions after Barca's win over Vissel Kobe as to why Rashford was only on the pitch for 33 minutes. Manager Hansi Flick explained that the on-loan United star's fitness was the reason for Rashford's minutes being managed.",
      "\"He's a week behind the others,\" he said. \"He hasn't been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him. It was a very good match, a good test for us.\"",

      "Their performance would have pleased Amorim and so too would the two-goal contribution from captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Too often United had to rely on the brilliance of their skipper to pull them out of trouble and that was signified by the fact he scored 19 goals and registered 18 assists in one of United's most forgettable seasons for decades.",
      "If United are going to get back to the top, they need their captain to maintain that brilliant form this season. The key is for others to step up with meaningful contributions of their own.",
      "However, it had been though that Fernandes would be used in a deeper central midfield role this season, having largely impressed as one of Amorim's two attacking midfielders in his 3-4-2-1 formation last term.",
      "New signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo had been tipped to take those two roles this season but in the absence of Mbuemo, Fernandes lined up alongside Cunha in a more advanced role.",
      "And he showed his qualities, linking up with the Brazil international well, and offering Amorim some food for thought - particularly given Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo played well together at the base of midfield.",
      "Mbeumo will be introduced to the side in the coming days and weeks and it will be interesting to see what that means for Fernandes.",
      "The Portugal international has always offered versatility in where he is used in midfield and it is hard to imagine United won't team up Mbeumo and Cunha, who scored 37 goals between them last term, in the more advanced midfield roles.",
      "But Fernandes sent a timely reminder of what he can do there and with Mason Mount and Amad also options that can be used in those roles, Amorim suddenly has a number of options at his disposal.",
      "If the deeper Fernandes experiment doesn't work, Amorim won't hesitate to change his plan.",

      "Looked comfortable back in midfield alongside Manuel Ugarte and was quietly effective during his 65 minutes. 7",

      "It was easy to miss but Ruben Amorim might have just aimed a subtle dig at Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Amorim was asked about his new signings, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, while out on the tour of the US, and said: “They are really humble. They know how to fit into a group, they don’t act like stars.",
      "\"They also understand that this is not the moment to want to be a star. They are team players at the same time. But it's not just what they give to the team, it's the way they make the feel with their teammates, so they are improving this team in every aspect.\"",
      "Amorim produced that answer during an interview with MUTV ahead of Manchester United's game against West Ham in New Jersey. The clip has gained some traction, but a lot of supporters won't have seen it.",
      "United's head coach is a good communicator. His comments could be taken at face value, but it felt like he was sending a message to the players who have crossed him at Old Trafford.",

      "Amorim outlined his vision for the dressing room when he appeared to have a dig at Rashford and Garnacho during his interview in the States. The United head coach wants elite players and stars in the dressing room - just not at the expense of the team.",
      "Building a healthy culture is crucial to building a successful team and Amorim wants the right personalities in his dressing room, which is why Rashford and Garnacho have been kicked out.",
      "Erik ten Hag improved standards during his two-and-a-half-year reign and took on Cristiano Ronaldo. Amorim isn't stupid and has quickly decided Rashford and Garnacho cannot be part of his squad.",
      "Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Amorim suggested he would be open to reintegrating members of the 'bomb squad', but that felt like a deliberate ploy to protect players' value.",
      "Amorim has moved on with the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo. The 40-year-old is delighted with United's new additions because they are brilliant players with the character needed to thrive at Old Trafford.",
      "United don't have room in their squad for players who criticise the manager's section calls or walk straight down the tunnel after being substituted.",

      "The 28-year-old was one of the best strikers in the Premier League last term, scoring 14 league goals, two of which were scored against United at Old Trafford.",
      "The Frenchman has made solid progress since joining Palace from German club Mainz, initially on loan, four-and-a-half years ago, scoring 46 goals in 152 games. However, he required time to adapt, so much so it was not until the 2023/24 campaign that he started to consistently show his class.",
      "Scoring 19 times in 2023/24, Mateta has scored 36 goals in the last two seasons for Palace. Of those 36 goals, 30 were plundered in the Premier League, meaning he has an established record in England's top flight.",
      "Mateta ticks plenty of boxes. He is a defender's worst nightmare, both with the ball at his feet and in the air.",
      "After Palace triggered the 12-month option in his contract last December to extend his stay at Selhurst Park until June 2027, they have ensured they have protected his value. His deal was originally due to expire next June.",
      "Despite that, Palace may be mindful that this summer could represent their last chance to get the best possible price for their chief goal-getter.",
      "If they fail to tie him down to a new deal within the next 12 months, clubs will try and land him for a cut-price fee next summer amid the fact he will have just one year left on his contract.",
      "Palace will be accounting for plenty of factors this summer, and keeping Mateta will be a priority for them. He is their main striker and losing him would be a massive blow.",
      "But as United have demonstrated with the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo, they still have plenty of pulling power. Palace's demotion to the Europa Conference League from the Europa League could also play into United's hands.",
      "There is no denying Mateta will cost a hefty fee this summer, but Palace might be prepared to negotiate amid the possibility their grip on his future this time next year could be weaker.",

      "Man Utd have decided to narrow down their striker search to just two names as they look to provide Ruben Amorim with added firepower, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils have so far brought in Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively as their two big signings, while Paraguayan youngster Diego Leon has also joined from Cerro Porteno.",
      "It has been claimed that Man Utd still want three new signings this summer with a striker, a defensive midfielder and a goalkeeper taking priority.",
      "Only four Premier League clubs scored fewer goals than Man Utd last season as Amorim’s outfit had a campaign to forget, finishing 15th in the table.",

      "However, The Athletic‘s Laurie Whitwell has revealed that Man Utd have now whittled their striker hit list down to just two names this summer.",
      "Whitwell wrote: ‘Manchester United have narrowed their striker search down to two names — Ollie Watkins and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "‘They had been exploring a deal for Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson, but have ruled out a move due to the cost. United had held back from Sesko due to the finances required, but talks have now taken place to establish some details around a potential move. The same has occurred for a Watkins deal.’",
      "After seeing a loan bid rejected by Aston Villa, The Athletic adds that Man Utd are ‘effectively ruling out a move’ for Emiliano Martinez as ‘he can only leave on a permanent deal’ with ‘no sign Andre Onana will go’.",
      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham reckons it’s for the best if Onana leaves Old Trafford this summer after his performances received criticism las term.",
      "Sheringham told Sky Bet: “When you talk about goalkeepers, it’s a specialised position and there’s a lot of pressure there. There’s talk about Andre Onana leaving, and I think it’s best if he does.",
      "“He’s made a lot of mistakes – yes, he’s made some outstanding and unorthodox saves, but when you make so many mistakes and a lot of goals seem to be down to you, it’s best that the pressure is relieved, not only on Manchester United but on him as well.",
      "“He needs to have a different start somewhere else, because he’s obviously a decent goalkeeper.”",
      "Sheringham insists that Man Utd must sell players, whatever the cost this summer, he added: “It’s very easy to spend money on players, but it’s hard to recoup it. It seems quiet, but I bet there’s lots going on behind the scenes at Manchester United. Other clubs know United’s position.",
      "“They’ve made it known that they’re looking to sell around five players, which signals to other clubs to make them ridiculous offers. I would assume that’s what football clubs are doing around Europe, and Manchester United are turning them down at the moment.",
      "“The longer that goes on, I reckon those offers might be a little less ridiculous, but United want these players off the books – they’ve made their bed, and they’ve got to lie in it. They’ll probably take anything from a quarter to a fifth of their asking price for some of them.”",

      "While Manchester United scour Europe for someone, anyone willing to pay anything for their unwanted cast of very talented footballers they’ve decided they have no use for, other Premier League teams have shown themselves to be adept at selling players to balance their books and boost their summer spending sprees, with Chelsea proving to be the masters.",
      "The Blues have four player sales in this top 10, which includes transfers which have been agreed but not yet signed and sealed.",
      "",
      "10) Bashir Humphreys: Chelsea to Burnley, £10m\nThat’s £10m of pure profit for a left-back with a market value of £6m, who made two appearances for Chelsea and was never going to make another one.",
      "The cash has been immediately spent on teenage centre-back Mamadou Sarr, who started 27 games to help Strasbourg into the Conference League last season. As becomes clearer as you go down this page, Chelsea remain experts in filling their coffers.",
      "",
      "9) Djordje Petrovic: Chelsea to Bournemouth, £22m rising to £25m\nWe’re entirely ready to accept that Chelsea may have sold their best goalkeeper. That may be Petrovic, it may be Kepa Arrizabalaga. But for us they’re all equally sh*t, average and alright, depending on what mood we’re in, so they may as well make a £10m PSR-boosting profit on Petrovic and have Robert Sanchez feebly tending goal again with the identically inadequate Filip Jorgensen in reserve if they’re really actually not going to sign a decent option to match the progression of the rest of the squad.",
      "",
      "8) Lloyd Kelly: Newcastle to Juventus, £14.5m rising to £20m\nWe’re pleased for Kelly, who probably thought – as we did – that he would play more for Newcastle having made what looked like a decent move for both player and club last summer.",
      "But after starting three of the opening five games following his free transfer, Kelly featured for just 96 minutes in the next 19 games before sealing a loan exit to Juventus.",
      "And the key part he played for the Old Lady – nailing down a spot at the heart of their defence – suggests Newcastle may come to regret the obligation to buy that was enforced when a limited appearance-based condition was met. But without knowing the heights Kelly will reach in Serie A and beyond, Newcastle will currently be seeing this as a huge PSR win.",
      "",
      "7) Yan Couto: Manchester City to Borussia Dortmund, £21m rising to £25m\nCouto joins a list of 12 players, including Pedro Porro, Aaron Mooy, Jason Denayer, Jack Harrison and Douglas Luiz, that City have sold for a combined £113m having never made an appearance for club. Incredible.",
      "Maximo Peronne was also sold this summer, to Como for £11.2m, having featured for just 20 minutes in a City shirt.",
      "",
      "6) Anthony Elanga: Nottingham Forest to Newcastle, £52m rising to £55m\nNo other team in world football is paying that fee for Elanga. That definitely doesn’t mean it was wrong for Newcastle to pay it, before all of this Alexander Isak heartache it was the one area of the pitch where there was the biggest potential for improvement and he’s a very Eddie Howe player – direct, powerful and speedy.",
      "But Forest must have been a tad surprised when Newcastle returned with an extra £10m after seeing their initial £45m bid knocked back for the Swede. He’s valued at £36m and cost them under £20m.",
      "A penny for the thoughts of the Manchester United chief who opened the door to that sale to Forest in the summer of 2023 due to ‘reservations over Elanga’s ability to break down stubborn defences in a United team that had expectations to dominate possession during games’ before sacking that manager and hiring one whose modus operandi is dynamism in transition.",
      "Now we think about it, United are the second team in world football who would have paid that fee for Elanga had that move not required a hilarious and embarrassing climbdown.",
      "",
      "5) Bryan Mbeumo: Brentford to Manchester United, £65m rising to £71m\nThere was a time when mid-table Premier League sides were bullied into letting their prized assets leave for Manchester United. As soon as they came calling, that was that, with a club the size of Brentford expected to kiss rings and bow in appreciation of the Red Devils bestowing such honour on them by being interested in one of their players.",
      "Not for the first time, nor we suspect the last, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Ineos lads played their hand way too early. Brentford weren’t happy that they approached Mbeumo first, and when the forward then made it clear he only wanted the move to Old Trafford despite interest from Tottenham and Newcastle, the Red Devils created a situation for themselves where they either had to meet Brentford’s demand – which didn’t change despite contrary reports pushed by United – or flounce away from their top target to the great enjoyment of the masses who feed on evidence that a once-great club is great no longer.",
      "They opted save face and were indeed ‘held to ransom’ despite Ratcliffe’s insistence that he wouldn’t be, paying some £18m over Mbeumo’s market value.",
      "",
      "4) Noni Madueke: Chelsea to Arsenal, £48.5m rising to £50m\nIn our latest instalment of Both Things Can Be True, we see this as a good signing from Arsenal but also a very good sale by Chelsea. The Gunners wanted an option for both left and right wings, whose first thought is to take defenders on, at a good age with a high ceiling; Madueke is all those things.",
      "And while the logic in coaching a player, watching them improve and then selling them before seeing whether they can fulfil their potential in favour of someone at the onset of what will likely be a very similar journey in Jamie Gittens is at best questionable and at worst a sign that Chelsea as a football club aren’t actually all that interested in developing young talent but buying and selling them until they uncover ready-made gems, on the face of it they have made close to £20m on a forward who got 20 goals and nine assists in 92 appearances for them.",
      "",
      "3) Luis Diaz: Liverpool to Bayern Munich, £65.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox should take note. Weirdly, the best way to get the most amount of money for a footballer who wants to leave and you don’t particularly want at your football club for at least that reason and possibly others, isn’t to drop them to a bomb squad and announce to the world that you’re desperate to be rid of them.",
      "The party line from Liverpool and Arne Slot for the majority of this transfer window, amid interest from Barcelona, Saudi Arabia and Bayen, was that they had ‘no plans’ to sell Diaz.",
      "They also had no plan to offer him an improved contract, and will therefore have known that Diaz would likely push for an exit. But he went on tour with Slot and his teammates, at least providing interested clubs with the illusion of a possible harmonious future at the club if they fail to up the ante.",
      "And Bayern did. After the Premier League champions rejected an opening bid of £58.6m from the Bundesliga giants, they’ve now accepted a £65.5m bid including add-ons, or 44% of an Alexander Isak, for a 28-year-old valued by Transfermarkt at £60m.",
      "",
      "2) Jarell Quansah: Liverpool to Bayer Leverkusen, £30m rising to £35m\nWe have no way of finding this out/didn’t even try, but we posit that there has never been a greater transfer-fee-per-senior-start paid (yes, it’s a thing if we say so) than the £875,000 Bayer Leverkusen have spent on Quansah per appearance from the off under Jurgen Klopp and Arne Slot at Anfield.",
      "Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are admittedly a very good reason why Quansah’s not played all that much and it’s technically possible for the game time of the third best centre-back in the world to be limited in a similar manner.",
      "But he wouldn’t be in many people’s top 50 as things stand and that was just too delicious a chunk of pure profit to turn down, with the Reds also safe in the knowledge that they can buy him back for £50m should his progression be as impressive as many of us thought it may be a year or so ago.",
      "",
      "1) Joao Felix: Chelsea to Al Nassr, £26m rising to £44m\nThe guaranteed £26m fee brings the total spent by clubs acquiring what we don’t think anyone will disagree are Felix’s limited services to just over £180m.",
      "After bizarrely spending £44m to sign him from Atletico Madrid last summer after a hugely underwhelming loan spell at Stamford Bridge the season before, Chelsea are miraculously set to make all of that money back thanks to Al Nassr, and could actually be up on the deal having already banked close to £5m from his six-month loan spell at AC Milan.",
      "The Blues are also said to have wisely inserted a hefty sell-on clause into the deal with Al Nassr, as another wealthy football club thinking they can ‘fix’ Joao Felix is the third certainty after death and taxes.",
      "Chelsea forward Joao Felix is set to accept a ‘pay cut’ in order to seal a ‘dream transfer’ this summer, according to reports.",
      "A list of 14 players could reportedly be made available by Chelsea this summer, with some big names expected to be surplus to requirements.",
      "Leeds United will stay in the Premier League if they sign a ‘new Raphinha’. Simple enough, right? We’ve created a ten-player shortlist for Daniel Farke.",
      "Former AC Milan and Chelsea great Marcel Desailly has seen plenty of Joao Felix over his itinerant career and feels he just still hasn’t ‘found his place’",
      "A new report has revealed ‘eleven’ Chelsea players are set to be sold this summer as club chiefs are looking to raise funds for a ‘super signing’."

      "The mere thought of a Sean Longstaff-Scott McTominay central midfield was enough to drive supporters to the point of impotent fury in 2019; by 2025 the former is the secret to survival for Leeds and the latter is Naples royalty.",

      "Benjamin Sesko is ‘impressed’ by Manchester United’s ‘efforts’ to sign him ahead of Newcastle this summer as RB Leipzig’s asking price has been revealed.",
      "Sesko is open to leaving the Bundesliga side this summer after they failed to qualify for the Champions League and after Arsenal plumped for Viktor Gyokeres despite interest in the Slovenian, Newcastle and Manchester United are now vying for his signature.",
      "United want a new striker after both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee failed to impress last season, while the Magpies are looking for a replacement for Liverpool-bound Alexander Isak after the Sweden international dropped his bombshell desire to leave the club on Thursday.",
      "After reporting that Newcastle had ‘opened’ talks with RB Leipzig over a deal for Sesko last week, journalist Nicola Schira claimed on Sunday evening that the Magpies have ‘an agreement in principle’ with the Slovenia striker.",
      "Schira wrote on X: ‘Benjamin Sesko has an agreement in principle with Newcastle for a contract until 2030. NUFC are now working to reach a deal with Leipzig.’",
      "But German journalist Guido Schafer insists that Sesko has given his preference to join United over Newcastle this summer, and Romano said on his YouTube channel on Monday that the Red Devils are ‘starting to move’ for the striker, with ‘concrete conversations’ being held over his transfer.",
      "He said: “For Sesko, Newcastle are ready to make something big but don’t forget also Man United. Man United have been discussing internally for days about strikers – Ollie Watkins but Aston Villa insist on keeping the player…Sesko but obviously financially it is not an easy deal.",
      "“But Man United also in the recent hours on Sunday night, on Monday morning made new contacts with Sesko’s camp. Not directly with the player, but with agents of the player to start conversations about eventual numbers, the contract, the project, the vision.",
      "“So Man United are starting to move, Newcastle have already presented their project and are prepared to match the financial request. So Newcastle are ready to make a very important proposal to Sesko and Leipzig. Man United have started the concrete conversation while they discussed his name internally for weeks.”",
      "And now Sky Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg claims Sesko is ‘impressed by Man United’s efforts to sign him’.",
      "He wrote on X: ‘Manchester United are not giving up on Benjamin #Sesko. As revealed today, #MUFC have presented the player with clear figures and their project. Sesko is impressed by Man United’s efforts to sign him.",
      "‘However: Newcastle are fully in the race and not backing down. An offer is ready to be submitted at any time. Leipzig are now demanding at least €80 million.’",
      "United boss Amorim insists any player who joins the club this summer will need to be fully invested in his project.",
      "He told the club’s media channels: “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already. Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it’s an important time in our club.”",
      "Man Utd have decided to narrow down their striker search to just two names as they look to provide Ruben Amorim with added firepower, according to reports.",
      "A diabolical transfer window for Newcastle will get worse when they miss out on Benjamin Sesko and Yoane Wissa before signing a Liverpool player for £50m.",
      "Man Utd have now made a ‘concrete’ ‘move’ to beat Newcastle to Sesko, according to Fabrizio Romano, with an ‘agreement in principle’ struck for the RB Leipzig striker.",
      "Man Utd face a potential knockout blow in the race to sign Benjamin Sesko as Newcastle are the ‘most serious’ contenders, according to reports.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has decided between a move to Man Utd or Newcastle as an ‘agreement in principle’ has been reached, according to reports.",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Raheem Sterling – Chelsea to Napoli\nChelsea have been very clear that Sterling has no future at Stamford Bridge, so Napoli’s interest should excite the winger if it is true that he would prefer to swerve Saudi or MLS for now to remain in Europe. The Serie A champions remain intent on signing Dan Ndoye from Bologna but if Forest win that race then Antonio Conte is quite willing to sanction a move for Sterling. Jack Grealish is also a possibility for Napoli.",
      "MORE ON THE SUMMER 2025 TRANSFER WINDOW\n👉 Every Premier League transfer and release confirmed in the summer of 2025\n👉 Twenty biggest transfers in the world in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "",
      "19) Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nNo sooner had we reports of renewed interest from United in Watkins did we have the rebuttal from Villa. The England striker is considered by the Villans as ‘not for sale’. Which is what anyone looking to sell for top dollar would say at first. Watkins is valued at £60million by Villa. United would doubtless seek to negotiate down from there but we’re struggling to see where the two clubs find common ground here if this was a deal done in isolation.",
      "",
      "18) 🔽 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nNewcastle are having a ‘mare of a summer, but some rare good news came in the form of Wissa’s desire to move to St James’ Park. However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike.",
      "",
      "17) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa\nGarnacho wants to stay in the Premier League and play in the Champions League, reaffirming somewhat that the winger has a higher opinion of himself than most others do. Chelsea and Spurs have been linked but it has always been tentative. The noise has been building around Villa’s interest in Garnacho, but like United’s view on Watkins, they can’t pay the amount requested. With all the accounting sorcery prompted by PSR, we’re sure there’s a workaround here that leaves everyone happy.",
      "",
      "16) 🆕 Nicolas Jackson – Chelsea to Newcastle\nThe unfortunate Wissa news means Newcastle are now looking at Chelsea striker Jackson, who can leave this summer after the additions of Joao Pedro and Liam Delap. The Toon Army won’t be thrilled, but 24 goals and 10 assists in 65 Premier League matches isn’t *that* bad. Nothing on Isak, mind…",
      "",
      "",
      "14) Joao Palhinha – Bayern Munich to Tottenham\nSpurs are looking for a new no.6 and while Conor Gallagher has been mentioned, there is greater clamour around Palhinha, who has been told he can leave Bayern after one season. Bayern want £30million; Spurs are chasing a discount. If they get one, and Palhinha still has some of the Fulham magic left, it would be a snip.",
      "",
      "13) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "12) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nIt was reported ages ago that agreements had been reached between the clubs and the player, but still we wait. The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "11) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Newcastle\nIf Newcastle get a massive fee for Isak, you can bet any discount Leipzig were offering on Sesko will be voided. Let’s say the Toon get £120million for Isak and they spend £75million on Sesko and cover the Anthony Elanga fee. Is that so terrible? Regardless, Newcastle’s interest in Sesko goes back a year and some reports suggest personal terms are already sorted.",
      "",
      "10) 🆕 Sam Johnstone – Wolves to Burnley\nWith James Trafford returning to Manchester City, Burnley are in the market for a keeper despite already having signed one. It seems they want to take Johnstone from Wolves’ bench to compete for their no.1 spot, and Wolves are quite happy to facilitate either a loan switch or a permanent deal for around £8million.",
      "",
      "9) 🔼 Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments…",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But first they need to raise some cash and even then, they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the Arsenal target.",
      "",
      "7)🔼Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nNewcastle are trying to fight what feels like the inevitable and we should see something in the way of an offer from Liverpool this week. We can be almost certain the first bid will fail, but when the player is as keen to move as Isak reportedly is, the Toon are fighting the tide. The Swede just needs to hope that Liverpool’s desire matches his own.",
      "6) Aaron Ramsdale – Southampton to Newcastle\nNewcastle faffed about all summer before eventually being elbowed out of the James Trafford race by Manchester City. So having missed out on one England keeper to replace their England keeper, they want a different England keeper, who is waiting for a Premier League club to spare him once again from playing in the Championship.",
      "",
      "5)🔼 Jorrel Hato – Ajax to Chelsea\nThis one is edging towards completion, with personal terms agreed and the two clubs close to a compromise that will see Chelsea pay over £35million for the teenager. Liverpool and Arsenal were both keen, and Real Madrid were also linked, but Chelsea have been more decisive than any of them.",
      "",
      "4) 🆕 Granit Xhaka – Bayer Leverkusen to Sunderland\nThis looked ot be off when Erik ten Hag said he could not afford to lose any more players this summer. But someone at Leverkusen has overruled the new coach by agreeing a £13million deal with Sunderland, who could pay another £4million in add-ons. Xhaka, who stated early his preference for Sunderland over Saudi, has been given permission to head to Wearside for a medical.",
      "",
      "3) 🔼 Joao Felix – Chelsea to Saudi\nChelsea, owned by Clearlake Capital with whom PIF have billions invested, are selling a player we’d almost all forgotten still plays for them to Al-Nassr for around £44million. That’s convenient for everyone, isn’t it? Unsurprisingly, this is going through quickly, with Felix already in Saudi.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Bayern Munich\nThe Colombian is spending most of his Monday in transit between Asia and Bavaria where he will undergo a medical after a fee of £65million was agreed. There’s half the Isak money…",
      "",
      "1) 🔼James Trafford – Burnley to Manchester City\nPoor Newcastle. They are having a shocker, and City haven’t helped. Newcastle took forever to finally agree a deal with Burnley for the England goalkeeper, only for City to exercise their option to match any offer. Trafford will re-join City for £27million to compete with Ederson. Who, no doubt, is delighted at the prospect. A medical is due to begin on Monday.",

      "Adding to his statement on social media, Aouna wrote in Foot Mercato: “Newcastle have been the big losers of the English summer transfer window so far. While there was the signing of Anthony Elanga from Nottingham Forest, the Magpies failed to secure Ekitike, who were overtaken by Liverpool , who are now targeting their own striker Alexander Isak. They also saw Manchester City overtake them on goalkeeper James Trafford.",
      "“Two blows that Newcastle will try to forget by sending a big offer to RB Leipzig for Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian striker is patiently waiting for his turn in this transfer window, after seeing Gyokeres, Osimhen, Ekitike, and others change clubs. The opening could come from Newcastle, who are planning to make an initial offer of around €73 million to snatch him from RB Leipzig. The German club knows they will be attacked for their player before the end of the transfer window.”",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a ‘transfer decision’ on signing Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson with two reasons given for their verdict.",
      "The Red Devils are crying out for a new striker after Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee only scored seven Premier League goals combined in 2024/25.",
      "However, Man Utd have already missed out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres amid their financial difficulties and failure to qualify for Europe ahead of next season.",
      "These disappointments have forced United to turn to potential alternatives and Jackson has been mentioned as an option. It has been claimed that Chelsea could cash in on the forward, who is likely to be behind Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in the pecking order if he stays at Stamford Bridge.",
      "A report from Football Insider claims Chelsea want as much as £80m for Jackson this summer, with former Premier League chief scout Mick Brown claiming the striker’s “temperament” and United’s ability to get “better players for the money” are the two reasons for INEOS’ ‘transfer decision’ on this potential signing.",

      "“I would be very, very surprised if Man United signed Jackson. There are concerns about his temperament and the mental side of his game, and I don’t think he’s consistent enough on the pitch to overrule those concerns.",
      "“If Chelsea are looking to get rid of him, that tells you whether he’s good enough for United.",
      "“I don’t think he’s the type of striker they need, and they’ll be looking at their other options. Especially when you consider the price it would take to get him out of Chelsea.",
      "“I expect he’s on a long contract there like all of his teammates, so they’re not going to let him go on the cheap, and definitely not to Man United.",
      "“For the money it would take to get him, there are better players they could bring in. He hasn’t done anything at Chelsea that would make him the ideal man for United.”",
      "Former Premier League winger Jermaine Pennant also claims Man Utd should look past Jackson, who would suit a move to Brighton.",
      "“I’m not sure if Nicolas Jackson is the man for a top team as we’ve seen during his time at Chelsea. It’s an interesting one to see where he goes if he leaves the club. He’s in the Darwin Nunez bracket for me – he gets loads of chances, but he isn’t prolific,” Pennant said.",
      "“If I were him, I’d look a little below that level – someone like Brighton. I think that could work because he’d do well there – they should be looking at him.",
      "“Manchester United are linked but I’m not too sure that’s the right move for the club – it could be another Rasmus Hojlund situation. He obviously believes in himself and thinks he should be at a top team, but I can’t see him being the number one for a top six side.”",
      "According to reports, Chelsea have submitted a ‘sensational swap offer’ to Premier League rivals Aston Villa as they eye England star Morgan Rogers.",

      "“We have ridden our luck, but I don’t think we were lucky.”",
      "It’s quite hard, we imagine based on absolutely no personal experience whatsoever, to speak with any great eloquence in the immediate aftermath of achieving something absurdly enormous. But we reckon Leah Williamson has come up with something quite wonderful here after England’s Euro 2025 triumph.",
      "Williamson, who genuinely might already have been the most Spoke Well, I Thought figure in women’s football, repeated the trick later in the same interview with a similar bait-and-switch: “Total disbelief, but at the same time I knew it was going to happen.”",
      "Both those statements appear to contain an unsolvable paradox, yet both in fact contain an essential truth about football, sport and – if you want to be a truly insufferable tagnut of a wanker about it – life itself.",
      "That second quote is really just a variation on the classic ‘name on the cup’ trope. Very obviously, no team’s name is ever on the cup. There is no such thing as destiny. No tournament is pre-ordained. But that doesn’t mean that the feeling of it being so is of no value or consequence.",
      "It can become self-fulfilling. It seems perfectly accurate to say that a huge part of England somehow winning this tournament boils down to England simply believing – knowing, on some level – they would do so. The sheer refusal to accept defeat is a huge part of the reason a team that led for one minute of the 360 minutes of knockout football they played in Switzerland was able to walk away with the prize.",
      "It’s that quote about luck that really grabbed us, though. We’d never really given much thought to the semantic difference between a team having luck and a team riding their luck. But when Williamson said it, we had some kind of eureka moment. Because it’s exactly and entirely correct.",
      "If you’re the sort of person who goes through life without a tinfoil hat on your head, then even giving a moment’s cursory thought to the idea of some teams or some players being intrinsically luckier than others is palpably absurd. It’s just such a childish notion when you think about it at all.",
      "Which is not at all to say luck does not exist, or play a large part in football. Of course it does. But it’s not ever what matters, not really, not by itself. And it’s not really what we’re saying, if we’re all honest with ourselves, when we say a team is ‘lucky’.",
      "Sheer dumb luck is probably more of a factor in sport (and, again, everything else) than any of us would care to admit. But the point isn’t that you had good luck; it’s that you capitalised upon it.",
      "England rode their luck in Switzerland. Again and again. To an almost ludicrous extreme. But what they did with that luck is what counts, what separates them from the rest.",
      "England’s desire, heart, determination, bottle, skill, talent and everything else helped them take the bits of luck that went their way and extract the absolute maximum possible. And like Williamson, we’re not at all prepared to write that off as just an accident. As itself just more good luck.",
      "And once you start down this road, you realise that distinction Williams draws between ‘luck’ and ‘riding your luck’ explains almost everything. There’s hints here of the classic ‘the more I practise, the luckier I get’.",
      "It’s about positioning yourself to be able to capitalise on those moments of fortune that come your way. To be remembered as a lucky side is really just to be remembered as one that made the most of that good fortune.",
      "Who remembers the lucky side that finished third? Absolutely nobody. Nobody is remembering lucky also-rans. Everyone remembers the lucky winners.",
      "When Manchester United were winning every trophy in sight under Sir Alex Ferguson, you’d hear this all the time. Lucky United. Another decision going their way.",
      "But while there may well be plenty of validity in the idea that United and big clubs in general get more decisions, what United under Ferguson were indisputably the best at was making any such good fortune count. Riding that luck.",
      "You see it still, now, with the more out-there of Online Arsenal Fans and their conspiracy-addled nudge-nudge wink-wink asides about the decisions that have gone Manchester City’s way, or Liverpool’s way, or PSG’s way or whatever.",
      "But of course those teams had luck go their way. You know which teams have a bit of luck going their way sometimes? All the teams. Absolutely every one of them. But one fairly obvious difference between the teams that win and the teams that finish second again is that the teams that win have made those moments of good fortune count more often.",
      "We’d suggest that the idea of a team being ‘lucky’ is rarely made in good faith, that whatever – if any – evidence that purports to support the position has been cherrypicked or manipulated. It is, by definition a glib and simplistic narrative designed not just to denigrate the target but to absolve you or your team from responsibility.",
      "It was the referees. It was that ricochet. It was that deflection. It was the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself. It was luck. It was, therefore, Not Our Fault. Being expected to compete against the unfathomable, unknowable will of the universe itself is even more absurd than expecting a team to compete with 115 Charges FC.",
      "But Williamson has got to the heart of it. The lucky teams aren’t the ones that have more luck; they are the ones who make damn sure they make that luck more significant, more memorable. The ones that make it count for something.",
      "Maybe it is better to be lucky than good, but any amount of the former will get you nowhere without a healthy dose of the latter."

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",

      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to Barcelona, describing his new side as \"a club where dreams come true\".",
      "Rashford will wear the No 14 shirt, which has been worn by many Barcelona greats in the past - including Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman, Thierry Henry and Javier Mascherano.",
      "\"I'm very excited,\" Rashford said at his unveiling. \"It's a club where dreams come true. They win big prizes and what the club stands for really means a lot to me.",
      "\"It feels like I'm at home and it's a big factor in my choice to come here.",
      "\"It's a family club and people are comfortable here. It's a good place for good players to showcase their skills.\"",
      "A Barcelona statement said: \"FC Barcelona and Manchester United have reached an agreement for the loan of the player Marcus Rashford until 30 June 2026. The agreement also establishes an option to buy the English forward.",
      "\"The player has signed his contract as a Barça player this afternoon at a private meeting in the presence of the FC Barcelona president, Joan Laporta; the director of the Football Area, and other Board members.\"",
      "Barcelona are expected to cover all of Rashford's wages during the proposed loan, although they are currently unable to register the forward due to LaLiga's financial rules.",
      "The Spanish champions are deemed to have spent more on signings and wages than they made in revenue for the 2024/25 season.",
      "LaLiga's rules dictate that clubs can only spend as much as they generate, so Barcelona will be required to make sales, cut wages or increase their revenue streams to make space for new signings.",
      "The deadline for this issue to be resolved is the end of August. Barcelona are confident of registering Rashford and their other new signings in time for the new season.",
      "Despite their long-standing financial issues, the Catalan club have always eventually been able to register their new signings in time despite these challenges.",
      "England international Rashford had publicly said he would like to play for the Catalans this summer and had been interested in a move to the LaLiga champions in January, before joining Aston Villa on loan.",
      "Rashford's move is understood to have been given the green light by Barca head coach Hansi Flick after he spoke with the player.",
      "It is thought Liverpool forward Luis Diaz was a priority target, but Barcelona's advances were rejected earlier in the window.",
      "The academy graduate is one of five players who have been given extra time off to explore potential moves away this summer.",
      "Rashford's career at Old Trafford has appeared to be over since Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.",
      "However, Rashford declined to criticise Man Utd when it was put to him the Old Trafford club, rather than him, were at fault for causing the situation which has led to his departure.",
      "\"The situation with Man Utd, the club is in a period of change, and they have been for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don't have anything bad to say about Man Utd. It's been an important part of not only my career but my life.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to play for them but football is the same as life, and not everything goes as simple as you may have thought.",
      "\"This is my next step, my next chapter, and I am fully focussed on trying to improve myself and help the team win trophies.",
      "\"I just wish Man Utd the best and hope they are successful in the future.\"",
      "Rashford picked out Barcelona's style of play and the influence of their head coach Hansi Flick as contributing factors to his desire to join the Spanish champions.",
      "\"I always try to make decisive actions and fast dynamic plays, and I always like good football. I've always been a fan of watching Barcelona play from a young age, like most football fans,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a joy for me to play here and I am going to enjoy every minute of it. I'm full of excitement and hunger to go out and try and help this team win.",
      "\"They won so much last year and I can see the ambition of the club is to do better than last year. For a player, that is what you want to hear because it keeps you improving year on year, and that is what you need to be the best version of yourself.",
      "\"\"Hansi Flick is another key factor in the reason I'm here.",
      "\"The conversations I had with him were very positive and what he did last year was a terrific season, but not just last year. In his career he has proved he is one of the top coaches.",
      "\"To lead such a young team to a very successful season and then to come back to pre-season and still want to do more, it shows me everything I thought I knew about the club, but now, to be here, it is everything I wished and thought.",
      "\"I'm eager to get going now and learn the Barcelona way as I go.\"",
      "As we know, Barcelona is more than a club. On his big day at the Nou Camp, Marcus Rashford was more than impressive.",
      "Smiling. Suited and booted, and his answers to dozens of questions were tailor made. Tailor made to look forward, not back.",
      "There were journalists who'd travelled from England to be here, me included. All of them were trying to catch the eye of the Barcelona press officer, but none were allowed a question. The feeling being that local reporters would ask about Barcelona, not Manchester United.",
      "And that's how it turned out.",
      "The club's new No 14 said everything a Barcelona fan would want to hear about the place where 'dreams come true'.",
      "When he was finally asked one solitary question about his parent club, he controlled it beautifully, turned on a sixpence (our euro) and hammered it into the top of the net.",
      "\"I've nothing bad to say,\" he said. 1-0 to the media chiefs.",

      "But the biggest winner in Marcus Rashford's move from Old Trafford to Camp Nou on loan with an option to buy is the player himself. He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",

He swaps a side that finished 15th in the Premier League last term for one which won a domestic double and rank among this season's favourites to win the Champions League.",
      "He gets to play with Lamine Yamal, a wish made public during an interview Spanish influencer Javi Ruiz last month. It seemed he might not get the chance when Barcelona subsequently tried to sign Athletic Club's Nico Williams, then Liverpool's Luis Diaz, but it all came together for him after those moves failed to materialise.",
      "It is not what anyone at Manchester United envisioned back in 2023, when he signed a five-year contract worth £325,000 a week on the back of an outstanding, 30-goal season under Erik ten Hag. The idea was that his boyhood club would enjoy his peak years.",
      "But Rashford's output dropped dramatically in the following campaign and despite early encouragement after Amorim's appointment last year, in the form of three goals in his first three games in charge, he was soon dropped by the new head coach due to disciplinary issues and poor performances in training.",
      "In what might turn out to be his final appearance in a Manchester United shirt, away to Europa League opponents Viktoria Plzen in December of last year, Rashford was hooked after only 56 minutes and booed by some supporters as he made his way off.",
      "A lot may have changed by the time his loan spell ends next summer. It is not inconceivable that a change of manager could reopen the door to him at Old Trafford. But it is nigh-on impossible to see a way back for him under this one. It feels a necessary parting of ways. He needs a fresh start and so does his club.",
      "It is on him now to show Barcelona that he is worth signing permanently. If he can reach the heights of his best seasons, in 2019/20 and 2022/23, it will be an easy decision for them, especially with the purchase clause understood to be set at just £26m. He is still only 27.",
      "His challenge is to finally deliver consistency, on and off the pitch, but his time on loan at Aston Villa in the second half of last season offers encouragement. Rashford appeared rejuvenated under Unai Emery, contributing four goals and five assists in 17 games in all competitions before his campaign was ended by injury.",
      "His performances earned him an England recall from Thomas Tuchel and it was not just in an attacking capacity that he impressed.",
      "Rashford's off-the-ball work was notably improved too. He averaged nearly four times as many tackles per 90 minutes for Aston Villa as in the first half of the campaign for Manchester United.",
      "He showed his versatility too, initially playing on the left flank then usurping Ollie Watkins in the No 9 role. He ended up playing more minutes up front than he did as a winger, producing a standout performance in the role in Villa's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain in April.",
      "Those displays no doubt helped convince Barcelona of his enduring capacity to hurt top opposition. \"We like Rashford,\" confirmed their sporting director Deco a month later.",
      "It will be interesting to see how they use him.",
      "Barcelona will hope he proves useful to them in both roles but having previously tried to sign Williams and Diaz, it seems likely that he is primarily seen as someone to provide competition for Raphinha on the left wing.",
      "It will not be easy to usurp the Brazil international, who ranks as one of Barcelona's most important players. He was named LaLiga player of the year last season and scored 34 goals in 57 games in all competitions.",
      "Rashford might not start every game but Barcelona would not have taken on his huge wages if they did not see him forming a significant part of their plans. At the very least he will add attacking depth and allow head coach Hansi Flick to rotate up front as well as on the left.",
      "Robert Lewandowski continues to defy his years. He produced his highest-scoring season yet for the club last term, with 42 goals. But he turns 37 next month. His minutes will need to be managed. Their new arrival can provide an alternative option in his position.",
      "For Rashford, the challenge is simply to make the most of any opportunities he gets and prove to Barcelona that he is worth extracting from Old Trafford on a permanent basis.",
      "But by moving from an ailing European giant in Manchester United to one in a position of Champions League-level strength in Barcelona, and getting a chance to prove himself again at the very top, he already looks like the biggest winner of the deal.",

      "Words by Zinny BoswellInterview by Dan Khan Imagery by Ben Scott & Leon Yearwood",
      "Ayden Heaven never expected to leave Arsenal, but when it became apparent first-team opportunities were at a minimum, the decision was taken to move on from his boyhood club.",
      "Barcelona, Eintracht Frankfurt and Marseille were queuing up to sign him. For a kid that faced rejection from more than a few academies, the tables had turned.",
      "All it took was one visit to Old Trafford to make up his mind. “It’s United”, he told his mother and agent, Lisa. Barcelona had scheduled a visit the next day, but he was unwavering.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up.",
      "Ayden made his Premier League debut at Old Trafford against Arsenal in March – a month after leaving his former club. “It was surreal,” he says. “I was only with them like five weeks prior, and then to be playing against them on my Premier League debut was crazy.”",
      "It was less than two months earlier that Ayden first experienced the stadium's magic. United approached Arsenal in January about signing the centre-back, with his contract up in six months. Ayden and Lisa were given permission to visit to watch a game and have a tour.",
      "United were handed the perfect sales pitch when captain Bruno Fernandes took the roof off Old Trafford with a stoppage-time winner against Rangers in the Europa League. “It was probably the loudest stadium I’ve been to – and now played in,” says Ayden.",
      "There was no shortage of clubs trying to convince Lisa that Ayden should join them, but the defender was clear on what he wanted after that. “Ayden walked away going, ‘yeah, it's United’,” says Lisa. Acting as both mum and agent, she told him to sleep on it.",
      "“We talked again in the morning because we were invited to Barcelona the next day and he said, ‘nope it's United’,” says Lisa. They had visited Eintracht Frankfurt and there were other big offers on the table, but none of that mattered to Ayden.",
      "“That's why I knew it was the best move for him because he's picked it from the heart and if he's got the heart and the loyalty then that’s what wins the game,” says Lisa.",
      "The ‘Manchester Is My Heaven’ banner at Old Trafford caught his attention for obvious reasons - and it just so happens the story behind those words, attributed to Sir Matt Busby in United folklore, resonates with the emotional impact of Ayden's first visit.",
      "As the tale goes, that's what Sir Matt told Real Madrid president Santiago Bernabeu in the 1950s when he tried to lure United’s manager to Spain. His offer was “a paradise” – and Busby, so the story goes, replied with those now-iconic words.",
      "Ayden and Lisa posed underneath the banner for a picture when he was doing media ahead of the announcement of his signing. Five weeks later he was revving up the Old Trafford crowd not far from that spot on his Premier League debut against his former club Arsenal.",
      "In a further nod to United's storied past, Ayden chose to have the No 26 on the back of his shirt - the same number of years Sir Alex Ferguson spent as manager. Ayden was leaving an established title-challenger in Arsenal for the lure of recreating history at United.",

      "Lisa made the decision to become Ayden's agent when he was 16 because no one else convinced her they could see his potential. She was never in any doubt.",
      "\"This is a business but in order for the business to be successful you have to understand what - [turning to Ayden] I know you're my son - but what your product is,\" she says. \"I didn't feel anybody understood him and believed in him.\"",
      "When it came to agreeing terms with United, Lisa was clear Ayden didn't want to spend more time in the academy. As far as they were concerned, he had outgrown it and that’s why he was leaving Arsenal.",
      "Jason Wilcox, United’s sporting director, agreed the 18-year-old was ready. Lisa and the lawyers she describes as “Ayden’s co-agents”, Andy Squires May and Karim Bouzidi from Clintons law firm, carried out the negotiations. Nine days after his visit, Ayden was announced.",
      "As well as the magic of Old Trafford, it was the opportunities he could see at United that convinced Ayden of the move. “I just saw myself in the squad,” he says, “because there's not much in our way, so I just felt like I could establish myself better than at other clubs.”",
      "Lisandro Martinez was his competition at United for that left-sided centre-back spot in Ruben Amorim’s back three and, in the same game Ayden was introduced to Old Trafford with fellow new-signing Patrick Dorgu, the Argentine suffered a season-ending injury.",
      "This opened the door for Ayden earlier than even he anticipated. “I was really surprised,” he says, when asked about making his Premier League debut against Arsenal.  “I knew when the opportunity came I could take it, and I feel like I've been doing it so far.”",
      "His situation at Arsenal could not have been more different. Already behind Gabriel and Jakub Kiwior in the pecking order at left-centre-back, Riccardo Calafiori was then signed for £42m after Ayden had been given minutes on the club’s US tour in pre-season.",
      "Ayden was in Arsenal’s first-team squad photo in September, but the next few months showed he wasn’t really in the picture. His only appearance was off the bench for the final 10 minutes of a 3-0 win over Preston in the Carabao Cup last-16.",
      "“[Leaving Arsenal] was a bittersweet moment because they had been so good with him,” says Lisa. “I felt like he had a good relationship with Mikel Arteta and the first team. But the pathway wasn’t there for him. He was ready for that next step.”",
      "Being brought on against Arsenal so soon after signing for United was a clear indication that Ayden had made the right move for his career. The response of his former team-mates at the full-time whistle demonstrated that they understood that too.",
      "“They showed [me] a lot of love after the game,” says Ayden, who was inundated with hugs and handshakes from the players he had trained with for the past two years.",
      "Arsenal had offered Ayden a new contract but could see what was unfolding for him. “They agreed Ayden had to move on for his development,” says Lisa. “It was our decision which club we went to, and Ayden made it for everyone.\"",
      "Ayden and Lisa spoke to Amorim on their visit to Old Trafford in January. United's head coach was visibly impressed by the sheer size of Ayden, around 6ft3in, having made no secret of his desire to improve the physicality of the team since being appointed.",
      "It isn't just Ayden's size Amorim likes. The teenager's poise in possession, coupled with his impressive ability as a ball-carrier, make him an ideal fit for the system Amorim wants to play at United.",
      "\"I'd been watching United, I knew Ayden's playing style and I knew what Ruben liked,\" says Lisa, who was encouraged by the way the coach planned to utilise her son. \"Ayden had the same confidence.\"",
      "Amorim wants his back three to contribute to the build-up in ways other coaches rely on their midfielders to do so. Ayden's suitability to the role makes more sense when you learn he used to be a midfielder.",
      "World Cup-winning centre-back Per Mertesacker, recently appointed Arsenal academy manager when Ayden arrived at the club as a left-winger aged 12, was responsible for identifying his best position.",

      "\"He's not a winger, he's a defender,\" Mertesacker would tell Lisa. She disagreed for a while but says the former Arsenal captain was convinced of Ayden being a centre-back as soon as he saw him play.",
      "\"Ayden just kept growing and went to defensive midfield and Per said, 'no, back a bit more'. I remember watching Ayden in defence for the first time and thinking, 'maybe Per knows what he's talking about'. I feel like Per had a huge impact on Ayden's development,\" says Lisa.",
      "Ayden turned to academy football aged six after it became obvious he had outgrown grassroots when Lisa was told during one particular game not to bring him back again.",
      "\"The score was 17-1 and they pulled me to one side,\" says Lisa. \"‘He's ruining the game for everyone, the kids on his team are crying because he's not passing'. He was literally dribbling through everyone and scoring all the goals.\"",

      "Finding a footballing home for a football-obsessed Ayden proved troublesome until Arsenal arrived on the scene.  \"Ayden never had that coach in an academy that [said], ‘this is how we're going to work for him’,\" says Lisa.",
      "\"All he needed was someone to throw a lot of strategic information at him, which he didn't get from a young age. It led to him getting released for not sitting still at the age of six, seven, eight.\"",
      "Arsenal had known about Ayden for a while, but didn't have the space to sign him up until he was 12. When he got to Hale End, everything changed.",
      "\"That was probably the only club that took Ayden for who he was,\" says Lisa. \"[They] worked with him and understood what kind of player he could be.\"",

      "It so nearly panned out differently, though. When Arsenal finally came calling, Lisa was with Ayden in the car park at Tottenham ready to sign for them.",
      "\"I'm looking at Ayden like 'what do you want to do?',\" says Lisa. \"'Do we carry on walking or  do I take this call?'\" As soon as Arsenal heard what was happening, they promised to have Ayden in by the end of the week.",
      "\"We walked straight to the reception area and said 'thank you for this opportunity' but we're going to go and give it a go at Arsenal down the road.\"",
      "Perhaps not the hardest decision for an Arsenal-supporting family, but one of the most crucial on Ayden's journey. Lining up against them on his Premier League debut wasn't in the plan but, without them, he may never have got there.",
      "Ayden Heaven is Next Up."
