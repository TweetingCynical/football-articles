      "Manchester United prospects Chido Obi and Tyler Fredricson look set to be given more first-team opportunities by Ruben Amorim next season after the pair were handed new squad numbers.",
      "Obi, 17, joined United from Arsenal's academy last year and has been a prolific goalscorer at youth level. The striker came off the bench to make his first-team debut against Tottenham in February and went on to make seven further senior appearances.",
      "Obi wore the No. 56 shirt last season, but has been handed the No. 32 ahead of the new campaign which has previously been worn by the likes of Carlos Tevez, Victor Valdes and Sam Johnstone.",
      "Speaking after Obi became the youngest player to start a Premier League game for United, Amorim said: \"It's really important because you can train a lot with the first team but feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think it's the best thing.",
      "\"Again, they did quite well. Chido fought all game but you can feel he's really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body. He's going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these kind of games, this is the best way. So we can take that positive.\"",
      "20-year-old defender Fredricson is an academy graduate and also made his first-team debut last season, starting in league games against Wolves and Brentford towards the end of the campaign.",
      "Fredricson wore the No. 55 shirt last year and has now been given the No. 33, which used to belong to the likes of Brandon Williams, Bebe and Chris Eagles, and Amorim has previously spoken highly of the centre-back.",
      "\"He's really composed, he's really humble,\" Amorim told MUTV ahead of Fredricson's debut. \"Every training with the first team, he's really focused on every detail of training. He's really good on the ball. So it's a good opportunity for him.\"",
      "United have also given new squad numbers to five other players. New signing Matheus Cunha has taken the No. 10, with previous holder Marcus Rashford expected to leave the club this summer.",
      "Diogo Dalot, meanwhile, has swapped the No. 20 for the No. 2 after Victor Lindelof's departure. Teenagers Shea Lacey, Bendito Mantato and Reece Munro have also been given new numbers, taking 61, 70 and 65 respectively.",

      "He spent the second half of last season on loan at Aston Villa and impressed under Unai Emery, but Villa did not take up their option to buy the forward permanently for £40million.",
      "Rashford saw his loan deal end early after picking up a season-ending injury at Villa and since recovering he has been attempting to drum up interest among club around Europe.",
      "United gave him extra time to secure a transfer before returning to training, but is now back at Carrington training away from the first team squad.",
      "And according to Sky in Germany, Barcelona are now going \"all-in\" for Rashford, who has become their \"clear number one target\" after missing out on Diaz.",
      "Barca boss Hansi Flick is on the lookout for a new winger and was left disappointed in his pursuit of Diaz, with Liverpool insisting the £60m-rated star was not for sale. Bayern Munich also had a bid rejected for the 28-year-old this summer.",
      "It comes after Diaz insisted he was \"very, very happy\" at Anfield, having played a key role under Arne Slot in their Premier League title-winning campaign, scoring 13 goals and assisting five.",
      "Now Flick has given the green light to Barcelona pushing for Rashford and the La Liga club will try to make the deal happen.",
      "Barcelona also missed out on Nico Williams after his shock decision to sign a 10-year deal with Athletic Bilbao, while they have also swerved on signing another target in AC Milan's Rafael Leao.",
      "It's understood Rashford is ready to take a huge pay cut on his £325,000-a-week wages in order to seal a move to the Spanish giants to help Barca keep costs down - though the Spanish club are hopeful of doing a loan rather than signing him permanently.",
      "His salary remains a stumbling block in any deal and United could still have to subsidise a portion of his wages to get the deal over the line. The Red Devils have already signed forward Matheus Cunha to push Rashford further down the pecking order, while they are also trying to snap up Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Marcus Rashford's future Manchester United remains unclear and he arrived at training eight minutes after Ruben Amorim departed - but the club claim this is not an unusual situation.",
      "The forward is back at the club for pre-season having spent the second part of the recent campaign at Aston Villa, whom he joined on loan after being frozen out in Manchester. Those at Villa Park opted against triggering their £40million option to buy him permanently.",
      "Rashford arrived at Carrington at 4.47pm on his own on Thursday, eight minutes after his head coach had departed. The MEN claims the 27-year-old has been training in the afternoons on an individual basis this week and his late arrival was just part of his schedule. Rashford arrived through the back gate entrance at Carrington, whilst Amorim used the front gate.",
      "The club have denied that the academy graduate was arriving at the club's training base to discuss his future, which remains unclear as he and Amorim still don't appear to see eye-to-eye after the United boss was a vocal critic of some of Rashford's behaviours when he first arrived.",
      "Rashford scored the first goal of the Amorim era when he notched in a draw Ipswich in late November, but quickly he saw his minutes decline. He was dropped for the Manchester derby at the Etihad and never found a way back.",
      "Amorim later claimed he would rather include one of the United coaches, who is into his 60s, on his bench instead of Rashford. He also criticised the forward's application in training and said they could not align their views on key issues.",
      "He said after sanctioning his loan exit: \"I couldn't get Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it. Sometimes you have one player that is really good with one coach, and the same player with another coach is different.\"",
      "In another telling sign that Rashford will be looking for a new club this summer he has seen his shirt number taken away - and he hasn't been handed a new one - after United decided to give the No10 shirt to new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Rashford last played for United against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League on December 12. It is understood that the player's dream move would be to Barcelona, but so far they've pursued other targets. The likes of Newcastle have been credited with interest, but on loan, whilst the Manchester outfit want an end to the saga and would prefer a permanent exit.",

      "Manchester United icon Nemanja Vidic has confessed he considered signing for arch-rivals Liverpool before his move to Old Trafford. Vidic had impressed at Spartak Moscow and was quickly snapped up by United for £7million in December 2005, officially joining the Red Devils a month later.",
      "The centre-back, who recently expressed his ambition to manage United one day, had been linked with a move to Old Trafford two years earlier. Vidic soon demonstrated why Sir Alex Ferguson had been a long-term admirer, establishing himself as one of the best defenders of the Premier League era.",
      "During his eight-and-a-half-year stint at United, Vidic won 10 major honours, including five Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2008. However, Vidic had also caught the eye of Liverpool and another Premier League club before Ferguson swooped in to secure his services.",
      "\"Yes, we talked [with Liverpool boss Rafa Benítez] maybe once or twice, but nothing happened for two or three weeks,\" Vidic revealed on The Overlap, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"David O'Leary wanted to bring me to Aston Villa too, but they didn't have the money. I had dinner with David O'Leary – he came to Moscow.\"",
      "However, Vidic's decision was straightforward once the United boss got in touch. \"Fergie just called me once and asked if I wanted to play for [Manchester] United, I said yes and that was done in four days,\" he recalled.",
      "Vidic made 15 appearances in the latter half of the 2005/06 season, but it was the subsequent campaign where he and Rio Ferdinand began to forge their iconic partnership, leading United to their first league title in four years. Having missed out on Vidic, Liverpool signed defenders Jan Kromkamp and Daniel Agger in the January window, while Villa struggled to a 16th-place finish.",
      "\"I was happy to go to Aston Villa, but they didn't have money at the time – that's what David O'Leary told me,\" Vidic explained. \"Liverpool were waiting too long, and Sir Alex Ferguson came in quickly and did the deal in four days.\"",
      "Vidic has admitted that the speed of his move to Old Trafford meant he forgot to mention his wage demands, which initially led him to take a pay cut for his big-money move to the Premier League. \"When I met him [Sir Alex Ferguson] was when I signed the contract with him and David Gill,\" Vidic admitted. \"The mistake I made at the time was that I said I wanted to play for United but I didn't say for how much money!",
      "\"For me at the time, it wasn't about the money – I wanted to test myself. If I wanted more money, it would've been better for me to stay in Moscow.",
      "\"I had double the money in Moscow than I did in Manchester when I came. Obviously, Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill told me don't worry and that, this contract is just the beginning, and then if I played 50 games – it doesn't matter if it's 5 or 10 minutes – we'll change the contract. After 20-25 games, I signed a new contract.\"",
      "Ferguson improved United's defence through Vidic's arrival, marking another pivotal piece in his plan to overthrow Jose Mourinho's dominant Chelsea side. With Edwin van der Sar and Park Ji-sung signing months earlier and soon joined by Patrice Evra, Vidic would go on to form the backbone of United's success.",
      "Having been part of a successful United side, Vidic recently took aim at the club's failures in the post-Ferguson era. The 43-year-old blamed the huge wages paid to players and the lack of football expertise within the club's hierarchy during Ed Woodward's time as chief executive.",
      "Vidic was given the armband in 2010, lifting two league titles as captain. Upon signing Vidic, Ferguson declared: \"Good defenders win you things. This lad is really natural and athletic. You need good defenders and that is exactly what this lad is.\"",

      "There are murmurs that Brentford may have underestimated Mbeumo's worth, particularly after Forest accepted a whopping £55m bid for Anthony Elanga and with Chelsea's Noni Madueke set to join Arsenal for more than £50m.",

      "For a while, it was an open secret but during the last international break, Thomas Tuchel confirmed one of the main reasons why Jordan Henderson is a key member of his England squad. Tuchel is satisfied 35-year-old Henderson can still do a job on the pitch at elite level but, just as importantly, he believes the former Liverpool captain is a leader off the field.",
      "“He is a very important addition to this group,” Tuchel said. “Especially when we talk about setting standards and keeping the group up to standards.”",
      "Those remarks came after a painful 1-0 win over mighty Andorra and a 3-1 loss to Senegal, so judgement on how Tuchel’s reasoning is working out should be put on hold. But Tuchel is not the only manager to value Henderson’s attitude to dressing-room culture.",

His time at Ajax has not been without controversy - there was a tale about him wanting to walk out for a move to Monaco, which he denied - but he has played to a decent level, appearing 57 times and captaining the club.",
      "And while Tuchel has been pilloried by many - including myself - for starting Henderson in some of his line-ups, you have to be fair and say the veteran has done okay in his international second coming. But does 35 count as 'veteran'? Not in modern football. You all know the examples - no need to list them.",

      "Manchester United have completed their third signing of the summer transfer window - but it is not Bryan Mbeumo. The club remain in talks to sign the Brentford star, but discussions are continuing after two bids were rejected.",
      "However, United did announced a signing on Thursday. France youth international Enzo Kana-Biyik has signed with the club, following in the footsteps of Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "But there is still an awful lot of work to do for United, who are keen to overhaul Ruben Amorim's squad entirely following a miserable 2024/25 campaign which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "They are still trying to sell Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho in deals which will bolster their budget for new signings. There are now just five weeks until the start of United's Premier League season, on August 17, meaning the clock is ticking. Here are the latest headlines involving the club.",
      "United have signed Kana-Biyik and immediately sent him out on loan. The 18-year-old forward is considered one for the future after scoring nine goals in 18 games for Le Havre's under-19s team last season.",
      "He will play his 2025/26 season in Switzerland, with United confirming in a statement: \"Following the signing of his contract, the emerging talent has secured a loan switch to Swiss Super League side, Lausanne-Sport.",
      "\"Everyone at United would like to welcome Enzo to the club and wish him the very best of luck for his loan.\"",
      "United have seen two bids knocked back by Brentford for Mbeumo and talks are still going on. The Bees rejected United's initial offer of £55m, then knocked back a second bid worth £62.5m. They reportedly believe their valuation of the Cameroon international is more than fair, given the £55m Newcastle are paying Nottingham Forest for Anthony Elanga.",
      "Mbeumo is set on a move to Old Trafford, but the transfer fee remains the sticking point. United may want to get a move on, with Tottenham's planned move for Yoane Wissa potentially affecting things.",
      "Like Mbeumo, Wissa had an outstanding campaign in 2024/25 and Brentford may be reluctant to let both of them leave in the same window, especially after they lost manager Thomas Frank to Spurs. \"I think Man United have to get this done. I think it's been in the news for far too long to get to a situation where you get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen,\" Rio Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "\"I think that would be a custard, egg on your face situation for Man United, unless they go and get someone else, another striker. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative?\"",
      "United are locked in talks with Napoli over the potential departure of Garnacho. Napoli failed with a £60m bid for Garnacho in January, but are still keen on the Argentina international winger.",
      "The Serie A champions want to pay £45m for Garnacho this time, but United value him higher. The question will be how long United are willing to drag out negotiations, given they want his future sorted and want the money to reinvest in the transfer market.",
      "Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis reckons Garnacho will become an even better player once he leaves United. \"Garnacho's got pace, flair and potential,\" he said. \"But that's not even why we want him. We want him because he's at United. Get him out and he becomes twice the player. There's a fault at United that I can't explain.\"",

      "But there are some doubts. Tottenham were linked with a move, only for Mbeumo to prioritise a move to Old Trafford.",
      "And now, transfers elsewhere could see United’s chances of signing Mbeumo over the coming weeks dwindle. Nottingham Forest are attempting to sign his teammate Yoanne Wissa this summer having seen their previous attempts fail, with The Athletic revealing that they have lodged a fresh bid for his services.",
      "Forest are pursuing him as a replacement for Anthony Elanga, who is expected to complete a move to Newcastle over the coming days. Should Wissa move to the City Ground, that could see Brentford sharply increase their demands for teammate Mbeumo.",
      "And that could trigger United into ramping up their negotiations in order to get a deal over the line before that. Speaking recently, Brentford director of football Phil Giles denied that a deal was close to being done.",
      "“Let’s see on that. I think our position is that he had an unbelievable season last season, we expected interest in him. If that deal’s right, there’s a deal to do, if not then he stays.",
      "“We’ve spoken to Bryan and his representatives. It’s not a given that he’s going to depart this summer. There is interest.",
      "“He had a great season last season so it’s inevitable there’s going to be interest in him. If we get the right offer, there’s potentially a deal to be done but there’s only so much we can say on that.”",

      "Manchester United have discovered what it'll take to finally sign Jarrad Branthwaite. Branthwaite, 23, was the subject of two bids from United in 2024, with the Red Devils' second offer worth a total of £50million.",
      "Everton rejected both proposals, valuing the defender much higher. After helping the Toffees soar away from the relegation scrap and cement their Premier League status last season, Branthwaite has signed a new five-year contract, putting him among the Merseyside club's highest earners.",
      "The deal keeps him at Everton's new stadium on Bramley-Moore Dock until 2030. But they'll be powerless to stop Branthwaite from leaving if a club actives his release clause and agrees personal terms - as United reportedly did a year ago before they turned to Leny Yoro.",
      "According to the Mail, his new contract includes an exit clause worth more than £70m which becomes active next summer. Branthwaite is happy working under Toffees manager David Moyes but has ambitions of playing Champions League football and breaking into the England squad.",
      "The 23-year-old made his senior debut for the Three Lions in June of last year before missing out on Gareth Southgate's squad for the European Championship. Branthwaite is yet to receive a call-up since Thomas Tuchel was appointed.",
      "But the centre-back's stock has remained high, with Tottenham said to have considered making an approach earlier this summer. The former Carlisle United prospect was also linked with a sensational move to Real Madrid during ex-Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti's tenure which ended in May.",
      "For now, though, Branthwiate is firmly focussed on helping the Toffees get off to a successful start in their new home after leaving Goodison Park. \"I'm over the moon. It's been something we've been talking about since the end of the season and to get it signed now is something I'm really excited about,\" he told club media.",
      "Will Jarrad Branthwaite be worth more than £70m next summer? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"The trust the club's put in me and how many games I've played over the past two seasons has made it quite an easy decision for me to stay and to keep progressing as a player. I know the club. I feel loved by the players - we've got a good group here - and the fans.",
      "\"Over the past few years, I've seen the impact the fans have on us as a team and how much it means to them. And, obviously, with the new stadium we've got here, the new ownership and the new manager, it's an exciting project and it's something I want to be part of.",
      "\"Moving to the new stadium together and having that first game at home is something we're all looking forward to. We want to go again and push for a good season.\""

      "Frank was interested in bringing Mbeumo to North London too, but the Cameroonian has his heart set on a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "However, United have been frustrated in talks with Brentford after seeing two bids rejected for the forward - the latest being around £62.5million. Spurs have since focused their attentions on Wissa, who scored 19 goals in the Premier League last season - one less than Brentford team-mate Mbeumo.",
      "And if they can move quickly and land a move for the dangerous striker, it could well derail United's hopes of taking Mbeumo - with the Bees loathe to lose both players at the same time.",
      "Spurs, back in the Champions League next term, will have to stump up at least £50m to recruit the 28-year-old however, according to the Evening Standard.",
      "Tottenham have already agreed a £55m fee with West Ham for Mohammed Kudus but Frank still wants more quality in his attack after watching Spurs finish 17th last season.",
      "Whether £50m for Wissa would be good value for money given that he turns 29 in September, is another question however. Daniel Levy and his hierarchy have long turned away from deals for players of that age due to a lack of resale value.",
      "Joining Spurs would appeal to Wissa offering him a taste of European football in its biggest competition. Brentford have fended off interest in him before, with Nottingham Forest already having a £22m bid rejected for him in January.",
      "United will hope Wissa stays put to ensure they stay on track to sign Mbeumo.",
      "Manager Ruben Amorim is desperate to overhaul his struggling attack and has already signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a bid to aid the problem - with the £62.5m fee paid for the Brazil international increasingly being used by Brentford as a marker for the price tag they've slapped on Mbeumo's head.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Some members of Manchester United's first-team squad started to return to the club's training base on Monday before those who were on international duty at the end of last season reported back on Thursday.",
      "Accounting for all the images and training ground footage shared by United throughout the week, 31 players have been spotted participating in training at various stages.",
      "After doing fitness and conditioning testing in the gym, head coach Ruben Amorim is now overseeing matters out on the grass. United's opening friendly is against Leeds United in Stockholm on July 19 and he will be keen to see his side hit the ground running.",
      "Pre-season is the ideal time for head coaches to get their ideas across, implement their plans and edge closer towards working out a first-choice starting XI ahead of the competitive action beginning in August.",
      "With just two new signings through the door so far, Amorim, unless things change quickly between now and a-week-on-Saturday, will not be deploying a team too dissimilar to the one that ended last season in Sweden.",
      "Matheus Cunha is set to become a guaranteed starter at Old Trafford, occupying the left-sided No.10 spot, while it remains to be seen how big a role left-back Diego Leon could play in his first season at the club.",
      "United remain hungry to strengthen their attack this summer, prioritising the signings of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo and out-and-out centre-forward. They are also keen to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper.",
      "One area that is not in desperate need of modification, though, is the centre-back department. Despite saying farewell to Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof at the end of last month, United are still well-stocked at the back.",
      "As things currently stand, United's senior centre-back options consist of Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven. Youngsters Tyler Fredricson, Godwill Kukonki and Reece Munro are also pushing to enter the first-team conversation on a regular basis.",
      "Furthermore, Noussair Mazraoui and Luke Shaw, who are both full-backs by trade, have also shown they are capable of operating at centre-back in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. They are both highly versatile and are good options to have.",
      "However, based on how the opening week of pre-season has unfolded, Amorim might have already settled on his preferred back-three ahead of the upcoming clash with Leeds. Neither Martinez, who is still recovering from a long-term anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, or Maguire have been spotted at Carrington in images released by the club.",
      "On the flip side, De Ligt, Yoro and Heaven have all been present. The trio have joined United within the last 12 months and have a very realistic chance of trying to establish themselves as the members of Amorim's first-choice defence this pre-season.",
      "Heaven has put himself in the conversation to become a regular starter at Old Trafford much quicker than anyone could have anticipated after his arrival from Arsenal at the beginning of February. He had made just one senior appearance for the Gunners, meaning it was surprising United immediately considered him as a first-team player.",
      "However, his performances quickly backed up their thinking. He has not put a foot wrong since arriving at Old Trafford, offering an excellent reading of the game, tremendous ability on the ball and so much more. Additionally, he is also left-footed.",
      "With Martinez still sidelined, the left-sided centre-back spot is Heaven's to lose this summer. However, Yoro produced some excellent performances on the left towards the end of last term and he could also creep into Amorim's thinking.",
      "When United transitioned to a back-three last November, Yoro was immediately tipped to become Amorim's first-choice right-sided centre-back. That situation could still transpire amid Heaven's suitability on the left.",
      "De Ligt is capable of playing on either the right or in the centre of the defence, meaning he is equally comfortable in two roles. But with Maguire yet to have been spotted in training, the Dutchman could find himself starting pre-season in the centre of the defence, flanked by Yoro and Heaven either side of him.",
      "Yoro and Heaven were signed by United to become mainstays in the defence for years to come and there is a very good chance they could nail down their places over the coming weeks."

      "Meanwhile, young defender Tyler Fredricson has also been given a new shirt number ahead of the upcoming campaign, swapping No.55 for No.33.

      "Speaking on his podcast, Rio Ferdinand has insisted that United have little choice but to meet Brentford's valuation of Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "United need to find a way of meeting Brentford's valuation. The proposal doesn't seem to be enough for Brentford, but Manchester United need to get this done. It's been in the news for far too long, to get to a situation to get to the end of the window and it doesn't happen, I think that will be an egg-on-the-face situation for Man United unless they go and get someone else. Who have they got waiting in the wings as an alternative? We haven't heard any names that are close.",
      "Despite these reports of a delay in negotiations between Napoli and Galatasaray for Osimhen, it seems this ship has sailed for United.",
      "The Reds are still focused on Mbeumo and that could be to their detriment.",
      "Osimhen will be given a hero's welcome back to Istanbul should he complete this move and you have to think that United could have missed a trick.",
      "According to Gianluca Di Marzio, Napoli have paused transfer talks with Galatasaray for Victor Osimhen.",

      "United confirmed this afternoon that young defender Sonny Aljofree has left the club to join Notts County on loan.",
      "The 20-year-old made 25 appearances for Accrington Stanley last season in League Two and he returns to that level with the Nottinghamshire club.",
      "In 2022, Aljofree starred alongside Garnacho and Mainoo as the young Reds won the Youth Cup.",
      "According to Sport, Antony has a burning desire to sign for Real Betis in the summer transfer window.",

      "MEN Sport understands that Antony is one of five players who has told the club he wants to leave this summer.",
      "Real Betis are reportedly confident enough that Antony wants to sign for them that they are willing to drag the saga into the final stages of the window to force United's hand.",
      "According to Cameroon's assistant Ashu Cyprian Besong, Mbeumo is growing increasingly frustrated by the lack of movement in the switch to United.",
      "Speaking to Telecom Asia, Besong said:",
      "Yes, obviously he’s very frustrated with how long it’s taken. But he’s a professional and anticipates these things. I spoke to him about a week ago and he is very calm with everything that is going on. But of course, he’s already told them he wants to go to United. He just wanted the two clubs to find an agreement, as he’s very grateful for the opportunity that he’s been given by Brentford in his career.",
      "It is being reported this evening that Nottingham Forest's Morgan Gibbs-White is set for a medical at Tottenham after Spurs activated his release clause.",
      "With that, David Ornstein reports that Forest have renewed their interest in Brentford's Yoane Wissa and with money coming in for both Gibbs-White and Elanga, the east Midlands club have money to spend.",
      "Yesterday we brought you news that the Bees are only willing to allow one of Wissa or Mbeumo to leave this summer.",
      "At the moment, there has yet to be a breakthrough in negotiations with Brentford for Mbeumo so Forest's interest in Wissa could be a concern."

      "Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has continued to drop hints of his keenness to join Barcelona this summer.",
      "Rashford, 27, is expected to leave United after returning from his loan spell at Aston Villa. The academy graduate is not in Ruben Amorim's plans for the 2025/26 season but a move hasn't materialised yet.",
      "It's been heavily reported that the forward's dream move is to join Barcelona and is willing to take a pay cut to seal a move to the La Liga champions. A possibility of a transfer agreement being reached had seemed in doubt when Barca pushed for Nico Williams but the Spain international instead signed a new contract at Athletic Bilbao.",
      "A move for Luiz Diaz has also been tipped for Barcelona but Liverpool remain adamant at keeping the Colombian. Reports this week have suggested that the Spanish giants are now ready to pursue Rashford with Hansi Flick giving the green light.",
      "United are keen to sell Rashford rather than a loan with a £40million valuation demanded. However, it's understood that Barcelona prefer a loan deal.",
      "After returning to Carrington to train on an individual basis this week, Rashford has sparked excitement among the Barcelona fanbase by liking Lamine Yamal's Instagram post. The Spanish sensation posted 17 images of him enjoying his summer break, writing: \"enjoy what you dream of\".",
      "Rashford was one of the 1.5million+ to like the Instagram post alongside Patrick Dorgu and Ethan Wheatley. It comes after the United star outlined his desire to play alongside Yamal during an interview last month.",

      "Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo continues to be a target for United this summer, with two bids already being rejected. United are also interested in bringing in a new centre forward this summer, with a host of names already being mentioned as potential targets.",
      "There have been reports linking possible new signings for almost every area of the pitch for United this summer. Whether it be at goalkeeper, midfield or the forward line, there continues to be rumours of new additions being made to the squad at Ruben Amorim's disposal.",
      "One area of the team that could arguably be in need of reinforcements is at centre-back. United currently have Leny Yoro, Matthis de Ligt, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven as the senior central defenders at the club.",
      "Martinez will not return from a serious knee injury until later in the year, and the departures of Victor Lindelof and Jonny Evans mean United will currently go into the campaign with three centre-backs at their disposal. Luke Shaw has shown his ability to play in the middle of the defence, especially on the left side of a back-three deployed by Amorim.",
      "But, when looking at the numbers available to start the campaign, it cannot be denied that United need at least one new signing to be a centre-back this summer. Who that player could be remains to be seen.",
      "One player who could be worth a look at in the transfer market is Goncalo Inacio. The Sporting Lisbon star has been linked with a move to the Premier League in the past, and, unsurprisingly, United, too, given the defender was previously coached by Amorim during his time in Portugal.",
      "Inacio has a release clause in his contract worth €60million (£52million) which has been active since he signed a new contract back in 2023.",
      "The centre-back has now entered the final two years of his deal with Sporting, which runs out in 2027, which could present an opportunity for United if they decide to go into the market for a new defender."

      "The summer transfer window was just 14 hours old when Manchester United announced they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Matheus Cunha on June 1.",
      "United triggered the Brazilian's £62.5million release clause and his move to Old Trafford was subject to him obtaining a visa and registration. The deal was officially completed 11 days later.",
      "During that brief waiting period, United also tabled an opening offer for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo after learning he wants to move to Old Trafford this summer. Their opening bid, worth £55m, was swiftly rejected.",
      "United returned with another bid last month, understood to be in excess of £60m, and it appeared as though that would be enough to make the Cameroon international their second summer signing. However, negotiations remain ongoing and supporters are becoming frustrated.",
      "United are treading a fine line between attempting to strengthen the squad and avoid paying over the odds this summer. Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last summer and Brentford are within their rights to hold out for as high a price as possible.",
      "As much as United want Mbeumo and as much as he wants to move to M16, the Reds must remain mindful that the clock is ticking. The start of their pre-season tour is just a fortnight away and the start of the new Premier League season will be here before you know it.",
      "Having first made contact with Brentford just over five weeks ago, United have got themselves involved in an unwanted saga. They wanted to sign Mbeumo in time for the start of pre-season training and that deadline has been and gone.",
      "With little progress being made on other fronts, United's fast start to the window is becoming a distant memory. Ruben Amorim's side finished 15th in the Premier League last season and the Portuguese chief is desperate to add fresh blood to his squad.",
      "What makes matters worse for United and their supporters is what is happening elsewhere. After Liverpool and Manchester City made storming starts to the window, signing the likes of Jeremie Frimpong, Florian Wirtz, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rayan Cherki, Tottenham Hotspur are now flexing their muscless.",
      "They completed the £55m signing of Mohammed Kudus from West Ham United on Thursday evening and are reportedly closing in on the signing of Nottingham Forest star Morgan Gibbs-White after triggering his £60m release clause.",
      "Arsenal are also greasing their wheels. After adding Christian Norgaard to the signings of Kepa Arrizabalaga and Martin Zubimendi earlier this week, they are now closing in on the signing of Chelsea winger Noni Madueke. Chelsea, too, have been very busy.",
      "Circumstances at every club differ, not least financially, and it is no secret United are having to sell in order to buy this summer. That situation is making the task of bringing new faces in much harder.",
      "Nevertheless, when supporters glance at the business being conducted by the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, City and Spurs, they are naturally going to become restless and frustrated.",
      "United were dreadful last season, offering very little in the way of positives, meaning they have no choice but to make the most of this summer's window. It is the most important summer they have faced in their modern history.",
      "You cannot dismiss the fact United have spent more than £60m on Cunha, a proven Premier League operator who is tailor-made for Amorim's system. They also deserve plaudits for persevering with their quest to sign Mbeumo, who was the fourth-highest goalscorer in the Premier League last season.",
      "However, as mid-July approaches, supporters can be forgiven for becoming impatient. Other Premier League clubs, many of whom enjoyed a far better season than the Reds did last term, are cracking on with their business at a decent pace.",
      "Spurs' recent movements have been the tipping point for many, forcing some supporters to pick up their phones and express their feelings on social media. The prospect of signing Kudus and Gibbs-White in the same week is one way to make a statement.",
      "It would be fantastic to see Mbeumo start the new season in United colours, and many believe the situation has come too far for that not to happen, but the longer this particular saga goes on, United are at an increased risk of being left behind."

The Gunners are said to be preparing an offer worth €65million (£56m) with add-ons amount to €5m (£4m) and €10m (£8m), which would take the overall package to €80m (£69m).",
      "But the Portuguese giants want a guaranteed €70m (£60m) with no add-ons for their prized asset. On Thursday, journalist Ben Jacobs reported that a move to Old Trafford remains a possibility, with the striker’s representatives aware that a deal could still be revived through the Reds.",
      "There is already tension between Gyokeres and the club he helped with two league titles and a domestic cup - including their double last season. A few weeks ago, it was suggested that he would not return for pre-season and would look to force a move away from the Portuguese capital.",
      "He has stayed true to his stance, with Portuguese outlet A Bola reporting that Gyokeres, who was due to report for pre-season on Friday, was absent. He is reportedly expected by Sporting to rejoin the squad by Saturday, ahead of their trip to the Algarve for their summer training camp.",
      "But that now appears unlikely, with reports stating that he is still in Sweden and currently on 'strike.' It's added that only a last-minute breakthrough in negotiations would convince him to return to Portugal.",
      "Sporting, meanwhile, will reportedly wait until Saturday before making a public statement on the situation. They are said to be monitoring whether Gyokeres continues to be absent without justification.",
      "A Bola notes that five consecutive unexcused absences or ten intermittent ones could be sufficient grounds for the player's dismissal. However, Sporting are unlikely to take such action, as it would mean losing their most valuable asset.",

Friday, August 11, marks 37 days until that opening fixture against Arsenal at Old Trafford and United will hope by then that their squad looks a lot different.",
      "The big deadline that United will be working towards is Monday, September 1 when the summer transfer window shuts for good. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at what a dream transfer window would look like between now and Tuesday, September 2, when we are reviewing United's business.",
      "First on the agenda for United will be to complete the deal for Bryan Mbeumo. The Brentford forward may have played out on the wing predominantly last season but he has the capabilities to play more centrally and we are perhaps all tired of the will he, won't he debate.",
      "Ultimately, the 25-year-old would be a good addition for United in the face of no European football this season to tempt other targets to switch to Old Trafford. The Reds would have a strong array of options at No.10 if he were to join and the move would put to bed talk that United wasted a large chunk of the window chasing a player they could not attain.",
      "On Friday, talk intensified surrounding the future of Marcus Rashford. MEN Sport revealed the winger arrived at Carrington this week eight minutes after Amorim left the training facility.",
      "Rashford has been undertaking an individual training regime at United's hub and has not been with his first-team teammates. After being burnt by Nico Williams, Barcelona look to have set their sights on Rashford and a move to Camp Nou would be ideal for all involved.",
      "The United academy graduate appears to be keen on the switch and will work with Barca to make that deal happen quickly. For the Reds, the idea of £40m of pure profit will be music to Ineos' ears.",
      "With Rashford off the books, the plan would be to look at centre-forward options and potentially a move for Hugo Ekitike could be a real statement of intent. United are believed to have enquired about the Eintracht Frankfurt man and discovered they will need to stump up £85m for his signature.",
      "Only sales would make that move possible for United - perhaps beyond Rashford, which we will get to. But, with one of their wantaways off the books, the Reds could feel encouraged to spend big on a player who is perhaps the closest person to Alexander Isak realistically available.",
      "As mentioned briefly, United would need to make another couple of sales to fund such a gargantuan bid for Ekitike. The priorities there would be Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho.",
      "Both men want to leave Old Trafford and could bring in some good money, particularly Garnacho. Antony would also be a decent player to sell but it feels like United are stuck in the unfortunate position of relying on Real Betis to make a decent bid, making a loan switch perhaps the only logical move.",
      "Amid all the talk of changes to the attack, the big gamble would be to keep Rasmus Hojlund at Old Trafford. He clearly has a desire to remain in Manchester and fight for his place.",
      "If he were to stay, it would represent a vote of confidence from Amorim and perhaps that Hojlund has turned over a new leaf after the disastrous second season. Once again, it would be a big gamble but if Amorim is willing to take it, it would be a dream scenario for the Reds."

      "Despite an excellent debut season at United in 2022/23, Casemiro regressed the following season, making the addition of a defensive-minded midfielder a leading priority for the 2024 summer transfer window. United spent several weeks in negotiations with PSG and eventually signed Ugarte on deadline day last August.",
      "After confirming Ugarte's arrival for an initial fee of £42.3million, former United sporting director Dan Ashworth said of the Uruguayan international: \"Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer. He is among the very best ball-winning midfield players in the world and has an excellent record at both club and international level.",

He played just seven times under the Dutchman prior to his exit on October 28, making just three starts, of which only one of them was in the Premier League.",
      "It meant the appointment of Amorim felt significant in Ugarte's hopes of nailing down his place in the team. Many anticipated he would join forces with Kobbie Mainoo in the engine room.",

      "Casemiro got the nod against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, starting in midfield alongside Bruno Fernandes. Ugarte failed to make it off the bench that evening.",
      "Throughout his debut season at Old Trafford, United fans saw the good and the bad of Ugarte. They witnessed how he has the credentials to maintain order in midfield out of possession, helping United keep their shape and win possession back, but they also witnessed flaws in his game when in possession.",
      "Unlike in France and Portugal, Ugarte is not blessed with as much time on the ball in the Premier League. The division is played at a frantic pace and you need eyes in the back of your head.",
      "As a defensive shield and midfield battering ram, Ugarte offers all of the varying qualities you need to fulfil that duty. On the ball, though, he is far from perfect, meaning it is easy to understand why United want to sign a midfielder this summer who can offer a little bit of everything.",
      "However, amid United's desperate need to strengthen their attack, the addition of a midfielder might be put on the back burner.",
      "Fernandes is poised to occupy one of the two No.8 spots and he will need a defensive-minded operator alongside him to ensure United maintain a sense of balance in midfield.",
      "Ugarte is best qualified to offer that defensive nous, but he must raise his game if he is to make one of the two central midfield spots his own. As a result, pre-season will be vitally important for him this summer.",
      "He joined United on August 31 last year, meaning he was thrown in at the deep end. Adjusting to a new club is hard enough, but when you join a club of United's stature, and are tasked with the challenge of fixing the team's biggest weakness, the job becomes even harder.",
      "With a full pre-season under his belt this summer, Ugarte should be all the better for it. If he makes the most of it, there is no reason why he cannot reach his best levels under Amorim again."

      "Sporting a Michael Jordan graphic t-shirt, Hojlund will hope that he can embody the Chicago Bulls legend at Old Trafford this season. However, time is of the essence to prove that to his own Phil Jackson - Ruben Amorim.",
      "Last season was one that is best forgotten from Hojlund's perspective. While his performances in the Europa League were manageable, it was the Premier League that proved to be his nemesis.",
      "Hojlund has shown he can score in the English top flight, with his ten in 30 appearances during the Dane's debut campaign being evidence of that. But with all those struggling around him, the 22-year-old wilted as United plummeted.",
      "The rhetoric surrounding the club this summer has been the need to sign a centre-forward. Hojlund has been linked to the exit door to make that happen despite insisting that he expects to stay at United this summer.",
      "Whether he leaves or not, a new centre-forward is certainly needed. Joshua Zirkzee clearly plays better in the No.10 role and even if Amorim is going to persevere with him as a striker, at least one new centre-forward is needed to provide decent cover to the team.",
      "On Friday, there are just 37 days remaining before the start of the Premier League season. Before then, United will face four Premier League opponents and Fiorentina to prepare for that opening day against Arsenal.",
      "During this timeline, Hojlund will need to prove to Amorim that he can be trusted to be the main striker. If he can do that, the Portuguese could save himself £60m or more in transfer fees.",
      "Strikers at the top of their games this summer have all been valued around this mark. Ollie Watkins, Victor Osimhen and Viktor Gyokeres could all improve United but will cost a king's ransom.",
      "However, if Hojlund proves himself to be capable of being a main striker who can reliably score, a move for a free agent could be seen as viable for Amorim. Signing a player like Callum Wilson or Jamie Vardy could be ideal for United and provide the Dane with a valuable partner to learn from.",
      "But these are all big ifs at the moment. Based on last season, Amorim will feel as though he needs to spend big to strengthen his attack.",
      "Only Hojlund can change his mind."

      "Marcus Rashford’s dream move to Barcelona may never materialise as the Spanish giants have reportedly selected an alternative, Ademola Lookman.",
      "Rashford’s time at Manchester United is realistically over, but both he and the club are struggling to find an exit route.",
      "The 27-year-old spent half of last season on loan at Aston Villa but has made it clear that he favours a move to Barcelona, with the Catalan club looking to strengthen their attacking depth.",
      "Initially, it looked as if Rashford’s move would not come to be with Barceloan going all out to sign Nico Williams, only for the 22-year-old to go sign a ten-year deal with Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Rashford then would have been hopeful about his chances, but a report from Spain suggests Barcelona are going after an alternative, former Everton winger Lookman.",
      "Sport, a newspaper based in Barcelona, says head coach Hansi Flick ‘likes’ the 27-year-old and that he could be available for less than €50 million.",
      "“The Blaugrana have other options on the table, such as Rafa Leao, and are also reportedly keeping a close eye on the situation of Atalanta star Ademola Lookman,” journalist Lluis Miguelsanz said. “He’s a player Flick likes, but his situation isn’t encouraging because relations with his entourage are currently strained.",
      "“Lookman has been trying for years to make the big leap from Atalanta to a top-flight Champions League club, but so far no one has taken the step to sign him.",
      "“The Italian club took a chance by signing him from Leipzig for €10 million, and he’s exploded onto the scene. He’s been gaining international prominence and is now a more mature player, although he needs to take a definitive step to establish himself at the elite level, as his performance is still very inconsistent.",
      "“He’s a pure winger, fast and capable of scoring goals. And he can play in all attacking positions, something Barça highly valued in Luis Díaz, the leading candidate to fill that position if financially possible. Atalanta would be willing to negotiate his sale for less than €50 million because his contract expires in 2027 and he hasn’t renewed yet, and Tottenham are strongly interested in signing him.”",
      "One stumbling block, though, could be Lookman’s choice of agency and their involvement with an ongoing issue at Barcelona.",
      "“The major handicap is that Lookman shares a representation agency with Marc-André ter Stegen, and problems with the goalkeeper are brewing.",
      "“The German will push hard to stay at Barça, and this could create an awkward situation for all parties, which could significantly impact relations with Lookman’s entourage. For now, Barça only has information about his situation, like that of many wingers, but nothing has been done about it.”",
      "Meanwhile, transfer reporter Fabrizio Romano says Rashford is “very open” to the Barcelona move and is “basically waiting for Barca.”",
      "“Marcus Rashford would be very keen on a move to Barcelona. Marcus Rashford is very open to that opportunity. I always told you since January and I keep repeating that Rashford would love Barca move and he’s basically waiting for Barca move because he has many opportunities.",
      "“Rashford is losing the number 10. He was informed 24 hours before about that, through his agents of course, but let me say that it’s not just Marcus Rashford desire to leave Manchester United.",
      "“All of this also starts from Manchester United desire to part ways from Marcus Rashford since January and continuing this summer. So it’s not only Rashford who wants to leave United but there is also United who are pushing the opportunity to sell Marcus Rashford or to find a solution for him this summer.",
      "“When I say Man United it’s the management, it’s the coach Ruben Amorim. So all parties are going to the same direction for Marcus Rashford to leave.”",

      "Marcus Rashford has given the ‘green light’ to Jose Mourinho as Fenerbahce line up a transfer for the Man Utd forward, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has given a ‘condition’ to any potential transfer to Barcelona this summer, according to reports.",
      "A Man Utd star has ‘gained strength in recent hours’ in the Barcelona offices and no, it’s not poor old Marcus Rashford.",

      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",

      "20) 🆕 Khvicha Kvaratskhelia – PSG to Liverpool\nThe story goes that Liverpool will ‘consider’ a move for Kvaratskhelia if they receive a ‘substantially’ better offer from Barca or Bayern for Luis Diaz, who they see as ‘a more proven player’ than the Georgian star, who only joined PSG in January before winning the lot. We know we ought to be more mature and offer a more considered response, but all we’ve got is: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.",
      "",
      "19) 🔽 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, finally, appear to have chosen a lane, one that takes them to Gyokeres’ door. We would never rule out a sharp U-turn, but Sesko’s hopes of joining Arsenal this summer have never seemed as slim as they appear right now.",

      "18) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Juventus\nDespite speculation that Juve preferred a permanent move for Francisco Conceicao, many reports suggest a deal has been agreed with United and it’s now down to Sancho to decide if how much he might be prepared to sacrifice to kickstart his career. The signs so far: not much…",
      "",
      "17) 🔼 Dusan Vlahovic – Juventus to Manchester United\nJuve’s problem here is similar to United’s with Sancho: they owe the player another year of a huge salary. But Vlahovic may be prepared to forego it if Juve simply cut him loose and allow him to find a contract elsewhere as a free-agent. Which would certainly suit United.",
      "",
      "16) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nWith a year left on his contract and a renewal unlikely, Palace are willing to cash in on their captain – but Liverpool won’t pay the £50million or so the Eagles are demanding. Currently, we are at stalemate. Liverpool don’t seem twitchy yet, but they are keeping the lines of communication open.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Nottingham Forest\nBrentford won’t sell Wissa and Mbeumo, which surely means Forest’s failed bid for the former will give Manchester United a kick up the backside in their pursuit of the latter…right?",
      "",
      "14) 🔽 Cristhian Mosquera – Valencia to Arsenal\nArsenal had one bid rejected for the 2024 Golden Boy-shortlisted defender but they remain in talks with Valencia. Which don’t appear to be going well.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Sean Longstaff – Newcastle to Leeds\nAh. It was initially thought Newcastle had accepted what was thought to be Leeds’ best and final offer, worth £10million plus add-ons, but it seems not. The Toon clearly feel they can squeeze more out of Leeds. Though probably not the £50million Man Utd were once quoted by Mike Ashley.",
      "",
      "12) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nArsenal have met with Eze’s representatives and the player is said to be keen on the prospect of moving to the Emirates. Arsenal’s next call ought to be to Palace, who will tell the Gunners they expect Eze’s £67.5million release clause to be paid in full, not as a part-exchange deal involving players we can’t be sure actually exist.",
      "",
      "11) Djordje Petrovic – Chelsea to Bournemouth\nSunderland have expressed an interest in signing Petrovic, who impressed on loan at Strasbourg last season, but it’s Bournemouth who are in the driving seat. Andoni Iraola needs a new goalkeeper and his side have made an offer, according to Fabrizio Romano, who says the Serbian goalkeeper is ‘keen on the move’. You can’t blame him; it’s an opportunity to become the No.1 at a mid-table Premier League team.",
      "",
      "10) 🔼 Marcus Rashford – Manchester United to Barcelona\nWith Nico Williams signing a new contract with Athletic Bilbao and Liverpool ignoring interest in Luis Diaz, Rashford is said to have found himself at the top of Barca’s wish-list and the Catalans are ready to go ‘all in’. Unfortunately for Barca – and United – ‘all’ doesn’t amount to much these days. Rashford wants the move and, most likely, United will be paying him to play as a loanee at the Nou Camp next season.",
      "",
      "9) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nUnited were confident of getting a deal done before now, with a big chunk of Ruben Amorim’s squad due back for pre-season on July 7, but still we wait. The beauty of missing your own deadline is you can simply set another. And another if need be. The latest guess for when United want Mbeumo on board is July 22 when they fly off to the United States.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are ready to pay £43million plus about £4.4million for Nunez, who will be offered £100k a week after tax, which represents a slight raise on what he trousers at Anfield. Liverpool might get more from Saudi but, wisely, the Kop’s Captain Chaos prefers to stay in Europe for now. That Galatasaray are now ready to meet Napoli’s demands for Victor Osimhen ought to speed this up.",
      "",
      "7) James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle are likely to get this done – finally – once the two clubs stop faffing and agree on all the T&Cs around a £30million deal.",
      "",
      "6) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Arsenal\nSo many claims and counter claims now, we’ve almost given up trying to keep up. The latest: Arsenal have offered £56million, with £4.3million then £8.6million in add-ons, which could take the total to £69million. But Sporting aren’t interested in bonuses; they are insisting on £60million up front. Just pay it, FFS, Arsenal and complete that jigsaw. They will. We think. Won’t they?",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Evan Ferguson – Brighton to Roma\nAfter a loan spell at West Ham in which he did absolutely nothing, Ferguson is now mulling over an opportunity to join Roma on loan, with some claiming the Italians will retain the option to buy. Sounds like a great opportunity for a striker once rated at £100million to kickstart his stalling career.",
      "",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Jordan Henderson – Ajax to Brentford\nNo romantic return to Sunderland, who are a bit busy signing everyone else, Henderson is reportedly close to signing for Brentford to replace Arsenal new boy Christian Norgaard. Thomas Tuchel will be chuffed, and so will Arne Slot, since Henderson will probably refuse to tackle any Liverpool player out of #respect.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Noni Madueke – Chelsea to Arsenal\nChelsea have agreed a fee with Arsenal – £52m, says Orny – and the winger has been given permission to fly back before the Club World Cup final to have a medical with the Gunners. Which will prompt some screeching U-turns among the Arsenal fan base, you would expect.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Anthony Elanga – Nottingham Forest to Newcastle\nNewcastle have finally reached an agreement with Forest worth £52million plus add-ons and Elanga is apparently in the North-East for a medical."

      "Everything has changed for Man Utd over Bryan Mbeumo after Nottingham Forest made an offer for Yoane Wissa about £30m below Brentford’s valuation.",
      "",
      "Rash decision\nIt is rare to be given such insight into the MailOnline‘s internal ranking of headline priorities. But Friday provided a glorious opportunity to peek behind that particular curtain.",
      "This story published at 9.11am…",
      "‘Marcus Rashford arrives at Man United training EIGHT Minutes [sic] after boss Ruben Amorim and the squad depart Carrington as forward’s cold exile continues’",
      "…was changed to reflect the most important detail of all at 10am, with myriad wrist slaps presumably doled out in between:",
      "‘Marcus Rashford arrives at Carrington in sparkling £177k Audi to train alone after the squad had left the complex – as forward’s Man United exile continues’",
      "The omission of some unnecessary ALL CAPS was obviously a tough call, his ‘exile’ is no longer ‘cold’ and now we have no idea of the delay between Ruben Amorim leaving and Marcus Rashford arriving, but look at the expensive motor before he takes it to Barcelona and shut up.",
      "",
      "‘Why Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford drove into Carrington amid transfer decision’",
      "Because he a) is a footballer who wants to train and b) didn’t fancy catching the bus.",
      "",
      "How’s it hanging?\nRashford makes up part of a group given perhaps the least inspired nickname in football history by the MailOnline:",
      "‘Inside Man United’s first week of pre-season as Gang of Five’s shadow hangs over Carrington while club struggle to sell outcasts’",
      "That is laughable. Where’s the creativity? No alliteration, rhyme or pun? What about The Rash Pack? The Infamous Five? If you’re not going to do it properly then don’t do it at all.",
      "But Mediawatch is intrigued. In what way does the ‘shadow’ of Rashford and his exiled brethren ‘hang’ over Man Utd beyond the club placing extortionate values on their heads before wondering why no-one wants to buy players they are explicitly desperate to sell?",
      "It is not exactly made clear and indeed Chris Wheeler has been ever so slightly stitched-up. His four mentions of Rashford in a wide-ranging piece include: how Man Utd want to sell him; that he has returned to training early and with an excellent attitude; and that the other players the club want rid of have chosen not to do so, as it their wont.",
      "It really does sound like the ‘Gang of Five’s shadow hangs over Carrington’. Wait until Sir Jim finds out what car Rashford took.",
      "",
      "Twist again, like we did last summer\nWith precisely zero actual movement on the Rashford front we are left with the ongoing need to pretend there is anything happening with regards to the future of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "That is obviously relatively difficult, seeing as it is common knowledge the player wants to join Man Utd but negotiations with Brentford over a fee are protracted and inevitably secretive.",
      "Yet there are absolutely updates to be had if you look hard/desperately enough. Like the Daily Mirror website, who say the move has ‘taken fresh twist as Brentford receive new bid’.",
      "How unfortunate that the headline implies said ‘new bid’ is from Man Utd for Mbeumo when it is actually from Nottingham Forest for Yoane Wissa.",
      "Does Forest making an offer about £30m below Brentford’s valuation of Wissa really constitute a ‘fresh twist’ over Man Utd’s pursuit of Mbeumo? No. If anything it reflects better on Man Utd who are far closer to finding a breakthrough in negotiations. But also obviously yes if you need to pretend things are happening at Old Trafford.",
      "The same outlet also runs this story:",
      "‘Bryan Mbeumo ‘very frustrated’ by Man Utd transfer as Brentford star’s coach breaks silence’",
      "And Mediawatch is thrilled to confirm that Cameroon assistant coach Ashu Cyprian Besong has finally spoken out on the matter after keeping his counsel for so long.",
      "If these quotes don’t get the ball moving then nothing will:",
      "“Yes, obviously he’s very frustrated with how long it’s taken. But he’s a professional and anticipates these things. I spoke to him about a week ago and he is very calm with everything that is going on.”",
      "Shame they could only find space in the headline to fit in how Mbeumo was “very frustrated” rather than “very calm”.",

      "Noni chance in hell\nArsenal’s move for Noni Madueke has prompted the sort of reaction this summer desperately needed: namely absolute fury at a relatively sensible but admittedly quite expensive transfer.",
      "The common consensus appears to be that Arsenal are shafting themselves; The Sun believe ‘Chelsea could be about to repeat their Mo Salah transfer mistake by selling Noni Madueke to Arsenal’.",
      "That is a brave and bold line from Lloyd Canfield, Sports Journalist and Sport Social Media Manager, who reckons the Blues are ‘selling what seems to be the most obvious Salah replica the club have had in years’.",
      "Good lord. There are some similarities in underlying numbers and style but it is a frankly ludicrous and unhelpful comparison.",
      "And pretending ‘it signals the sale of a player who perhaps epitomises BlueCo’s model better than any other’ is also quite weird for two reason: the £52m sale itself of a player Chelsea signed for £29m less than two years ago epitomises that model, as does the fact ‘his replacement is an 18-year-old Brazilian wonderkid who is a talented but still relatively unknown outside of South America in Estevao Willian’.",
      "This is remarkably BlueCo Chelsea.",
      "Madueke’s modest output last season is then excused because it is ‘important to remember he had Nicolas Jackson on the end of many chances he was creating’.",
      "Why that didn’t stop six different Chelsea players assisting at least one of Jackson’s 13 goals but held Madueke back to the extent he set up fewer goals than Christopher Nkunku, Tyrique George and Jackson himself last season is unknown.",
      "‘With Liam Delap and Joao Pedro already looking clinical in the Club World Cup, Chelsea’s frontline next season could have represented an opportunity for Madueke to explode into the player most fans know he can become.’",
      "Someone’s forgetting the other £55m forward Chelsea have signed; that frontline needs to make room for Jamie Gittens too and the player with 20 combined goals and assists in 67 Premier League games makes sense if a buyer is willing to meet his price tag.",
      "Madueke might come good at Arsenal. He might not. But is it really necessary to pretend there is literally zero middle ground between starting a petition against his signing and comparing him to one of the greatest players the Premier League has ever seen?",
      "",
      "Bees knees\nWith the ‘shock’ of the only Premier League club then without a manager considering the credentials of Ange Postecoglou having barely set in, the MailOnline now brings us this JUST DAYS later:",

      "It is not often a player can leave the popular, newly-crowned miracle champions for a loathed mid-table team with barely an eyebrow raised or an unkind word spoken. But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",

      "Marco Silva kept a straight face when describing Iwobi as “one of our main targets”, despite the Toffees having to rush through a move in the final two hours of the 2019 transfer window after finally abandoning their summer-long pursuit of Wilfried Zaha.",
      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",

      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",

      "Juan Mata – £37.1m in January 2014",
      "From: Chelsea (3rd)\nTo: Manchester United (7th)",

      "David Moyes welcomed the Spaniard with unsurprisingly open arms, hoping he could galvanise his fading first season at Old Trafford as Manchester United sat seventh, a point clear of Newcastle.",
      "Chelsea were third at the time the deal went through, much to the chagrin of Wenger. “Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others not. I think if you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly the same, that should not happen.”",

      "The first of a great many awkward midfield keys signed to unlock Paul Pogba, it was Matic who Jose Mourinho described as having “everything he wants in a footballer” in what was presumably intended as a compliment but is actually a damning indictment beyond about 2015.",
      "Conte was furious and for once entirely justified as Chelsea used the funds to restock their cupboards with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater before Ross Barkley arrived in January.",

      "Cole Palmer – £42.5m in September 2023",
      "From: Manchester City (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "Enough steaming missiles have been launched at the walls of Stamford Bridge, Cobham and any other property Chelsea have sold to themselves over the years for some to stick. Yet Palmer is still probably the one unqualified success story for Clearlake’s recruitment strategy.",
      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",

      "Kyle Walker – £53m in July 2017",
      "From: Spurs (2nd)\nTo: Manchester City (3rd)",
      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Spurs claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker left the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",
      "",
      "Mohammed Kudus – £55m in July 2025",
      "From: West Ham (14th)\nTo: Spurs (17th)",
      "It is an unflattering reflection of both club and player that Kudus signed a West Ham contract containing an £80m release clause in summer 2023 and left for £25m less two years later.",
      "There were flashes of something exceptional over those 80 Hammers appearances under three different managers, but that wonderful first season being shown tapes of Steven Pienaar by David Moyes had faded long before Spurs swooped.",
      "Thomas Frank identified the Ghanaian as his priority signing, Kudus picked out Spurs as the only club he wished to join, West Ham swallowed their pride to fund much-needed squad improvements and Arne Slot looked on longingly.",
      "But 14th to 17th is barely a step down in comparison to what Morgan Gibbs-White is about to do.",
      "",
      "Moises Caicedo – £115m in August 2023",
      "From: Brighton (6th)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "Joao Pedro and Mohammed Kudus have joined the increasing legion of players swapping Premier League clubs for at least £50m, with more deals to come.",
      "For six years the most expensive uncapped English player ever was a Manchester United signing, but Chelsea have inevitably forced a change.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City star Kyle Walker is ‘close’ to completing a ‘shock’ move to a rival Premier League club in a ‘significant coup’.",
      "A former Chelsea defender has offered his thoughts on Liam Delap, suggesting he ‘can shine’ with the help of ‘elite’ players like Cole Palmer.",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes – including three Man City cast-offs and Marcus Rashford."

      "1) Enzo Fernandez – £106.8m/€121m (Benfica to Chelsea, January 2023)\nA €10m Benfica signing and Argentina youth international in June 2022; a €121m Chelsea signing and Argentina World Cup winner six months later. It was a lot of money to finish in the bottom half but then they sorted themselves out.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m/€117.4m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nRice could be a game-changer for Arsenal – for £100m and another £5m in add-ons, he ought to be. The double free-kick to sink Real Madrid will live long in the memory and basically helped pay back his fee.",
      "",
      "3) Moises Caicedo – £100m/€117.1m (Brighton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThere is every chance Caicedo could jump to the top of this list soon, with around half of the £15m in add-ons a grovelling Chelsea had to offer described as easily achievable in some quarters. Liverpool had put together a £111m package but, much to some hilarious and entirely grown-up Proper Red fury, the Ecuadorean wasn’t interested.",
      "",
      "4) Paul Pogba – £93.2m/€110m (Juventus to Man Utd, August 2016)\nMan Utd never did figure out how to unlock Pogba, with the weary efforts of three different managers ultimately ending in frustration, viruses, haircuts and a second Old Trafford exit to join Juventus as a free agent.",
      "",
      "5) Jude Bellingham – £88.5m/€103m (Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid, June 2023)\nThe idea of a £100m bargain sounds particularly weird but Bellingham is as close as is possible. Real Madrid would be thrilled if add-ons taking the deal to £115m/€133.9m were activated over the course of a six-year contract for a 21-year-old with more than 300 senior career appearances who will probably break soon.",
      "",
      "6) Frenkie de Jong – £74.5m/€86m (Ajax to Barcelona, July 2019)\nGiven a choice also involving Paris Saint-Germain and both Manchester clubs, De Jong cashed in on his rising Ajax stock at the absolute peak to join Barcelona just as they started financially collapsing in on themselves. The Dutchman has been central to their revival.",
      "",
      "7) Aurelien Tchouameni – £68.3m/€80m (Monaco to Real Madrid, June 2022)\nSimilar to Bellingham, Real Madrid would not mind paying an extra £17m/€20m if Tchouameni holds up his end of a quite stunningly executed midfield renovation.",

      "",
      "11) Martin Zubimendi – £60m/€69.5m (Real Sociedad to Arsenal, July 2025)\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to abandon the food or mountains of San Sebastian but Arsenal made the right pitch a year later, reuniting Mikel Merino with his former La Real teammate.",

      "12) Jorginho – £57m/€65m (Napoli to Chelsea, July 2018)\nManchester City could not force a deal over the line but the pull of London and Maurizio Sarri delivered Jorginho to a productive if never unanimously popular half-decade at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "13) Tanguy Ndombele – £55.4m/€62m (Lyon to Tottenham, July 2019)\nA club-record signing made so long ago that Mauricio Pochettino welcomed him to north London when Ange Postecoglou was busy winning titles with Yokohama F Marinos, Ndombele left for nothing nine games short of a century of Spurs appearances.",

      "14) Kevin de Bruyne – £55m/€75m (Wolfsburg to Manchester City, August 2015)\n“I thought it was lira,” said Paul Merson of the fee an English club had agreed to pay a German side for a Belgian player. “The world is going mad,” added Phil Thompson. That fee does look crazy for what Manchester City received in return over a decade, to be fair.",

      "15) Miralem Pjanic – £54.8m/€60m (Juventus to Barcelona, June 2020)\nRemember the Arthur entry? Well as part of a fudged pandemic transfer which seemed to point towards a future of big clubs swapping their wage-drainers because no-one had any money, Barcelona were able to press the Pjanic button for a couple of years.",

      "16) Romeo Lavia – £53m/€61.9m (Southampton to Chelsea, August 2023)\nThirty-six senior career appearances was enough for a Chelsea side gripped by their insatiable obsession with signing young midfielders. And indeed anyone. Manchester City even received £8m or so after sticking a sell-on clause into the deal which saw Lavia join Saints a year earlier.",
      "",
      "17) Matheus Nunes – £53.2m/€62m (Wolves to Manchester City, September 2023)\nThe Portugal international went on strike to force through a move to work with Pep Guardiola at City after Wolves refused the Treble winners’ first offer. The fee includes a 10 per cent sell-on clause when City are done with the 26-year-old.",

      "18) Naby Keita – £52.75m/€60m (Leipzig to Liverpool, July 2018)\nThat rare example of an expensive Liverpool transfer committee misstep. Keita seemed absolutely perfect for Klopp but 75 starts in five seasons tells a particular story which revolves around hamstrings.",

      "So the pity is out of the way let’s stick the boot in, a year ago before you came 16th I said that you were just a poor team, it’s still true, you have next to nothing in terms of players that are “Man United” standard, Bruno is the best of a bad bunch and sadly he wouldn’t get into a lot of Prem sides because he’s a bit sh*t.",
      "I really hope that this is the year you get relegated, last year was a close call and Ruben is going to keep his terrible form because he’s not that good, they’ll sack him before Christmas as they should but which idiot will take the poisoned chalice, a lot of managers have taken the United job and none have come out of the other end smelling of roses (maybe the little Norwegian but his other jobs were Molde and Cardiff), you won’t get a good manager and even if you do it won’t matter because you’re poor and will come close to the bottom 3 again (hopefully Leeds spends this mystical £300 million so they can overtake you).",
      "This team is on par with West Ham just 10 times more expensive, it’s not an insult, West Ham are okay, the problem that Man U have is, coming back to the start of this e-mail, your owners have created a toxic atmosphere, every player that has been brought in the last 5 years has been rather good at the club they were at before joining United, Onana looked like he had hands when playing for Ajax, Sancho was in German team of the season, Mason Mount wasn’t constantly injured from embarrassment and Antony was touted as a world beater.",
      "They then joined United and became terrible, this is due to the horrible place that Old Trafford and Carrington has become, it wouldn’t matter if United bought prime Messi and Ronaldo, they would go to United and fall out of love with football and turn poo, you did this to yourself.",
      "Don’t think of relegation as a problem, it is freeing, it is the only way you are going to be sold to someone who may actually like the club more than money, one of your owners has a Chelsea season pass for God’s sake, you should be protesting every match but it doesn’t matter, it won’t get the club sold, just hope for relegation and that someone nice takes over you.",

In the same way that there is logic suggesting Liverpool are one of the favourites this year, which you did, rather hypocritically after pointing out that everyone starts on zero points.",

      "10) Riyad Mahrez – £60m (Leicester to Manchester City, July 2018)\nHad things gone to plan then Mahrez would have honoured only the first season of a four-year contract he signed with newly-crowned Premier League champions Leicester. The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",

      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time.

      "Christian Norgaard to Arsenal is a done deal. Now we like Norgaard rather a lot. In our view, his has been an under-rated contribution to Brentford’s post-Toney attacking success, with his lower-key creative input significantly and understandably overshadowed by the more eye-catching Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa.",
      "Point is, he’s a very good player available at a very good price and he might be just the thing. But…bit underwhelming, isn’t it? One thing Norgaard is not and never can be is the big-name striker Arsenal fans crave so desperately.",
      "But sometimes this precise kind of initially underwhelming transfer can obtain enormous significance come the final reckoning, like these five lads whose eventual contribution to title glory in their first season was far greater than the excitement that greeted their arrival.",
      "We’re talking specifically players who actually helped win their teams the title, not Ralph Wiggum-style helping. So no Federico Chiesa here, unfortunately.",
      "",
      "Manuel Akanji (Man City, 2022)\nOne of the problems with a feature like this is the fact that a vast number of Premier League titles have been won by Manchester United ages ago and Manchester City more recently, meaning any new signings – underwhelming, overwhelming or those that merely adequately whelm – are coming into teams already well used to winning titles by the sh*tload and thus making it harder to make decisive contributions.",
      "But if we try to do this feature without any contribution from Manchester we’re in very deep trouble, so we will have to make the best of it.",
      "And thus, Manuel Akanji is our man. There was little fanfare when he arrived right at the end of the 2022 summer transfer window to join two-time defending champions for whom Aymeric Laporte and Ruben Dias had formed an estimable first-choice defensive pairing with top-tier reinforcements in the shape of John Stones and Nathan Ake.",
      "At the very least it would be fair to say that of City’s two signings from Borussia Dortmund that summer, Akanji’s (for less than a third of the fee City threw Leeds’ way for Kalvin Phillips) was the lower profile.",
      "And while, yes, the very much not underwhelming signing of Erling Haaland certainly played its part in City’s continued success, so too did Akanji. He would end the season with more Premier League appearances than any of Ake, Dias, Stones or Laporte despite not making his debut in the competition until mid-September, as well as playing every minute of the Champions League knockouts and in every round of the FA Cup for the treble winners.",
      "Now Manchester City need an upgrade, but then he was an underrated revelation.",
      "",
      "Marcos Alonso (Chelsea, 2016)\nChelsea’s rollercoaster journey from 2014 to 2017 will always be one of the Premier League’s very best bits, with a pair of hugely impressive title wins under Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte sandwiching a comically disastrous season that ended Mourinho’s second spell and resulted in a 10th-place finish.",
      "As well as appointing Conte, something else Chelsea did in the summer of 2016 was sign Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina.",
      "Now he had proved himself a very capable player for La Viola in Serie A, but here in England we have very correctly never really placed much stock in what a player might achieve in daft little foreign leagues like that one. It only matters what you’ve done here. And in Alonso’s case, that was ‘be a bit-part player in a relegated Bolton team and half-a-season of relegation-battling with Gus Poyet’s Sunderland’. In other words, nothing very interesting at all.",
      "Yet he was absolutely crucial to Chelsea’s success under Conte. We’ve all enjoyed the banters about the sorcery of Conte’s ability to win the league with Victor Actual Moses as his RWB – a magic trick matched only by Conte’s ability to regrow his own hair – but it’s easily overlooked now just how brilliant and integral Alonso was on the other side, and how that really was not something everyone knew would be the case at the time.",
      "As well as his defensive work, Alonso became a key progressive component of Chelsea’s dominant title-winners, more than doubling his career tally of top-flight goals in that one season.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante (Leicester, 2015)\nFeels like it’s a bit of a cheat to include anything at all from Leicester’s 2015/16 miracle, because for very, very understandable reasons not one soul on earth was talking about any Leicester signing of any xW (expected whelm) as being the one that might just propel them to the title after their escape from relegation in 2015.",
      "But equally it feels like you just can’t have this list without Kante given the sheer gulf between the lack of fanfare that greeted the arrival of a player on the back of one mid-table season in Ligue 1 with Caen and the mammoth significance of his contribution to Leicester pulling off the Premier League’s greatest ever madness.",
      "Such was his impact that he moved on to Chelsea after just one season – duly winning the season again as a signing that was in no way underwhelming – and his name remains to this day an instantly understood shorthand for a very specific and very special type of player.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick (Man United, 2006)\nIt’s one of those things that’s been largely memory-holed now by all involved, but at the time of Carrick’s move from Tottenham to Manchester United there were plenty of United fans who felt they’d been sold an overpriced pup by those wily southern chancers.",
      "The mood was febrile enough around Old Trafford back in the summer of 2006 on the back of a truly unthinkable three-year Premier League title drought. It seems hilarious to think of that now – largely because it is hilarious – but at the time United had never previously gone even two seasons of Barclays without winning the thing.",
      "Jose Mourinho had come along and ruined everything, the great Special prick that he was, and there was widely held suspicion about the idea a pretty-passing midfielder of such conspicuous pretty loser stock as West Ham and Tottenham could significantly change matters.",
      "Five Premier League titles and 316 Premier League appearances later, opinions had altered a bit.",
      "",
      "Jens Lehmann (Arsenal, 2003)\nGot to have a bit of Arsenal in here, haven’t we? And there really is only one contender when you look through the names.",
      "Now it’s not like Arsenal fans thought they’d signed a dud when Lehmann arrived, but he was a goalkeeper with a reputation for being something of a loon.",
      "As the man to replace the very safest of English goalkeeping hands in David Seaman, it was undoubtedly a bit of a punt. Yet a punt that led to Lehmann being an ever-present member of the first and still very much only unbeaten English league champions since the Victorian era.",
      "Look, fair play.",
      "Arsenal have announced that they have completed their third summer signing, while Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that another transfer is “absolutely on”.",
      "Arsenal continue to make moves in the summer transfer market with their third signing set to be confirmed this week.",
      "According to reports, there was one key reason behind Mikel Arteta’s decision to favour Arsenal-bound Christian Norgaard over an alternative.",
      "Arsenal have reached an ‘agreement’ for their third summer signing as a replacement for a midfielder who looks to be Barcelona bound."

      "By Lyall Thomas, Senior Football News Editor",
      "Friday 4 July 2025 11:10, UK",
      "Marcus Rashford has returned to Manchester United after his loan with Aston Villa officially expired on June 30.",
      "However, the forward faces no real future at Old Trafford and he would rather be at a new club than returning to Carrington this summer.",
      "So, with pre-season looming, where does Rashford go next?",
      "Barcelona remains Rashford's preferred destination should he leave United this summer.",
      "And, intriguingly, the door could be opening on a move to Catalonia.",
      "That's because in the past week, Barcelona have seen their hopes of landing either Liverpool's Luis Diaz or Athletic Club's Nico Williams more or less extinguished.",
      "Liverpool rejected Bayern Munich's offer for Diaz - just as they rebuffed Barca's advances earlier this summer - and made it clear the Colombian is not for sale. Then on Friday, Williams signed a new 10-year deal with Athletic Club.",
      "Financial issues remain a concern at Barcelona. They have tight financial parameters set by LaLiga and a recent history of failing to register players due to problems around funding those deals.",
      "Rashford's prospects of a switch to Barcelona look more likely now than they did a week ago - but how a deal will be structured will take some work given Barcelona's financial issues, Rashford's wages at Manchester United, and the Old Trafford club's preference to sell rather than sanction another loan.",
      "It is understood that, if he cannot move to Barcelona, Rashford wants a move to another Champions League club.",
      "It is for that reason that Aston Villa appear out of the running for the moment and have not pursued a permanent deal at the £40m mark set by United.",
      "Rashford moved to Villa on loan in January and he had a promising spell there, recovering some of his best form, but Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on the final day of the season.",
      "In April, it was reported that Rashford does not want to move to London, which seemingly rules out Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs.",
      "As United's biggest rivals, Man City and Liverpool can also be considered highly unlikely. If he wants to play for a Champions League club in England, that just leaves Newcastle.",
      "Alexander Isak is their main striker, and Eddie Howe has other targets for wingers including Anthony Elanga - who they have made a second, increased bid of around £55m for - Johan Bakayoko, Karim Adeyemi and Mo Kudus.",
      "An issue for clubs in Europe more than Saudi has been Rashford's high wages at United and how to reach an offer that would be attractive to him.",
      "A loan deal would be more manageable for European clubs but United are not keen on this and prefer a permanent sale; as they also do with Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
