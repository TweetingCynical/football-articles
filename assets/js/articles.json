      "The former Manchester United star had spent nearly two years in the K League and made 67 appearances for Seoul, scoring 19 goals and providing 10 assists. Now Lingard is moving on to pastures new.",
      "During the January transfer window, the 32-time England international held talks with several clubs in England and Italy. But Dutch giants Feyenoord have entered the fray following a devastating injury blow.",
      "According to the Mail, Van Persie is keen to reunuite with Lingard. It comes after Feyenoord youngster and Van Persie's son, Shaqueel, suffered what appeared to be a serious injury a week ago.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"It's not looking good,\" Van Persie admitted after Feyenoord's 2-1 loss away to Real Betis in the Europa League. \"Tests have to point out how he's doing, but the first signs are not looking good.",
      "\"You hold your heart when any player goes down with an injury. It happened to be Shaqueel today, that's just how it is. You hope for the best, but when you hear the first signs that it isn't it's heartbreaking.",
      "\"I'm a coach, but I'm also his father and I find this terrible. It's a bit of both. It's heartbreaking that he's going through this.\"",

      "The report adds that Lingard wants to make a decision on his next club by the end of next week. The midfielder most recently played in Europe with Nottingham Forest in the 2022-23 season.",
      "Forest was Lingard's first permanent club following his release from United, having not been offered a new deal. In 2021, he enjoyed a memorable loan spell with West Ham, who've also been linked with a move.",

      "Manchester United have another tough game on the horizon as they welcome Tottenham to Old Trafford on Saturday. The Red Devils ended the winter transfer window with little fanfare, allowing several fringe players to go out on loan as they kept their main squad intact.",
      "Michael Carrick has been a breath of fresh air on his return to the club, winning all three games so far. Tough matches against local rivals Manchester City and old foes Arsenal both yielded three points, while a last-minute winner against Fulham ensured the interim boss remains with a 100% record.",
      "Next up it's Tottenham at home as Thomas Frank's side look to build on their own impressive result against City last weekend. A win over Spurs will see United bolster their top four credentials even further and potentially close the gap on Aston Villa, who play later in the day against Bournemouth.",
      "Ruben Amorim has indirectly given Carrick the ultimate show of respect by holding off on explaining his side of his United journey until the end of the season. Following a 1-1 draw with Leeds United in January, the Portuguese manager was sacked after 14 months in charge.",
      "Carrick was placed in interim charge with many clamouring for Amorim's side of the story immediately after his departure. However, a source has now told the Daily Mail that the 41-year-old is planning to wait until the summer to speak out.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo injured Alex Iwobi on Sunday(Image: Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Fulham's Alex Iwobi has singled out Kobbie Mainoo after injuring his hand during a fierce battle on Sunday. The midfielder has had a resurgence of form under Carrick, starting all three Premier League games and covering more ground than anyone else.",
      "This is in stark contrast to his time with Amorim, who kept him on the bench for the majority of his tenure. And it seems that Iwobi is still feeling the effects of the England international from their clash last weekend.",
      "During his recent YouTube video, the midfielder said: \"Shout out Kobbie Mainoo but Kobbie man.. you absolutely finished my hand. This guy has Ghanaian strength!\"",
      "Iwobi showed off his broken finger(Image: youtube/@alexanderyaadigg)",
      "As he said this, Iwobi showed his right hand, which had his ring and little finger strapped together. It is unclear how this injury was caused, but the Fulham star's comments paint a picture that the pair battled it out in a duel that Iwobi clearly lost.",
      "Just last month, a loan away from United seemed the likeliest next step for Mainoo after Amorim had given him just over 200 minutes of Premier League action this season. But that has all changed with the return of Carrick, who has shown clear faith in the England star from the get go, with a contract extension seemingly on the table, too.",

      "United's major shareholders, the Glazer family, have proven deeply unpopular in their time with the club, and speculation over a sale has been rife in recent years. Such uncertainty saw Sir Jim Ratcliffe arrive as a co-owner in 2024 after buying a 27 per cent share for £1.25bn.",
      "Ratcliffe's tenure has seen him become a face of the club's ownership, and he has proven controversial too. United have imposed a number of cost-cutting measures, including widespread redundancies, and in some corners, an appetite for a takeover remains.",

It remains unclear precisely what Mainoo did to Iwobi that caused his finger injury, but, based on the latter's remarks, it appears to have occurred during a tussle for the ball, in which the United player came out on top.",
      "A month ago, a January loan move appeared probable for Mainoo, with Amorim having given him barely 200 minutes of Premier League action this season. Since the former United head coach revealed he was in direct competition with Fernandes for a place in the team, his appearances became increasingly rare.",
      "Napoli had been expressing keen interest in securing his services temporarily, with the Italian champions already having Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund on their books. Currently, a contract extension appears far more probable than an exit this summer, with discussions set to commence.",

      "Carrick said: \"Sometimes we can pigeonhole players quite quickly, but it's not always the case. Kobbie can play different roles within that, but definitely with Cassie in the middle, the last couple of games they've had a really good pairing and been a big part of controlling the team.\"",

      "Honor, who previously played for Manchester City's academy before moving to Blackburn in his teenage years, has made six appearances for Blackburn's under-21s this season. The 19-year-old is expected to serve as a training goalkeeper, providing support during sessions.",
      "United have a history of utilising training goalkeepers to aid both their first-team and academy squads.",
      "Stephen Torpey took over as head of United's academy last summer following Nick Cox's departure. Luke Fedorenko, formerly head of academy recruitment, also announced his exit shortly after Cox. Torpey joined City in 2014 and gradually climbed the ranks within their academy, eventually becoming the head of coaching for the Under-15 to Under-23 age groups, where he oversaw several trophy victories.",
      "United's under-21s currently sit at the top of the Premier League 2 table. Travis Binnion recently moved up to work with the first team, paving the way for Adam Lawrence to return to the club to manage the under-21s.",
      "Lawrence led United's Under-18s to a treble in the 2023/24 season, clinching two trophies at the expense of rivals City. He is now tasked with aiding the under-21s' development for the remainder of the campaign.",

The England international had to be patient before getting the opportunity to play at Barca's legendary Camp Nou stadium following delays to their redevelopment project but the best may still lie ahead - including a potential European final at the storied venue.",
      "Rashford has already made his debut at the ground since its reopening, though the first games back there have been played in front of a reduced crowd. He could yet grace the venue on the grandest stage of all, though, with Barcelona confirming their ambition to host the 2029 Champions League final.",
      "\"FC Barcelona hereby formally expresses its intention to participate, together with Barcelona City Council and the Government of Catalonia, in the initial bidding process to host the 2029 Champions League Final, proposing the city of Barcelona as a potential host and Spotify Camp Nou as the proposed venue, subject to the corresponding certification and approval by UEFA, and with the support of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF),\" the club announced in a statement. \"This process forms part of a preliminary phase of analysis and assessment.",
      "\"The club and the institutions involved have submitted the initial required documentation with the aim of advancing the procedure and enabling UEFA to assess the suitability of the bid, in accordance with the established protocols. The formal submission of the final bid and the delivery of the complete dossier, including all the documentation required to be considered as host of the final, are scheduled for early June 2026.\"",

      "\"Atmosphere-wise, I'd probably say I enjoyed Nou Camp,\" Rashford revealed when quizzed on The Overlap in 2023 about his favourite ground. \"The first time we played there we got beat 3-0. We had a couple of chances and I hit the crossbar early on.",
      "\"I think Paul [Pogba] had a shot that clipped the post and this was all at 0-0. Once they got the first goal, the crowd was different. Every time [Lionel] Messi got on the ball it was daunting and the crowd were shouting to make the backline nervous. It was all a mess after they scored the first goal.\"",

      "(Image: Simon Stacpoole/Offside, Getty Images)",
      "Rashford may soon have the opportunity not only to feature in a final at a stadium he holds in high regard but to do so wearing Barcelona colours. This would depend on the Camp Nou being selected to host the 2029 final, whilst the player himself would need to keep his levels up between now and the end of the campaign and secure a permanent move.",
      "The forward set ambitious targets when joining the club on loan and and was questioned about the Champions League after Barca's semi-final run last year. A fifth-place finish in the league phase has seen them progress directly to the round of 16, where they will face Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, Newcastle United or Qarabag.",
      "\"It is what the club was fighting for last year and they were very close and I hope they can take the next step this year,\" Rashford said upon his arrival. \"This is a historic club and they are known for winning the biggest prizes. I am here to help the club do that. It is a dream of mine for sure.\"",
      "The 28-year-old has already hit double figures for goals and assists during his loan stint, including setting up a Ronald Araujo strike in a midweek Copa del Rey triumph at Albacete. He also found the back of the net in Saturday's clash with Elche, prompting words of encouragement from boss Hansi Flick as Barcelona get ready to decide whether to trigger a £26million permanent transfer clause for their loanee.",
      "\"I think he has a lot of potential to show,\" Flick said after the 3-1 victory at Elche . \"We always focus on goals, the final pass, because this is one of the ways you can measure things, and he's doing well in that regard.",

      "The winger had been put in United's 'bomb squad' after taking aim at the ex-Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim after last season's Europa League final. Few United supporters were sad to see Garnacho go when he eventually got his wish of a move to Chelsea.",
      "On Wednesday, the Argentina international hoped to help his new team come from behind on aggregate to beat Arsenal in their Carabao Cup semi-final. Ahead of the game, Garnacho used United's recent victory at the Emirates as evidence to suggest that Chelsea could win 'perfectly'.",
      "\"Everyone knows how hard it is to play there,\" Garnacho told club media. \"When we lost the first game, I saw a lot of people saying, 'Yeah, but no one won yet at the Emirates'.",

      "\"How did that work out for you?\" one United supporter cheekily asked. \"Didn't age well,\" another wrote. \"Who does he think he is?\" a third posted on X.",

      "The situation has sparked speculation over whether Ronaldo will see out the final 18 months of his £488,000-a-day contract with Al-Nassr. So could the five-time Ballon d'Or winner return for a stunning third spell with Manchester United?",
      "No, according to his ex-team-mate, Wes Brown. Former United defender Brown told BettingLounge: \"He's not happy but would Cristiano Ronaldo come back to Manchester United for a third go? I would say no.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"I can't see how that could happen. A move to MLS? Maybe. Maybe he goes back to Portugal and plays there. I'm sure he will still have so many options.",
      "\"The main thing is that he still wants to play in the World Cup and we would have to keep playing and making sure he keeps himself fit to do that. It's a shock to everyone to see Ronaldo on strike but I honestly think it will get resolved. We'll have to wait and see where it goes from here.\"",
      "Ronaldo nor any of his team-mates and coaches have made public statements since Monday's win. Manager Jorge Jesus saw his post-match press conference cancelled while their players were told not to speak to the media.",

      "Al-Nassr next play on Friday, hosting Al-Ittihad, and Ronaldo's involvement remains a mystery. Al-Hilal, on the other hand, will face strugglers Al-Akhdoud at home.",
      "The league leaders have given Al-Nassr a sniff of hope in recent weeks, drawing their last two games. Failure to beat Al-Akhdoud would give Al-Nassr the chance to go top, having last won the title in 2019, long before Ronaldo's arrival from United in 2022.",

      "Manchester United loanee Marcus Rashford has been snubbed at Barcelona(Image: AP)",
      "Manchester United chose not to make any first-team additions with the January transfer window now closed. But interim boss Michael Carrick has won his first three matches in charge.",
      "After a summer in which they welcomed the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, United opted not to splash any cash in the winter window. These players were purchased for head coach Ruben Amorim, but he was shown the door in January after a 14-month stint at the helm.",
      "Carrick has been handed the reins as interim manager and after wins against Manchester City and Arsenal, his side left it late versus Fulham but prevailed 3-2 to make it three wins from three. Away from the club, loanee Marcus Rashford is still strutting his stuff for Barcelona and a decision has reportedly been made regarding his future.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Rashford joined Barcelona over the summer and in that time he's made quite an impact under Hansi Flick. He has contributed 10 goals across all competitions.",
      "Despite this loan period being so prolific, United hero Nani still does not think Rashford measures up to one of his Blaugrana team-mates, Lamine Yamal.",
      "In a video uploaded to social media for Goal, Nani was asked to compare some of Europe's best attackers. Firstly, the Portuguese star was told to choose between Barcelona's Yamal and Chelsea starlet Estevao. He chose the former.",
      "Then, Rashford and Bukayo Saka were put to Nani for a verdict. He opted for Rashford before making a few more decisions. In the next round of picks, it was Rashford and colleague Yamal who were put side by side.",
      "Here, Nani snubbed the United loanee and said: \"Right now? Lamine Yamal.\" In fairness to Rashford, the 39-year-old went on to choose Yamal as his No. 1 out of all the players he was queried about, adding: \"He's my type of player.\"",
      "In January, Rashford's team-mate at his parent club Casemiro was subject to a stark announcement. It was revealed the Brazilian is set to depart at the end of the season upon the expiry of his contract.",
      "A goodbye video was released last month with United making it very clear that the 33-year-old will not remain at the club beyond the summer. But the Brazilian has impressed in his previous few fixtures.",
      "Casemiro will leave United at the end of this season(Image: Getty)",
      "The report claims that although fans are asking why United are letting the Brazilian go, he is one of the club's biggest earners, will soon turn 34 and United have a long-term plan in place for their midfield. All of these, they say, contribute to the club's firm stance blocking any form of U-turn regarding Casemiro and the player remaining at Old Trafford.",

      "Former Premier League referee Dermot Gallagher has offered his verdict on the controversial incident surrounding Manchester United's opening goal against Fulham. Whites manager Marco Silva criticised what he believed was an extraordinary VAR ruling to grant United a free-kick that led to their first goal during his team's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon.",
      "Referee John Brooks originally pointed to the penalty spot after Matheus Cunha went to ground following Jorge Cuenca's challenge. Replays revealed Cuenca had won the ball cleanly, but rather than completely reversing the decision, VAR suggested United should receive a free-kick on the touchline.",
      "The reason was that Brooks had awarded the penalty for a tug that occurred outside the area. Casemiro nodded home from the subsequent free-kick to break the deadlock.",
      "Silva believed the video assistant had effectively re-officiated the match, but Gallagher said: \"Straight away, I knew it wasn't a penalty.",
      "“The trajectory of the ball told me everything. There's no doubt he lets go of the shirt before they enter the penalty area. It's factually outside, so they gave a free-kick.\"",

      "Speaking after the match at Old Trafford, Silva said: “The penalty was given – it was a bad, bad, bad decision from John Brooks.",
      "“The penalty was given for the tackle of Cuenca, that was clear. Then after they found the pull three, four seconds before.",
      "“The ball went for a corner. The feedback we got on the touchline was that after the review John Brooks was going to go to the screen because in VAR’s opinion it was not a penalty and that after that comes a completely different decision, they give a free-kick for a pull.",
      "“It’s the first time this season that a penalty has been given for one incident and then a VAR decision comes from a completely different incident and gave a free-kick. It’s the first time we have seen that this season, last season, but maybe it comes more in the future.”",

The Manchester United icon is rumoured to be departing Al-Nassr, with whispers even suggesting the Portuguese superstar has gone on strike.",
      "The drama is thought to be linked to former Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema's switch from Al-Ittihad to Al-Hilal, with Ronaldo reportedly furious at Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), according to sources. The 40 year old is said to be unhappy with how PIF - which holds stakes in both Al-Nassr and Al-Hilal - facilitated such a transfer, and was notably absent from his side's victory over Al-Riyadh yesterday.",

      "Other options include a move from Al-Nassr to another league rival at 7/4, but the odds suggest a slim chance of Ronaldo retiring at 3/1. However, with just over 50 goals left to reach 1000 career goals, it seems unlikely that CR7 will bid farewell to the game anytime soon.",

      "Tyrone Marshall",
      "The challenge for whoever comes in to replace Casemiro will be dealing with the pressure of doing just that. A five-time Champions League winner, 82 caps (and counting) for Brazil and nine years at Real Madrid, he was comfortable in the Old Trafford pressure cooker from day one.",
      "I like Elliot Anderson as the most stylistically similar fit to Casemiro. He is proving his worth as a holding midfielder for England, but also has a brilliant passing range. Casemiro could do both of those jobs, shielding his back four but also progressing the ball and helping to penetrate a low block.",
      "Anderson has nowhere near the experience of Casemiro, but he is the type of character who doesn't seem to get fazed. The way he has settled into the England squad and won over Thomas Tuchel is a positive sign.",
      "Adam Wharton is a fascinating player, but also a bit of a maverick in that position. I would be fascinated to see him at an elite-level club. But I think Anderson is more likely to be successful and brings a better all-round package at the moment.",

      "The expectation to perform to a high level each week at United is completely different to playing for Nottingham Forest. Anderson has excelled for England, but in games against the likes of Wales and Latvia.",
      "Camavinga may be an ambitious target, though. There were murmurs of interest in Morten Hjulmand last summer, and perhaps he could be an option. The 26-year-old is a Denmark international and scored an equaliser against England at Euro 2024, finishing brilliantly from 30 yards to secure a point for his country in the group stage.",

      "After two goals in two games against Manchester City and Arsenal, Dorgu looked to have nailed down the spot on the left wing in Carrick's 4-2-3-1 system. The headache was Matheus Cunha, who came off the bench in both matches to register an assist and a goal.",
      "Carrick was interesting when speaking about the Brazilian at the Emirates Stadium after he scored the late winner, explaining how disappointed he had been not to start either game, but that he had channelled that frustration in the right way to make an impact off the bench.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "It was excellent man-management from the 44-year-old, but Carrick has been around the block often enough to know that it also has a shelf life. After that kind of impact as a substitute, Cunha needs the reward of a start.",
      "The problem with that is the lack of games available to United this season. In the flow of a relatively standard United season, there would have been a European game for Cunha to start between those fixtures. There would be another FA Cup tie on the horizon.",
      "Instead, there are only league fixtures, and only a couple of those are midweek rounds between now and the end of the season. After his heroics as a substitute, Cunha hadn't started for three weeks. Carrick had got a tune out of the £62.5million summer signing, but had he been benched once again for the Fulham fixture, that might have changed.",
      "It is all well and good to challenge players to make an impact off the bench, but there has to be a reward when they rise to that challenge; otherwise, it becomes hollow. There will be a feeling that no matter what you do with your limited time on the pitch, it won't be enough to earn you a start.",

      "That's why Cunha had to start against Fulham, no matter what. The injury to Dorgu, while extremely unfortunate for a player in the best form of his United career, simply opened an easy route back into the team.",
      "Keeping a squad happy will be a challenge for Carrick over the next 14 games. It might even be the biggest challenge he faces when there are just four games in February and four games in March. Rotation isn't looking likely at the moment, with a settled team delivering results.",
      "The next situation for the former United midfielder to assess is that of Benjamin Sesko, who shone in two games under Darren Fletcher but has been a substitute in all three under Carrick. The £73million striker has been on the pitch for just 25 minutes across those matches.",
      "But he delivered what Carrick believes to be a \"huge moment\" on Sunday, scoring that 94th-minute winner against Fulham. It has undoubtedly given the 22-year-old a major lift and he has four goals in his last four appearances for United.",
      "Can Carrick keep that confidence and momentum going with cameos off the bench here and there? Or does he need to reward another young player who has done what was asked of him and influenced a game from the bench?",
      "You feel it should be the latter and that's why Sesko is surely deserving of a start against Tottenham on Saturday or West Ham on Tuesday.",

      "Mainoo and Carrick after the Manchester derby victory.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo shared a Manchester United-related photo on social media for the first time in a while after the Manchester derby when posting an image of himself in the tunnel alongside Michael Carrick.",
      "\"Believe that,\" was the caption. Ruben Amorim did not believe in Mainoo, but the midfielder's performances in the last few weeks have confirmed it was criminal to overlook him.",
      "The lack of United imagery on Mainoo's Instagram may not have seemed like a big deal, but it was his way of expressing his frustration. Mainoo could not speak out against Amorim, so he sent a message by posting leisure and personal training photos, just not many of himself in United colours.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Mainoo being active for his 3.5million followers on Instagram again, revelling in wins against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham, is a sign of his delight with his improved situation.",
      "It couldn't have got much worse for Mainoo. He did not start a Premier League game under Amorim this season, dashing his hopes of playing at the World Cup, and there seemed to be no way out.",
      "United blocked Mainoo's request to leave on loan in the final week of the summer transfer window, and a new request was expected to be submitted for January. Thankfully for Mainoo, Amorim was sacked.",
      "Mainoo was determined to force his way back into the team at the start of the campaign. The academy graduate wanted to prove Amorim wrong and reviewed his lifestyle to improve. That led to him changing his private chef at home, and training with a personal coach during the international breaks.",
      "The youngster worked with a private football performance coach during the September break. \"Everyone can get faster. We can show you how,\" is the motto of the coach he worked with.",
      "During the October international break, Mainoo underwent a private warm-weather training camp in Marbella, Spain, working at the Arroyo En Medio sports complex to maintain sharpness.",
      "A close friend accompanied him on the trip and they were pictured wearing an England shirt with Mainoo's name on the back. Mainoo was highly motivated to start consistently for United again, but it's understood the aim of representing his country at the World Cup was a huge driving factor behind his determination.",
      "Mainoo warmed the bench with Amorim in charge.       (Image: AFP or licensors)",
      "However, while Mainoo trained in Marbella, England played against Wales and Latvia, games in which Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson enhanced his Three Lions credentials.",
      "Thomas Tuchel warned that Mainoo needed to start regularly with United to be considered for a recall to the England squad. He described Anderson as a \"very complete midfielder.\"",
      "Mainoo started in the Euro 2024 final against Spain. At that tournament, Gareth Southgate said England hadn't \"really had a player like him.\" Meanwhile, Anderson was a periphery squad member at Newcastle.",
      "The Stockport-born Mainoo watched his international career regress as players he was well ahead of progressed past him. He knew he needed to convince Amorim, but his chances remained limited.",
      "Amorim handed Mainoo his first start of the season against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, and United crashed out of the competition after a shocking performance at Blundell Park.",
      "The Portuguese explained that Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes for a Premier League start, but there was a watershed moment against Brentford in October when Casemiro was suspended, which seemed like the perfect opportunity to give Mainoo his first top-flight start of the campaign.",
      "Instead, Amorim selected Manuel Ugarte. Mainoo was introduced in the 66th minute of the game, and the 2,000 travelling fans at Gtech Community Stadium roared him onto the pitch.",
      "Mainoo started in the Euro 2024 final.(Image: 2024 Eurasia Sport Images)",
      "The England international was consistently overlooked by Amorim, and further cracks began to appear in December after the 1-1 draw against West Ham. \"Who is the man we have to put in the offence?\" asked Amorim in reply to a question about his conservative substitutions. \"Kobbie Mainoo,\" was the response.",
      "Amorim replaced a defender with another defender, but he laughed at the question. Mainoo confirmed he was aware when he liked a post about the press conference exchange on social media. Amorim was laughing because he was tired of Mainoo questions, however, it did not look good.",
      "Darren Fletcher put an arm around Mainoo when he was appointed as caretaker. “He seems in a good place,\" Fletcher said at his pre-match press conference ahead of Brighton. \"Kobbie doesn't give you much [indication], so you wouldn't know if he was in a good place or not so good!",
      "\"He's like that, that's his natural way. But I know him well, and I've known him for a long time, and I've seen him around the building and around different places, throughout the season. Not so much about the building, but you see people around. And I've had conversations with him, in general.",
      "\"But he's in a good place. I know Kobbie, and I think he knows me, and he knows Travis Binnion, so he’s comfortable with his environment. He's hard to read, Kobbie, so that remains to be seen.\"",
      "Carrick said Mainoo is \"quite straight-faced and doesn't give you an awful lot\" when he took over as interim head coach. Mainoo has done his talking on the pitch in Carrick's three games in charge so far.",
      "The 20-year-old covered more ground than any other United player against City and Arsenal. He was important against Fulham, making the most tackles in the game and winning six of his seven duels.",
      "Binnion's promotion to the first-team backroom staff will have been warmly welcomed by Mainoo, as Fletcher suggested. Binnion won the FA Youth Cup in 2021/22 with Mainoo at the heart of the midfield. He described him as \"brave and elite with the ball\" when he sat down with the MEN in 2023.",
      "The 39-year-old knows Mainoo better than any coach at Carrington, having worked with him at Under-18 and Under-21 level, which is bound to be helpful as he finds his feet again.",
      "Mainoo pictured against Fulham.",
      "Mainoo has benefited from the rekindling of his relationship with Casemiro. A source previously admitted that Mainoo \"loves\" playing with Casemiro, and that has been clear over the last few weeks.",
      "The feeling appears mutual with the Brazilian, who recently commented a love heart on Mainoo's social media, and the pair were spotted chest-pumping during the celebrations against Arsenal.",
      "The youngster is hungry to prove a point and will have an outside chance of making England's World Cup squad if he continues to excel, and United will revisit contract talks with his camp, which are overdue.",
      "Mainoo last signed a contract with United in 2023, meaning his role in the squad has not been fairly reflected by his wages. Although United opened talks over a new deal in 2024 and an agreement was close, negotiations stalled, Amorim was appointed, and the prospect of fresh terms was shelved.",
      "The performance-related bonuses in Mainoo's contract have been triggered, but he is among the lowest-paid players at the club. Mainoo is in line for a pay increase. He is a talent United cannot afford to lose.",

      "Jacob Devaney has moved to St Mirren",
      "Manchester United youngster Jacob Devaney sealed a move to St Mirren in the mid-season transfer window. The 18-year-old is hoping the temporary move will improve his chances of following in the footsteps of Kobbie Mainoo in progressing through the United academy and making a name for himself in the first team.",
      "The Reds Under-21 skipper joined Stephen Robinson’s side on a six-month loan. Having been mentored by Darren Fletcher in the United academy, Devaney has ambitions of becoming a Premier League star like Mainoo.",
      "Mainoo became a breakout star in 2023 when he burst out of the Old Trafford youth set-up. Now Devaney is hoping to complete that same journey himself, only via St Mirren.",
      "Asked who he admired at United, the Irish youth international said: \"In my position, Kobbie Mainoo is a great one to look up to. He's done what I want to do, which is go through the academy.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"My journey might look a bit different to his in coming here, going back and trying to break through. I like to think I back myself. I backed myself here to go in, do well and perform.",
      "\"I feel like I have that confidence to go on and push through. I've grown up a United fan so it would definitely be a dream to play for them.",
      "\"Even with the youth teams and Under-21s we get the chance to play at Old Trafford, which is something not many people can say they've done. Hopefully I can go on and do it in front of 75,000.\"",
      "Devaney revealed Fletcher had been a source of advice and inspiration, saying: \"I've worked with Darren. He came in when I was with the Under-14s or Under-15s. The career he has had at United has been amazing. Everyone speaks so highly of him in terms of his footballing ability. Again, with his coaching, we did position-specific sessions with him.",
      "\"He's a great coach to have around the building for me. Because the move happened so quickly, it was hard to ask about, but I'm sure if I did, he would have recommended it.",
      "“But John McGinn is a prime example of what is achievable here. He has gone on to Aston Villa and done great things and hopefully I can do similar.”",
      "Devaney's loan move got off to the perfect start on Tuesday night as he helped St Mirren stun league leaders Hearts less than 24 hours after completing his deadline day move. It was the United midfielder's bursting run that got Hearts captain Craig Halkett sent off for a last-man challenge.",
      "He admits the feisty encounter was a huge step up from the youth action he’s been used to in Premier League 2. \"This is the reason I came to St Mirren,\" he said. “I want to challenge myself at this level and improve my all-round game.",
      "\"I'm really proud and hopefully I can bring this into the rest of the season. It's a lot different playing here compared to playing in front of little crowds or no crowd at all.",
      "\"The football is different but I've had experience of it in the EFL Trophy games. I really enjoyed the challenge and hopefully I can kick on from now. United told me they just want me to get used to the style of football. I'm used to very possession-based football.",
      "\"Going into games, we might try and dominate the ball but there may be times where we have to concede having the ball. They just told me to enjoy the challenge and bring the things that I've learned back in the summer, and I'll be a better player for it.",
      "“They last two days before the game have been long! I was up at five o'clock on Monday morning driving up. I think that's why I was cramping up before I came off. I've really enjoyed it and everyone has been very welcoming towards me. It's a great set of lads.\"",

      "While the January transfer window may have come and gone, talk over potential comings and goings at Manchester United continues as eyes turn to the summer window.",
      "The mid-season window was a relatively quiet one for United with no significant incomings or outgoings. United did try to sign Antoine Semenyo, but were beaten by rivals Manchester City, while some young players did complete loan moves away from the club.",
      "Instead, concentration is expected to be on some changes in the summer window, with midfield in particular an area that is expected to be strengthened. United have been heavily linked with interest in Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "Over January, there was also speculation over Chelsea midfielder Cole Palmer, who grew up as a United fan. Reports suggest that the England international is suffering from homesickness, although that has been denied by manager Liam Rosenior.",
      "In terms of outgoings, the summer will see Casemiro leave the club, while Barcelona could make their loan move for Marcus Rashford permanent. Striker Rasmus Hojlund, on loan at Napoli is in a similar situation.",

      "“After I met him, he helped me a lot, going through a lot of scenarios here at the club. And even in that moment, he helped me.",

      "Michael Carrick takes a hands-on role in Manchester United training",
      "Manchester United trained at Carrington on Wednesday as they stepped up preparations for Saturday's Premier League fixture against Tottenham, when Michael Carrick will try and make it four wins in a row to start his tenure. Carrick has overseen wins against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham to move United into fourth and the visit of Thomas Frank's Spurs represents a chance to solidify their top-four status.",
      "There was no sign of Matthijs de Ligt or Mason Mount during the session, while Patrick Dorgu remains a long-term absentee. JJ Gabriel, 15, was one of five academy players involved, along with Yuel Helafu, Jack and Tyler Fletcher and Jack Moorhouse.",
      "This is what we spotted from the part of the session that was broadcast by United's official channels.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "Carrick's central role",
      "Anyone who spent time watching any part of Ruben Amorim's sessions can't fail to notice the difference between the Portuguese head coach and Carrick. Amorim would often observe parts of training from a distance, usually letting his coaching staff set up drills, and only getting involved to add weight to a message.",
      "Carrick is a modern, hands-on coach, and although he is in charge, he is also leading much of the training. After a warm-up, he set up a reasonably complicated passing drill and spent time getting it right before explaining it to the players himself.",
      "The 44-year-old led the group huddle before it began, then walked through the plan for the drill himself, explaining each part in detail to players and using some of them to show where they should be passing the ball and where they should be moving.",
      "It is clear that Carrick is very much a training-ground coach.",
      "Passing plan is clear",
      "The passing drill saw players exchanging short, sharp passes before moving on to the next station and carrying the ball down the pitch. It all looked pretty slick.",
      "MUTV pundit Danny Simpson noted that much of what he saw on the grass at Carrington this morning was similar to what he had seen in the three games so far, which is evidence that the message is getting through.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Simpson revealed that after the cameras had gone off, there was an attack vs defence drill, with the group split into three teams and the fast-paced match played between the 18-yard boxes at either end of the pitch. It was another focus on keeping the ball under pressure, and we have seen United do just that under Carrick so far.",
      "Carrick's pleased",
      "Simpson had spoken to former teammates Carrick and Jonny Evans before training began and revealed that the head coach had praised the players' togetherness and work rate over the last three weeks.",
      "As an example of the former, he highlighted Joshua Zirkzee's reaction to Benjamin Sesko's injury-time winner against Fulham, even though the Slovenian's goal will likely make it harder for Zirkzee to get a game.",
      "Evans and Casemiro chat",
      "All of Carrick's coaching staff were out on the grass and involved with the players, and it was interesting to see Evans having a one-on-one chat with Casemiro at one point.",
      "Evans is the member of staff with the most recent playing experience, and he only hung up his boots last summer, so not only can he relate to the squad, but he has played with and knows most of them as well.",
      "Moorhouse's role",
      "JJ Gabriel's inclusion in first-team training for the second day in a row was the headline news for the academy, along with a call-up for 17-year-old Yuel Helafu, but it was interesting to see Jack Moorhouse involved.",
      "The 20-year-old only returned to the club from Leyton Orient late on deadline day, with concerns raised about his game time in the second half of the season as the League One club head for a relegation battle.",
      "Moorhouse gained valuable experience in playing 24 games for Leyton Orient and with numbers a little short in midfield at United, he could jump the queue ahead of Jack Fletcher for first-team involvement between now and the end of the season.",

      "Manchester United have been sent a transfer message about Tottenham star Micky van de Ven(Image: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have been told why they could have a chance of signing Tottenham Hotspur defender Micky van de Ven this summer. United had a quiet January transfer window with no new signings arriving at Old Trafford, but it could be a different story in the summer.",
      "Ruben Amorim left the club at the start of January and was subsequently replaced by Michael Carrick, who was named as United's interim head coach until the end of the season.",
      "It remains to be seen what plans United will have for the summer transfer window, and the Reds have already been linked with a host of potential targets, particularly in midfield.",
      "However, former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood has argued why Van de Ven, a centre-back, could be a player of interest to United in the summer, reports the Liverpool Echo.",
      "Speaking to CasinoStugan, Tim Sherwood suggested Van de Ven's Spurss future hinges on his fitness record, while also explaining why United may not be alone in showing an interest in the defender.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"If he proves his fitness, I think there will be a queue around the block for him,\" Sherwood said. \"Hopefully Tottenham can keep hold of him but you know what it's like when a player decides he wants to leave. Unfortunately, if you don't let him go, you're left without the money and the player in the end.",
      "\"People may be shocked by that but it all depends on who they have as manager in the summer because they've got it wrong so many times before and it looks like they have got it right at the moment.",
      "\"United are a club that can go from where they have been to the top quicker than most because they've got the brand power, the money to do it. They can pay the big wages for the big players.",
      "\"They missed the boat before. They could have signed Declan Rice and Harry Kane. Instead, they ended up with seven or eight signings who were alright but mostly very poor.",
      "\"They won't want to miss the boat this time on Van de Ven. He will certainly be at the top of a lot of lists at any number of clubs and Tottenham will have to fight tooth and nail to keep hold of him.",
      "\"I think the only real way they keep hold of him is if Micky [Van de Ven] decides that there might be a bright future ahead at Tottenham, and right now they're down in 14th in the Premier League and out of the running for the two domestic cups. They're flying high in the Champions League but there are stiffer tests to come in that competition.\"",
      "Sherwood went on to explain why United's bitter rivals, Liverpool, could be another club who have an interest in signing Van de Ven. This is despite the Anfield club agreeing a £60million deal with Rennes for centre-back Jeremy Jacquet on deadline day.",
      "\"Is Micky van de Ven to Liverpool off? All Micky has got to do is to prove his fitness between now and the end of the season but that will make it very difficult for Tottenham,\" Sherwood said.",
      "\"Van de Ven is what I call a hierarchy player, players who when they are fit, they will play. They are the players that fans crave, and Tottenham fans want those top players like Harry Kane.",
      "\"When he was fit, you knew he was playing, and they've only got one of those players at the moment and that's Micky van de Ven. If he's fit, he plays. Other than him, Tottenham's players are all a much of a muchness.",
      "\"I think Tottenham have got more chance of keeping Micky van de Ven than they have of bringing in another one of these players. That is the issue.\"",

      "United will hope to sell Marcus Rashford this summer",
      "The January transfer window went as expected for Manchester United, who resisted the temptation to make any short-term moves for a season that has just 14 games left to run. Maybe there is an element of risk to that, but if the squad stays fit, they have proven recently that the quality is there to secure Champions League football.",
      "Three successive victories under Michael Carrick have moved United into fourth and the gap to Manchester City and Aston Villa has closed. The January gamble will pay off if things continue as they are.",
      "The long-term approach to transfers will set up a busy summer, when an overhaul in midfield will be the priority, but other positions could also be targeted, including left-wing, goalkeeper and possibly defence. Several players will be heading for the exit door.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "If United do secure a return to the Champions League, it will provide a significant boost to their revenues after a season without any European football and two early cup exits. A campaign of just 20 fixtures at Old Trafford will hurt the balance sheet, so a guarantee of what should really be at least five extra home games in Europe will be welcome.",
      "That should allow United to be a little more aggressive in the summer window, but their approach could also be dictated by departures and the kind of money made from exits. Casemiro's departure will free up significant room on the wage bill, and if Harry Maguire also leaves, that will be around £550,000-a-week in savings.",
      "Then there are sales and there are three obvious candidates to leave. Andre Onana, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund are all out on loan this season and the latter two have options to make that permanent as well.",
      "Hojlund's deal will see his move to Napoli become permanent for £38million if the reigning Serie A champions qualify for the Champions League, which is touch-and-go at the moment. Even if they don't, they are likely to try to keep him but will look to negotiate the fee.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Barcelona can make Rashford's loan move permanent for £30million but their financial difficulties could yet be an issue. The 28-year-old has been a success at the Nou Camp and wants to stay, while the Catalan giants want to keep him, but there could be some negotiation and for the forward to accept a pay cut.",
      "Onana might be a more difficult deal. There is no option in his last-minute loan move to Trabzonspor, although the 29-year-old has had a solid enough season in Turkey and has hopefully done enough to drum up some interest.",
      "The form of Senne Lammens has made it clear that Onana's days at United are over. He doesn't want to be a back-up goalkeeper, and he is paid too handsomely to fulfil that role as well, so finding a buyer will be the target.",
      "United's aim will be to secure deals for all three first-teamers currently out on loan as soon as possible. In a best-case scenario, there is potentially £100m in sales to be had there, although that might be difficult to pull off.",
      "In a window where United will be looking to strengthen the squad, that could be a substantial bonus, however, and a brilliant start to the window.",

      "United were busy in the loan market.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Seville and Rotherham were options for Manchester United youngster Gabriele Biancheri in the January transfer window, so you may be surprised to learn he relocated to South Yorkshire on deadline day.",
      "The coal-mining town won, despite being pitted against one of Spain's most picturesque cities. Biancheri will spend the next few months on loan at Rotherham, whereas Real Betis submitted a permanent bid for the youngster to join their B team, with a view to promoting him to their senior side.",
      "United rejected the bid from Betis and arranged for Biancheri to move to the New York Stadium. The forward's contract at Old Trafford expires in 2027, meaning there is still time for his value to increase.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Biancheri has not made the headlines that his peers in the academy may have produced over the last few seasons, but his goalscoring record is impressive: 42 goals in 82 United youth games.",
      "Biancheri has represented Wales throughout the age groups, but his heritage caught the attention of Canada, who called him up to their senior squad last summer. Cardiff-born Biancheri is eligible to represent the nations of his father (Italy) and his mother (Canada), as well as his birthplace (Wales).",
      "United hope Biancheri can continue to score goals for Rotherham. His size could be a sticking point in the football league, but his movement is a strength, and you don't need to be 6ft to succeed.",
      "It feels unlikely that Biancerhi will make a first-team debut at United, though. The best-case scenario may be that he continues to develop, improve and command a decent transfer fee when he is sold.",
      "Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is tasked with generating more revenue from sales of young players. Nick Cox raised more than £100million during his time in charge, but it has been identified as an area for improvement.",
      "Torpey helped Manchester City become one of the best exporters of academy players during his time in the blue half of Manchester. He is now trying to do the same job at Carrington.",
      "The academy's priority is to produce young players for the first team, but the reality is that most will not make a senior debut. United need to obtain higher fees for the academy players they sell, and arranging positive loans with these players will be key to doing so.",
      "Biancheri has a good record in front of goal.(Image: 2025 Manchester United FC)",
      "That is important context when looking at United's loan departures in the winter window. United loaned out six players, including Biancheri, most of whose futures will probably lie away from the club.",
      "Ethan Wheatley was recalled from his loan with Northampton. United sources confirmed the club wanted to pursue \"an alternative development opportunity\", and he was sent to Bradford City on deadline day.",
      "It was an interesting move. Wheatley made 20 league starts for Northampton and contributed three goals and four assists during his stint. United were pleased with his loan but still decided to recall him.",
      "In the past, game time for young players on loan was the priority, so it initially seemed strange that Wheatley was recalled. The young striker has joined Bradford, though, who are challenging for promotion in League One. In comparison, Northampton are trying to avoid relegation from that division.",
      "Wheatley has made a step up, joining a better team in the third tier, and he will gain valuable experience of being in a promotion-chasing dressing room, but he may not play as much.",
      "There is a possibility that Wheatley starts each game and fires Bradford to promotion, which would do him the world of good, however, it will be tougher for him to force his way into a better team.",
      "From the outside, it seems like United have recalled Wheatley from a club that could be relegated to send him to a promotion-chasing team. United believe that it's logical to send forwards somewhere they will receive more chances in front of the goal. Perhaps there is a bit of truth in both.",
      "United were happy with Wheatley at Northampton.(Image: 2025 Getty Images)",
      "James Scanlon is another player who United should eventually be able to sell for a reasonable fee. Scanlon joined Swindon Town on loan on deadline day and will try to help them secure a play-off spot.",
      "The 19-year-old missed out on a move in the summer window. Scanlon has outgrown academy football and needed a fresh challenge, so it was a no-brainer to arrange a loan for him.",
      "Scanlon was born in the Midlands but represents Gibraltar on the international stage, and he scored a brilliant goal against the Faroe Islands in a World Cup qualifier last summer. His mature performances for Gibraltar against senior opposition have only enhanced his market value.",
      "The winger scored a hat-trick in front of Michael Carrick at Leigh Sports Village a week before leaving United on loan, and he will be relishing the chance to get a first taste of playing in the English pyramid.",
      "Scanlon will be managed by former Crystal Palace and Blackpool boss Ian Holloway, who is known for his quirks and colourful personality. Scanlon should at least not be bored during his time in Swindon.",
      "Jacob Devaney joined St. Mirren on deadline day. The youngster was born in Barnsley but has represented Ireland's youth national teams. In November, Devaney started for Ireland's U21s as they played against England in an Euro U21 qualifying fixture. He was one of the standout performers for his nation against the likes of Jobe Bellingham, Lewis Hall, Rico Lewis and Jamie Gittens.",
      "Devaney should receive regular game time in the Scottish Premiership, and it's understood the plan had always been for him to leave on loan, despite the move only happening on the final day.",
      "Toby Collyer and Harry Amass spent the first half of the season on loan with West Brom and Sheffield Wednesday respectively. Collyer will see out the campaign with Hull City, and Amass with Norwich City.",
      "Both players have made first-team appearances for United, so their situations differ from those of the other players sent on loan. They could both have long-term futures at Old Trafford.",
      "Collyer is hoping to start consistently for Hull as they look to push for a Championship play-off place, however, Amass picked up a hamstring injury after his arrival and is facing a stint on the sidelines.",
      "Amass enjoyed his time at Sheffield Wednesday. He won successive club player of the month awards, but United were essentially paying for Amass to play due to the Owls' financial problems.",
      "Finally, the loan deal that went under the radar was Jack Moorhouse's recall from Leyton Orient, who agreed with United to send Moorhouse back earlier than expected because they are fighting relegation.",
      "Orient felt Moorhouse's game time could be limited as they attempt to maintain their third-tier status. Their openness about the situation will help them land young players from United in the future.",

      "Carrick has taken over as interim manager and following victories against Manchester City and Arsenal, his team secured a dramatic 3-2 triumph over Fulham to maintain a perfect record of three wins from three.

      "Despite such a productive loan spell, United legend Nani still believes Rashford doesn't measure up to one of his Blaugrana team-mates, Lamine Yamal. In a video posted on social media for Goal, Nani was asked to compare some of Europe's leading attackers.",
      "Initially, the Portuguese icon was asked to choose between Barcelona's Yamal and Chelsea prospect Estevao. He selected the former. Next, Rashford and Bukayo Saka were presented to Nani for his judgement. He picked Rashford before making several other choices.",
      "In the following round, it was Rashford alongside team-mate Yamal who were compared. At this point, Nani overlooked the United loanee and said: \"Right now? Lamine Yamal.\" To be fair to Rashford, the 39-year-old went on to select Yamal as his top choice from all the players he was asked about, adding: \"He's my type of player.\"",

      "\"I think Paul [Pogba] had a shot that clipped the post and this was all at 0-0. Once they got the first goal, the crowd was different. Every time [Lionel] Messi got on the ball it was daunting and the crowd were shouting to make the backline nervous. It was all a mess after they scored the first goal.\"",
      "Rashford played for Manchester United at Camp Nou in 2019(Image: Enric Fontcuberta/EPA-EFE/REX)",
      "Barcelona and Manchester United faced off in the 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals but haven't met in the competition since that 2019 clash. Camp Nou was also the venue for United's famous 1999 final victory over Bayern Munich - the last time the winners were crowned in Catalunya.",
      "Rashford could soon get the chance not just to play a final at a stadium he admires but to do so as a Barcelona player. That would require Camp Nou to be awarded that 2029 final, while the player himself would need to do enough between now and the end of the season to earn a permanent transfer.",
      "He also set his sights high when moving to the club and was asked about the Champions League after Barca reached the semis last year. A fifth-place finish in the league phase has sent them straight through to the round of 16 where they will meet Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain, Newcastle United or Qarabag.",
      "\"It is what the club was fighting for last year and they were very close and I hope they can take the next step this year,\" Rashford said when he joined. \"This is a historic club and they are known for winning the biggest prizes. I am here to help the club do that. It is a dream of mine for sure.\"",
      "The 28-year-old has 10 goals and 13 assists so far during his loan spell, setting up a Ronald Araujo goal during a midweek Copa del Rey win away at Albacete. He was also on target in a victory over Elche on Saturday, earning praise from manager Hansi Flick, with Barca set to make a summer decision on whether to exercise a £26million permanent option for their loanee.",
      "\"I think he has a lot of potential to show,\" Flick said after the Elche win. \"We always focus on goals, the final pass, because this is one of the ways you can measure things, and he’s doing well in that regard.",
      "\"There’s always room for improvement. But with his speed and technique, he can give us so much more. I’m delighted with what he’s giving us, but he has much more potential. I want everyone to be at their best.",
      "\"It’s about mentality, attitude during training… That’s what we want to see. Always striving to be better.\"",

      "Lammens is enjoying an underrated first season.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "Senne Lammens was pictured alongside his partner leaving The Ivy in Spinningfields after beating Fulham. The understated Lammens almost looked embarrassed to be photographed by the paparazzi.",
      "Lammens is having an underrated debut season in Manchester. The goalkeeper has brought calm and stability, transmitting confidence when his predecessors had made Old Trafford uneasy.",
      "The 23-year-old made his debut in the 2-0 win against Sunderland in October, and fans celebrated Lammens claiming a cross into the box like a goal. That reaction was a statement from matchgoers, who had become exhausted watching Andre Onana, and then Altay Bayindir.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The bar was low for Lammens to make a strong impression, but the ease with which he's adapted to the Premier League, having come from the Belgian top-flight, has been impressive. There have been times when Lammens should have done better. Danny Welbeck's free-kick for Brighton in October and Kieran Dewsbury's goal for Everton in November were both saveable, but that is nitpicking. There have been no major errors, no blunders that have cost United a game.",
      "Lammens consistently delivers 7/10 performances, with the odd excellent display chucked in for good measure. The Belgian's demeanour has helped him remain unfazed in one of the most scrutinised No.1 roles in the world. He was happy to speak in the mixed zone after the win over Liverpool at Anfield, and he spoke again after the victory at Arsenal. On both occasions, he took the initiative to speak to reporters.",
      "Some players ignore requests for a chat as they leave grounds on matchdays, which is their prerogative, but Lammens has thought 'why not' after two big wins. He seems like a good egg, someone impossible not to get along with.",
      "\"I try to keep my best friends and family close. The rest is a bit like outside noise. It's all praise, I know, and I'm realistic, if it does not go so well, it will be all bad commentary,\" he reflected at Anfield.",
      "The ability to remain level-headed after wins and defeats is a common trait shared by the most successful professionals. Lammens celebrated the Liverpool win by spending the evening with a close friend.",
      "It's been a breath of fresh air to have a reliable goalkeeper between the sticks. Lammens was a data-driven signing, and the data boffins in Michael Sansoni's department will be delighted with his start at United.",
      "Gyoekeres takes a shot against Lammens.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "But United have another goalkeeper on the books who is ready to challenge Lammens. Radek Vitek is enjoying a wonderful season on loan in the Championship, where United send young players who they believe have potential to feature for the first-team.",
      "Vitek is thriving with Bristol City and he made a save of the season contender against Ipswich Town last month, instinctively stretching a hand to tip the ball over the crossbar when he was on the ground.",
      "Vitek's highlights reel will be worth a watch at the end of the campaign. He's produced a handful of top saves, but he's not just stopping shots for the cameras - he's delivering consistently.",
      "United are delighted with how Vitek's loan spell at Ashton Gate is unfolding. He has made 25 starts in the Championship - he missed five games due to a small knee injury - and looks destined for bigger things.",
      "In November, Vitek said: \"It would be a dream to play for Manchester United, but I will take it game by game, and I know there's a big challenge in front of me, but I want to improve every week.\"",
      "Vitek delivered a man-of-the-match performance in United's opening pre-season friendly against Rosenborg in 2024, but he didn't join last summer's tour of the United States because he was due to leave on loan.",
      "It would be a surprise if Vitek isn't assessed in pre-season this summer. Lammens has made a superb impact, but Vitek has earned the opportunity to be considered to challenge for the No.1 role.",
      "Vitek is ready for another step up.(Image: 2025 CameraSport)",
      "How United's goalkeeper situation will develop remains to be seen. Vitek would be a superb second choice and great competition for Lammens, but would a talented 22-year-old settle for a No.2 role? It seems unlikely. Vitek will be hungry to play every week after such a successful loan spell.",
      "He's had previous loan spells with Accrington Stanley and FC Blau-Weiß Linz, so it would be a shock for him to be happy to play in cup competitions for United, with a view to challenging Lammens.",
      "The Czech knows what it's like to fight for points each week and won't be short of interest from Europe in the summer. He will feel he can succeed elsewhere if he's seen a No.2 in Manchester.",
      "\"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them,\" Vitek said a few months ago.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything. Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day, but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
      "Vitek's challenge for the No.1 role may be short-lived, but United are in a strong position with their goalkeeper choice this summer. That couldn't be said at the start of last summer with Onana and Bayindir.",

      "United had a quiet transfer window.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“Never say never,\" Michael Carrick said when asked if Manchester United could complete any deals on transfer deadline day. January is usually a quiet month at Old Trafford - and not much has gone on again.",
      "United have not made a signing and there have been no departures from the first-team squad. The most exciting United-related transfer story, interest in Antoine Semenyo, was effectively put to bed before the window opened.",
      "The £62.5million needed to release Semenyo from his Bournemouth contract was bound to be met and Manchester City won the race for his signature. Semenyo ticked a lot of boxes at United and would have been a great addition, but the club did not react by turning to alternatives that weren't quite right.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The message from United sources after missing out on Semenyo was consistent: United were unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets were not expected to be available in the winter window. That's not what fans have wanted to hear, though.",
      "Semenyo has scored four goals in five games for City. He is one of the most in-form forwards in the Premier League and would have provided a huge boost in the pursuit of Champions League football.",
      "Carrick has made a dream start to his interim role, winning three games on the bounce, a run that has seen United climb to fourth. The Reds are just 12 points adrift of Arsenal, despite the possibility of being dragged into the bottom half being touted in the final weeks of Ruben Amorim's tenure.",
      "Amorim's sacking did not change much regarding transfers in the window. United had a plan and they have stuck by it. They have not acted because long-term targets were not available.",
      "Semenyo was on the losing side at Old Trafford two weeks ago.(Image: 2026 Allstar)",
      "Carrick revealed at a press conference that he would be consulted on summer plans, though. When asked whether his opinion would be sought on a new midfield signing to replace Casemiro, Carrick said: \"I'm certainly in this position to do that. And as I said, I think, making decisions for the club moving forward, whatever that may be, I'm fully committed to that.",
      "\"Naturally, as a midfielder, then there's a big tendency towards that anyway, but taking that away from it and now being where I am in the position I am, certainly would be part of those conversations and moving forward because it's important when we get the next steps right in terms of moving forward as a team and there's a squad and putting the right things in place. So yeah, I'll be part of that in the right way.\"",
      "Casemiro announcing that he would leave at the end of the season has been one of the biggest headlines. The Brazilian wanted to avoid speculation about his future during the remainder of the season, and his representatives can engage with potential suitors now that confirmation is out.",
      "The announcement was classy, befitting of a player who has enjoyed a magnificent career, and Casemiro will try to bow out by steering the club back into the Champions League.",
      "United splashed £215million in the summer window and were not in a position to sign a Casemiro replacement, who could cost in the region of £100million, in the winter window.",
      "Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are all admired by United, but they will not be prised away cheaply from their respective clubs. It will be fascinating to see how the summer window unfolds.",
      "Although Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee were marked down for possible loan exits, they will continue to contribute at United for the remainder of the season. Mainoo's situation has improved since Carrick's appointment. The youngster was hopeful of leaving on loan before Amorim was sacked.",
      "Roma were interested in signing Zirkzee, but United did not seriously entertain their enquiry. \"United said no quite clearly a couple of weeks ago, and they have not changed their minds,\" said Roma's football director.",
      "Tyrell Malacia was ready to travel to Turkey on deadline day, but the plug was pulled on his move to the Super Lig by Jason Wilcox, who decided Malacia was needed at United after Patrick Dorgu's injury.",
      "Wilcox told Malacia on Monday morning that he would be needed as part of the first-team squad for the rest of the season. The Dutchman will be frustrated at missing out on a move away again.",
      "Casemiro scored against Fulham on Sunday.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "The MEN were the first to report Rhys Bennett's move to Fleetwood Town, while Joe Hugill is the only other academy export to have left the club on a permanent transfer in the window.",
      "United have banked nominal fees for Mather, Bennett and Hugill, but the club have started to insist on inserting sell-on clauses to benefit from future success. The challenge for Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is to start obtaining higher transfer fees for youngsters when they leave.",
      "Torpey has overseen the club's loan deals since Jonny Evans stepped back from his role as head of loans and pathways in December. Sources with knowledge of the situation indicated the pace of the role was too slow for Evans.",
      "There were loan departures confirmed on deadline day. Ethan Wheatley's move to Bradford City was formally announced, while James Scanlon and Jacob Devaney joined Swindon Town and St. Mirren respectively for their first taste of senior football.",
      "There is no rush to confirm Sekou Kone's move to Lausanne-Sport because the Swiss transfer window shuts on February 15 - the expectation is that Kone will stay with Lausanne-Sport for the second half of the campaign.",
      "Academy transfer activity was as exciting as it got in the final hours of the window.",

      "Ronaldo, who celebrates his 41st birthday on Thursday, declined to feature for Al-Nassr in their 1-0 win against Al-Riyadh on Monday after becoming incensed by Karim Benzema's transfer to title challengers Al-Hilal. Benzema, Ronaldo's former Real Madrid colleague, had his Al-Ittihad deal cancelled before securing a free transfer to Al-Hilal, who sit one point clear of Al-Nassr at the top of the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The Public Investment Fund (PIF) owns all three sides, and Ronaldo is frustrated that the transfer was approved, believing the acquisition of the French forward has unfairly strengthened Al-Hilal's championship challenge. The circumstances have triggered questions about whether Ronaldo will complete the remaining 18 months of his £488,000-per-day agreement with Al-Nassr.",
      "Could the five-time Ballon d'Or recipient make a remarkable third return to Manchester United? Not according to his former colleague, Wes Brown, who told BettingLounge: \"He's not happy, but would Cristiano Ronaldo come back to Manchester United for a third go? I would say no.

It's a shock to everyone to see Ronaldo on strike, but I honestly think it will get resolved. We'll have to wait and see where it goes from here.\"",
      "Neither Ronaldo nor any of his teammates and coaching staff have issued public statements following Monday's victory. Head coach Jorge Jesus had his post-match press conference cancelled, with the squad told not to engage with journalists.",

      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",

      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",

      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "Have INEOS stumbled into a potentially very bright future for Manchester Utd? Or did Wilcox and co. learn their lesson about letting an inexperienced manager bring in an equally inexperienced staff and instead, through their own connections and discussions with Carrick, put together their ideal team, a balanced mix of experience and youth with genuine ties to the club and national team?",
      "With every top-level manager insisting on bringing his own team, the cost goes up and the club ties disappear, while the risk barely drops and the hope barely rises. That type of appointment also seems to contradict the board’s long-term plan. From the beginning, they talked about a unified, cooperative structure that brings back the so-called “United DNA”: get results, improve players, connect with the fan base, promote young coaches and local players, all built on hard work and technical quality.",
      "All of INEOS’s decisions so far have been made with an eye on the future, with a transfer and manager policy of buy younger and develop over time. Handing control back to a bigger name would contradict that. The gamble also then becomes whether that big name eventually cedes some control or doubles down, potentially leaving us right back where we were with Amorim. Of course, if Carrick were to stumble across the finish line instead, it might be the only option left.",
      "Timing is often the missing ingredient when chasing success. Wilcox and Barrada were labelled inexperienced but highly rated. Is this recent upsurge ability or luck?",
      "Their transfer policy of “no dickheads” seems to be paying off. The squad looks better, happier and harder working. New leaders are emerging and old ones are reasserting themselves. We’re hearing stories of players like Dorgu staying behind after training, Sesko and Cunha taking recovery more seriously, and players generally looking after themselves better. Compare that to the missed sessions, nights out and late-night Xbox marathons of the last few years and it’s night and day.",
      "That’s why I hope there’s a pinch of salt to the Rashford return stories. As much as the romantic in me likes the prodigal son narrative, it probably makes more sense to shake hands and move on.",
      "But football is about romance. Isn’t that why we’d want Carrick to take the job full time? Not out of sentiment alone, but because if he earns it with a second or third place finish, it means something special has happened. Another big-name appointment might do fine, but when did we become so hardened that we’re scared of getting carried away by something potentially lovely?",
      "Speaking of lovely: Kobbie Mainoo. This surely has to all lead to him becoming club captain when Bruno eventually leaves. He’s a one-off. Young, talented, academy developed. He’s overcome adversity and disappointment to establish himself as the leader in midfield. Tough year, head down, took his chance. Never bitched or moaned once. His simple brother did, but you can’t be surprised by simple people doing simple things.",
      "Before that though, hang on to Bruno for another four or five years. Man’s a genius. The usual criticism is that he disrupts shape with his one-man heroics and needs more discipline. But his game has never been about speed, it’s about speed of thought. As his legs naturally slow, he’ll be forced to be stricter positionally. And as the team around him becomes more structured, with a younger, fitter Casemiro replacement behind him, and Kobbie continuing to develop, we might actually see an even better version of Fernandes.",
      "With Mbeumo now starting as a 9 and more goals coming from the supporting cast, we’re finally affording Sesko the time and support Højlund was never given. We criticised the club for asking a young, unproven striker to shoulder the burden alone. Now Sesko can come off the bench full of beans this season, then feature more next year when the games stack up, allowing him to develop properly. Regardless of the price tag, this is how you treat a 22-year-old new to the league.",

      "– They ARE dull to watch. Hugely effective, very strong defensively, but just not exciting for neutrals. Winning is of course the name of the game, and it brings its own buzz for their fans, but you can be successful without setting pulses racing. That’s the case with Arsenal this season, and that’s fine. Plenty of previous league winners have been similarly solid. Their fans are right not to particularly care how they go about ending a title famine of 20+ years.",
      "– Comparisons to Liverpool’s stroll last season are also pretty valid, in the sense that none of the other contenders are performing at the level they would have expected. City are horribly inconsistent compared to previous seasons. Liverpool, Chelsea and United are all some combination of work in progress/shambles/regression. Villa lack depth, largely thanks to PSR. Arsenal have so far taken advantage of all that, very similar to Liverpool’s serene run last season. It doesn’t mean it’s a terrible league, or that they’d be bad champions, but the margin for error is far higher than they could have anticipated.",
      "– If they fail to get over the line, it will be objectively hilarious for everyone else. Arteta’s cartoonish intensity rubs a lot of fans up the wrong way, which I think Arsenal fans probably understand. The players sometimes mirror it too – he has them wound up like springs, hence some of the insane celebrations we’ve seen from them in the past.",
      "The derogatory narratives have of course been set in stone by rival fan groups, getting their rationalisations for their own teams’ failure prepared nice and early. “They won it by playing crap football”, “It was handed to them”, “They had to win it sooner or later by the law of averages”, etc. It must be fantastic for level-headed Arsenal fans to recognise that this all stems from the increasing likelihood of them making it over the line in the next few months.",
      "They are still pretty shit to watch, mind. Who wants to win a league like that, eh???\nKeith Reilly",

      "If Arsenal win the league I think we will see the best football under Arteta NEXT season.",
      "Arteta knows the pressure is on this season to win something hence the pragmatical and stifling football in the league this season to ensure we try and get over the line.",
      "People forget what he did when he first came into Arsenal. He played with a back 5, ensured we were difficult to beat and got Aubamayang to score the goals that led to an FA cup win. He was more George Graham (or Mourinho) than the Pep everyone though he would be.",
      "Over the years he gently evolved the team to be more Pep. Unfortunately due to a lack of squad depth he was unable to get over the line (while still punching above his weight in my view).",
      "This season the squad has been beefed up to cope and he has realised he needs to play to what they are best at – Defensive solidity. Any Arsenal fan under the later Wenger years watched Arsenal between fingers knowing they could concede at any time, particularly against the big teams. That anxiety is gone under Arteta. Only replaced with the cautious anxiety of trying to win games to be champions.",
      "But one thing I have noticed is that Arteta has an ego. He likes being lauded by foreign coaches for Arsenal’s displays in Europe. He will not enjoy any boring tag associated with his team. He knows it has to be this way for now. However, once the pressure is off. The ego in him will demand a more expansive playing style which he will aim to deliver now he has the squad and hopefully the confidence of Champions.\nMichael O, Chingford",

      "The truth is last night was men against boys. Like the big lad in an 80s film we held our arm outstretched on the little boy’s forehead while he swung his arms wildly and hit nothing. Chelsea are the biggest spenders in the league and still only look like top four material at best. They’re also completely unlikeable imo but at least that’s on-brand for Chelsea.",

      "Elliot Anderson is undoubtedly one of the busiest central midfielders in the Premier League – but how do his grades compare with the best in class?",
      "Manchester United are said to have identified Anderson as their top summer target as they prepare to wave off Casemiro, leaving a gaping void in their midfield.",
      "The Red Devils have scoured the league and appreciate the work of two others in particular, but Anderson is reportedly the player they want.",
      "So how does the Nottingham Forest star compare with his contemporaries?",
      "Across a vast range of metrics, football data analysts Gradient Sports grade every player out of 100, measuring execution and outcome to offer the most insightful and accurate view of individual performance.",
      "Anderson’s basic numbers look impressive, his prominence and energy helping him pass the eye test with flying colours. But, in context, the stats suggest the 23-year-old doesn’t stand out in any specific area. Are United in danger of being dazzled by Anderson’s all-action nature?",
      "Here is how the England international’s relevant grades compare to the Premier League’s best in his position…",
      "",
      "1) Bruno Guimaraes – 95.3\n2) Moises Caicedo – 89.8\n3) Alex Iwobi – 89.4\n4) Adam Wharton – 89.3\n5) Enzo Fernandez – 88\n…11) Elliot Anderson – 87.1",
      "Anderson’s grade may not be good enough to make the top 10 but no central midfielder has attempted more passes (1565) or completed more passes this season. Martin Zubimendi is the next highest in both metrics and 164 behind Anderson for passes attempted and 114 behind for passes completed. But the grades capture both the detail of any pass (accuracy, pace, trajectory) and tactical intent, putting Bruno Guimaraes way ahead of the rest of the field.",
      "",
      "1) Adam Wharton – 91.7\n2) Moises Caicedo – 91.6\n3) Bruno Guimaraes – 91\n4) Enzo Fernandez – 89.7\n5) Elliot Anderson – 88.9",
      "The raw data highlights Anderson’s involvement, with no player completing more pressured passes than the England midfielder’s 822, while Guimaraes is the next closest 122 behind. Across the Premier League, no one can touch a Manchester City star here.",
      "1) Mikkel Damsgaard – 86.4\n2) John McGinn – 85.3\n3) Enzo Fernandez – 84.9\n4) Sander Berge – 84.4\n5) Bruno Guimaraes – 82.9\n…29) Elliot Anderson – 71.2",
      "Again, Anderson leads all central midfielders in the Premier League for line-breaking passes but much of his work comes from deep. Over half of the line-breaking passes attempted by Anderson are intended to break the opposition’s midfield lines, while 10% attempt to play through defensive lines. Which is fine for United if Anderson is finding Bruno Fernandes.",
      "",
      "1) Adam Wharton – 92.9\n2) Bruno Guimaraes – 90.1\n3) Alex Iwobi – 86.1\n4) Mateus Fernandes – 84.7\n5) Nico Gonzalez – 82.7\n…15) Elliot Anderson – 77.7",
      "In this metric, Anderson is operating around the same level as Declan Rice, attempting and completing similar numbers to the Arsenal captain. This is another field, though, of which Bruno Fernandes is the king, with Jordan Henderson and Adam Wharton the only players to get within 15 of the United skipper’s 37 completed balls over the top.",
      "",
      "1) James Garner – 86.8\n2) Joao Palhinha – 85.6\n3) Declan Rice – 82.8\n4) Amadou Onana – 82.1\n5) Martín Zubimendi – 81.7\n…17) Elliot Anderson – 73.9",
      "Anderson is certainly busy off the ball, competing in more challenges (includes ground duels, aerial contests, and tackles) than any other central midfielder, but 33 of his contemporaries have won a higher percentage of  their challenges. Still, his 40% is a higher success rate than any United central midfielder.",
      "1) James Garner 88\n2) Moises Caicedo – 87.8\n3) Vitaly Janelt – 87.7\n4) Boubacar Kamara – 84.4\n5) Yegor Yarmolyuk- 83.8\n… 48) Elliot Anderson – 71.7",
      "Only Joao Gomes has competed in more 50/50 duels but only five central midfielders have a lower success rate than Anderson’s 41%. Of course, the highest-graded player for 50/50s and challenges came through at United but the Red Devils saw no pathway for James Garner.",
      "",
      "1) Ryan Gravenberch – 90.4\n2) Nico Gonzalez – 83.7\n3) Dominik Szoboszlai – 83.3\n4) James Garner – 82.9\n5) Moises Caicedo – 80.7\n… 29) Elliot Anderson – 72.7",
      "Only Gravenberch (76) has attempted more ball carries than Anderson (62), and only the Liverpool star has more carries that have broken a defensive line. But among all central midfielders, the Forest man has the highest number of ball carries leading to a loss of possession while he tries to drag Forest up the pitch.",
      "1) Joelinton – 86.8\n2) John McGinn – 86.5\n3) Ryan Gravenberch – 86.1\n4) Bruno Guimaraes – 86\n5) Moisés Caicedo – 85.1\n… 35) Elliot Anderson – 72.5",
      "Anderson has faced more tackles than any other central midfielder and came out on top most often too. He has won 75% of the tackles he has faced, with only five CMs having a higher success ratio, but all faced considerably less than half the number of total tackles. Still, he’s no Bruno Fernandes.",
      "",
      "Manchester United reportedly ‘want’ to sign two Nottingham Forest stars in a potential £147m double deal, with summer exits for these players inevitable…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have chosen their ‘first-choice’ summer signing between three potential replacements for Casemiro.",
      "Man Utd have decided on three players they want to sign in the summer transfer window as they look to ‘revamp’ their squad, according to reports.",
      "Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are ranked in the Premier League’s top 10 for pressurised passing which highlights a weakness for Man Utd…",
      "Teddy Sheringham has warned Manchester United over a potential £100m move for Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson.",

      "Manchester United held ‘formal discussions’ with Wolves over a surprise January move for Mateus Mane and the ‘key factor’ in a summer battle with Liverpool has been revealed.",
      "After spending over £200m in the summer to revamp their forward line through the signings of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, United made no further signings in the winter window.",
      "But a report from Sports Boom claims both the Red Devils and Liverpool made an approach to Wolves to enquire over the availability of Mane, who’s been the shining light for Rob Edwards’ rock-bottom side.",
      "After scoring for Wolves against West Ham in January, their first and only win of the Premier League season, Edwards insisted it was important that the club “look after” Mane, “a very bright talent”.",
      "“He finished his performance with a fantastic goal,” Edwards said. “He once again delivered a very bold display, playing with real commitment.",
      "“He’s 18, but he’s almost like a little leader on the pitch. I think that’s contagious. I believe he influences others – with his energy, his enthusiasm.",
      "“He’s truly a very bright talent, someone we should really admire. At the same time, we want to make sure we look after him.”",
      "The report claims ‘scouts from several top-tier clubs, most notably Manchester United and Liverpool, have been tracking the youngster’s every move for the past month’ and that ‘dossiers compiled’ are ‘filled with “extraordinary” ratings’ of the 18-year-old.",
      "Both clubs held ‘formal discussions’ with Wolves but were put off by an ‘asking price in the region of £45-£50m’.",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365…\n* Man Utd choose ‘first-choice’ summer signing to replace £120m pair as PL star is ‘Manchester-bound’\n* Man Utd decide on three summer signings in £173m ‘revamp’, including Newcastle star\n* Cristiano Ronaldo stance on Man Utd return revealed by ex-colleague with ‘progress towards agreement",
      "There is still hope of a move though as the report suggests he ‘could be available for a reduced fee in the summer, should Wolves suffer relegation to the Championship’. Cut-price fee it is then.",
      "On the reason for Wolves’ very high price tag, the report states:",
      "‘Wolves’ firm stance was underpinned by the fact they had already cashed in on striker Jørgen Strand Larsen, who joined Crystal Palace for a record club fee earlier in the window. With significant funds already secured, the West Midlands club had no pressing need to sell Mateus Mané and were comfortable resisting advances.",
      "‘That confidence was reflected in a late move to line up Girona forward Vladyslav Vanat as a potential Strand Larsen replacement, but despite groundwork being done, a deadline-day deal ultimately failed to materialise.",
      "The report further claims that Mane ‘remains focused’ at Wolves for now, but with Liverpool and Man Utd both ‘making enquiries through his representatives’ the summer could ‘prompt record-breaking transfer attempts for Mane’, with Wolves’ final position a ‘key factor’ in his future."

      "“I think Tonali would work really well in that United midfield,” Simpson told Metro via Meta Spins Casino.",
      "“I think he would complement Kobbie Mainoo really nicely, because he gets about the pitch so well.",
      "“Obviously, he’s been a top player for Newcastle. He’s good on the ball, he’s strong, he’s physical, he’d be a brilliant player in there in many regards.",
      "“Also, he’s the type of player that I think could wear a Man Utd shirt. It’s not easy, that, and I feel like he could wear it with the pressure and deal with it.",

      "According to reports, Real Madrid have ‘made a firm decision’ on whether to re-sign Manchester United legend Cristiano Ronaldo from Al Nassr.",
      "Ronaldo‘s future at Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr appears uncertain after it emerged that he ‘refused to play’ for them against Al-Riyadh on Monday.",
      "The Man Utd and Real Madrid legend joined Al Nassr at the start of 2023, with this move following the termination of his contract at Old Trafford by mutual consent.",
      "The 40-year-old has 133 goal involvements in 127 appearances for Al Nassr across all competitions, but everything has not been rosy between the forward and the club.",
      "Last year, Ronaldo was heavily linked with an exit from Al Nassr ahead of the expiry of his contract, with rumours suggesting that he was unhappy following their failure to win the Saudi Pro League and/or AFC Champions League and could join a club competing in the Club World Cup.",
      "READ: A bonus famous F365 England ladder as Man Utd players climb and Arsenal stars tumble",
      "Ronaldo eventually opted to sign a new two-year contract with Al Nassr, though his most recent dispute with the club reportedly relates to a lack of backing from the board in the transfer market.",
      "Naturally, this has fuelled fresh reports of a potential exit from Al Nassr, with a potential return to Europe via his 50 million release clause mooted as an option.",
      "It also comes as no surprise that Ronaldo’s former clubs are being touted as possible next destinations for the veteran striker, who will be hoping to play regular football ahead of this summer’s World Cup.",
      "However, it is hard to see Man Utd being willing to sanction another spell at Old Trafford for Ronaldo, and the same can be said for Real Madrid.",
      "Now, a report from an outlet in Spain claims Real Madrid have ‘made a firm decision’ on whether to re-sign Ronaldo as they have ‘ruled out’ this transfer.",
      "This said to be because head coach Alvaro Arbeloa has opted to ‘block’ his return.",
      "The report explains: ‘Ronaldo feels competitive, continues to score goals regularly, and believes he can still contribute to European football. In this context, he offered Real Madrid a very different return than in previous spells, accepting a secondary role and making no demands in terms of sporting achievements.",
      "‘However, the club doesn’t see it that way. Alvaro Arbeloa has been clear with the sporting director that Cristiano Ronaldo’s return would pose an unnecessary risk internally. Even if the Portuguese player is willing to accept a substitute role, no one in the dressing room believes his presence could coexist with that without creating tension.’",
      "Alternatively, Ronaldo could secure a move back to boyhood club Sporting Lisbon, and a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims this ‘return’ transfer is ’emerging strongly’ as an option.",
      "The report claims: ‘A return to Sporting would have an immeasurable historical and emotional impact. For the player, it would mean closing the circle of an unforgettable career, while for the Lisbon club it would be one of the most high-profile signings ever made.",
      "‘Although the operation wouldn’t be easy from a financial standpoint, the symbolism could outweigh any other factor.’",

      "We would probably go with Nick Pope, but we think Tuchel sticks with what he knows here. Unless you are yourself James Trafford or Nick Pope, it doesn’t really matter.",
      "",
      "He’s back in the Man United team and thus firmly back in the mix. We reckon there are five squad places for central midfielders. Rice, Anderson and Henderson will be three of them, and Mainoo is now once again a significant part of a conversation also involving your Whartons, Scotts and Gallaghers if not now perhaps the Loftus-Cheeks of this world.",
      "We tentatively lean towards what he did at the Euros counting for a lot with Tuchel, who we suspect has just been waiting/hoping for exactly this kind of extended run in the United side.",
      "",
      "No coincidence that his own form has improved in direct relation to West Ham coming back from the dead, and with Noni Madueke struggling for playing time the Bukayo Saka understudy gig does once again seem to be up for grabs.",
      "Tuchel’s selection policy has always been an interesting and we think rather clever balance of rewarding both current club form and previous England form. With this longer gap between international squads, our thinking is he will lean slightly more heavily on the former than latter. If he does, Bowen is definitely ahead.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick replacing Ruben Amorim has already reshaped Manchester United, but what might it mean for England? Maguire is back playing regularly and knows his way around a summer tournament better than almost any other England player. With Stones a doubt and nobody else beyond Marc Guehi and Ezri Konsa having locked down a squad place, why not Maguire?",
      "We already know from Henderson’s return that Tuchel values and requires members of the playing group with those battle-hardened leadership qualities, and it’s quite a green defensive group if Stones isn’t in it.",
      "",
      "Has always been very good when Tuchel has called upon him, and we know this is a manager for whom that counts for an awful lot. But if you were picking a squad right now on current form it would be extremely hard to justify Madueke over, say, Jarrod Bowen.",
      "",
      "Scored a hat-trick against Spurs straight after the international break, which was good, but hasn’t scored or assisted a Premier League goal since, which is bad. Simply does not have the England record to remain secure in the squad while becoming as peripheral as he has at club level.",
      "",
      "Every chance, you know. Left-back is the most up-in-the-air position of the lot, and Shaw is playing there again now Man United are free at last of Ruben Amorim’s back-three tyranny. There’s a certain irony in the fact Shaw and Reece James also now appear to be England’s most injury-resistant full-back options, having managed 47 out of a possible 48 Premier League appearances this season between them.",
      "Would bring a wealth of experience to a defence that could use that if it is indeed a perfectly capable but not particularly tournament-hardened Guehi-Konsa central pairing, as well as providing an experienced LCB option in a back three.",
      "",
      "Did absolutely nothing wrong when called upon in October but usurped by Nico O’Reilly in November and now as injured as all Spurs players must be. Ability to play both flanks still works in his favour but also now, through no real fault of his own, probably in a position where he needs to play himself back into the 26.",
      "",
      "Four goals in four games since returning from a frustratingly persistent injury and coming into a genuinely terrible Tottenham team at a horrifically low ebb.",
      "Scoring an outrageous scorpion kick as one of your two goals against Man City in front of the watching England manager is certainly not a bad idea.",
      "What’s interesting about Solanke is, while obviously not approaching Harry Kane’s class, he is probably the closest England have available in terms of all-round playing style. So it could come down to what, exactly, Tuchel is looking for in his Kane back-up: a point of difference, or an inevitably inferior but passable facsimile.",
      "",
      "A badly timed injury cost him in November. A goalkeeper who is playing week in, week out for a Champions League club should logically be a better choice as third-choice keeper than someone who is not doing that, but we’re just not sure it’s something Tuchel is going to be spending much time faffing about with this close to tournament time.",
      "",
      "Played right-back in England’s last qualifier, and ‘back-up right-back’ does look like it might be a position available to a versatile, utility-player sort – whether that’s a full-back who can play either side (a Spence, a Livramento) or a Jarell Quansah/Joe Gomez type who can shuffle across from their preferred centre-back spot.",
      "",
      "Whether it makes Tuchel more likely to pick you we’re not so sure, but you’re certainly going to get talked about more as a possible England selection if you’re playing in England. Gallagher is now doing so again, and will have done himself no harm at all with that all-action effort against Man City in front of the England coach at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.",
      "Is a player Tuchel knows from Chelsea, which we’ve already seen count for something, but also one of the accursed gang whose sole England appearance under the current manager came in the Game We Don’t Like To Talk About against Senegal.",
      "",
      "Couldn’t even nail down the right-back spot when he was one of Liverpool’s best and most visible players and Reece James was pretty much always injured. Is not about to do so while he is struggling to get a game for Real Madrid and Reece James is pretty much always available.",
      "In terms of the squad, we still rule nothing out because there is no current compelling back-up right-back and a fresh Alexander-Arnold with a point to prove is a very tempting wildcard in a 26-man group.",
      "The facts are, though, that he hasn’t been part of an England squad since last summer. If he were already in the squad, his Real Madrid struggles might be overlooked; but he’s in the position of trying to force his way in and just isn’t doing enough.",
      "",
      "Bellingham, Rogers, Palmer is already a difficult pack to burst through for one of the No. 10 spots, and that’s before you consider the likes of Foden or Eze who could play there or elsewhere. Looks like a losing battle at this time.",
      "",
      "Needed to pull up trees at Everton. A Premier League record since the last international break of one goal, two assists, one foot injury, one mysterious Christmas ‘illness’ isn’t really that.",
      "",
      "Still hasn’t played for England since That Senegal Game, but was in the last squad and remains an automatic pick for Chelsea.",
      "Problem for Chalobah that he cannot do anything about is that he may now find himself in a scrap with some enormously experienced big-tournament players for the squad centre-back positions, and Tuchel clearly values that know-how.",
      "",
      "Were there such a thing as a January international break, then he would have been a shoo-in after scoring seven Premier League goals in six games between November 29 and December 28. But there isn’t so he wasn’t.",
      "And now he’s scored one goal in his last six. Never underestimate the importance of timing. But Watkins’ injury does certainly leave a door potentially ajar for a Calvert-Lewin, Solanke or Toney.",

      "Whether by accident or design, Manchester United may have stumbled upon a winning formula. The policy is finally bearing fruit.",
      "West Ham remain six points adrift and a contract clause in every player’s contract means they face an exodus if they’re relegated this summer. It falls to us to reassign ...",

      "That does leave them with significantly less room for improvement than their peers. The goalkeeper and defence is not shifting. The midfield – even with a mild sense of supporter frustration at the stylings of Martin Odegaard – will likely not change either. But the attack is slightly different.",

The Viktor Gyokeres experiment will not be abandoned after a single season in which he is currently the club’s top scorer anyway. Gabriel Martinelli feels a little less secure, with Eberechi Eze, Leandro Trossard and Noni Madueke failing to provide ample evidence that they can be more than cover and rotational options on the left.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have made a ‘clear’ decision on whether to re-sign Cristiano Ronaldo after it was claimed that they were ‘in talks’.",
      "Ronaldo‘s second spell at Man Utd ended as his contract was cancelled by mutual consent at the end of 2022.",
      "The Red Devils had no choice but to part ways with Ronaldo after he blasted then-head coach Erik ten Hag, the Glazer family and several club legends in a now-infamous interview with Piers Morgan.",
      "Ronaldo quickly secured himself a move to Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr, but this move has not gone perfectly for the veteran forward.",
      "The multiple-time Ballon d’Or winner was heavily linked with an exit from Al Nassr last year as there were suggestions that he was unhappy following their failure to win the Saudi Pro League or the AFC Champions League.",
      "READ: Man Utd transfers to reach 14 but one move ‘difficult to pull off’",
      "Ronaldo was linked with Al-Hilal and other clubs competing in the Club World Cup ahead of last summer’s tournament, but he eventually decided to pen a contract extension with Al Nassr.",
      "However, Ronaldo’s situation has boiled over in recent days, with reports claiming that he ‘refused to play’ in Monday’s 1-0 win against Al-Riyadh.",
      "Ronaldo is said to be unhappy with Al Nassr’s board over a lack of investment in the transfer market and there are now reports that he could leave the Middle East side.",
      "Naturally, Man Utd have been the first club to be mentioned as a next possible destination for Ronaldo, even though a proposed third stint at Old Trafford is fanciful at best.",

      "A report has claimed that the Red Devils are ‘in talks’ over re-signing Ronaldo, who is said to be willing to make a ‘financial sacrifice’ to force through the transfer.",
      "Now, Portuguese outlet Record claims Europe and the MLS are ‘possible destinations’ for Ronaldo, who has a 50 million euro (£43m) ‘release clause’ that can be activated in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "And an update from journalist Graeme Bailey for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Man Utd are ‘clear’ that they have ‘no intention’ of pursuing a ‘sensational’ deal for Ronaldo, whose ‘exit’ from Al Nassr is still ‘closer than ever’.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘Senior figures at Old Trafford have made it clear to us that a sensational reunion is not under consideration.",
      "‘While admiration for Ronaldo’s legacy at the club is undiminished, this new INEOS-led era at Old Trafford is focused on long‑term squad building and signing future superstars, rather than paying over the odds for established names or revisiting past chapters, however iconic they may be. As things stand, United will not be part of the conversation should Ronaldo decide his time in Saudi Arabia is coming to an end.’",

      "According to reports, Al Nassr star Cristiano Ronaldo has ‘opposed’ Karim Benzema’s proposed move to Al-Hilal and this is impacting three deals."

      "Man Utd won't U-turn on the decision to allow Casemiro to leave when his contract expires in June despite improved Premier League form under Michael Carrick; the club are forward planning and expected to chase a number of midfield targets in the summer, with Elliot Anderson top of list",
      "Monday 2 February 2026 15:50, UK",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is in his richest vein of form since arriving at Old Trafford in a deal worth £70m in 2022. So why would the club let him go now?",
      "The veteran Brazil international, who turns 34 later this month, rolled back the years as Man Utd picked up another dramatic win over Fulham on Sunday, heading in the opener before setting up Matheus Cunha's goal with a sublime no-look pass.",
      "Casemiro has started all three games under Carrick, but made his impending departure official last month while Ruben Amorim was still in charge. United did hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension, but with a midfield overhaul planned for the summer it was decided that Casemiro would be allowed to leave.",
      "\"Manchester United are determined not to have a short-term approach to signings and managers. That's what has got them into trouble in the past. It's left a lot of big-name players on big wages who are not part of the plans.",
      "\"Casemiro is flying right now. Player of the match against Fulham. I can understand why a lot of fans are saying: 'we're trying to find a midfielder but willing to let Casemiro go?'",
      "\"He turns 34 later this month, he's one of the biggest earners at the club, £325k a week, and Man Utd know that can't go on forever. He's playing out of his skin right now but they have to have a longer-term plan.",
      "\"Casemiro will leave in the summer, they have done the big goodbye video and there is no going back on that.\"",
      "\"I think it is. He has done brilliantly well, playing with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in there makes a difference.",
      "\"He's got to move on. He's 34 and before you know it, he's 35. He's been a top player; he's had a lot of unworthy stick because he hasn't got the legs to play on his own in midfield if Fernandes pushes forward.",
      "\"Mainoo has helped that a lot - common sense by Michael Carrick. But we're talking about the future of Man Utd and they are right to be doing what they're doing and letting him go.\"",
      "\"Midfield is where Man Utd feel they will focus the bulk of their spend in the summer.",
      "\"Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there's a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "\"Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It's a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that's why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "\"Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we're talking over £100m.\"",
      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Nevertheless, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "Going into the window, the feeling was Arsenal were going to be quiet. And so it proved.",
      "They did their business in the summer - and were only likely to dip into the market if a long-term target or unique market opportunity presented itself.",
      "Manager Mikel Arteta maintained they would be alive and alert.",
      "However, he also called for the numbers in a matchday squad to be increased in line with Europe. He is begging for 23 in total - and 20 outfield players. The reason? He is having to disappoint two or three players every game.",
      "With that in mind, the chance of a new signing was always going to be slim.",
      "A serious injury to Mikel Merino gave Arsenal food for thought - and they tentatively explored a potential deal. However, that's as far as it got and Arsenal will continue their fight on all four fronts with the squad they have.",
      "Thoughts will no doubt switch to the summer when Arsenal are expected to be busy again.",
      "With the challenges presented by complying with the Premier League and UEFA's financial rules still very pertinent for Aston Villa they perhaps did as much as they could this January to remain competitive on three fronts in the coming months.",
      "Douglas Luiz has a lot of work to do to cover for the absence of injured trio John McGinn, Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans for the foreseeable future, but at least he knows Unai Emery's system.",
      "Tammy Abraham knows the club and is a more natural central striker than Donyel Malen, who left to join Roma. Returning from Rome is Leon Bailey who feels a better option than Evan Guessand, who underwhelmed after his summer arrival.",
      "Emery's brilliance probably holds the key to Villa holding off the challenge from behind in the league and ending a 30-year wait for silverware.",
      "This was always going to be a tough transfer window for Bournemouth to navigate with the anticipated departure of Antoine Semenyo due to his release clause. However, with the arrival of four new faces for Andoni Iraola, this window will be seen as a success.",
      "The injury to Justin Kluivert around the same time as Semenyo left for Man City only added to the sense that this would be a pivotal period for the Cherries. Results were mixed and the club were flirting with slipping into the relegation battle. It all felt a bit worrying.",
      "How different the picture looks now though. Unbeaten in five games and 13 points clear of the bottom three, Bournemouth can comfortably look up the table rather than over their shoulder and the early signs are that their latest recruits could be hits.",
      "Brazilian teenager Rayan, the potential Semenyo replacement, set up Bournemouth's second goal in Saturday's 2-0 win at Wolves in his debut following £30.3m move from Vasco da Gama. Bournemouth will be glad he has a release clause of £86.3m in his contract.",
      "The signing of midfielder Alex Toth from Ferencvaros was another coup. Lazio, Benfica and Galatasary were all chasing the 20-year-old, who was developed at the Hungarian club by head coach Robbie Keane, and he comes with experience of pressure environments.",
      "Bournemouth have also brought in goalkeeper Christos Mandas from Lazio to provide competition for Djordje Petrovic in a move that could become permanent in the summer. Left back Ade Solanke, 18, is seen as one for the future after signing from Lorient.",
      "There was hope at one point of adding a fifth signing. Inter's Luis Henrique was one of those that Bournemouth looked at but because of the club being in such a comfortable position there was no desire to force a move at an inflated price late in the window.",
      "Brentford's impressive form this season meant they could stay measured in this window. Their league position is a reflection of the great work they have done in previous windows.",
      "They had wanted to add a young centre-forward prospect for some time and Kaye Furo becomes that player, now learning under former Club Brugge team-mate Igor Thiago.",
      "They also kept hold of some key players in Kristoffer Ajer and Vitaly Janelt. Both have signed new deals after uncertainty around their futures and interest from other clubs.",
      "There may have been some further changes in defence but nothing really materalised for Ethan Pinnock in the end, meaning no replacement was needed.",
      "It started with a bang but arguably ended with a bit of a whimper.",
      "Brighton's window started in spectacular fashion with the return of club legend Pascal Gross early on. The re-signing of the Germany international for a fee of £1.2m from Borussia Dortmund is already starting to pay dividends. His experience will be key and is sure to rub off on the many young players in the squad.",
      "Matt O'Riley is another player to return to the club albeit in different circumstances. The midfielder's loan from Marseille was ended early and becomes another option for head coach Fabian Hurzeler. With appearances in the Champions League for the French club this season, the former Celtic man comes back a better player.",
      "The 25-year-old's return to Brighton was confirmed on the final day of the window. Perhaps there was a hope amongst some of the support in certain quarters that there would be more arrivals.",
      "Should a striker have come in to ease the pressure on 35-year-old Danny Welbeck and 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas up front? Evan Ferguson's possible return from a loan spell at Roma was often a topic of discussion but he is staying in Italy.",
      "Has Tommy Watson's loan move to Millwall for the rest of the season left Brighton light in terms of back-up wingers? Brajan Gruda has moved to Leipzig on loan too.",
      "Brighton tend not to do too much business in January - they are calm, not reactive and spend much of it looking at forward planning. Much work would have been done behind the scenes for the summer window. Expect a fair bit of movement in and out then.",
      "Worth a reminder that one of their best signings this window might not be a player but one behind the scenes. Mike Anthony, who was high performance chief at the All Blacks, came in to take a newly created role as the club's head of player development and high performance in what they feel is an innovative move focused on culture and mentality.",
      "Signing James Ward-Prowse, a player with a proven track record in the Premier League, from a relegation rival no less, will certainly be seen as a smart signing by Scott Parker.",
      "Whether that will be enough to surmount the overwhelming challenge Burnley face in terms of keeping themselves in the Premier League remains to be seen.",
      "At one stage, it looked as if Ward-Prowse's move from West Ham would not happen. At least they managed to get this one over the line.",
      "Whatever Burnley did in this window, they were always facing an unenviable task to stay in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are usually big spenders in transfer windows but this turned out to be a quiet month by Stamford Bridge standards.",
      "They missed out on their No. 1 target Jeremy Jacquet. Liverpool got him at the last minute after Chelsea were confident that he would choose them ahead of other interested clubs.",
      "It's debatable whether Chelsea needed another centre back, especially with Levi Colwill due back from injury before the end of the season and promising young defenders out on loan.",
      "One of them - Mamadou Sarr - is coming back from sister club Strasbourg and he is expected to challenge for a first-team place straightaway.",
      "This window officially marked the end of Chelsea's so-called Bomb Squad. Raheem Sterling's contract was terminated and Axel Disasi joined West Ham on loan.",
      "It's been some start to the year for Crystal Palace.",
      "They smashed their transfer record to sign Brennan Johnson from Spurs. Their FA Cup defence collapsed at the first attempt against non-League Macclesfield Town. Days later, their manager Oliver Glasner confirmed he'd be heading off in the summer just moments after revealing that club captain Marc Guehi was set to be sold.",
      "On the pitch, the winless run continued as a season filled with promise began to unravel. Reinforcements were forthcoming as the future of their top scorer Jean-Philippe Mateta became more and more uncertain. Long-term target Evann Guessand was signed in a try-before-you-buy loan deal from Aston Villa as Palace threatened to commit more than £100m in incomings in the winter window.",
      "As ever, all roads pointed towards a busy Deadline Day. Jorgen Strand Larsen was lined up as a replacement for Mateta. But the wantaway Frenchmen didn't get the Italian Job done.",
      "It seemed implausible that Palace would end the season with two frontline strikers but they deserve credit for ploughing ahead with the deal for Strand Larsen despite the late collapse of Mateta's move to Milan.",
      "It's a calculated gamble from Steve Parish. They have added firepower up front. They have failed to replace their captain but left no stone unturned in their attempt to sign a central defender for a fair market price.",
      "It's now imperative Palace immediately quell any doubts surrounding their Premier League status and then press forward in achieving a successful finish. A rollercoaster season could still culminate in European glory.",
      "David Moyes had been pretty clear in his expectations that this window and Deadline Day was not going to be spectacular.",
      "Only a few weeks ago he said to me how welcome an approach it is given the spending of the past which caused Everton so much harm in the long run.",
      "So, a quiet window ended with what should be seen as sensible business.",
      "In Tyrique George they are getting the chance to have a look at a 19 year old who joins on loan until the end of the season, before deciding whether or not to take up their option to buy.",
      "There was interest in George from another premier league club and one in Europe, who was close to a £22m move to Fulham in the summer. And he arrives at Everton having scored three goals in 11 Chelsea appearances this season, including in the Champions League at home to Ajax.",
      "In total he's made 37 appearances for Chelsea including one Premier league start. While his only Premier League goal came last season as he kick started the comeback win at Fulham.",
      "Given the injury to Jack Grealish, George will be hopeful David Moyes can offer him greater playing time.",
      "The Everton boss will have also Dwight McNeil to call on for the remainder of the season out wide after his move to Crystal Palace collpased after the deadline had passed. A deal sheet was submitted but the relevant paperwork was not done in time.",
      "At the obligation price of £20m it was a difficult offer for Everton to say no to. But having another more experienced wide player to support youngsters George and Tyler Dibling could prove valuable for Moyes.",
      "Deadline Day at Fulham started with a great deal of promise but ultimately failed to deliver. The club were hopeful they could get a deal done for Riccardo Pepi, the PSV Eindhoven striker.",
      "The club had reached an agreement on a £32m package, but that was on the proviso that PSV could find a replacement. They were unable to do so and therefore the deal fell through.",
      "Fulham do however still hope to pick it back up in the summer. The 21-year-old Pepi is a long-term target and a long-term successor to Raul Jimenez.",
      "Harry Wilson was also in the headlines early on Deadline Day. It emerged Everton had made an approach for him last week - unsurprisingly it was rejected by Fulham. Marco Silva has repeatedly said Wilson is going nowhere in this window.",
      "So, Fulham's January business saw a 30-year-old winger, Adame Traore, leave the club and a 22-year-old winger, Oscar Bobb, arrive.",
      "Slim business, yes - but if Bobb can stay fit and fulfill his potential you have to say potentially very good business too.",
      "Leeds United reach the end of another transfer window with an overwhelming sense of what could have been after missing out on Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace.",
      "This was never supposed to be a big window for Daniel Farke's side and loan signings were always thought to be more likely than permanent deals. That is how things panned out in the end with Facundo Buonanotte, a loan from Brighton, the only incoming for Leeds.",
      "The Argentina international playmaker adds a creative profile to the squad that was lacking, but it remains to be seen if he can cut it at Premier League level after struggling to consistently keep his place in the team at Brighton and Leicester.",
      "Expectations were low coming into the window, but the pursuit of Strand Larsen raised hopes. Leeds were unwilling to go above £40m - Wolves' initial valuation for the striker - and Palace ended up committing to £8m more than that.",
      "For a club that said they were maxing out PSR after the summer, there was no further that Leeds could stretch to make this deal happen. So why did some of those funds not go towards improving other areas of the squad?",
      "Leeds were planning to structure most of the deal to come out of next year's budget to stay within Premier League rules. Strand Larsen was also viewed as a unique opportunity and players like that do not often become available in mid-season windows.",
      "At a time when there is uncertainty in the goalkeeping department and injuries at full-back, it has been received by some fans as a gamble not to invest more in the squad to give Leeds the best chance of Premier League survival.",
      "We have been here before, though, with Leeds. In the summer, deals for the likes of Igor Paixao failed to materialise, and there were concerns that this squad did not have what it takes to cope with the Premier League. So far, they have defied those expectations.",
      "The true test will be in May. If Leeds stay up, none of this matters, but if they go down then perhaps the club will look back on this window as a missed opportunity to strengthen. Only time will tell.",
      "After a record breaking spend in the summer, this was a window in which Liverpool were never going to go wild. At the same time, having missed out on Marc Guehi on the final day of the summer window when Crystal Palace pulled the plug, to then lose him to Manchester City was a major blow.",
      "Ultimately the whole package didn't make financial sense, which was disappointing given how open to the move Guehi had been in the summer and the fact that Liverpool's interest had never waned, particularly as they saw him as someone who is not only one of the Premier League's centre backs but can also cover at right back.",
      "Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements was emphasised by injuries to Joe Gomez, Jeremie Frimpong and Conor Bradley all adding to the long term absence of Geovanni Leoni.",
      "Ultimately, a deal for Lutsharel Geertruida proved impossible as Sunderland were not in a position to sanction the move despite the player himself wanting to make the switch.",
      "It all meant that discussions with Spurs over a £5m move for Andy Robertson were short-lived as it would have made little sense for Liverpool to weaken their defensive options further. Similarly, Inter Milan's interest in Curtis Jones was swiftly rebuffed.",
      "Liverpool, though, have started the reshaping of their backline. Jeremy Jacquet completed a medical before finalising a deal that could see Liverpool pay Rennes up to £60m for the 20-year-old centre half. However, he will only become a Liverpool player in the summer, and will play out the rest of the season with Rennes hoping to deliver European football.",
      "Unlike the Guehi situation, Liverpool have headed off interest from other clubs, most notably Chelsea, with Jacquet believing he'll get more game time at Anfield. For the rest of this season though, it's a case of as you were when it comes to the makeup of this current Liverpool squad.",
      "Manchester City arguably stole the show this window by swooping in ahead of Liverpool and other top clubs for Antione Semenyo and Marc Guehi.",
      "They have made two important additions ahead of the summer in key positions and signed Premier League ready players who have already hit the ground running.",
      "A solution has also been found, finally, for Kalvin Phillips who joins Sheffield United on loan until the summer.",
      "Sverre Nypan returns from a loan at Middlesbrough to integrate into the first-team, while a number of other youngsters head out on loan for more game time.",
      "As expected, it was overall a quiet window in the January transfer window for Manchester United.",
      "Entering the window, there was uncertainty amongst a few players such as the likes of Kobbie Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "But none of those situations for different reasons ended up in departures - and perhaps the reason why is because the biggest outgoing of the window for the club was United's former head coach Ruben Amorim and the most impactful incoming was his replacement Michael Carrick after leading them to three huge wins in the last three weeks.",
      "The change has seen United start Kobbie Mainoo start and star three league games in a row which has put questions around his future on hold for now.",
      "However with no reinforcements, all attention for United will be on the summer window as they look to reshape their midfield, especially with Casemiro leaving the club at the end of his contract this summer as well.",
      "They resisted the temptation to reinforce this window and refused to compromise on their long-term targets but all eyes will be on United's hierarchy this summer - especially when it is still uncertain who will be the head coach going into next season.",
      "Newcastle failed to make a January signing, much to the frustration of their fanbase.",
      "With a relentless fixture schedule that sees them currently play a game every three days, a fresh face would have given everyone a lift. Eddie Howe has previously gone on record to say he'd like to sign at least one new player every window.",
      "In truth though, Newcastle are still counting the cost of a summer splurge that saw them spend £250m. The jury is still out on a few of those new faces as Eddie Howe attempts to knit a new team together without the player they were all there to serve - Alexander Isak. It all feels very much a work in progress.",
      "The biggest move of Deadline Day was club captain Jamaal Lascelles moving to Leicester City after 12 long years with the club.",
      "The team as a whole are doing okay despite the distractions and residual damage of last summer, and are still in four competitions.",
      "But when it comes to new faces they'll keep their powder dry until the summer as they look to strengthen significantly then.",
      "It won't all go their way, as it again looks as though they'll have to brace themselves for further attempts from competitors to sign their best players. Sandro Tonali and Tino Livramento are two that continually get linked with moves away.",
      "But for now, it's batten down the hatches and get through until the end of the season.",
      "Nottingham Forest had a frustrating end to the window but covered most positions they wanted filling.",
      "There will be lots of focus on their failed bids for Arne Engels and Jean-Phillippe Mateta but both would have been bonus signings.",
      "Luca Netz was brought in for a pittance by Premier League standards to offer competition at left-back, Lorenzo Lucca offers another striking threat with Chris Wood out and Stefan Ortega's arrival was timely after an injury to 'keeper Matz Sels.",
      "Long-term targets will be chased in the summer but Elliot Anderson's future will be the main story at the City Ground at the end of the season.",
      "It was a significantly quieter transfer window for Sunderland than what we saw in the summer when 14 new arrivals cost around £150m.",
      "That was a necessity back then, but the need for mass change has been reduced due to Sunderland's impressive start to the season that sees them unbeaten at home and lying mid-table.",
      "The one big signing arrived on Deadline Day - Nilson Angulo from Anderlecht. The winger has signed for £15m, with a potential £2.5m in addition in add-ons.",
      "It was left very late, and reliant on outcast Adil Aouchiche freeing up a loan spot by cutting his deal at Aberdeen short and moving to Schalke. That loan spot was the taken by Simon Adingra who joined Monaco on loan, and allowed Sunderland to sign Angulo permanently.",
      "Confused? It's never dull on Deadline Day. Sporting director Florent Ghisolfi can be very creative.",
      "Liverpool tried to make it more confusing by attempting to sign Lutsharel Geertruida over the weekend. But due to the complexity of the deal (The Dutchman is on a season-long loan from RB Leipzig) Sunderland refused to sanction it.",
      "There were a number of January departures from The Stadium of Light. The most notable one being former captain Dan Neil, who led the club promotion to the Premier League. He was never given a chance by Regis Le Bris in the top flight, but now has the chance for back-to-back promotions with Ipswich",
      "Tottenham end the window with Thomas Frank's squad looking short amid an injury crisis despite the arrivals of midfielder Conor Gallagher and left-back Souza. Failure to bring in a forward after injuries to Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus is the big shortcoming for Spurs.",
      "The club did not want to be reactive to their situation and panic buy. January is a notoriously hard window to do business in and top players rarely become available. Every effort was put into trying to sign Antoine Semenyo, but he chose to join Manchester City.",
      "Spurs also tried to sign Andy Robertson to inject some much-needed experience into the side and provide cover for the injured Ben Davies. However, it proved too difficult for Liverpool to recall Kostas Tsimikas from his loan at Roma and the deal could not be done.",
      "Randal Kolo Muani, Mathys Tel, Radu Dragusin and Antonin Kinsky all attracted interest in this window but Spurs could not sanction their exits with all their injury issues. They have all struggled for game time this season but there is an opportunity now to prove themselves.",
      "Spurs have big plans to strengthen in the summer transfer window. Frank will hope he gets the time to reap the benefits of that. The spirited fight-back in the draw against Man City suggests he has the backing of the players, but a lot is being asked of this depleted group.",
      "Frank and his employers must hope that they have enough to rise to the occasion and restore some consistency for Spurs. Otherwise, the increasingly frustrated fanbase may run out of patience with the lack of support they have been given.",
      "West Ham made a fast start to the transfer window and a slow-ish end.",
      "Taty Castellanos and Pablo coming in within five days of January strengthened the attack. Adama Traore coming in towards the end adds pace and unpredictability into the squad.",
      "Nuno Espírito Santo constantly talked about rebalancing the squad during the winter window. I can't quite work out if he has so I'll be interested to get his answer when I speak to him on Thursday. Apart from Lucas Paqueta, no key players have left. And the Lucas Paqueta we've seen this season can't be described as key.",
      "Players who weren't playing minutes are gone. Igor Julio, James Ward-Prowse, Guido Rodriguez and Andy Irving are out. Axel Disasi signing on the final day offers needed cover.",
      "Are West Ham stronger now than compared to the start of the window? I would say just. Pablo and Castellanos as a pair seems to be working up front but if that starts to slow down, the window starts to look very different.",
      "Wolves' window has been more about outgoings than incomings, as the club looks increasingly likely to be relegated at the end of the season.",
      "They have sold arguably their best forward in Jorgen Strand Larsen to Crystal Palace for £48m, which has to be seen as trying to extract maximum value for a player out of form.",
      "In turn the club have been looking to get ready for a medium term that may involve a season at least in the Championship, and the additions of Adam Armstrong and Angel Gomes add know-how and quality.",
      "It is a shame they did not also add Che Adams - a long-term target - to their thanks despite trying with Torino right until the final day.",
      "Tough times ahead for Wolves indeed but the money from Strand Larsen gives them more to spend in the summer and with time to plan for the market.",

      "After impressively beating Arsenal and Manchester City, Carrick's United passed another test that had its fair share of refereeing controversy.",
      "The first incident came in the build-up to Man Utd's opener as they were initially awarded a penalty after Matheus Cunha was judged to have been brought down by Jorge Cuenca. However, after a VAR check, the decision was overturned, with Cuenca clearly winning the ball, although the hosts were given a free-kick for a shirt pull instead - much to Marco Silva's fury.",

      "From the resulting free-kick, Casemiro headed home a Bruno Fernandes delivery for his fifth of the campaign. After announcing his departure at the end of the season, the midfielder is enjoying a farewell tour.",
      "Cunha, who made a return to the starting line-up in the only change to the side in place of the injured Patrick Dorgu, thundered in to double Man Utd's advantage in the second half.",
      "Fulham thought they had pulled one back when Cuenca tapped in a deflected Samuel Chukwueze shot that fell kindly into his path. However, after a VAR check that lasted around four minutes, the goal was ruled out for a marginal offside.",
      "But after being brought down by Harry Maguire in the area, Jimenez scored from the spot, before Kevin's stunning equaliser looked like it had rescued a point for Marco Silva's side.",
      "But Sesko, set up by Fernandes, had different ideas, thumping in his fifth goal of the season. A resurgent Man Utd are now five points off third place in the Premier League. Fulham drop to eighth.",

      "Monday 2 February 2026 06:19, UK",
      "It was easy street for Man City in the first half. They didn't need to get out of first gear at Spurs. The problem was they stayed there for the rest of the game.",
      "There's been a common theme regarding Pep Guardiola's teams and that is slow second halves after being 2-0 up.",
      "Against Wolves, Joao Gomes and Jorgen Strand Larsen should have pulled a goal back for the league's bottom side but missed chances. Victor Osimhen should have scored once or twice for Galatasaray in midweek. This dip at Spurs was one too many - and it felt similar to the two second-half goals conceded in the Manchester derby",
      "Guardiola said his City team suffered emotionally after the injustice of Dominic Solanke's first goal standing due to the Marc Guehi collision. Duels were missed, particularly out wide with the full-backs, he said - and it was seen in the equaliser as Nico O'Reilly and Nico Gonzalez got mixed up.",
      "And then the excuses from Guardiola start to come. Blaming the Guehi-Solanke incident follows similar complaints about not getting a penalty against Wolves and Diogo Dalot staying on the pitch in the Manchester derby. The reality is City have been struggling in the most important parts of matches.",
      "Is it a physical issue, with injuries catching up on them? Is it too many new players over the last 12 months? It all acts as a reminder that this is not a Manchester City of years gone by. How many times in the past would a Guardiola team kill a game off early and sit on a lead, maybe push for more?",
      "They need a fix to this second-half issue quickly, as it's Liverpool up next in the Premier League. The gap to Arsenal cannot afford to get bigger.Sam Blitz",
      "Casemiro is just one goal from matching his return from his best goalscoring season in a league campaign.",
      "He's very much on his farewell tour, after announcing he will depart at the end of the season and he's rolled back the years under Michael Carrick.",
      "His opening goal set the tone and his no-look assist to set up Matheus Cunha was reflective of the confidence he's playing with. Carrick noted the \"presence\" he has been since he took over as interim coach and how his experience has been significant.",
      "A five-time Champions League winner, his reputation has taken a hit since arriving on these shores; however, the Brazil international has maintained the favour of his coaches.",
      "As he approaches his 34th birthday, any suggestion that he should have been a part of Man Utd's plans beyond this season are misguided. But on the flip side, alongside Kobbie Mainoo, he remains an important cog in Carrick's machine.",
      "Casemiro is often profiled as the anchor in midfield and that owes to his time at Real Madrid, where he was the proverbial water carrier for Toni Kroos and Luka Modric.",
      "However, for Manchester United, he's proving to be much more of a complete package, showing a willingness to break lines with forward passes, hence his seven into the final third against Fulham.",
      "Beyond the goal contributions, suddenly, Casemiro appears to be a player United can once again rely on. It's a call back to the player signed from Real in a deal worth £70m in 2022.",
      "There's been a lot of talk about United's reported midfield overhaul this summer but the hole Casemiro is going to leave and the boots that will need to be filled grow every passing day.William Bitibiri",
      "In his pre-match press conference ahead of the game against Manchester City, Thomas Frank said Xavi Simons needed to translate his Champions League performances domestically. He certainly did that.",
      "The Dutchman was the biggest beneficiary of the 3-4-3 system that was forced to turn to due to the injuries that have plagued the squad. With the wide wing-backs pushing up, it gave Simons ample space inside to operate in areas he is dangerous in.",
      "More often than not, he was the go-to for Spurs as they transitioned from defence into attack. His neat footwork was at times a joy and his weight of pass was more often than not, exemplary.",
      "Having said that, the most impressive thing was his tenacity. He never gave up a fight for possession. He showed the grit needed in tough and physical Premier League games, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "This was somewhat of a coming our performance for Simons, whose quality was never questioned, but was a case of if it was suited to English football.",
      "In perhaps one of the most difficult games Spurs will have this season with regards to the pressure they are under and the opposition they found themselves against, an unsung hero stepped up and epitomised what Spurs' comeback was all about.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White was named man of the match as 10-man Nottingham Forest held Crystal Palace to a draw but Elliot Anderson was an equally deserving candidate.",
      "The 23-year-old showed all sides of his game in a complete performance which underlined, again, his status as one of the Premier League's top central midfielders.",
      "His best work came in possession in the first half as he demonstrated his technical ability and passing range, sending Forest forward on the attack repeatedly.",
      "He continued to show his on-ball value even after Neco Williams' sending-off. No Forest player had more touches or made more passes over the course of the 90 minutes. Anderson even completed all five of his attempted dribbles.",
      "But he was just as influential defensively after the break. Anderson snapped into challenges and played a crucial role in frustrating Palace, working tirelessly, cajoling and instructing team-mates.",
      "In total, he won possession 10 times, the highest total by any player on either side. He was also successful in 12 of his 14 duels. An outstanding all-round performance from a player getting better all the time.Nick Wright",
      "The draw against Nottingham Forest extended Crystal Palace's winless run to nine in the Premier League and 12 in all competitions. Shelbourne were the last team they beat, all the way back on December 11.",
      "But while that is miserable, arguably more concerning is their struggles in front of goal.",
      "Across those last 12, they have scored nine, with three scored from the penalty spot. That equates to a goal from open play every other game.",
      "Even with the absence of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was left out of the squad owing to the speculation around his future - Palace should probably have put more than an Ismaila Sarr penalty past Matz Sels - and half-time replacement Angus Gunn. Their hosts were reduced to 10 after a mindless handball from Neco Williams.",
      "But despite having 74 per cent of the possession after the break, they just couldn't. In fact, in the second half, they recorded only 0.22 xG and did not even muster a single shot on target.",
      "Right now, Mateta's future remains up in the air ahead of Deadline Day, but Palace have had a bid for Jorgen Strand Larsen totalling £48m accepted by Wolves. Providing that deal goes through without a hitch, they will need him to be firing from the off.Dan Long",
      "Aston Villa welcomed Douglas Luiz and Tammy Abraham back to the club this week and the duo went straight into the starting line-up against Brentford.",
      "This wasn't a nod to their talents, although both looked bright in flashes. It was evidence of the strain Unai Emery's squad is currently under.",
      "Captain John McGinn and top goalscorer Ollie Watkins both watched on from the stands due to injury, with Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans joining them on the sidelines.",
      "Club-record singing Amadou Onana also wasn't fit enough to feature, despite being named on the bench.",
      "The injury crisis continues to sweep the club and faltering against the 10 men of Brentford highlighted that lack of depth.",
      "Arsenal know more than anyone how injuries can impact a team pushing at the top of the table.",
      "A seven-point gap to Liverpool in sixth remains after this defeat but moving forward, Villa might need to pay closer attention to those behind them rather than Arsenal at the top.Patrick Rowe",

      "Saturday 31 January 2026 21:44, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "This is one of those prices that makes you stop, wash your face with cold water and check you're reading it correctly.",
      "Aston Villa to win at 21/20 with Sky Bet feels very generous considering what this team have been telling us for months.",
      "Since going winless in their opening five Premier League games, Villa have been nothing short of elite. They've taken 43 points from 18 matches, title-challenger output no doubt and no side in the division have collected more points over that period. That's not a short hot streak either. It's a sample of results to respect. It's sustained excellence.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, remain a side you want to oppose on their travels. Only bottom club Wolves have suffered more away defeats in the Premier League this season (8). Home win.",
      "There is no better attacker of a set-piece in world football than Harry Maguire. And in a Premier League season where dead-ball situations are being mined relentlessly for goals, Maguire is going to get his feed soon enough.",
      "Back in the Manchester United starting XI, Maguire is playing with an authority that has shone brightly in the last two performances. That confidence can translate to when he ventures forward. Maguire's old-school dominance remains a potent betting weapon and the 7/1 with Sky Bet for him to score is worth jumping on.",
      "There's a strong whiff of needle about this one. There's lingering animosity in the air after the summer legal battles which ended in Forest replacing Palace in the Europa League and when you layer in the relegation context, emotions are likely to be running hot. That's usually when the card markets come alive.",
      "One match-up in particular looks primed to deliver.",
      "Neco Williams is expected to lock horns with Ismaila Sarr, and that's a tough afternoon for any full-back. Sarr is relentless in one-vs-one situations, drives straight at defenders and forces decisions at pace. The data is damning from a defensive perspective as Sarr has drawn 21 cards from opponents since the start of last season, with only Bruno Guimaraes responsible for more in the Premier League.",
      "Williams looks a bet material at 100/30 with Sky Bet to be carded in an edgy game.",
      "There's no escaping the strange relationship between these two. Spurs have won seven of the last 12 meetings and Pep Guardiola has lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (8) than any other opponent. On paper, that history screams Tottenham.",
      "And when you see Spurs at 100/30 with Sky Bet, the temptation is obvious. But Spurs at home remain impossible to trust.",
      "Instead of fighting the uncertainty, the smarter route is to isolate a player who can still profit from Spurs doing some things right and that's where Dominic Solanke to score at 11/4 with Sky Bet comes to the party.",
      "He's become something of a forgotten man, but Solanke is built to score in the Premier League. Goals in back-to-back games is a reminder of his talents.",
      "There's also a bigger-picture motivation edge at play. With England's forward depth in focus, Solanke knows he's fighting to be a potential Harry Kane understudy this summer for England at the World Cup.",
      "Sunderland remain the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season. That is wild.",
      "But trends do snap and, in betting, timing when to step in to profit from such a run ending is a key weapon to use when trying to profit in this game. It's 19/5 with Sky Bet to end here - a price on a Burnley win that is too big to pass up.",
      "The absence of Granit Xhaka is pivotal. We saw exactly how fragile Sunderland can be without their midfield reference point in their worst performance of the season away at West Ham. Without Xhaka's control, leadership and ability to dictate tempo, Sunderland lost structure, lost composure and were far too easy to play through.",
      "Burnley need wins now. So their approach will be positive and the market is dangling a very juicy carrot towards us regarding their win prospects."
