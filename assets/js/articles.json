      "Former Liverpool striker Fabio Borini has revealed that he bought former Manchester United CEO Ed Woodward's house in a cut-price deal. The Italian international took advantage of unsavoury scenes to knock down the asking price of the home, once valued at around £2million.",
      "Borini made the purchase four years ago after Woodward was targeted by a gang of supporters who were discontent over how he was running the Red Devils. A smoke bomb and fireworks were set off at the property in 2020 in chaotic scenes.",
      "The mob also rang an intercom on the large gates at the entrance to the home before spraying it with red paint in unsettling visuals. Woodward, his wife, and their young twins were not at home when lit flares were thrown into the grounds.",
      "When the former United chief executive was ready to sell, Borini was more than happy to capitalise on the concerns of other prospective buyers. The forward, who was playing his trade with Turkish side Fatih Karagumruk in 2021, is now able to share the home with his wife Erin and his two young children, Stella and Lando.",
      "Borini said: “We bought the house four years ago, actually from the former CEO of Man United, Woodward.",
      "“Because of the protests outside, everybody was worried, so I said, ‘Don’t worry I’ll buy it, get the price down!'\"",
      "The Cheshire home has come in clutch with Borini now playing for Salford City in League Two. The 34-year-old last spent two years with Sampdoria in Serie B but made just 11 appearances last term after scoring nine goals in 23 matches in his first term.",
      "Borini was more than happy to embrace Salford's project and to provide his own input into the team. A summer conversation saw him sign on the dotted line earlier this month.",
      "He told the Times: “I spoke with Alex over the summer about the possibility and said I’m open to the opportunity of coming to Salford even if it was League Two.",
      "“They said, ‘Yes, you come and train, give a little bit to the group, be around the guys and help us, in a way, to understand if we’re doing the right things or the wrong things and you get fit’.",
      "“It doesn’t really matter the league or context, it’s about football. Salford is being built to be a proper football club.",
      "“It’s not like they’re throwing money around for no reason, it’s football people running a football club.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Dads across the world can rejoice at the news that even David Beckham embarrasses his kids at times. The England and Manchester United legend has one of the most recognisable faces on the planet, but even 'Golden Balls' is capable of cringe.",
      "Beckham's \"heartbreaking\" moment of realisation came after one particular school run. And it was after daughter Harper asked to be dropped off slightly away from the school that he discovered he wasn't as cool as he'd perhaps like.",
      "Wife Victoria made the revelation during an appearance on the Armchair Expert podcast in 2022. David has in the past made fun of his partner for getting dropped off at school by father Tony in a Rolls Royce as a child, and Victoria harked back to those times.",
      "\"We had the Rolls Royce, but because he was an electrical wholesaler he also had a van,\" she said. \"Me and my sister used to say like 'please drop us [off] in the van.'",
      "\"I think more kids at school were being dropped off in a van and so when we were in the Rolls, we'd be like 'oh please drop us down the road.' Nowadays, I'd be like literally pull up right to the front gate. And I'd be proud to get out of that Rolls.\"",
      "Harper, who was 11 at the time of recording, had her own similar moment of realisation after hitting the same point in her development. And the episode left its mark on Beckham as he struggled to come to terms with the fact his daughter was growing up.",
      "\"David was having this conversation the other day when he was dropping off Harper,\" Victoria continued. \"She was like, 'Daddy can you drop me a little bit away from the school?'",
      "She went on to say David was \"heartbroken\" before explaining: \"She's our youngest daughter, and he was like, 'Oh really, this is happening.' And then he was like, 'If it's uncool that David Beckham's your dad...' I mean let's be honest, what hope do most of the other kids have?\"",
      "Dads worldwide can take comfort from the fact even David Beckham isn't exempt from being sidelined. The former Real Madrid and LA Galaxy midfielder wasn't accustomed to playing a background role on the park, but fatherhood can clearly be more brutal than any manager.",
      "That being said, if there's anyone who can get away with distancing themselves from Dad, it's Harper. The Beckhams have three older sons in Brooklyn, 26, Romeo, 23, and Cruz, 20, but it's their 14-year-old daughter who will always be the apple of David's eye.",
      "\"Having a daughter is a whole new thing: it changes you,\" he once said of his experience being a girl-dad. \"I have no power with that little girl, no power whatsoever.",
      "\"I love all my children, of course, equally. But I am definitely stricter with the boys than I am with Harper. I can’t say no to her. I think I only said no to her once; her bottom lip started shivering and I was like: 'Never again.'",
      "\"She’s amazing. She’s a princess with Victoria – obviously she’s a big mummy’s girl – but she’s also a big daddy’s girl, which I love. I think she’s the best.\"",

      "Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola has discussed his future at the Premier League high-flyers. The Cherries currently sit second in the league and have earned plenty of praise for their impressive start to the season.",
      "Iraola’s side have picked up 18 points from their first nine games and rose to second following a 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest last Sunday. This weekend, Bournemouth will have their top four hopes tested away at Manchester City.",
      "Iraola was linked with the Manchester United job earlier this month, prior to the Red Devils’ upturn in results, and speculation this week has suggested he has admirers at Chelsea too. His deal is currently due to expire at the end of the season, with the Spanish coach joining Bournemouth at the end of his Rayo Vallecano contract in 2023.",
      "Bournemouth finished ninth last season and collected 56 points, their highest-ever Premier League tally. However, Iraola is refusing to get carried away and has compared his team’s fortunes to his own future at Bournemouth.",
      "\"Now we have City, Villa away, we could lose both games - that is probably a big chance - and people will start thinking, 'They were doing well and now they've dropped a little bit.'",
      "\"At the end you have to continue performing. You don't know where you are going to end [up], if your next job is going to be in a bigger club or your next job is going to be in a smaller club.",
      "\"I always say, I'm really happy here and I have to be at a very, very high level to have the chance to continue in Bournemouth. That's my concern. To perform well, you have to win a lot of games, you have to improve players, you have to do your job well so you can have good chances, like being in this club.\"",
      "Despite Iraola insisting he is happy at Bournemouth, the coach will continue to be linked with other clubs as his contract nears its end. With his future remaining uncertain, the 43-year-old has already explained that he does not take a short-term approach to his managerial career.",
      "\"It's not just a one-season thing, you have to be there to stay and get results with the teams that you have. As I've said before, if you don't have good players, it's going to be very difficult.",

      "Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny has lifted the lid on just how brilliant Marcus Rashford has been in training since his switch from Manchester United, branding the England star 'unstoppable'. Rashford made the move to the Spanish giants on a season-long loan deal during the summer, with Barcelona holding a £26.2million option to make the transfer permanent.",
      "The 28-year-old has netted five times and laid on seven assists in 13 appearances for Hansi Flick's side this campaign. Since the start of the season, he has made no secret of his ambition to seal a permanent switch to the Nou Camp when his loan spell concludes.",
      "Now Szczęsny has become the latest figure to sing Rashford's praises, offering insight into the forward's attitude and displays during training sessions.",
      "Despite Rashford's high number of goal contributions, Szczęsny thinks the England star 'deserves more' considering what he's been doing to his Barcelona team-mates in training.",
      "Chatting to Barcelona's official YouTube channel, the ex-Arsenal shot-stopper said: \"He's an excellent player, I love him a lot.",
      "\"Direct in his play, attacks with speed, and he's contributed to a lot of goals. I think he's a complete player, and I remember him since he was 18 or 19 in the Premier League. I knew he was special back then.\"",
      "He added: \"He has fewer goals than he deserves, because in training, when he's having a good day, you can't stop him. If he shows that magical right foot more in matches, he'll be very dangerous.\"",
      "Szczęsny's glowing praise of Rashford's training ethic follows further commendation at Aston Villa. After joining in the January transfer window, the forward contributed to 10 goals in 17 matches before an injury limited his playing time.",
      "Cole Brannigan, an Under-18s striker who often trained with Rashford, confessed in a chat with The News Letter that the United loanee is \"by far the best player\" he had witnessed technically with the ball. \"He was absolutely ridiculous,\" he exclaimed.",

      "Manchester United are in a confident mood after earning three consecutive Premier League wins. It is the club’s best run of league results since Ruben Amorim took charge last year, and the Red Devils will hope to extend their good form against Nottingham Forest this weekend.",
      "After a slow start to the campaign, United lifted themselves to sixth in the table through their 4-2 victory over Brighton. Goals from Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and a Bryan Mbeumo brace contributed to the feel-good performance at Old Trafford.",
      "The summer additions of Cunha and Mbeumo have helped bolster United’s frontline, while young forward Benjamin Sesko has also continued his development. Following the team’s string of positive results, United’s director of football Jason Wilcox has given an insight into the club’s future transfer strategy.",
      "Jadon Sancho endured the unfortunate experience of being replaced after coming on as a first-half substitute during Aston Villa’s win over Manchester City on Sunday. The 25-year-old came under scrutiny following his 45-minute display, though Villa manager Unai Emery explained that the decision was made to help with Sancho’s fitness levels.",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund star was one of the most coveted players in European football when he completed his £73million transfer to United. He has since struggled to reach those same heights, but former Villa striker Emile Heskey believes there is still time for Sancho to prove his doubters wrong.",
      "“It's a tough time for the lad, but he’s only young. He’s only 25, so the reality is that he can get his career back on track, but he really needs to figure out what he wants from his career,” Heskey told 10bet Casino, as reported by Birmingham Live. “He needs to start knuckling down and playing regular, consistent football.",
      "“We’ve seen little glimpses of it, but we aren’t seeing enough of it. Unless you play regularly, it’s hard to get that fitness up to where it needs to be.",
      "“Jadon needs to get sharper and work hard, because technically he’s as good as anyone. He’s probably technically better than all the other Villa players, but everyone else is ahead of him because they are delivering on the pitch while he isn’t.",
      "“That’s sad to see, given the heights he was at. He was flying at Dortmund, moved to United, was in the England team. Really at the top of the game, with the best platform. Now he’s down here, but the fascinating thing is he can still build himself back up.",
      "“For example, I went from Liverpool, then four years without England football, I knew I could build myself back up. I knew I could get back in, and he can do that too. I played at the World Cup, and he’s at a similar age to do the same.”",
      "Sancho's contract at United is set to expire at the end of this season but the Red Devils have the option to extend his deal for a further year. The winger has made five appearances in all competitions for Villa so far this term, including two starts.",
      "Jason Wilcox has indicated the type of players Manchester United will target in future transfer windows. Wilcox, who was named the club’s director of football in June, gave his verdict on United's summer business, which included a trio of forwards and new goalkeeper Senne Lammens, and believes the Red Devils can continue to improve by recruiting with the right mentality to succeed at Old Trafford.",
      "“We have got a clear plan. We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve,” Wilcox told MUTV. \"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad. We have got to buy the right players.",
      "“The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team. We are really happy with where we are.",
      "\"We know we have got to improve and, you know, the players, they will never be satisfied, Ruben will never be happy, I will never be happy, it is just how we are built. We are always looking to improve. Anybody who works at Manchester United should be thinking the same and they do, with the standards we are driving every day.”",

That turnaround comes after comments from Dyche earlier this year, in which he claimed that he would 'win more games' at Old Trafford by reverting back to basics.",

      "While United are back in form, the same cannot quite be said of Forest just yet. They have lost each of their last four Premier League games - the 2-0 defeat to Bournemouth last weekend leaving them 18th in the table with just five points to their name.",
      "There have been promising signs under Dyche though, the former Everton and Burnley boss having secured a 2-0 win against Portuguese giants Porto in the Europa League in his first game in charge.",

      "Luke Shaw's social media post featuring his son sporting a Marcus Rashford Barcelona shirt has triggered a wave of responses from his Manchester United teammates, including Rashford himself.",
      "Despite sealing a loan switch to Barcelona during the summer, Rashford continues to maintain strong bonds with the United squad after falling down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The 27-year-old forward has been thriving at Camp Nou, netting five times and providing seven assists across 13 appearances in all competitions. His exploits in Spain haven't gone unnoticed back at Old Trafford, particularly by Shaw's young son Reign.",
      "Shaw took to Instagram to share glimpses of his daily routine, including a photograph of Reign donning a Barca jersey emblazoned with 'Rashford' whilst copying the winger's trademark celebration.",
      "The post prompted a heartwarming reaction from Rashford, who responded with 'RS' alongside a heart emoji - widely interpreted as a response to Shaw's son, Reign.",
      "Morale at Carrington seems buoyant, with Shaw also posting a picture of Leny Yoro sporting a glittering gold blazer in the canteen.",
      "Many followers were baffled by his sartorial choice, prompting Rio Ferdinand to demand clarity: \"Leny, explain bro.\"",
      "The centre-half subsequently revealed he had 'lost a crossbar challenge' and suffered the consequences of a fresh training punishment. Skipper Bruno Fernandes responded with: \"Noooooo Leny Yoro.\"",
      "Another snapshot in the post showed Matheus Cunha beaming whilst displaying one of Shaw's United jerseys in his corner of the changing room.",

      "Nottingham Forest boss Sean Dyche has clarified his previous remarks about Manchester United under Ruben Amorim. Dyche, who previously managed Everton and Burnley, took over from former Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou at the City Ground on 21 October.",
      "The club was in a downward spiral under the Australian, failing to secure a win in any of their eight matches before owner Evangelos Marinakis gave him the boot just 17 minutes after a 3-0 loss to Chelsea earlier this month. So far, Dyche has overseen just two games for Forest - a victory against Porto in the Europa League and a defeat at Bournemouth last weekend.",
      "He is now preparing to manage his first home Premier League match for the East Midlands club this Saturday against United, with kick-off at 3pm. This weekend's fixture brings to light Dyche's previous comments about Amorim's tactics at Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking to the Stick to Football Podcast in May, Dyche suggested that he would have had more success than the Portuguese if he had been chosen to replace Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "\"He's not going to change the way he plays. He [Ruben Amorim] better win some games – pretty quick,\" Dyche said. \"I reckon if I went there and played my way, we'd win more games. Just 4-4-2 – give them basic rules of principles.",
      "\"We're all going, 'Fair play' – but, he's been there a while now so you better start bringing some wins soon.\"",
      "The 54-year-old has now set the record straight during Thursday's pre-match press conference - insisting his remarks were twisted out of all proportion.",
      "\"I didn't question him as a person and I would never do that. Clickbait kills anything,\" he said. \"I equally said I want managers to be given time and I said he should get half a season to continue what he's doing.",
      "\"I have maximum respect for all managers. I'm pretty sure his media department will have made that clear to him.",
      "\"The basics may have worked better was my suggestion and they have changed their style so fair play to him. Not necessarily their beliefs but their style.",
      "\"They are playing quicker forward and longer, a bit tighter in getting back into their shape. That's management, that's coaching.",
      "\"That doesn't mean he's changed his whole philosophy, it's adapting to what's in front of him so fair play to him. He's shown a bit of flexibility and they're getting results.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Amorim has revealed he grasps why Dyche initially took aim at his United squad.",
      "\"First of all, maybe it's true if we play 4-4-2,\" he smiled at his pre-match press conference on Thursday. \"We won more games, but I always said that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while, but in the future it's going to be better. So we don't know that. Then I can look at Sean Dyche as a manager and then as a pundit.",
      "\"If you are a pundit and you don't say very strong things, I don't want to watch you! I'm the same. So I can understand that it's a completely different job. I know that Sean Dyche is really smart and he knows how to play the game.",
      "\"And he also understands that one thing is when we are seeing the game and talking about the game, the other thing is to coach a team. So I understand that, I have nothing to say, I just want to win the next game.\"",

      "Carlo Ancelotti managed to persuade Kalidou Koulibaly to stay at Napoli following a huge transfer offer from Manchester United. Koulibaly has opened up on how the legendary Italian manager torpedoed a potential blockbuster deal for him at Old Trafford back in 2018.",
      "Seven years ago, Jose Mourinho was desperate to sign a top-quality centre-back for United and ear-marked Koulibaly as targets, alongside Harry Maguire and Toby Alderweireld. Koulibaly was at the top of his game for Napoli and United therefore submitted an offer, which the Senegal international remembers being worth €100million (£88m today).",
      "He was ready to jump ship and join the Premier League side, who then had Chris Smalling and Victor Lindelof as their first-choice pairing in central defence. But Napoli were unwilling to let him go – and it was Ancelotti’s intervention which made all the difference.",
      "“Napoli had received an offer worth €100m from Manchester United, but they rejected it,” Koulibaly recalled on the Zack en Roue Libre Podcast, as relayed by Tutto Mercato.",
      "“Ancelotti came to me and said: ‘I came here to win the Scudetto. What do you want to do?’ I replied: ‘I wanted to leave, why?'” He said he knew about the offer, but if I had left, he would have resigned the following day.”",
      "Koulibaly had joined Napoli from Genk in 2014 for around £6.5m and he felt the time was right to move on. But the experience and persuasive power of his manager ultimately saw him change his mind.",
      "“I thought my time at Napoli was over,” he added. “I had given my all. I had spent four seasons there, and I could have had the best contract of my career.",
      "“In the evening, Ancelotti called me and said: ‘Come to my room.’ He opened the door and said: ‘Ah, mon ami Kalidou!’ He spoke French, we were both wearing pyjamas. I was shocked. I explained to him that I wasn’t happy and that I thought the president had lacked respect towards me for the way he spoke.”",
      "The deal was scuppered and Koulibaly ended up staying with Napoli for a further four years before joining Chelsea in 2022. The centre-back lasted just one season with the Blues before leaving for Al-Hilal in 2023, where he remains to this day.",
      "United didn’t get their man with Koulibaly but did splash the cash the following summer, spending £80m to get Maguire from Leicester City. The England international remains at the club now and arrived in the 2019/20 season alongside Bruno Fernandes, who went on to take the captaincy off him.",

      "AS Monaco manager Sebastien Pocognoli believes Paul Pogba still has the technique he has shown in the past for Manchester United, Juventus and France. However, he recognised the French international's situation is different to that of some of his team-mates.",
      "Pogba hasn't played any senior competitive football in over two years. He was handed a four year ban after testing positive for a banned substance during his second Juventus stint, though this was reduced on appeal after it was determined he didn't intentionally commit a doping offence.",
      "The 32-year-old midfielder was brought to Stade Louis II when Adi Hutter was manager, but the Austrian was dismissed in early October. Pocognoli has taken over in the dugout, and is close to being able to call upon Pogba in domestic competition and in the Champions League.",
      "\"Paul is closer to returning than Denis (fellow midfielder Denis Zakaria), even though his absence was much longer,\" Pocognoli said. \"I said this week would be used to answer some more questions, and every day is part of that process.",
      "\"For the moment, things are going well; I expect it to be a short time before he’s back with the group. When he returns, we’ll need to work together to assess him as a player.. The Paul of Manchester United or his first period at Juventus dates back several years now.\"",
      "Reflecting on the differences between Pogba and his team-mates, Pocognoli added: \"Every player develops according to their age and experience, so we’ll have to judge him based on his background and his age. From what I can see, he still possesses the technique we know he has. The rhythm of the matches will then give us some answers to all these questions.",
      "\"He can be the best version of himself at AS Monaco; in any case, it will be my role to try and guide him towards that level, to try and stimulate all his qualities and his potential. It’s the same for every player, but it’s different for him. I hope to get the most out of what he has to offer us.\"",
      "Pocognoli, who began the season with Belgian club Union SG, is unbeaten in three matches in Ligue 1. He also earned a point in his first Champions League game with his new employers, drawing 0-0 at home to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Most recently, they came out on top in a 5-3 thriller away to Nantes. The three points were enough to lift Pocognoli's team up to second in the Ligue 1 table, just a point adrift of leaders Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Next up for Monaco is another home match, with 12th place Paris FC heading to the principality. It's followed by a Champions League trip to Bodo/Glimt, with the new boss looking to pick up a first win in the competition.",

United boss Amorim has only recently won three Premier League games in a row for the first time, despite taking charge of the Red Devils nearly a year ago, symbolic of his struggles at Old Trafford.",
      "The Portuguese has been heavily criticised for sticking to his 3-4-2-1 formation which until now hasn't been getting results. Amorim used that shape to great success at Sporting Lisbon but he could only guide United to 15th in his first season, the club's lowest-ever Premier League finish.",
      "In May, as the Red Devils' dreadful campaign was coming to an end, Dyche - now in charge of Nottingham Forest, who play United on Saturday - appeared on a podcast. The former Watford, Burnley and Everton boss claimed that if he was given the job, he'd do a better job than Amorim at the time.",
      "At a press conference on Thursday, ahead of their meeting at the City Ground, Dyche's comments were put to Amorim. \"First of all, maybe it's true if we play 4-4-2 we win more, but I always said that I have a way of playing that is going to take a while,\" the United manager replied.",
      "\"Then I can look at Sean Dyche as a manager and then as a pundit. If you are a pundit and you don't say very strong things, I don't want to watch you! So I can understand that it's a different job. I know that Sean Dyche is really smart and he knows how to play the game.",

      "\"I reckon if I went there and played my way, we'd win more games. Just 4-4-2 - give them basic rules of principles. They have some good players. You don't have to over teach everyone.",
      "\"I'd be interested more in the longer run, if he can stick to his principals and then next season, we're all going, 'Fair play' - but, he's been there a while now so you better start bringing some wins soon.\"",
      "The pair will shake hands in the dugout before Saturday's 3pm kick-off, with their sides in very different situations. Amorim is looking for a fourth successive win while Dyche is aiming for his first league victory at Forest, having suffered a 2-0 loss away to high-flying Bournemouth last weekend.",

      "The Reds travel to face Forest, looking to make it four straight wins in the top flight, after beating Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton. Amorim's side would move up to second in the table - for a matter of hours at least - if they win at The City Ground.",
      "In his press conference, Amorim was asked about the club's injury situation, including Martinez's fitness, Forest's start to life since Sean Dyche replaced Ange Postecoglou and how United are going to cope without Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo during AFCON. So, with that in mind, The Mirror has taken a look at the best from the Portuguese's chat with the media on Thursday.",
      "Amorim has reminded Martinez who calls the shots after revealing the defender had made it clear that he desperately wanted to play against Nottingham Forest. The Argentine, however, has been told he is going to have to wait for his return to action.",
      "Martinez has been sidelined since February after injuring his Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) against Crystal Palace, but was back in training with his United teammates earlier this week.",
      "Asked for an update on Martinez and whether he could make his return against Forest, Amorim said: \"He wants to go to this one [Forest], he isn't going to this one. He's going to need time.",
      "\"He has started training with us. Slowly, he is going to get better.",
      "\"It's really good. He gives use that edge in every training session, that is also really good for us. The rest of the guys we have one day. I don't know about Harry Maguire, the rest are fit.\"",
      "Amorim has praised three Nottingham Forest players ahead of Manchester United's trip to the East Midlands. The United head coach singled out England stars Morgan Gibbs-White, Elliot Anderson and Callum Hudson-Odoi as the main dangermen.",
      "The United boss also revealed that he has watched Forest closely since Dyche took over the reins. The ex-Burnley and Everton boss has won one and lost one game in charge of Forest since replacing Ange Postecoglou earlier this month, beating Porto in the Europa League and falling to a 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth.",
      "\"I watched against Porto, I watched against Bournemouth, the style of play is similar, with different characteristics,\" Amorim said. \"I watched one game that we didn't pre-season with Sporting, so to try to understand how he played in that game. It's similar, he can change some characteristics of the players with the talent that they have, especially with Gibbs-White, Anderson, Hudson-Odoi, very good players.",
      "\"So we need to be prepared for a different game against Brighton. We had space to play. We are not going to have that space. You need to understand that we are not being the same team away and at home, so we need to improve the way we control the environment. Every tackle is a big moment for the opponent's fans, so we need to play better away. We are prepared for a very tough match.\"",
      "Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo won't be involved for a period in December and January due to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) - and Amorim believes the Reds are going to \"struggle\" without them.",
      "The tournament is set to start on Sunday, December 21, before running through Christmas and the New Year, with the final taking place on Sunday, January 18.",
      "\"We will have time to suffer,\" Amorim said when asked about Amad and Mbeumo's expected absence. \"We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew it's going to be an opportunity.",
      "\"When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing, but it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us.",
      "\"They are understanding the way we want to play, so if we are improving on that, the change of characteristics is not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team. But let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and we will see in general.\"",

      "The defender took part in outdoor training sessions towards the end of pre-season and Ruben Amorim added him to the Red Devils' new six-man leadership group, a sign that he remains a crucial member of the squad. But Martinez has had to be patient after being made to continue working individually for slightly longer than expected.",
      "Earlier this month, the Argentina international saw his return to first-team training delayed by a minor setback. Now Martinez has finally been given the all-clear and was spotted getting stuck in at Carrington on Thursday ahead of United's trip to face Nottingham Forest.",
      "Saturday's Premier League fixture could come too soon for Martinez, who'll be a topic of discussion in Amorim's pre-match press conference on Thursday afternoon. The Red Devils have one more game before the November international break, away to Tottenham next weekend.",
      "Quizzed on Martinez's progress last week, Amorim replied: \"He's feeling well. The knee is responding really well, so I don't want to say one specific day or one week.",
      "\"I don't know, but it's near to start the training with the team. Then it depends on the rhythm of Licha, if he wins the place or not, that will depend on him, but he's closer to return to training.\"",
      "Previously, the United manager made it clear how sorely missed the former Ajax star has been. \"We miss a lot Licha, especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does, we miss him,\" Amorim admitted.",
      "But Martinez won't have an easy route back into the Red Devils' defence. Luke Shaw has been ever present in the Premier League this season, operating as the left-sided centre-back.",
      "Shaw, whose own injury troubles are well documented, assisted a goal in United's 4-2 win against Brighton on Saturday. Harry Maguire, Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt have also impressed this term, with Noussair Mazraoui and Ayden Heaven also featuring in the back three.",
      "Martinez won't have opportunities in cups before January either, as Amorim's side were dumped out of the Carabao Cup in August. The 27-year-old has been keen to stay involved in team affairs, regularly attending meetings and travelling to matches, despite not being able to play.",

      "Manchester United have a clear disadvantage in the race for Karl Etta Eyong, it has been claimed. Barcelona will reportedly be able to land the Levante star for considerably less than the Red Devils, with his current club putting in place different release clauses for different buyers.",
      "Barcelona are said to see Etta Eyong as a long-term successor to Robert Lewandowski, whose own future in Catalunya is far from secure. Interestingly, United themselves have been linked with Lewandowski only for owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe to dash those hopes.",
      "Lewandowski, 37, is out of contract next summer and has been tipped to leave as Barca aim to trim their wage bill. United appear to be moving away from the approach of signing older players on big wages, though, following expensive gambles in years gone by.",
      "If he does move on, Barcelona will have a lot of goals to replace, with the former Bayern Munich star scoring 105 times in 156 appearances. Hansi Flick's side have been sharing the goals around this term, with United loanee Marcus Rashford helping boost the front-line, and Etta Eyong could add further goals next term.",
      "The 22-year-old only joined Levante over the summer, having scored his first La Liga goal for former club Villarreal last season. He has made a flying start, though, scoring five times in seven league outings for his new club.",
      "According to Mundo Deportivo (via Football Espana), it will cost Barcelona £26.4million to sign Etta Eyong. For Premier League clubs, though, the magic number sits at £35.2m.",
      "Manchester City, Arsenal and Real Madrid have also been linked with the 22-year-old, it has been claimed. However, Barca's interest comes with the club potentially looking at cheaper alternatives to Flick target and Borussia Dortmund hotshot Serhou Guirassy.",
      "Guirassy, 29, is expected to be available for just north of £57m. A relatively late bloomer, the Guinea international scored 28 Bundesliga goals in his final season with former club Stuttgart and 21 last term for current employers Dortmund - along with a tournament-leading 13 in the Champions League.",
      "United, meanwhile, may find themselves in the market for attacking reinforcements in 2026 despite a busy summer. Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko arrived at a combined cost of around £200m, but if United return to European competition they may feel the need for further additions.",
      "The funds for any new forwards may well come from selling Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund. Both men are spending the season out on loan, at Barcelona and Napoli respectively, and permanent exits could follow next summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Jason Wilcox has confirmed Manchester United will make further investment into their playing squad and revealed the two transfer rules the club now follows. The Red Devils spent big during the summer transfer window, bringing in an entirely new front line and anointing a new first-choice goalkeeper.",
      "The most high-profile arrivals were Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, while Senne Lammens arrived from Royal Antwerp on deadline day. After a slow start to the season, United have turned a corner under Ruben Amorim of late, winning their last three matches in the Premier League to leap to sixth in the table.",
      "And Wilcox has revealed that United will make further investment to challenge for major honours but warned that new players will only be recruited who are the right character and add something different. He said: “Yeah the guys have settled in really, really quickly. I think especially when you look at Matheus and Bryan, they have played in the Premier League and they have lived in England, so there is a quicker transition.",
      "“I think for Benji and Senne, you look at their transition and they have transitioned really well. We are really pleased. They are two young players, two for the future, but they have settled in amazingly well.",
      "“They are all good guys, even from last summer's window, they are top professionals, top players and we are really optimistic we are going in the right direction.",
      "“We have a clear plan. I am sure there are going to be bumps in the road but we have just got to make sure we stay calm irrespective of the noise outside.",
      "“I see the intensity, I am at training every day, I see the way that they train, the way they apply themselves, the way they communicate and get on with each other.",
      "“Like I say, when you lose football matches you are always going to be a little bit disappointed and especially at this club.”",
      "But despite United's impressive form, Wilcox revealed that both him and Amorim are in agreement that now is not the time to be satisfied. He said: “We have got a clear plan. We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "“For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad. We have got to buy the right players.",
      "“The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.",
      "“We are really happy with where we are, we know we have got to improve and, you know, the players, they will never be satisfied, Ruben will never be happy, I will never be happy, it is just how we are built.",

      "Paul Scholes has doubled down on the view that Declan Rice is 'not his type' of midfielder. The player-turned-pundit recently received criticism for believing that Sandro Tonali is better than the Arsenal man.",
      "\"I get slagged off for this,\" Scholes said while appearing as a guest on episode 100 of The Overlap's Stick to Football podcast. \"I did a top five the other week, and I didn't put people like [Moises] Caicedo and Declan Rice, because I like a different type of midfielder.",
      "\"I like a Vitinha at PSG, I think he's brilliant - he's amazing. I thought [Alexis] Mac Allister last year, at Liverpool, was brilliant; now he's not started great this year.\"",
      "The Manchester United legend explained: \"I like that more, not so much an attacking midfielder, but that more controlling one who can do a bit of everything. Not just the defensive one who just gets around it and might score the odd goal here and there, I like the more progressive type.\"",
      "When asked about his ideal England midfield, Scholes said: \"[Jude] Bellingham has to be in there just because of his goals, ain't he? Not just for his goals, he's a good player.",
      "\"I'm trying to think of a midfield player, but my mind's gone blank. I know there's Declan Rice, and people say, 'you didn't have Declan Rice in your top five,' because he's not my type of midfield player.\"",
      "Scholes made his preference for Tonali over Rice known during The Overlap Fan Debate earlier this month. \"I think he's better than Rice,\" Scholes said when asked about the Newcastle United midfielder.",
      "\"I really like Rice, don't get me wrong, I think he's got everything. Sometimes he takes a few too many touches of the ball and tries to look a bit more stylish than necessary.",
      "\"He can do everything, but I don't think he does it enough. I prefer Tonali, but they're both good players.\"",
      "On Stick to Football, Scholes said: \"I don't think we [England] have that type of controlling midfield player now that can do a bit of everything. We haven't got a Vitinha, we haven't got a Toni Kroos or a [Luka] Modric from them days, I just don't think we have that.",
      "\"A while ago, Jack Wilshere was probably the closest to being that type, but obviously, a load of injuries and stuff stopped him. I just don't think we've got that type, who has that game intelligence, of when to slow it down, when to fizz it into a centre-forward, I just don't think there's that intelligence around.\"",

      "Levante striker Karl Etta Eyong looks set to put Manchester United and Arsenal on a collision course for his signature. It's little wonder why the Cameroonian sensation has earned comparisons to Barcelona superstar Robert Lewandowski given his latest performances in La Liga.",
      "In truth, there may not be a major European power without their eyes on Etta Eyong at present in his current run of form. The 22-year-old has scored six goals in La Liga so far this season, with only Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe (11) having netted more.",
      "That's put a host of continental heavyweights on alert, with Real Madrid, Barca and Manchester City also said to be interested. And his star only looks set to shine more brightly after Mundo Deportivo reported he'd like to cement his future sooner rather than later.",
      "It's claimed Barca are ramping up interest in the youngster, whom they are believed to see as a replacement for Lewandowski. The Poland icon has been prolific in Catalonia but is now 37 and in the last year of his contract, though Barcelona do have the option to extend his stay by a further 12 months.",
      "Both United and Arsenal each bought new strikers in the summer. The Red Devils plumped to purchase Benjamin Sesko, while the Gunners finally moved for a new frontman and secured Sweden's Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "However, Etta Eyong could present an opportunity that's too good to pass up. Mundo Deportivo reported the player has a buyout clause in his contract that's worth roughly £26.5million for La Liga clubs, while Premier League sides would have to pay around £35m.",
      "Not a bad turnaround for Levante considering the Frogs only spent around £4m buying him from Villarreal in the summer. Around £2.5m of that went to the Yellow Submarine, while previous club Cadiz - who are due a percentage of his sell-on fee - received roughly £1.5m.",
      "Etta Eyong cannot play for a third club this season after already representing both Villarreal and Levante. He made a fast start to the campaign under Marcelino and made a direct goal contribution in each of Villarreal's first three league games before moving to the Valencia-based outfit.",
      "And his work has only continued to impress, bringing his total in La Liga this term to six goals and three assists overall. To put those figures into context, Mbappe is the only player in Spain's top flight with more direct goal contributions this season.",
      "According to Mundo Deportivo, the player would like to join a new club in January before being loaned back to Levante. Not only that, but it's understood his preference is to join Barcelona, whose colours he has been snapped sporting in the past.",
      "It's difficult to envision either United or Arsenal making a move for the player as soon as this winter. Each club spent mammoth amounts adding new forwards over the summer, so funds to spend so significantly in that area again may not be available.",
      "Their loss could prove to be the gain of any club with the initiative to move swiftly for a star quickly causing waves in La Liga, however. And Barcelona may already have an in-road to recruit Lewandowski's natural successor.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Premier League and EFL clubs are prohibited from signing players from overseas until they reach 18, and all transfers from European countries necessitate a work permit, which is allocated using a points system. It's not uncommon for United to be named in transfer rumours as a tactic used by agents to gain leverage.",

      "Manchester United loanee Andre Onana's form since moving to Trabzonspor in September has been described as \"outstanding\".",
      "Onana was allowed to leave Old Trafford in the summer after Senne Lammens arrived at Old Trafford. After defeat to Fenerbahce on his Trabzonspor debut, Onana has not lost since.",
      "His side are currently on a four-game winning run which has lifted them to second in the table ahead of Saturday's trip to league leaders Galatasaray. Ahead of that match, MEN Sport spoke to Trabzonspor sports reporter Hasan Tuncel to discuss Onana's time at the Turkish club so far.",
      "\"In one word: outstanding,\" Tuncel said when asked how Onana had fared in his early months at the club. \"Onana’s debut came in the match against Fenerbahce. Trabzonspor lost 1–0, but the story of that game was far deeper than the scoreline.",
      "\"A Trabzonspor goal was controversially disallowed, creating real tension on the pitch. During that chaos, Onana’s leadership stood out - he calmed his teammates, used his experience, and pulled off some remarkable saves.",
      "\"From that moment on, not just the fans in Turkey but everyone watching internationally saw that he is still a top-level goalkeeper. He has maintained the same standard in the following matches.",
      "\"His performance against Kayserispor was phenomenal - he practically saved every shot on target. In the match against Eyupspor, his two crucial saves were instrumental in keeping Trabzonspor’s title hopes alive.",
      "\"So far, he’s been flawless. Beyond his goalkeeping, he’s become a leader in the dressing room.",
      "\"He personally mentors three young goalkeepers — Onuralp Cevikkan, Ahmet Dogan Yildirim, and Erolcan Colak — guiding them during and after training sessions. This mentorship has earned him great respect within the club.\"",
      "Tuncel admitted the reaction to Onana's arrival within the Trabzonspor fanbase was one of caution. Onana represented a significant investment for the club and his woes at United had been well-documented in Turkey.",
      "However, the welcome he received upon his arrival was on a different scale to high-profile signings of the past. \"In Trabzonspor’s culture, big-name signings are usually welcomed with great passion - but Onana’s arrival was something beyond the usual,\" he explained.",
      "\"We’ve seen large crowds at the airport before for players like Daniel Sturridge or John Obi Mikel, yet Onana’s reception had a different atmosphere. Because he arrived with his family, the club decided to organize a more personalized and emotional welcome.",
      "\"Fans interacted with him directly, telling him: 'Don’t worry, we’re with you all the way.' That moment, combined with Onana’s smile, created a very symbolic image.",
      "\"Players who come with their families usually adapt much faster - and that’s a crucial factor in professional football. Onana taking this process seriously and settling in with his family was seen as a very positive sign by both the club and its supporters.\"",
      "There is a sense that Onana has found the right environment to thrive but the chances of him signing permanently look to be slim. \"The club is extremely happy with his performances, but given the transfer fee Manchester United paid for him, a permanent deal looks financially difficult at the moment,\" Tuncel admitted.",
      "\"However, if Onana continues at this level and United lower their asking price, I have no doubt Trabzonspor would be interested in making a formal move.",
      "\"For now, the focus is on having Onana mentor the club’s young goalkeepers and help them grow. But if conditions become favourable, Trabzonspor would definitely love to keep him permanently.\"",

      "It's funny what can happen in just 12 months in football - you only need to ask Casemiro.",
      "Casemiro was hooked at half-time against Liverpool at the beginning of September 2024 and replaced by Toby Collyer, which felt like the beginning of the end for the Brazilian.",
      "Erik ten Hag had stood by Casemiro after his horror show at Selhurst Park near the end of the previous season, but his patience had worn thin, resulting in the removal of the midfielder at the interval. \"It was tactical because we were 2-0 down,” said Ten Hag about his substitution.",
      "Collyer had usurped Casemiro in the pecking order, but he was loaned to West Brom in the summer, and the Brazilian has enjoyed a renaissance to become an important player again.",
      "After Brighton, Ruben Amorim said: \"I think he gives a lot of experience, he is an example for everyone. In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer].",
      "\"But he fought and worked and now he is back in the national team. He is so important to us. He ran a lot, today he had to fight and press, and then return. I'm really pleased with him.",
      "\"And the other guys need to look at Casemiro. To understand that football can change really fast. You just need to work for me. If I think you are the best one to play a game, then you will.\"",
      "United were leading 3-0 against Brighton last weekend when Casemiro was replaced in the 70th minute. Brighton scored two goals following the substitution to set up a nervy end to the game.",
      "United have only conceded three goals this season when Casemiro has been on the pitch. They have conceded 16 goals in all competitions and 13 have gone in when Casemiro has not been on the field.",
      "Casemiro has started every Premier League game except against Brentford due to a suspension. United lost that match 3-1 at the Gtech Community Stadium and Manuel Ugarte looked off the pace in midfield.",
      "Amorim has relied on Casemiro during this campaign. The player deserves credit for an unlikely resurgence, although his improvement can be traced back to Ruud van Nistelrooy's interim tenure last year.",
      "Van Nistelrooy immediately put an arm around Casemiro and leaned on his experience. He started Casemiro in each of his four games as interim manager and launched a passionate defence of his squad role after United's dominant 5-2 win against Leicester City in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Casemiro scored two brilliant goals in that game, and Van Nistelrooy said: \"I was delighted for Casemiro. The way he's been training and helping the team, the club, it's such an example.",
      "\"If you see him train and prepare for games, with the history and all he's achieved with five Champions Leagues, he's an example for us and that was part of my celebration - I was happy for him.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy lifted Casemiro at a time when it seemed like everything was going against him. The Dutchman placed his trust in him and reminded him of what he was still capable of.",
      "Casemiro had to prove himself to Amorim following his appointment from Sporting Lisbon. By the end of January, Casemiro had started in four of Amorim's 18 games in charge.",
      "Amorim suggested Casemiro no longer had the \"characteristics\" to start regularly, but everything changed in the spring. Casemiro was instrumental in the Europa League campaign, better-suited to the pace of the competition, and he delivered a midfield clinic in the quarter-final comeback against Lyon.",
      "Casemiro won the penalty in the 114th minute against Lyon, he found Kobbie Mainoo for the equaliser and he assisted again with a wonderful cross into the box for Harry Maguire's winner.",
      "Amorim lept off his feet on the touchline and perhaps that performance was the turning point. Casemiro started alongside Bruno Fernandes in the Europa League final, with Ugarte named on the bench.",
      "Casemiro has forced his way back into Amorim's plans. He has showcased the character that propelled him to become the world's finest defensive midfielder during his nine-year stint at Real Madrid.",
      "Now, there is a conversation among supporters about extending his contract. Casemiro has entered the final year of his deal and the club has the option of extending by 12 months.",
      "Regardless of how well Casemiro has performed and his importance to the team, his contract should not be extended. United must take a long-term view and it's not logical to extend Casemiro's contract when he's in the winter of his career. This season should be his swansong.",
      "The fact that there is even a conversation among some fans about extending Casemiro's deal is a credit to him, but United must allow him to leave in the summer and sign a replacement.",
      "Casemiro will be 34 in February. How long he can keep up this level of performance is up for debate. Amorim will hope the kinder schedule will help him maintain his current performances.",
      "United must return to the Champions League and securing a top-four finish will be a fitting way for Casemiro to bow out.",

      "\"Licha is really important for us, not just as a player, but as a character,\" Ruben Amorim said after Manchester United defender Lisandro Martinez picked up an ACL injury against Crystal Palace in February.",
      "The injury was a body blow for a player who has had a number of injury problems since arriving at United. Martinez proved pundits wrong following his move to Old Trafford but there is a fear his injury issues could prevent him from becoming a regular in the starting XI for years to come.",
      "After nine months away, Martinez is close to a return. United confirmed before Amorim's press conference on Thursday that the Argentine had rejoined his teammates in training.",
      "While he did want to travel to Nottingham Forest, Amorim has insisted that Martinez will not be in the squad. However, should he be in a position to travel to Tottenham Hotspur next week, it would be a huge boost for the Reds.",
      "Martinez is now a member of the leadership group at United. While he has still been around his teammates during his time on the sidelines, his absence on the pitch means he will not have been as influential in the months he's been out as he would have liked to have been.",
      "His impending return means Amorim will soon have his full leadership group fit and available. Harry Maguire, who is also part of the leadership group, is a doubt for the trip to the City Ground but his injury is not thought to be a long-term issue.",
      "Whether Martinez comes straight back into the starting line-up once fully fit is another question. Luke Shaw has played well and is the man to beat for a place in the squad.",
      "But just having Martinez back in the squad will be a huge boost for Amorim. His personality and hunger to win will bring a fresh wave of positivity into a squad that is already on a high thanks to their current run of form.",
      "United will soon have their entire leadership group available for selection for the first time this season.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United transfer blog on Friday, October 31.",
      "The January transfer window is now just two months away, and United are preparing for another busy period. While business is often challenging to conduct in the winter window, Ruben Amorim's men have been linked with a host of players.",
      "United are in red-hot form at the moment after claiming their third win in a row against Brighton last weekend. After beating Sunderland and Liverpool, the Reds will be hoping to maintain their form against Nottingham Forest tomorrow afternoon.",
      "As well as all the build-up to that game, we will bring you the latest transfer talk from Old Trafford. A new midfielder continues to be heavily linked with a move, alongside Angelo Stiller, Carlos Baleba, and Morten Hjulmand.",
      "This week, new links to West Ham United's Lucas Paqueta and Lille's Ayyoub Bouaddi have also emerged. The possible signing of a new operator in Amorim's midfield could spell the end of Kobbie Mainoo's time at the club, for the rest of the season at least, with Napoli preparing a move.",
      "Stay tuned below to stay up to date with the latest transfer news and build-up to the Nottingham Forest game...",
      "Reports in Spain have claimed that Man United are willing to offer Real Madrid Kobbie Mainoo in order to bring Endrick to Old Trafford.",
      "Defensa Central have claimed that Los Blancos are keen on Mainoo, but would like to send the striker the other way. Endrick hasn't played for Madrid this season and is almost guaranteed to secure a loan move in January.",
      "And it's good news for Man United. Football365 have claimed that the Reds have 'taken the lead' in the race to sign Adam Wharton.",
      "United's interest in the Crystal Palace star is said to have 'shocked Real Madrid management' with them working on a deal worth £61.5m.",
      "Adding another attacking midfielder has been touted by Man Unitd with Football365 suggesting that an approach has been made to West Ham over a possible move for Lucas Paqueta.",
      "The report claims they have 'asked for more details' to determine a fee for the Brazilian. It comes after The Times confirmed Paqueta's decision to leave the relegation-threatened club in January.",
      "Paqueta, 28, is under contract until 2027.",
      "Napoli are preparing a new attempt to sign Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window.",
      "The Italian champions wanted to sign him in the summer but Ruben Amorim was keen on keeping the midfielder. Gazzetta dello Sport have now claimed that Napoli are exploring a loan proposal, either a straight loan or a loan with performance-related clauses.",
      "Man United are reportedly actively monitoring Lille superstar Ayyoub Bouaddi.",
      "GIVEMESPORT have claimed that United have kept tabs on the midfielder since 2023 with Christopher Vivell maintaining a close eye on him in recent months.",
      "Bouaddi's contract in France expires in 2027 and it's said a fee of £40m could be enough to get the deal over the line.",
      "Yesterday, it was revealed that Lisandro Martinez is back in training with his Man United teammates as he continues his rehabilitation from an ACL injury.",
      "The defender has been out since February. Forest comes too soon for him but there is a chance he's in the squad for the Tottenham clash next week.\"Licha is on the final straight,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is a soldier who works so hard. He is always in the gym working hard. He works hard both on and off the pitch. He is a machine that works so hard. He is one those players who love to work hard. It is a pleasure to have him here.",
      "\"He works so much. We arrived at 9am, it's now 4pm and he continues working. He has the experience to know when to work hard. I am so glad - not just me, everyone - because he is an essential player at the club.\"",
      "AC Milan are reportedly keen on signing Joshua Zirkzee in January in a plan to replace Santiago Gimenez.",
      "Goal have claimed that the Dutchman is their main target for the transfer window with CEO Giorgio Furlani and sporting director Igli Tare scouting alternatives.",
      "Ruben Amorim has admitted that his side will struggle without Bryan Mbeumo and Amad when they go to the African Cup of Nations.",
      "\"We will have time to suffer,\" Amorim laughed. \"We are going to struggle a little bit, but we already knew it's going to be an opportunity. When I watch the training, there are players that should be playing.",
      "\"But it's hard with one game to take some players from the team, because they are doing well also during the training in games. So other players are going to have the opportunity to help us.",
      "\"They are understanding the way we want to play, so if we are improving on that, the change of characteristics is not going to change the idea or the momentum of the team. But let's use Amad and Bryan in these games and we will see in general.\"",
      "Man United are not currently pursuing AIK's young striker Kevin Filling.",
      "United's academy is essentially limited to a UK-based recruitment search due to Brexit rules.",
      "Filling is 16 years old, which means he could not join United in January, as reports have suggested.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Hello and good morning, Manchester United fans!",
      "Off-the-pitch, transfer business is heating up. Stay tuned and we'll bring you all the latest news..."

      "Manchester United's recent meetings with Nottingham Forest have not been matches to remember for supporters.",
      "Last season's trip to the City Ground in the Premier League was a night to forget. United dominated but it was Forest who picked up the win.",
      "To make matters worse, it was United old boy Anthony Elanga who ran through the heart of the Reds' defence to slot the ball past Andre Onana. The sight of Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho desperately tracking back before Noussair Mazraoui was tied up in knots will haunt Ruben Amorim to this day.",
      "Since then, Nuno Espirito Santo has been sacked by Forest, as has Ange Postecoglou, and now it is Sean Dyche at the helm. While not sharing exactly the same approach, Dyche will be looking to emulate Nuno in exploiting United on the counter.",
      "During that 1-0 defeat in April, United enjoyed 68 per cent possession and were ultimately caught out having committed too many men to their attack. A subtle change in recent matches suggests this may not be an issue against Forest this weekend.",
      "In their run of three straight victories, United have had more possession than their opponents in just one of those games - against Sunderland. In those matches, the Reds have been comfortable without the ball and have kept themselves defensively solid.",
      "The goals United conceded against Brighton both came from dead ball scenarios. Against Liverpool, one of the best teams in the country when it comes to turning defence into attack, Amorim's side did well to avoid not being picked off on the counter-attack.",
      "United are likely to see more of the ball than they did against Brighton and Liverpool. But the key for Amorim's team will be to not over-commit.",
      "United's pressing against the Seagulls was impressive and there will still be room for that at Forest. However, ensuring the back three and Casemiro are always aware of the possible threat on the counter will be key.",

In that case, negotiations could take place for a fee around €50m or €60m (£44m or £53m), but it is very difficult to imagine a transfer in January. It is way more likely in the summer.",

      "At the time, England was seen explaining the decision before brandishing the red card and former PGMOL chief and ex-FIFA referee Keith Hackett admitted that it opened the referee up to backlash.",
      "\"The red card issued by Darren England is correct, this is a challenge with excessive force, that endangers the safety of his opponent,\" he told Football Insider. \"Frankly, [when refereeing myself] I monitored the player leaving the field of play without engaging in any discussion, it is easy in the heat of the situation to be accused of saying something.",
      "\"You should monitor for sure, but there is no point of explaining why the player is being sent off, it is pretty obvious when you make a challenge with such force.”",
      "This week, the Premier League have announced their match officials appointments for the weekend's action and England will be in charge for United's trip to the City Ground. Scott Ledger and Akil Howson will be his assistants, with Bobby Madley joining the managers in the technical area.",
      "VAR for Saturday's game is Tim Robinson and Paul Howard his assistant.",
      "Fanatics has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 60% off select items.",

      "Manchester United's preparations for the weekend game against Nottingham Forest are already underway.",
      "United made it three wins on the spin on Saturday as they beat Brighton and Hove Albion 4-2 at Old Trafford. The players who were unused substitutes against the Seagulls or played limited minutes at the weekend took part in Sunday's training session, as did a number of academy players who were called up to boost the numbers.",
      "The club have released a short video of the training session and MEN Sport picked out three key points from the workout.",
      "Before Brighton, Amorim confirmed that Mason Mount was a doubt for the fixture, which instantly caused concern given his track record with injuries.",
      "He managed to be fit enough for a place on the bench but was not risked against the Seagulls. He took part in Sunday's training session and looked to be moving freely as he aims to regain his place in the team on Saturday.",
      "As the current back-up goalkeeper, Altay Bayindir was involved in the session along with Tom Heaton. The Turkish goalkeeper took part in a small-sided game with the outfield players.",
      "While United have looked to be more direct with Senne Lammens in goal, being able to play out from the back is still a big part of modern-day football, and Bayindir is clearly keen to get the practice in with his feet.",
      "Harry Maguire was not spotted participating in the session having missed the win over Brighton through injury.",
      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford is enjoying a career revival at Barcelona.",
      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",
      "Speaking before the clash with Real Madrid, Rashford told ESPN: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "Rashford is benefitting from a change of scenery, culture and team. It is not a case that the 27-year-old has suddenly been relieved of all pressure, because United and Barca are comparable on that front.",
      "But in England he was under the spotlight daily and, in a struggling side, he was expected to be the main man. Eyes aren't always on Rashford to be the key man in Barcelona.",
      "United and Rashford will always be linked but that chapter is now closed.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt urged his Manchester United teammates to cut out mistakes and take responsibility when he spoke after the disappointing Brentford defeat in September.",
      "United suffered a big setback at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ruben Amorim's future subsequently dominated headlines, but Amorim has enjoyed an October to remember.",
      "Amorim must be in contention to win manager of the month after impressive wins against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, which have seen United climb up to sixth in the table.",
      "So what has been the difference? Amorim has made a few tweaks. Senne Lammens made his debut against Sunderland before the international break and the goalkeeper punted most of his goal kicks long.",
      "Benjamin Sesko was found regularly by Lammens and speaking after the victory, Mason Mount said about the goalkeeper's impressive impact: \"It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben [Sesko] and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot.\"",
      "Amorim hinted that supporters could see the same against Liverpool. \"I think if you look at nowadays, every time the ball goes to the goalkeeper, most of the teams play man-to-man,\" he said.",
      "\"Sometimes you don't have anyone to play and you try to use the first ball with the second ball and try to win. When you have players with a lot of power in front and now we have it. If we win one second ball, we can take all that build-up from the game and have the opportunity to score.",
      "\"I think everyone is doing that. Senne has one ability that is really good. He can play with both feet. It's harder for the opponents to try to make the pressure from one side or the other.",
      "\"They know that he can kick the ball with both feet and I think that is really important. But he also needs to be ready. People are seeing the games. Understanding that it takes a little bit of time to choose.",
      "\"He needs to be ready for the Premier League. It's something that you use if it's man-to-man in front. You are not building up. You can put the ball in one against one up front and that is the play.\"",
      "Arne Slot complained about United's effective approach, but Amorim refused to respond to the comments from the Liverpool manager. \"Liverpool is in the past, I don’t want to comment,\" he said last Friday.",
      "\"It is not important, it is important what Fabian [Hurzeler] said - to try to understand what is going to happen [against Brighton]. I understand everything, I am really pleased that the team can play different games.",
      "\"It was an important win but I was the first one to say we need to play better with the ball. I don’t care what Slot is saying, what people are saying about our team.",
      "\"I can watch the game and say we can do better and we need to do better in the future but sometimes you need to adapt to the game. So I don’t need anyone to evaluate my team. I can evaluate my team and I am really clear that we should play better with the ball and we are going to try to do that in this game.\"",
      "United have gained confidence, helping the back-three to push up to squeeze the opponent more aggressively. \"That was the plan [defenders pressing with aggression],\" said Amorim after Brighton. \"When we have Harry Maguire we can defend better our box so we can play a little lower.",
      "\"But when you have players that can press high... Luke is not really tall, but he's fast and aggressive. We can press a little higher and we know if we win the ball we have players in front of the goal. They [United's attackers] are so good that we just need one chance when we win the ball.\"",
      "Amad has hit form after suffering from a family bereavement. The 23-year-old's understanding with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed and the pair were crucial against Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "\"He's a working machine,\" said Amorim about Mbeumo. \"He's so good in transitions. He's improving when we are organising the final third. The connection with Amad is really hard to beat these two guys because they change positions. They are really fast, they are good in one against one.\"",
      "The pieces have fallen into place and United are now officially an in-form team.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Andre Onana’s performances for Trabzonspor following his Manchester United exit have been summed up “in one word” as the chances of a permanent transfer have been revealed.",
      "Onana joined Man Utd from Inter Milan for £47m in the summer of 2023 but was allowed to leave the club in September after his less than convincing displays for the Red Devils last season.",
      "A four-game winning run has moved Trabzonspor into second place in the Turkish Super Lig and Onana hasn’t tasted defeat for his new club since his debut loss against Fenerbahce.",
      "And Trabzonspor correspondent Hasan Tuncel was full of praise for the 29-year-old when asked for his assessment of his performances, describing his contribution as “flawless”.",
      "“In one word: outstanding,” Tuncel said. “Onana’s debut came in the match against Fenerbahce. Trabzonspor lost 1–0, but the story of that game was far deeper than the scoreline.",
      "“A Trabzonspor goal was controversially disallowed, creating real tension on the pitch. During that chaos, Onana’s leadership stood out – he calmed his teammates, used his experience, and pulled off some remarkable saves.”",
      "“From that moment on, not just the fans in Turkey but everyone watching internationally saw that he is still a top-level goalkeeper. He has maintained the same standard in the following matches.",
      "“His performance against Kayserispor was phenomenal – he practically saved every shot on target. In the match against Eyupspor, his two crucial saves were instrumental in keeping Trabzonspor’s title hopes alive.",
      "“So far, he’s been flawless. Beyond his goalkeeping, he’s become a leader in the dressing room.",
      "“He personally mentors three young goalkeepers – Onuralp Cevikkan, Ahmet Dogan Yildirim, and Erolcan Colak – guiding them during and after training sessions. This mentorship has earned him great respect within the club.”",

      "On how Onana was welcomed to the club, Tuncel added: “In Trabzonspor’s culture, big-name signings are usually welcomed with great passion – but Onana’s arrival was something beyond the usual,” he revealed.",
      "“We’ve seen large crowds at the airport before for players like Daniel Sturridge or John Obi Mikel, yet Onana’s reception had a different atmosphere. Because he arrived with his family, the club decided to organize a more personalized and emotional welcome.",
      "“Fans interacted with him directly, telling him: ‘Don’t worry, we’re with you all the way.’ That moment, combined with Onana’s smile, created a very symbolic image.",
      "“Players who come with their families usually adapt much faster – and that’s a crucial factor in professional football. Onana taking this process seriously and settling in with his family was seen as a very positive sign by both the club and its supporters.”",
      "Despite Onana’s excellent form, it’s unlikely Trabzonspor will have the wherewithal to complete his permanent signing",
      "Tuncel continued: “The club is extremely happy with his performances, but given the transfer fee Manchester United paid for him, a permanent deal looks financially difficult at the moment,” Tuncel admitted.",
      "“However, if Onana continues at this level and United lower their asking price, I have no doubt Trabzonspor would be interested in making a formal move.",
      "“For now, the focus is on having Onana mentor the club’s young goalkeepers and aid their development. But if conditions become favourable, Trabzonspor would certainly love to keep him on a permanent basis.”",
      "Here is our ranking of every Premier League No.2 goalkeeper. Liverpool will need to call on theirs soon to make his English top-flight bow due to injury.",
      "Man Utd are ‘expected’ to place a £60m bid for Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite in the January transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United squad was ‘relieved’ to see Andre Onana leave the club for one reason, according to a report.",
      "Andre Onana is the latest Erik ten Hag signing to leave under Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim, with the goalkeeper joining Trabzonspor on loan."

      "“They will score goals, run less, and play more relaxed—that’s football. But so far, these three players add a lot of quality to the team and are helping a lot. They’ve been scoring goals, being very productive, and involved in every match. And that’s what we want for each player who comes to the club.”",

      "They’ve won a few trophies and there were some good times under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and then Erik ten Hag, along with other glimmers of joy, but the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the sinking Old Trafford ship while Liverpool simultaneously plunge into crisis has created a satisfaction stew which might just have made October 2025 the most enjoyable month for a Manchester United fan since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe came out in support of Amorim when reports of his sacking and talk of possible replacements were still rife despite a face-saving victory over Sunderland at the start of the month.",
      "The co-owner said he needed three years at Old Trafford to prove he’s a “great” coach; we gave him three weeks, still wholly unconvinced both by Amorim’s ability to turn things around and by the veracity of Ratcliffe’s backing of a manager with the worst record of any Man Utd boss since the halcyon Fergie days. But what a three weeks it’s been.",
      "Having incredibly failed to win consecutive Premier League games since joining the club last November, Amorim’s now won three(?!) on the bounce, with victory over fourth-placed Sunderland followed by their first win at Anfield in nearly a decade and then their latest triumph, over Brighton.",
      "And they were proper wins too, featuring some tactical nuance, game management, surprising confidence and some outstanding performances from summer signings to shift the narrative in dramatic fashion, to the point where we’re wondering what’s stopping United from qualifying for the Champions League next season.",
      "No midweek football thanks to the Europa League final and Grimsby Town defeats, while meaning scant opportunity for backups like Kobbie Mainoo, is granting Amorim plenty of time on the training ground with the players to hone ideas and implement a philosophy which they now appear to be finally getting to grips with.",
      "Senne Lammens has been a revelation in goal and Casemiro’s rejuvenation has, at least for the time being, put a stop to claims Amorim and United were doomed to perpetual false dawns at best until they signed a new No.6. Rumours of interest in Carlos Baleba, Elliot Anderson and others have been conspicuous by their absence in the last couple of weeks.",
      "The centre-backs are all playing well, with the question now not which three are less likely to screw up but which in-form defender Amorim should leave out. Lisandro Martinez’s return looks set to raise those standards even higher.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are doing excellent work in relieving the creative pressure on the shoulders of Bruno Fernandes, who looks increasingly like the leader of Man Utd rather than a guy whining while wearing an armband.",
      "And although the jury may still be out on Benjamin Sesko, it’s testament to the work of his fellow forwards that he’s being allowed the space to ease into life in the Premier League rather than being harangued for not scoring regular goals as Rasmus Hojlund was.",
      "It’s all going swimmingly for them, and whether because of some mystical requirement for one of the two greatest English teams to be in crisis at any one time, or simply thanks to a glorious twisting of fates for the Red Devils, the aversion of their club emergency has coincided with Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming fully fledged in October.",
      "It’s seen the Reds lose three Premier League games before dumped out of the Carabao Cup, making it six defeats in seven. Mohamed Salah has lost it. Virgil van Dijk might just be past it. Their two £100m+ players have been stratospheric flops. And Arne Slot, while making excuses that would make Jurgen Klopp or Arsene Wenger blush having been a beacon of objectivity last season, is now second in the sack race. Amorim is eighth.",
      "Having been eight points behind Liverpool after five games, after nine Man Utd are above them. And while we can’t yet know whether October 2025 will act as a line in the sand, the point when Amorim’s Man Utd truly discovered their identity before going on to great things while Slot’s Liverpool scrabbled to recover theirs to no avail before his sacking, there’s no doubt that it’s been a standout month for Red Devils fans in the post-Sir Alex era; maybe the most enjoyable of all.",
      "We had three favourites in the Sack Race this weekend, and that is undeniably pure Barclays. Ruben Amorim is surely safe for now.",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”.",
      "Ruben Amorim once said that Bruno Fernandes ‘is always there when we need a goal and an assist’. That finally wasn’t the case and Man Utd should be thrilled",
      "Gary Neville has revealed that Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has another “big job over the next couple of weeks” after guiding his side to three wins in a row."

      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, leaving Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner and Nuno Espirito Santo in clear and present danger of losing his second job of the season, and title-winning Arne Slot a genuine contender as the Liverpool crisis deepens further.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a five-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. It will very much do, and importantly provides a significant buffer for Le Bris and his team as they continue a tough little run of games.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 18 Premier League games in the last 11 months, and just one from four very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. Currently four points outside a largely daft top six, and that won’t do, no matter what the mitigation.",

      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "In truth, we can’t quite understand why he’s only mid-table here. Feels like he should be out there with Arteta. It would only make sense for him to be here if a big job were currently available, and not even Forest is available for the next six weeks or so.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City perhaps remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But it’s now been four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but that’s still significant progress on where they were a month ago when it felt far more certain. And not in a good way.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland sees awkward questions resurfacing, though, ahead of what feels a particularly significant trip to Spurs at the weekend.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of last season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has just engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "With Forest and Spurs up next there is real scope for this to become a decent little run. That lad off the internet might even be able to get his hair cut in a couple of weeks. Amorim, meanwhile, knows ‘a couple of weeks’ is no longer the amount of time he possibly has left in the job. Everybody’s happy.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re approaching a quarter of the way through this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s trio managed.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth ahead of an upcoming run that includes a resurgent Manchester United, Liverpool and a six-pointer against Leeds means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eases the stress significantly.",
      "",
      "Fulham have hit a serious rough patch just as Silva was starting to be talked about for other jobs. Might be coincidence, might not, but the timing wasn’t great. A last-gasp defeat at Newcastle means it’s now four straight defeats, which is only keeping the Cottagers clear of the bottom three because those three teams are all currently just unspeakably awful.",
      "Still feels very much to us like Fulham and Silva are both better with each other than without, and would advise against anything hasty. Does need some points from somewhere soon, though. The good news? Wolves next.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis has reached full-blown levels, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "It’s now six defeats in the last seven games, and five straight losses in domestic competition. Slot and Liverpool simply have to pull out of this tailspin soon, or something truly extraordinary really could happen here to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season. And there is nothing obviously helpful on the immediate horizon with Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Man City to come before an interlull Slot genuinely yet ludicrously might not survive.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, we do already start to wonder whether he’s the answer to any of those problems. He absolutely could be sacked twice by Christmas, with defeat at Leeds leaving West Ham already four points adrift of safety.",
      "",
      "It is the history of the Wolves. They absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United, Leeds and now, really damagingly, Sunderland after a pair of encouraging draws.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Brighton for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Purchase alcohol for some youths?",
      "But defeat to Burnley in a rollercoaster six-pointer leaves things looking bleak indeed for Pereira.",
      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030.",

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”.",

      "",
      "Okay, someone asked for some considered opinions, and, as we’re a quarter of the way through*, here goes…",
      "*Quiet at the back!",
      "Arsenal – can’t criticise them for not winning it (note, not ‘bottling’) and then criticise them for trying to win it however they so desire. Will they even concede another goal?! I think they finally do win it, and people still complain. Hey Stewie!",
      "Bournemouth – selling that vast majority of their defence seems like a bold strategy that’s paying off. They’re pretty good at finding players, aren’t they?! Will fade a little, but I think a European spot may beckon.",
      "Spurs – Hang on!?! How are they 3rd? Fair play. Does the away from crack before the home form improves? They will finish 7th. Does Solanke have a chant to The Police’s ‘So Lonely’?",
      "Sunderland – Uh, have you not got the ‘please relegate yourself imposter’ memo? Xhaka the signing that’s made the biggest impact thus far. Will stay up comfortably. Possibly half way to the tally they need to do so. Hearing Isidor’s name always makes me want to watch Lord of the Rings. I know, I know, it’s Isildur.",
      "Man City – They’re just not quite them, are they. Their ‘title challenge’ will see them 4/5 points off all the way through.",
      "Man Utd – No jokes here. Definite strides being made. It just feels like that fragility (and an Amorim meltdown) could return at any time still. At the moment.",
      "Liverpool – Was a curious summer with some seemingly unnecessary signings. More bumps in the road to come (early CL exit) before steadying improvement post Jan. Won it last year, so it could be Wirtz.",
      "Aston Villa – The greasy breakfast seems to have finally allowed the hangover to be shaken off. Tielemans can’t come back soon enough. Win the Europa League and nothing else matters. Won’t do in Spurs style if they do, however.",
      "Chelsea – Champs League games (where they actually have to play a decent XI) taking a toll? I can see up and down season in store. Really though, I just don’t care either way. Which is a weird thing to say. Is Maresca the distinctly average one?",
      "Crystal Palace – Rightly lauded and yet somehow still sit 10th. It’s a skill really. Could see another cup win. Excellent fans.",
      "Brentford – Oh, Keith. Keith, Keith, Keith… Just stop it! Take your first management job from a fella who’d been there a while and was loved, lose your best forward players, and don’t give a shit. Excellent work you likeable so-and-so.",
      "Newcastle – It feels fine, and sort of is. But is it? Will report back later.",
      "Brighton – Same as it ever was. Which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Cause the big boys trouble, look average elsewhere.",
      "Everton – A shiny stadium and a fun Jack Grealish. Just enjoy it all. No danger whatsoever.",
      "Leeds – Home form will dictate everything, and they will need 25+ points from their home games.",
      "Burnley – See above. Winning at Wolves doesn’t count.",
      "Fulham – Maybe try going to back to the mid table obscurity thing. This doesn’t look great. Will beat Arsenal at the Emirates just to get everyone jittery.",
      "Forest – The admiration and good graces of fans of other teams thrown away in the space of a few months. Almost impressive. I don’t like saying it, but I don’t think I’d be upset to see them relegated.**",
      "West Ham – ‘I’m addicted to you, don’t you know that I’m Toxic’. It looks bleak. Very bleak. Get out Jarrod. Get out! Villa Park is nice.",
      "Wolves – Not sure the ‘be crap to start with, sack the manager, and improve no end’ bit is going to work this season. They finish in 20th despite an excellent challenge from above.",

A quick stat for you folks taken from Football365’s interactive table, after 9 games last season City were top having not lost a game, they went on to lose 6 of their next 9 games.",
      "Looking at the upcoming fixtures Arsenal have opportunity to extend their lead this weekend with on paper an easier game and many of the chasing pack playing each other. Then they have some tricky fixtures such as Sunderland and Brentford, they also play Chelsea and Spurs. Call me paranoid but let’s just cool our jets and see where we are around Christmas before getting too giddy.\nMarvin (42) AFC (We’re going to get done by Burnley aren’t we!)",

      "It is the responsibility of both teams to try and win a match. If one club goes to another, and sits all its men behind the ball, has no ambition to do anything other than defend and hope to get a counter, I would say the poor quality of the match and the football itself, is not the fault of the team trying to win the match, but the one trying desperately hard not to lose it.",
      "In this tortuous analogy, Arsenal are the team who actually want to win their matches, and their opponents are the ones desperate not to lose.",
      "So you can be upset that Arsenal score goals from set pieces and that might be ruining the ‘quality’ of the league, but at least we want to try and win. Considering our opponents average an xG against us of 0.8 per game, it tells me they aren’t even trying to score, whereas ours is 1.6 in comparison.",
      "Your craven clubs, with the hundreds of millions spent by them, are still too scared and lack the ambition to even want to try and win. So get mad at your own clubs and players for ruining the league. As an Arsenal fan, I love 1-nil results. I was raised on them. Bould at the near post flick on to someone in the middle. It was beautiful that George Graham was at the ground to witness our 1-nil against Palace (who are an excellent team).",

      "Because currently, all I can see on social media is Arsenal fans putting their bragging to one side while they attempt to inform the masses that corner kicks have been a thing since 1872, which by the way is a full 14 years before the club was formed, and also, crucially, 153 years ago.",
      "Suddenly, corners and set pieces are a widespread problem. I wonder why? The Arsenal freaks on Twitter are thankfully doing the Lord’s Work and pulling up tweets from official accounts of United or Liverpool or whoever, who are actually ‘bragging’ about their set piece specialists from once upon a time, while genuinely intelligent people such as Jon MacKenzie are asking if we should implement rule changes!! Wtf are we doing here honestly?",
      "Someone has also found a video of Jamie Carragher praising Chelsea’s ability to turn set pieces into goals about six years ago, while he and Freddie Ljungberg laugh together about how Arsene Wenger neglected the coaching of these scenarios in training, and that was probably a bit of a mistake. Quite funny, in hindsight.",
      "Honestly, you couldn’t make up what you’re seeing right now on the cesspit platform. All of this is the TLDR way of saying: Jamo, we are not bragging about anything. We are not yet in November and we’ve been burnt thrice in a row by one thing or another (our fault or otherwise), so you are clearly either looking in the wrong place or completely making it up.",

      "In an attempt to move on from the hyperbolic headlines, here is my attempt at diagnosing the problems and potential solutions to the poor run of form at Liverpool.",
      "Problems:",
      "Evolution from 433: Clearly this years’ signings marked an evolutionary move from Liverpool’s long serving 433 formation. Slot admitted that the signings were intended to give us more flexibility in the way we lined up against teams. Wirtz a clear number 10 means we were at times moving away from Klopp’s 6 and two 8s and Slot’s two 6s and an 8. It is also a clear move away from a team which gets its running and physicality from 3 midfielders with creativity provided by the full backs and the attackers. MacAllister and Wirtz are a long way from Hendo and Gini. Wirtz is most like Coutinho who didn’t fit within the 433 and had to leave. Buying Wirtz for 9 figures means we are moving away from 433 which will naturally unsettle some players who have played it for years. I see the logic in having someone like Wirtz to unlock the low block which Liverpool often face.",
      "The combined signing of Isak and Wirtz suggest a possible move away from 3 up front or certainly configuring the 3 differently. Is Slot’s ultimate long term vision 2 upfront, Wirtz at the tip of a diamond midfield behind, with Frimpong and Kerkez providing the width and legs?",
      "Leaking goals: Whether it’s the change in the formation, change in players or just poor form. Liverpool have leaked goals particularly of late.",
      "Missing Trent: I hope the long-time critics of TAA can see the error of their ways. Defensively Trent was never as bad as people alleged and Liverpool have not locked down the right hand side of the defence since he left. Issues on the right were never Trent being ‘the worst defender’ in the world. They were chiefly the result of Salah not tracking back and neither Milner or Henderson being replaced to fill in the gap.",
      "There is a Trent shaped hole in this team from an attacking perspective. It lacks creativity from deep and the ability to turn defence into attack with one quick pass",
      "Salah out of form: No one misses Trent more than Salah whose form has dipped noticeably. No one expected last year again but he has been poor. He has not found the right chemistry with teammates on the right. The lack of a consistent ball over the top (Trent!) means he is easier to mark. Putting Wirtz into midfield means there is one less person to do his running leaving us badly exposed to pace on the opposition left (Semenya, Eze, Mbuemo etc…). If I zoom out, I think in the absence of Trent, Salah is more likely to drift infield to an inside right position which I think is really where Wirtz would like to play. Really what we are seeing is the painful transition from a Salah led offense to a Wirtz led offence. It is now a question of how soon this happens.",
      "Big names, small performances: New signings have not settled. Isak in a red shirt is still miles from Isak in a Newcastle shirt. Frimpong is supposed to bring pace on the right to provide an overlap for Wirtz and others creating from midfield. He has had a shaky start and doesn’t seem to be a defensive upgrade from Trent. Wirtz has not looked like the best player in Germany and doesn’t seem to know where he should play. He looks for time he’s not going to get in the PL. Most disappointing for me has been Kerkez who isn’t adapting to a new league and should have been an immediate improvement on the left. He has been physically weak and reckless in tackles.",
      "MacAllister has been poor in every aspect of the game from tackling to passing and has rightly been dropped for Jones. Konate had a shocking start to the season and there is a risk his head has been turned. Salah, see above.",
      "Missing Allison: The new keeper does not look like the best young keeper in the world. He’s been nervous coming and dealing with crosses and dived too soon twice for Brentford goals. It was tough watching Kelleher for Brentford on Saturday. When you miss Allison you miss a keeper who makes saves he shouldn’t and is lethal in one on ones.",
      "Brass tax, Liverpool have conceded 7 in GM’s 3 PL games vs. 7 in Allison’s 6 PL games.",
      "Look at the 3 games and the goals conceded and ask would Allison save it? Mbuemo definitely, Caicaido he could have and the Brentford goals he would certainly have done better.",
      "Solutions:",
      "Sort the defence first. It applies to Sunday league and premier league alike. You cannot win games conceding too many goals. We need to get a defence sorted. For me that means putting Gomez at RB and Robbo at LB. Play a flat back 4. If the game requires it, start Endo at the base of MF until RG is fit again. This also means getting midfielders and wingers to put in a shift to cover the defence.",
      "Continue everyone is droppable: Salah and MacAllister have rightly been dropped for playing badly. This needs to be the case. Chiesa and Jones deserve their chances and if they don’t get them now then they have to leave the club. Past performances and big transfer fees shouldn’t guarantee a player a spot either. Isak and Wirtz similarly need to be droppable.",
      "Play Szoboszlai in MF: He’s our only shining light this season. Just start him in midfield every game, no messing around at RB. Play him at 6 or 8. With RG out we should start him at 6 for now.",
      "Use the injuries to settle the team: Injuries mean there are less options and allows the team to settle a bit. Isak being injured means continuing with 3 upfront and playing Hugo at 9. This should always have been the case but it’s easier to have the big transfer injured than dropped. Jones and RG being out means playing an offensive midfield 3 of Macallister, DS and Wirtz which makes the solid 4 at the back even more important. Hopefully this will see MacAllister and Salah settle and find their form but if that doesn’t happen Chiesa and Endo should be put in.\nPL from DL",

My response is that VVD and McAllister conspired together to be absolute balls and the ball immediately went into a dangerous area leading to a goal. Two things here. It was a Liverpool player who made that howler; if it was Mbeumo who did it then 150% stop play but it seems like something rife for gaming the system if play gets stopped because teammates run into each other and someone goes down holding their head. Ed more than welcome to tell me if I’m talking bollocks",
      "With regards to the stitches, having worked at sea for 10+ years, I’ve had (cumulatively) 7 staples and 12 stitches in my head over three separate occasions, it’s nothing more than an elaborate boo boo that McAllister definitely made the most of and considering there was no actual concussion test or anything that I saw, in hindsight, I think the ref got it right.",
      "Ryan, Bermuda: All salient points made, well done that man – and decent PS from Ed. Which leads me on to one of my bugbears in football. A defender can often come sliding through, absolutely clattering a striker after they have had a shot without any censure because of some weird logic that they’ve already had a shot without any consideration to the fact that an uncontrolled ~100kgs of defender sliding at the striker across the turf at 20km/h, may have in fact, put the striker off.",
      "Essentially, if the defender tackles late enough, he can put the striker off and foul him without any punishment. It is truly baffling and Ryan certainly is Me when I scratch my head at some of the rules, the opaqueness of their application and disaster refereeing. I know we have more chance of Maggie rising from her grave to vote for the Green Party, but I do think we should all, as Prem fans, start making more noise for the rules, VAR and refereeing to be MUCH MORE professionally applied to the Prem.",

There seems to be an allure of big personalities, hungry for glory, loving the limelight , as if that alone will rub off on the team and make them successful. Managers celebrated for their drive and self-assurance when things go well (well, at least the managers do a great job of selling that vision.)

      "We all nodded in agreement with Dave Tickner’s sage assertion that while Elanga might not be worth £55m to any other team he is to Newcastle because of their excellence in transition on the counter-attack, but are now very much distancing ourselves from that fool of a journalist/man.

      "Feels harsh to bump down this list after a significant uptick in his impact on games against Liverpool and then Brighton, but if we’re to tar all Manchester United forwards with the brush Roy Keane has used to claim Mason Mount is underserving of a place in Ruben Amorim’s team then Cunha really needs to improve on his output after one (wonderful) goal and no assists in nine appearances for the Red Devils.",
      "Ekitike said what all players must when asked about competition for places on the back of Alexander Isak’s deadline-day arrival from Newcastle, insisting he’s looking forward to the challenge rather than frankly a bit f***ed off that he could do nothing to avoid his inevitable ousting from the starting XI in favour of his rival for the No.9 position.",
      "He will still be wondering just how terrible Isak will have to be when he returns from injury to not be included ahead of him, because apparently six goals and an assist in 700 minutes of football wasn’t worthy of that place ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "",
      "He got two goals and three assists in his opening four Premier League games to provide genuine hope that Chelsea may have found a fully-formed striker to lead their attack, and although that hope has faded as he’s not got a sausage since, that’s more down to a realisation that he’s far more accomplished as a second striker.",
      "Whether that’s something Maresca can accommodate when Liam Delap and Cole Palmer return from injury remains to be seen, but Chelsea look a far better team when the Brazilian’s playing in that slightly more withdrawn role than as the furthest man forward.",
      "Martin Odegaard’s injury has seen Eze revert to his typical No.10 position and lo and behold, when playing in the role he’s made his name in, he’s thriving.",
      "His first Arsenal goal, the winner against his former club, was really special and he joins a growing list of Gunners players making it very difficult to hate them as a whole.",
      "",
      "Manchester United have needed more Brunos and Mbeumo is chief among them. He’s now got five goals and an assist, and looks to have bucked a very long trend in being a high-quality footballer who arrives at Old Trafford and continues being that very same high-quality footballer.",
      "We would count Zubimendi in that same list of admirable, good guys in the Arsenal ranks with Eze and as suckers for low stress, technically brilliant defensive midfielders we suspect we will be swooning over the Spaniard for a long time yet.",
      "As Arteta pointed out recently, while so many others struggle to come to terms with the pace and power of the Premier League, his transition has been seamless. Just a hugely impressive footballer.",
      "We will forever have a soft spot for footballers who don’t look as though they should be good at football. Combine that with him being the cause of great mirth for naysayers in the summer having joined for a fee way above his market value as Newcastle’s fourth or fifth-choice striker and him having to replace £125m defector Isak and we’ve got a veritable jambalaya of joy at seeing Big Nick hit the ground running at St James’ Park.",
      "",
      "Suspicions that those questioning Kudus’ price tag after a very ordinary output of five goals and three assists last season were missing the obvious ‘but he was playing for West Ham’ caveat have been confirmed through his displays for Spurs.",
      "He looks a threat every time he gets on the ball, aiming to beat his man whenever possible rather than recycling the ball as far too many wingers are prone to see as priority one these days. He’s undoubtedly the player Spurs fans are paying to watch in what are otherwise stolid performances producing very good results.",
      "Former Arsenal winger Theo Walcott reckons the Gunners should’ve signed Man Utd summer signing Bryan Mbeumo “many years ago”.",
      "Alan Shearer has again spoken out against Alexander Isak, but Liverpool head coach Arne Slot needs to listen this time and make a key decision…",
      "A new report has revealed how Manchester United’s summer signings have settled, with staff ‘struck’ by one new arrival in particular.",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot has provided an update on Alexander Isak and Jeremie Frimpong, both of whom were replaced in the Reds’ 5-1 victory over Frankfurt with injuries.",
      "Wayne Rooney has admitted that he has been forced to make a U-turn on one Manchester United star who has “proven him wrong” this season.",
      "A former FIFA referee and ex-PGMOL chief has given his verdict on Bryan Mbeumo’s controversial opener for Man Utd vs Liverpool."

      "He faced charges including attempted rape and assault, but the Crown Prosecution Service announced in February 2023 that the case had been discontinued.",
      "Greenwood eventually left Old Trafford in July 2024 when he joined Marseille in a deal worth €31.6m with Man Utd retaining a 50 per cent sell-on clause.",
      "The 24-year-old has largely performed well for the French side since moving with 21 goals and five assists in 34 Ligue Un appearances last term.",

      "READ: Top 10 things that make no f***ing sense as Premier League enters its chaos era",
      "There have been reports in the last couple of months claiming that Marseille would now demand as much as €100m with the French club knowing 50 per cent of any sale will go to Man Utd.",
      "If Greenwood was sold for €100m then the Red Devils would be entitled to €50m (£44m) and there are rumours that Premier League sides are now interested.",
      "Our friends at TEAMtalk claim that Barcelona scouts watched his recent performance against Le Havre, in which he scored four goals, and the Catalan giants are now understood to ‘lead the chase’.",
      "The report adds that Premier League sides Tottenham and West Ham are ‘also in the race’ with a report on Monday claiming that Thomas Frank could opt to try and offload Dominic Solanke.",
      "When asked earlier this month whether Greenwood can become one of the world’s elite if he keeps up his current form, Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi replied: “It’s true that Mason can do more, not just in terms of goals scored because in that area he doesn’t need to do better.",
      "“He’s already a top player in front of goal, but he can become one of the best players in the world, because he has the ability.",
      "“He can improve in helping the team when it needs it, when it’s necessary. But I want to protect Mason from criticism, he’s always scored a lot of goals and never missed a training session. But he still has room for improvement.”",
      "Man Utd are looking at the possibility of bringing Mason Greenwood back to Old Trafford as they ‘prepare’ an offer to Marseille, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could receive a sizable windfall as Mason Greenwood is attracting interest from Spanish giants Atletico Madrid.",

      "Greenwood isn’t in Tuchel’s England ‘thoughts’ but would a Harry Kane injury change that? What if he was a No.6 and not a striker?",

      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists Ruben Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” after refusing to change his tactics.",
      "The Red Devils made a poor start to the new season, with just two wins from their first six games, and there were concerns that Man Utd were heading for a similar finish to last campaign, where they ended up 15th in the Premier League.",
      "However, victories over Sunderland and Liverpool saw them win back-to-back matches for the first time since Amorim joined, while another win over Brighton on Saturday made it three in a row.",
      "Amorim had stubbornly refused to move away from his preferred formation and tactics earlier in the season and it now seems to be paying off.",
      "However, Ferdinand reckons Amorim is “playing Russian Roulette with his job” by being so inflexible about the way he wants his team to play.",
      "READ: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",
      "Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel: “I admire it to a certain extent. But, like I said, I think he is playing Russian Roulette with his job. I don’t think he’s changed drastically, he’s just tweaked.",
      "“That’s what a lot of fans were asking for. Just tweak what you’ve got. Maybe don’t be so much on the front foot, maybe be a bit more conservative at times when we haven’t got the ball.",
      "“You can’t press, press, press for 90 minutes, unless you’re an absolute beast of a team. PSG do it. This manager couldn’t do that with this squad.",
      "“That’s just sometimes how the cookie crumbles. We might look back in six months and, say Man United finish in the Champions League or something like that, he’ll probably sit there confidently and go, ‘Well, if I did change, I probably would be out of a job because I have been doing things that are alien to me’.”",
      "Gary Neville insists he was “a little worried” that Amorim had lost the belief of the players a few weeks ago but now believes the Man Utd head coach has survived the “month of reckoning” at Old Trafford.",
      "“But one thing that’s been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people around the club is that they really like him as a person, and that does count for a lot. Because I think there’s no doubt – he’s not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him.",
      "“I think they want to play for him, they’re desperate to win and I think you’ve seen that coming together in the last week. I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special, but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected I think has given them such a big lift.",
      "“We’ll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after – there’s still a big job to do in the next month. But I felt it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week against Liverpool it could have gone a different way but it feels very different, it feels like the momentum is with them a little bit and the spirit is good.”",
      "Does the combination of Ruben Amorim implausibly righting the Man Utd ship while Liverpool plunge into crisis make October 2025 the best post-Fergie month of all?",
      "We had three favourites in the Sack Race this weekend, and that is undeniably pure Barclays. Ruben Amorim is surely safe for now.",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030.",
      "Rio Ferdinand doesn’t think £65m for Luis Diaz was “good business” for Liverpool. We’re confident it was very good business, actually.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has hit out at his former club for letting one player leave who “should have stayed”.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and he isn't ready to trust Manchester United at short prices.",
      "A solid betting tactic to use is to give Brighton respect against the big boys and back them to be flaky against the rest.",
      "The Seagulls can turn Manchester City into mush one week, then turn into mush themselves the next against a team battling relegation. All three of Ipswich, Southampton and Leicester avoided defeat at the Amex last season and Brighton have already failed to beat Wolves this campaign when odds-on to do so.",
      "Against sides who sit in, frustrate and counter at speed, they often struggle to convert dominance into results. And Leeds possess the fourth best defensive process in the Premier League this season (9.23 expected goals against). They can make this another fiddly afternoon for the hosts with 10/11 with Sky Bet on Leeds double chance standing out.",
      "Some bets just make sense. Sometimes the obvious ones are the ones laced with the most value.",
      "You look at the numbers, you look at the patterns, you look at the opposition and you can almost hear the value whispering in your ear, saying \"back Arsenal to win to nil.\"",
      "Yes, the 10/11 with Sky Bet isn't going to change lives but it's a rock-solid play that over time will keep you ahead of the ledger in this battle against the oddsmakers. Arsenal's defensive record isn't just good, it's title-winning, elite, brick-wall good. They've now conceded just three goals in their last 14 matches across all competitions, winning 11 of those without conceding.",
      "If Arsenal win, they almost always do it whilst keeping their sheets clean. And Burnley, for all their endeavour, look ill-equipped to change that narrative.",
      "Yeremy Pino's start to life at Crystal Palace has been like a sparkler in a petrol station: lively, unpredictable and very dangerous. And that's exactly why Pino to either score or be carded at 5/4 with Sky Bet looks a cracking bet this weekend. Pino has the desire be involved - one way or another - with or without the ball.",
      "Since arriving in south London, he's been averaging 2.5 shots per 90, getting into the central areas of the box regularly and showing exactly the kind of low-centre-of-gravity menace that is hard to mark - as seen by his classy goal at Anfield in midweek.",
      "But there's a flip side. For all that flair, there's a fiery edge. He leaves a leg in when the ball's gone and doesn't take kindly to being kicked himself. He's already been carded in three appearances which backs up his card-happy data from Spain where he was booked 12 times last season at a very healthy rate of 0.52 per 90.",
      "Fulham's new attacking livewire Kevin looks to have finally found his feet after being integrated into Marco Silva's system. And for those of us sniffing around the shots on target markets, he's shaping up as a player to follow over the next few weeks. Over his last few appearances, he's been popping up in dangerous areas, pulling defenders apart with his movement and, most importantly, shooting.",
      "He had seven shots in the midweek win on penalties against Wycombe, hitting the target three times. It's time for him now to be trusted in a Premier League game and the 2/1 with Sky Bet for him to have two or more shots on target is brimming with potential.",
      "Some teams make you feel safe when they're hovering around Evens away from home: Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool, spring to mind.",
      "However, betting Manchester United at these prices is like going back to the ex who says: \"I've changed.\"",
      "You want to believe them, but deep down, you know exactly how this ends with hearts broken, fingers burnt and wallets bruised.",
      "This version of United under Ruben Amorim remain a deeply unreliable, defensively chaotic team. And that makes them punting poison at short prices like they are here at 21/20 with Sky Bet to win at Forest, meaning the home team on the double chance at 8/11 with Sky Bet is the confident play.",
      "Defensively, they're still hanging on by their fingernails. They've conceded 22 big chances in the Premier League this season, more than any other team. That's not bad luck, that's structural fragility, especially in the central midfield area.",
      "A low-scoring home win it is.",
      "You know a Premier League season has gone a bit rogue when Micky van de Ven, a centre-back who failed to score last season, is Tottenham's top scorer with five goals. But here we are. And for punters, that is where the value hides.",
      "Because at 14/1 with Sky Bet to score anytime against Chelsea, the Dutchman looks a cracking price in a season where defenders have suddenly become the headline acts.",
      "This Premier League season is producing record levels of goals from corners and free-kicks, something which still isn't being factored into the markets. Excluding penalties, 67 of the 241 goals scored this season have come via a set-piece (27.8 per cent). And 45 of those 241 goals scored have come via corners (18.7 per cent), a higher proportion than any other Premier League season.",
      "At 14/1 anytime, Van de Ven's implied probability is just 6.7 per cent. Given his form, Spurs' relentless set-piece output and Chelsea's defending, that number underplays the true probability.",
      "As Liverpool head into a pivotal stretch of their season, the smartest play might just be trusting Arne Slot to get it right again at a time where the narrative is portraying him as someone who is out of his depth.",
      "Because if the title-winning campaign taught us anything, it's that Slot knows how to manage chaos, rotate wisely and keep his squad peaking while others run out of steam.",
      "When Liverpool lifted the Premier League trophy last season, it wasn't just about tactics and in-game substitutions, it was about player management. Slot got the blend between rotation and rhythm spot-on. He trusted his fringe players and made brave calls in the league that left his stars fresh for the big days. That's what this fixture is for Liverpool: a big one.",
      "And Slot knows it, hence why he's sacrificed the Carabao Cup in order to reboot his key players. It's the product of a manager who understands when to gamble and when to protect.",
      "Slot's already proven he can navigate the chaos better than anyone else. He can get Liverpool moving in the right direction again - starting here where the home win is generously priced at 4/6 with Sky Bet.",
      "West Ham remain unfit for purpose in this Premier League season as they've become a plodding, predictable outfit who are easily bullied.",
      "And this is a terrible match-up for them against perhaps the most aggressive and intense team on these shores.",
      "Joelinton, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali and Anthony Gordon all will be licking their lips at winning their individual battles and I'm expecting Newcastle to be at it from the first whistle in order to turn the pressure up on the home players in front of their own fans, who have now seen nine games without a win at home, including five defeats in a row.",
      "Eddie Howe is a marginal gains type of manager and he'll know a fast start to get the home fans turned will be a key tactic to win this match.",
      "So, the way to boost the 8/13 with Sky Bet on a Newcastle win is just to concentrate on the first half. West Ham have scored just four first half goals in their last 20 matches and none in the last seven. Back the Toon to win the first half at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth are a punters pal when it comes to over goal lines away from home as 14 of their last 16 matches on the road have sailed over the 2.5 line. And since the start of last season their away games against last season's top five have averaged 3.9 goals per 90.",
      "However, with the Premier League only trending at 2.68 goals per 90 this season, which is almost 0.6 of a goal fewer than two seasons ago, I'm a little wary of backing over lines.",
      "The smarter play when your read on a game is for goals is to slide across into the goalscorer markets instead and chase a bigger price. Antoine Semenyo, who has scored eight goals in last 10 Premier League appearances, is the play at 7/2 with Sky Bet.",
      "Looking at the data, Bournemouth's aim is to get him into dangerous positions in transition and City will leave spaces to be hit via that tactic. In what should be a goal heavy game, simply backing him to score at 7/2 is the smartest way to get a goals and pro Bournemouth play on side.",
      "Everyone's talking about Jack Grealish, yet, he's not even Everton's best player.",
      "If you actually use your eyes rather than just concentrate on the Grealish love-in, it's Iliman Ndiaye who's running the show in the final third. He's the one drifting between the lines, wriggling into pockets of space defenders hate and, crucially for us punters, is getting into shooting positions with real intent. Something that Grealish isn't doing.",
      "Ndiaye has already scored three goals this season - two more than Grealish. He's had seven shots on target - three more than Grealish and his expected goals return is higher by 1.5 expected goals than Grealish.",
      "He's also the penalty taker for Everton, meaning the anytime goalscorer price of 3/1 with Sky Bet being dangled is too juicy to pass up. You're effectively investing at 3/1 in Everton's most advanced and most involved attacking player who also could have a free shot from 12 yards if the ref points to the spot."

      "Newcastle's £69m striker Nick Woltemade is contributing more than goals as Alexander Isak starts slowly at Liverpool; The Radar column also looks at the man-management techniques being used by Fabian Hurzeler on Charalampos Kostoulas and Brighton's other young players",
      "Friday 31 October 2025 12:25, UK",
      "",
      "💪 Woltemade's strong start for Newcastle🔹 Kostoulas being challenged by Hurzeler🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Nick Woltemade scored his third header of the season in Newcastle's Carabao Cup win over Spurs on Wednesday. The 6ft 6in striker is proving difficult to handle. And not just aerially.",
      "His tally of six goals in only 760 minutes includes two ingenious flicked finishes, one against Union Saint-Gilloise and an even better one against Brighton. There was a penalty lifted into the top corner against Nottingham Forest as if struck with a pitching wedge.",
      "It is a fitting level of variety for a player who is difficult to define. Woltemade has the physical profile to play the role of a targetman. His presence has allowed Newcastle to send more passes long in line with the Premier League's shift towards directness.",
      "He has scored headed goals against Wolves and Arsenal as well Spurs. Not many strikers can claim to have bested Gabriel Magalhaes this season but Woltemade towered over him when scoring Newcastle's opener against the Gunners in September.",
      "As is becoming increasingly clear to his new audience, though, he is also an excellent technician capable of a light touch as well as brute force. He is comfortable holding onto the ball in tight spaces. He drops deep and pulls wide to link the play. He can even dribble.",
      "His team-mates certainly value his all-round contribution. \"He is so big, it is a little bit easy for him to score goals with his head but he is a very good player,\" said Sandro Tonali after the Spurs game.",
      "\"He runs all 90 minutes every time. He plays with us, the midfielders and the defenders. He is the first defender and the first striker.\" Eddie Howe added that he \"set the tone\" for Newcastle's pressing.",
      "He is already loved by Newcastle supporters. His arrival, for £69m from Stuttgart in the summer, having previously been a target for Bayern Munich, has helped to ensure that, so far, at least, the departed Alexander Isak has not been missed.",
      "It has escaped nobody's attention that Woltemade has comprehensively outperformed his predecessor, who is yet to score in the Premier League for Liverpool, his only goal since his record £125m transfer coming in the Carabao Cup against Southampton.",
      "Yoane Wissa's injury absence has added to the pressure on Woltemade to perform and he continues to deliver. He has more Premier League goals, with four, than any of the 18 other strikers signed by Premier League clubs during a summer transfer window which featured unprecedented spending on forwards.",
      "It is all the more impressive given he has played fewer minutes than many of the other players in the list, including all of Chelsea's Joao Pedro, Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres, Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike and Manchester United's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "He is of course a different type of player to the man he has replaced. He is not generating as many shots or creating as many chances as Isak last term but he offers an aerial outlet, wins more duels, makes more pressures and regains possession more frequently.",
      "His heat map shows a broader remit.",
      "While Isak was focused on stretching opposition defences with runs in behind, Woltemade is more likely to be seen further away from goal, helping to construct attacks as well as finish them.",
      "Woltemade is still acclimatising to certain aspects of the Premier League. Issa Diop and Calvin Bassey subjected him to rough treatment which often went unpunished against Fulham last weekend, much to the striker's frustration.",
      "But overall the speed of his adaptation has been hugely impressive. His challenge now is just to continue in the same vein.",
      "So, is his current scoring rate sustainable? Woltemade has scored four goals from four shots on target in the Premier League. Factor in his goals in the Champions League and Carabao Cup and, amazingly, it is six from six shots on target overall.",
      "He has reached that tally from chances worth only 3.46 expected goals, an overperformance which suggests a reversion to the mean may lie ahead. And yet, his actual goal total could easily be higher.",
      "Woltemade hit the post from close range in last weekend's 2-1 win over Fulham and struck the underside of the crossbar in the game against Nottingham Forest, during which he also had a goalbound effort blocked by defender Morata inside the six-yard box.",
      "Newcastle may ultimately need to service him with more scoring opportunities. They will need their wingers to contribute more goals too, with Jacob Murphy, Harvey Barnes, Anthony Gordon and Anthony Elanga having only found the net once in the Premier League between them so far this season.",
      "But in Woltemade right now, they have a player giving them exactly what they need, filling an Isak-shaped void, contributing a lot more than just goals, and, two months into the season, winning the battle of the Premier League's new No 9s.",
      "From Newcastle to Brighton, where it has been a slower start for Charalampos Kostoulas, another of the Premier League's newly-signed strikers having joined from Olympiakos for £31.4m in June.",
      "The 18-year-old came with a reputation as one of Europe's most exciting young frontmen and finally earned a first start in Brighton's Carabao Cup tie against Arsenal on Wednesday having scored his first goal from the bench against Manchester United.",
      "Unfortunately for him, it did not last long.",
      "Kostoulas looked menacing from the left flank in the first half at the Emirates Stadium but he was withdrawn at the interval with Fabian Hurzeler citing \"physical reasons\" afterwards.",
      "\"He needs to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League, he needs to adapt to the demands,\" said the Brighton boss.",
      "The 32-year-old talked up the importance of \"honest feedback\" having been firm with Baleba over his performances following a summer of transfer speculation. Hurzeler has taken him off at half-time on three separate occasions this season. \"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside,\" he said.",
      "Clearly, Hurzeler is pushing Kostoulas in the same way. And even if it feels uncomfortable, the striker should keep in mind that his team-mate appears to have benefitted. Baleba was Brighton's best performer against Arsenal, dominating the midfield in the first half and demonstrating the potential Hurzeler is trying to extract.",
      "No Dean Huijsen, no problem for Bournemouth. They have another young gem at centre-back in Veljko Milosavljevic.",
      "The 18-year-old Serb is pushing to face Erling Haaland and Manchester City on Super Sunday having helped Bournemouth keep a clean sheet against Nottingham Forest last time out.",
      "Sunderland host Everton on Monday Night Football. Tune in from 6.30pm ahead of the 8pm kick-off.",
      "Joao Palhinha, Rodrigo Bentancur and Tottenham's issues playing through midfield featured in last week's column. There was also a look at Bruno Fernandes' stunning record for Man Utd ahead of his 300th appearance."

      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has promised investment in the \"right\" signings in order to realise the club's long-term vision.",
      "United have hit a groove of positivity, having won three league games on the bounce for the first time since boss Ruben Amorim's appointment last November.",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their evident attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the Man Utd website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent, they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
      "United's summer transfer window is likely to be an important one given the fact that some members of the squad are approaching the final six months of their current deals, such as Casemiro and Harry Maguire. United had looked at possible options in the middle last summer but had prioritised other positions, especially up front. However, potential outgoings present an opportunity to strengthen in the middle of the park.",
      "The Old Trafford club have long been admirers of Brighton's Carlos Baleba - but he is just one of a number of midfielders they continue to monitor.",
      "Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is another on the radar Old Trafford, given his impressive performances have continued into this campaign.",
      "While transfer business is not on the immediate agenda, Wilcox heaped praise on United's summer acquisitions, who he says are guiding the club in the right direction on the pitch.",
      "\"They are all good guys,\" Wilcox said.",

      "By Danyal Khan and Rob Dorsett",
      "Thursday 30 October 2025 09:23, UK",
      "Manchester United bosses are quietly satisfied with their progress after securing three straight wins for the first time in 18 months - but know there is still much to do before the men's team can compete regularly at the top of the table.",
      "The team's recent run of impressive results has not been met with overt celebrations in the executive offices at the Carrington training ground. Rather, it has reassured the club hierarchy that the tough decisions taken are starting to have an impact on the pitch and strengthened their resolve to continue with the long-term plan.",
      "Ruben Amorim has targeted a place in Europe for next season, and certainly chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox would be satisfied with a top-six finish. As Amorim continues to develop his squad, no one at the club is getting too high when the team are on a positive run, or too low when results are disappointing.",
      "Crucially, while there is abundant noise outside Old Trafford calling for some heavy investment in the squad in January, among the executives there is a determination to stick to the plan. United are not expected to spend big in the New Year.",
      "A new defensive midfield player is the priority to strengthen the squad, after last summer's focus on attacking areas. But because a No 6 is likely to mean a significant level of investment - with Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba all under consideration - it is much more likely to be addressed in the summer, as part of a broader review of the squad and the overall wage bill.",
      "The strategy was successful in the summer in terms of reducing a bloated and expensive squad, moving on many of the big-earning players who weren't part of Amorim's plans. But there is also an awareness that the futures of a number of Manchester United's highest-profile players are still up in the air.",
      "However determined Marcus Rashford is to pursue his career away from Manchester, he still has two-and-a-half years remaining on his United contract. Harry Maguire and Casemiro are both out of contract in the summer, and so any decision to let either move on would free up a significant chunk in the squad salary budget. Rasmus Hojlund's substantive move to Napoli is only guaranteed should Antonio Conte's side make the Champions League.",
      "All of those considerations will impact what incoming transfer business United can do, but there is a determination to avoid some of the recruitment mistakes of the past, which saw too many big names on big salaries sitting in the big Old Trafford stands.",
      "The summer focus on strengthening the attack seems to be paying dividends. Manchester United's xG has actually been lower over the last three matches compared to the first six games of the season - but the statistics make it clear United are being much more clinical in front of goal, with a very impressive 20 per cent of their shots producing goals this month, compared to just 7.4 per cent previously.",
      "The style of play has been tweaked, too, with United going more direct. Over the last three matches, they've averaged less than 44 per cent possession compared with over 53 per cent for the rest of the season. And with Senne Lammens between the posts, he has kicked long for almost 85 per cent of the time, compared to 43 per cent and 56 per cent under Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, respectively.",
      "United had no plans to change goalkeeper in the summer, despite their long-term interest in Lammens. But Onana's dip in form, and Jadon Sancho's wages being removed from the overall bill, meant a deal could be done for the 23-year-old.",
      "The stats suggest he has made a difference on the pitch. A 78.6 per cent save rate is more than 11 per cent better than Onana's, and more than 25 per cent ahead of Bayindir.",
      "It is also significant that the focus on Amorim's chosen formation of three central defenders has waned.",
      "But there have been signs in the last few games that the Portuguese coach has adopted a more flexible approach to his team structure. Even though Manchester United line up with three at the back, that sometimes becomes a four when they are defending, with one or both of the wing-backs dropping deeper.",
      "An increasingly positive mood is becoming obvious to those inside Carrington. After the defeat to Brentford last month, it would have been characteristic of the recent United past for stories to start leaking out about certain players being unhappy, or others losing faith in the head coach. There were no such stories this time, which suggests there is greater unity in the squad than has been seen for a while, and a widespread buy-in to the coaching methods.",
      "United's bosses know they are still in the early stages of their revolution. And they expect some rocky roads ahead as they search for stability and, ultimately, silverware.",
      "But, for the time being at least, all is quiet at Carrington, as the club's power brokers feel things are moving in the right direction.",

      "Before Super Sunday, Everton were the only team yet to concede from a set-piece in the Premier League. Given the prolificacy of set-piece goals this season that fact is impressive. What followed in a 3-0 defeat to Thomas Frank's Tottenham, though, was Micky van de Ven tucking away twice from corners.",

Fashion isn't always about aesthetics. Sometimes it's about practicality. If the best wearing pair of jeans only look good on the hanger, then really they serve no purpose at all.",
      "Nineteen per cent of all English top-flight goals this season have come via corners (45/241), the highest proportion ever in a Premier League campaign. Arsenal are the masters of this art. Gabriel is so effective, in fact, Jamie Carragher has called him the \"most influential player in the league\" right now.",
      "It's true that Mikel Arteta has got his team delivering machine-like efficiency. Arsenal have scored 11 goals via set-pieces this season, two more than any other side (Chelsea are second on nine). 69 per cent of goals scored in 2025/26, in fact, have come via set-pieces (11/16). Arteta's squad has been assembled with physicality and power purposefully to operate in such a way. But they are not the only ones.",
      "Brentford have made the long throw their party piece, scoring eight times via that method since the season began. Michael Kayode catapults the ball into the mixer and asks a team-mate to make first contact. That bit is fundamental. And then it's about who reacts quickest. At the weekend it was Dango Ouattara to spark a 3-2 victory over reigning champions Liverpool. Every side are susceptible to this type of threat if it's choreographed well enough.",

      "Romanticists might call this evolution boring, but it's actually initiating a levelling out of the league. Bournemouth, who have used set-piece threat to good effect five times this season, are second in the table. Spurs, boasting the same success rate from dead-ball situations, are third.",
      "Frank has long been an advocate of the benefits of set-piece ability because it offers realistic marginal gains. It's a product of dedicated training ground practice. When pass-heavy football was all the rage it was less transferable because far fewer players, often costing huge sums, have the specialist talent to play that way. They were ring-fenced for the top clubs.",
      "The formula is equally true of both ends of the table. Those teams who concede from set-pieces most regularly - Nottingham Forest and West Ham, both 10 - are 18th and 19th respectively. There is little point in resisting or ignoring the shift. \"If you're not doing it, you look like a bit of a dinosaur as a coach,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Super Sunday.",
      "This new, or perhaps just elevated, manuscript is here to stay. And if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.",
      "When Manchester City were the Premier League's most potent emerging force in the early 2010s, before Pep Guardiola, managers at the very top of the game criticised City's lack of clear identity. Carlo Ancelotti, when at Chelsea, once said City had \"skill and ability\" but were \"not a team\".",
      "Not once has that ever been said of a side under Guardiola's charge - not in any part of Europe. Not at Barcelona, not at Bayern Munich and never previously at Manchester City - until now. The scars from last year's well-documented meltdown are having a lasting effect on Pep's newly-shaped squad. And it's unclear exactly what they stand for.",
      "City's most recent defeat to Aston Villa - their third of the season - was indicative of a side caught between the style change that has glorified set-pieces over pretty passing patterns. Pep has publicly professed to want to embrace what he calls \"modern football\" but a lot of the ideas go against the fibres of what made him so famously successful at every club he's managed. He was the ultimate philosophy coach.",
      "Gary Neville has been critical of this recent erosion. \"Man City aren't even good to watch any more,\" he said on this week's podcast. \"They look like they can be beat in any game of football. The play is like a hybrid between direct, old Pep in terms of passing, a bit scruffy - I'm not quite sure what it is.\"",
      "This period of flux is evidently difficult to control for a perfectionist manager. Guardiola is not going to be enlisting the long throw any time soon. City are actually the only Premier League side yet to score from a set-piece this season, which gives an indication of just how seriously, or not, Pep has welcomed these new rules of engagement.",
      "Their latest downfall was engineered by a brilliantly worked Matty Cash strike, and it came from a corner.",
      "It was City's first loss since August, and just the second time they've failed to score all season, but their repeated predictability has meant falling short far more times than is necessary to seriously challenge for the Premier League crown.",
      "Guardiola blamed \"the last action\", needing \"to shoot better or to cross better,\" but really it was a lack of ideas that cost. And if City aren't strangulating teams in possession like they once were - keeping the ball in such a methodical way that opposition sides got fed up of chasing - then what exactly are they doing?",
      "Being more direct with fast wingers is ok if you have got the physicality to cope when play breaks down and City without the lesser-seen Rodri, arguably, do not. They won just 42 per cent of ground duels at Villa Park. Not for the first time, Unai Emery got his tactical setup spot on.",
      "Back to the drawing board for Pep, then. City need a new plan B.",
      "In case you didn't hear over the weekend, and you would have to live under a rock not to, Manchester United have won three consecutive Premier League games in the same season for the first time since February 2024. Ruben Amorim is nothing if not persistent, and his will has finally been rewarded.",
      "As he himself noted in the press room at Old Trafford after making a comfortable win over Brighton look difficult, though, a sense of \"suffering\" seems to surround Man Utd before any positive outcome is reached.",
      "Only they can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. How can a performance so assured coincide with one so fraught with nervousness? Perhaps we will never know. This seems to be Amorim's brand and for now it's working.",
      "What is clear and admirable about this version of Man Utd, which is all the more tangible when you watch from the terraces of Old Trafford, is how devoted the players are to the manager's cause. \"The players really like Amorim,\" Neville said over the weekend. \"He's authentic and honest. The players want to do well for him.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes in a sacrificial midfield role, Amad at wing-back, and Luke Shaw's willingness to slot into a back three are all evidence of the buy-in. The stars of this latest triumph, however, were undoubtedly Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - recruited to fit a style that is starting to show promise.",
      "While Pep's might be lost in the post, Amorim has got the modern football memo. This is not a side who are going to dazzle with intricate build-up, but can clearly sustain threat with fast, direct play that puts Cunha and Mbeumo at the heart of each attacking phase.",
      "Cunha's opener was also evidence of his maverick quality, which is helpful too. Since the start of last season no player has scored more times from outside the box than him (seven).",
      "\"We feel like we can solve anything,\" Amorim said with a smile on Saturday, later revealing he enjoyed the performance against Brighton better than beating Liverpool the week prior. \"It was more complete,\" he added. Some semblance of coherence is certainly building but Amorim was right to caveat his excitement with realism. He cannot afford to get complacent.",
      "Trips to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in consecutive weeks will stress-test just how much progress has really been made."

      "Only Manchester United can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. This was definitely a banana skin moment. United's recent record against Brighton is woeful and it's a fixture that always throws up drama. This latest instalment trended similarly.",
      "Just when United draw you in, Old Trafford bouncing with unbridled glee at being 2-0 up, they drop you like a sack of bricks. It was easy to be charmed by the first-half performance but the second proved this United side are far from flawless. How can they make things look so easy and so hard all at the same time? It's an art.",
      "Until Bryan Mbeumo slammed home a fourth in stoppage time there was a sense of foreboding seeping into the terraces. You could tangibly feel the atmosphere shift. Of the four big chances the hosts created, three were missed. And yet they still scored four times.",
      "That's what Ruben Amorim means when he emphasised in his press conference that this year's squad contains players who \"fit the style\". He's talking about the quality of Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo. A new brand of Manchester United matchwinner.",
      "Without them, this is still an average side very much trying to find its way.Laura Hunter",
      "\"Even when we don't play well, we're able to score two goals and create more chances than only the two we scored from open play.\"",
      "Arne Slot has, in essence, described the problem with Liverpool. At one end they are dangerous and at the other they are vulnerable. Even then it can be argued their attack is misfiring. He is yet to solve why this side is so imbalanced from back to front.",
      "There is no control from his midfield where, at Brentford, Dominic Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones, two No 8s, were sat behind Florian Wirtz. They are without the nous to receive the ball from the defence and play forward. Alexis Mac Allister is the answer to that.",
      "Then there are more trivial issues like Milos Kerkez, who is so woefully out of form and yet still trying to do everything too quickly rather than building some confidence by simply keeping it simple.",
      "Conor Bradley had one of his better evenings at right-back although is still clearly weighed down by being the heir to Trent Alexander-Arnold's throne. The reality is that he is just not as good.",
      "Not even playing alongside Virgil van Dijk can help Ibrahim Konate this season. The disappointment of missing out on signing Marc Guehi gets worse by the week.",

      "When will Nuno Espirito Santo give himself a chance too, after two incorrect line-ups against Leeds and Brentford saw him experiment with inverted full-backs playing on the wrong side and no centre forwards?",
      "After the disastrous first 15 minutes which saw them go 2-0 down, they were lucky this is a fairly misfiring Leeds side as it could have been worse before half-time.",
      "West Ham didn't deserve to get back in this game. Leeds ran nearly seven more kilometres than them, creating chance after chance right through the heart of the team.",
      "Given West Ham have been in this division for over a decade, that's unacceptable.",
      "There are holes in defence, holes in midfield and with Nuno reluctantly using Callum Wilson as their only recognised, fit striker, there's a hole in attack too.",

      "But on this evidence, Liam Delap's pending return from injury cannot come soon enough. The England man could be involved in midweek Carabao Cup action - and Chelsea are in real need of a central threat on this stage.",
      "Injured Cole Palmer's creativity is another big miss for a Chelsea team that struggled to carve a way through Sunderland's well-organised defence. That was illustrated by the Expected Goals figures, which showed Chelsea at 0.97 to Sunderland's 1.16 - despite the hosts having 69 per cent possession.",
      "But Guiu was bullied by Dan Ballard, unable to find an angle to receive a pass from his team-mates and then unable to retain possession when he did get it. After 76 minutes he was withdrawn having had just 10 touches.",
      "Joao Pedro later went up top, with sub Estevao going to No 10 but still Chelsea struggled to produce meaningful moments. It was an afternoon to wonder why there was such eagerness to offload Nicolas Jackson in the summer.",

      "But Regis Le Bris has combined a big summer splurge with well-organised tactics to defy the doubters. Sunderland's 17 points from their first nine Premier League games is the best return from a promoted club at this stage since Hull City in 2008/09.",
      "The majority of their points have come at the Stadium of Light, where their raucous home support matches the energy, physicality and intensity of the team. But on the road at Chelsea they showed quality in defence to shut out their hosts and then set-piece and counter-attack threat to hurt them at the other end.",

      "He comes alive at the big moments. The moments that matter. He defines what this Newcastle team are all about: fight and heart sprinkled with an abundance of quality.",
      "Against Fulham after the equaliser that left the game at 1-1, it was Bruno who grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck and shook off any feelings of fatigue from the Champions League in midweek to get his team the points. He broke up play, launched counter attacks and completely shifted the momentum of the game with his tenacity. And when his team needed someone bursting into the box to slam home a rebound, he made that run and got his reward with the winning goal.",
      "Big players don't just turn up in big games, they decide them. Bruno is doing that, repeatedly.Lewis Jones",
      "Fulham have a couple of problems. The surge of the newly-promoted clubs showing no fear and huge worries concerning their own final-third output which is lacking in freshness and quality.",
      "Despite showing promise in various phases in the defeat at Newcastle, Fulham were blunt in the key moments. To rack up 47 final third entries and 25 touches in the opposition box at St James' Park is a really healthy number but they simply didn't do enough with their territory.",
      "It's now four defeats on the spin and if the goals don't flow soon, pressure is going to mount. That will test the mental resilience of a squad whose recent seasons have delivered stability, rather than battling survival. This is a season that could easily evolve into a tension-ridden relegation fight rather than a comfortable mid-table campaign.Lewis Jones",
      "Carlos Baleba's form is a concern for Brighton. He has been substituted in all nine of his starts this season, departing just before the hour mark in the Seagulls' chaotic defeat to Manchester United. It has been worse. Three times he has been hooked at the break.",
      "After an improving showing against Newcastle, this was a return to the error-strewn efforts prior to that. Baleba switches off out of possession and looks far too loose in it. He was strongly linked with a move in the summer and does not seem to have settled.",
      "\"It is for the experienced players to get around him, ground him, have a couple of honest conversations because he is going to be a world-class midfield player.\" Still only 21 years old, that is most likely true given the potential that Baleba had shown previously.",
      "But this is an alarming dip in form from him now and the demands of the Premier League wait for no man. Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler is trying to play his star midfielder back into form but he cannot wait indefinitely. It is on Baleba to do more.Adam Bate",
