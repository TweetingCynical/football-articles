      "Micah Richards has rejected Luke Shaw's defence of Ruben Amorim following Manchester United's dire Europa League final defeat. United's abysmal season hit a new low with a 1-0 loss to Tottenham on Wednesday, compounding their worst domestic campaign since they were relegated in 1974.",
      "Shaw was involved as Brennan Johnson scored the only goal as Spurs inflicted a first European loss of the campaign on United. Despite the result, Shaw defended Amorim, declaring him \"100 per cent the right person\" for the job. However, in the wake of the loss, questions around Amorim's approach persist.",
      "As he hailed Ange Postecoglou's tactical flexibility, Richards slammed Amorim's stubbornness. Speaking on The Rest is Football podcast, the ex-Manchester City defender said: \"We've talked about Ange and his tactics, how he has this high line and doesn't want to change that.",
      "\"But actually, when they got the goal, they sat in a low block. I thought, 'Fair play to you.' He's not listened to anyone, he did what the game demanded.",
      "\"That's the biggest thing I took from the game. You've got one manager [Amorim] who stuck to his principles and was hoping this game would get them out of jail. It didn't get them out of jail.",
      "\"Then you've got a manager who thought, 'I have to adapt to what the game needs.' Sometimes you have to. Yes, the game was terrible, it was one of the worst finals I've ever watched, but who cares? Ange deserves big credit for adapting his style of play.\"",
      "Then, following Alan Shearer's claim that United needed a goalkeeper, centre-back, midfielders and a striker, Richards added: \"They need two wing-backs as well. How many times have we done analysis on United this season when a cross is mis-hit or pulled back to the wrong areas?",
      "\"And this is not me saying the United players are bad, they're just bad in this system that the manager persists with. That is the problem.\"",
      "However, a brutally honest Shaw insisted the players were at fault for an abject campaign as he apologised to fans: \"I think a lot of it has to do with mindset. I think self-belief is a big thing in football.",
      "\"I think a lot of times this season we've gone into games not believing that we can win. I think there's a lot of things that need to be changed. I think that's why Ruben is 100 per cent the right person.",
      "\"He knows and he can see day in and day out at the club, not just on the pitch but off the pitch, around the club. The standards, the mindset... like I said, I think he sees everything. I think he knows what he needs to change.",
      "\"I think, of course, you can't change everything at once. Of course, I think the results have not been good at all. But I think ultimately it's us as players that step onto that pitch. It's us as players that need to take the responsibility for these results.\""

      "Viktor Gyokeres has made a fresh admission over his future as he gears up for what is expected to be his final match for Sporting CP. The red-hot Swedish centre-forward has been tracked by Arsenal and Manchester United ahead of the summer transfer window but he wants to sign off as a double winner after Sunday's Taca de Portugal final against arch-rivals Benfica.",
      "Speaking to Portuguese TV channel SIC Noticias ahead of the crunch clash, Gyokeres was asked what the future holds, to which he responded: \"Hopefully you can expect I keep improving and score goals.\"",
      "When pressed whether he'd be staying put this summer, the ex-Coventry City striker added: “We’ll see. It’s the future. Football is like that, you never know what’s going to happen. As we saw this season, you never know what’s going to happen. And it’s the same thing now. We’ll see what the future holds.\"",
      "Newly-appointed Arsenal sporting director Andrea Berta has been championing the potential signing of Gyokeres since arriving at the Emirates Stadium in March.",
      "And if the Italian chief has done enough to win over Mikel Arteta by convincing him to pursue a deal, Arsenal would now be considered clear frontrunners for Gyokeres' signature following Manchester United's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been keen on a reunion with his former Sporting striker at Old Trafford but the 1-0 loss to Spurs is poised to have damaging implications for United's finances because they've now missed out on a golden ticket back into the Champions League where huge prize money is up for grabs.",
      "The Red Devils are already on the cusp of triggering Wolves star Matheus Cunha's release clause which is worth in the region of £62.5million. And if United want to continue spending cash of that magnitude they will have to make a number of high-profile sales with the likes of Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho among those that could yet depart.",
      "Gyokeres, who netted a hat-trick against Manchester City in November, wants to test himself at the highest level and play Champions League football next season while also competing for major silverware.",
      "Arsenal can offer him that, their budget would also allow them to finance a move but the sticking point is they've also considered other strikers such as RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, a long-standing target, as part of their extensive summer planning. Despite that, Mikel Arteta has already publicly disclosed that internally, the Gunners have already agreed on their final shortlist.",
      "Gyokeres, 26, has been hugely respectful to Sporting in the past few weeks despite facing countless questions over his future. There is a gentleman's agreement in place with the Portuguese club that will enable him to leave the club for a figure between £55m and £60m this summer which is significantly less than his £84.3m (€100m) release clause.",
      "Sporting were keen to reward Gyokeres for his loyalty as he did not push to pursue a new challenge in January following the departure of Amorim to United. It's understood that once again, out of respect for Sporting, Gyokeres has asked his representatives to inform suitors to refrain from formalising their interest in his services until after Sporting's season has been concluded."

      "Tottenham midfielder James Maddison put Roy Keane in an uncomfortable position during his post-match interview after the Europa League final. Spurs brought an end to their 17-year wait for silverware with a narrow 1-0 win over Manchester United in Bilbao, courtesy of Brennan Johnson's decisive strike, bundled in after a deflected cross off Luke Shaw slipped past Andre Onana.",
      "Although sidelined for the final due to injury, Maddison didn't miss the opportunity to remind one of his loudest critics - Keane - that he was now a Europa League champion. Earlier this season, the former United captain had criticised Maddison's inconsistency and mocked his darts celebration.",
      "So when the midfielder joined CBS Sports' post-match coverage, he proudly flashed his winner's medal. Opening the segment, he quipped: \"I wasn't gonna do any interviews but I heard Roy Keane was in the studio tonight!\"",
      "The panel burst into laughter, with Micah Richards urging the 28-year-old to recreate his darts celebration on camera. Maddison happily obliged, saying: \"Oh, I will, Micah, with pleasure - Roy Keane, that's for you, son!\"",
      "A slightly flustered Keane fired back with a good-natured dig, noting that Maddison hadn't actually played in the final: \"I've always said he's a good player, he needs to be more consistent, simple as that. And he played well tonight.\"",
      "Maddison cheekily responded: \"I'm the reason we're here tonight, Roy.\" Keane wrapped up the exchange with a smile, acknowledging: \"Don't worry, I know you played your part. Well done.\"",
      "The former Leicester City ace then reflected on the significance of the win, highlighting how media criticism helped fuel the team's determination and how lifting the trophy marked a turning point after years of disappointment for the club.",
      "Toward the end of the interview, Richards asked him to name his favourite pundit on the panel. Maddison responded with a smirk: \"Roy's not a regular, is he?\" prompting Jamie Carragher to jump in with a cheeky jab: \"A bit like you at Spurs!\"",
      "Without missing a beat, Maddison shot back: \"Turned up in all the big ones, Carra. You go and check your stats.\" The studio erupted in laughter once more before Maddison named Richards as his favourite and headed off to join the rest of the Spurs squad in celebration, ready to kick back and \"enjoy a beer\".",
      "Keane - never one to sugar coat analysis - took aim at Maddison in the lead-up to Tottenham's 1-0 Premier League win over United back in February. \"We saw James Maddison at Tamworth, he was taken off! Tamworth are non-league,\" he said.",
      "\"People say, 'Maddison's the man', but when is he going to step up to the plate? He got relegated with Leicester and [looks like] with Spurs. Maddison isn't bad but if you think he's going to come back and get Spurs top six, you're in cuckoo land.",
      "\"He's a talented player, but if you're a player in the Spurs dressing room and he's back in the squad, you wouldn't be looking and going, 'James is back today – we're going to be fine!'.\"",
      "Maddison ended up scoring the only goal of the game, and he celebrated with a 'shush' celebration that many felt was aimed at Keane. He also poked fun at Keane's comments with a post on TikTok after the game.",
      "Tottenham's win in Bilbao not only means they've ended their long wait for a major piece of silverware, it also sees them seal an unlikely route into next season's Champions League. United, meanwhile, are left picking up the pieces after enduring their worst domestic season in over half a century."

      "Alan Shearer says Manchester United didn’t want to win the Europa League final as much as Tottenham did. The pundit and former England striker went on to slam the Red Devils’ tactics, calling their last-ditch attempts to score by putting Harry Maguire up front “embarrassing”.",
      "Two of the Premier League’s worst sides this season produced a truly forgettable Europa League final on Wednesday night. Spurs, ravaged by injuries all season, took the lead 42 minutes in through Brennan Johnson after a comedy of errors by Luke Shaw and Andre Onana saw the ball brush onto the Tottenham winger and trickle in at the near post.",
      "The north Londoners sat deep for the rest of the match as Ruben Amorim’s side chased the game and dominated the second half possession stats. But United offered no imagination in their attacking play and resorted to lumping balls into the box - to no avail - as Spurs held firm to win 1-0 and claim their first trophy in 17 years.",
      "United even used central defender Maguire as a makeshift striker in the final 10 minutes as one last throw of the dice, which failed to come off. And Shearer, speaking on The Rest Is Football podcast, blasted the Red Devils’ tactics at the end of the game while calling into question their desire to win on the night.",
      "The former Newcastle captain said: “It was just [Spurs] bodies on the line trying to chuck themselves in front of whatever Man United were throwing at them. And they did that.",
      "“Man United never did enough, they were rotten and they’ve been rotten all season. They’ve been awful, it’s been embarrassing for them.",
      "\"Spurs deserved it, I thought. I think they wanted it more and they were up for it more than United, that was apparent to me.”",
      "Venting his frustration at their reliance on Maguire to score, he added: “Let me say one thing to you, Man United were an embarrassment tonight. And in the semi-final.",
      "“They chuck a 6ft 4in centre half up to centre forward in desperation in the last ten minutes of the game, lugging huge balls into the box.",
      "“That’s how you’re going to get out of trouble? That’s how they got to the final, because of Maguire going into that position.",
      "“Man United are not the club that they were 20 years ago, only by name. They’re a million miles off it both on and off the pitch. I don’t know how they’re going to get over this.”",
      "United’s only big chances came from crosses, with Leny Yoro failing to meet a Bruno Fernandes free-kick while Rasmus Hojlund’s header was cleared off the line. Fernandes himself also fizzed a header past the post, while Guglielmo Vicario made a last gasp save to keep out Luke Shaw’s header in added time.",
      "As Spurs lifted their first European trophy since 1984 and cemented their place in next season’s Champions League, United lost to Ange Postecoglou’s side for the fourth time this season.",
      "The night was widely regarded as a new low for a club which has lost all sense of identity in the years since Sir Alex Ferguson’s departure. For United, there will be no European football next season off the back of their worst ever Premier League finish to date.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games in the 2025/26 season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Ruben Amorim has revealed that Manchester United had been planning for life without the Champions League as they head into the summer transfer window. United lost the Europa League final to Tottenham on Wednesday.",
      "Given they sit in 16th place in the Premier League, 27 points adrift of the top five, the final in Bilbao had been their last chance to qualify for Europe's premier competition. Brennan Johnson's first-half goal was enough to condemn them to defeat.",
      "United had been building up to a major squad overhaul in this summer's transfer window. Embattled boss Amorim had been hoping to bring in a number of players which may have helped him to turn his reign around.",
      "But missing out on a lucrative spot in the Champions League means that United's transfer plans will have to be changed. The Red Devils had been closing in on the £62.5million signing of Matheus Cunha and a £40m move for Liam Delap.",
      "Doubts are now likely to emerge as to whether United can afford to actually push those deals over the line. But Amorim has now insisted that club chiefs had already been preparing for exactly this scenario.",
      "\"We have two plans for the market and we have to understand it is tough for a club like ours not to be in the Champions League,\" he said. \"But we have to use the other side. We have more time to work during the week on the Premier League and that will be our focus.\"",
      "\"It's in the future, I'm not going to talk about the future. This loss, the pain of losing this match. I can see it was clear, we were the better team but then we managed not to score again.",
      "\"It's very hard to win football matches but the guys tried everything to win the game. In the future, we will have time to assess everything. I think I was always really honest with you guys. We didn’t perform perfect today.",
      "\"But we were better than the opponent, and the opponent also played. In the second half, we try everything – with the central defenders, with the players wide, crosses going inside the box.",
      "\"I think I’m really honest with you guys, so I expect the same and there are some days where I said we were really poor. I think today was not the day. We were not perfect. We have a lot to improve, but I am always honest with you guys.”",
      "Missing out on the Champions League likely spells the end of United's pursuit of Tyler Dibling. The 19-year-old had emerged as a target for the Red Devils having impressed for Southampton, despite their dreadful season.",
      "Saints will demand £100m for their wonderkid. It was reported last month that if United missed out on the Champions League, and the £80m in prize money that comes with it, a move for Dibling would be put on the backburner.",
      "Instead, it was claimed that Amorim would prioritise signing a centre-forward and an attacking midfielder as part of his plan B. It is a plan that will now have to be activated."

      "The Portuguese raised eyebrows with his team selection in Bilbao, notably leaving Garnacho on the bench, with Mason Mount and Amad both being given the nod in attack, supporting Rasmus Hojlund. It came after Garnacho had fuelled speculation over being dropped from the first team after sharing an Instagram snap of him scoring in the previous season's FA Cup final.",

I think self-belief is a big thing in football. I think a lot of times this season we've gone into games not believing that we can win.”",
      "With United - currently 16th in the Premier League - facing a season without any European football, Shaw is well aware of the consequences of the desperate defeat in Bilbao. But in his despair, he wanted to stress how appreciative he has been of the support of United fans through this disastrous campaign.",

And his situation could become more complicated if Ruben Amorim ends up leaving this summer.",

      "“But today was the day that mattered, the most important day of the competition. It was the day we could have been in the history of the Europa League, but it's not like that. And football is cruel, and it's been our turn to lose.”"

United are one of five Premier League sides interested in signing the Lyon star this summer – and Thierry Henry has given them some advice on how to get the best out of him.",
      "Cherki is poised to leave Lyon in the summer transfer window after catching the eye of many scouts by contributing 12 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances. He is understood to have a €22.5million (£19m) release clause in his contract and Lyon know they are powerless to resist the widespread interest.",
      "Henry has coached Cherki in his old role with France Under-21s and the Olympic team and knows what makes him tick. The Arsenal legend says that, while his talent is not in doubt, Cherki has to be encouraged to contribute defensively.",
      "\"We didn't give him anything, he got through it, and that too is the strength of a great player,\" Henry told L'Equipe. \"Everyone knows what he can do. And this season, he has shown that he also knows how to do what is expected of him without the ball, that is to say, adapt to a system.",
      "\"His problem was that he had never been able to play a string of matches to show what an extraordinary player he is. But to play a string of matches, he had to do things, defensively, throughout the duration of a match.",
      "“This season, he did it, so he played a string of matches. I appreciate this kid so much... It's just that at certain times, you had to be tough, like a father with his son.",

      "The statistics certainly back up Henry’s assessment. Cherki has scored 13 goals in 23 games for France Under-21s and is now expected to be called up to the senior Les Bleus squad this summer.",
      "But for now he is focused on securing a transfer, having dropped a strong hint after Lyon’s 2-0 win over Angers in their final league game of the season. He said: \"Thanks to OL, the coach, the staff, the president, my teammates and all people at the club.\""

However, stoic performances by Porro, van de Ven and Udogie helped keep United at bay. A goal late in the first half was the difference and so Tottenham will play Champions League football next season.",

      "\" Cristian Romero - A battling leader at the back. He took the knocks and constantly frustrated United. Was given the man of the match award.",
      "\" Micky van de Ven - Defended well throughout and then came up with a brilliant acrobatic goal line clearance to stop Hojland's header looping into the net. What a night for the young defender.\"",
      "\" Destiny Udogie - Struggled with Diallo's pace in the first half but grew into the game enormously and became an attacking force in the second period. Made a great challenge in the Spurs box before racing up the pitch with Solanke who couldn't control his pass on the run in a two vs one situation. Came off late after taking a couple of knocks on barnstorming runs.",

      "Mohamed Salah was quick to congratulate Tottenham's Europa League success as the Liverpool icon referenced Ange Postecoglou's second season claim. The Australian was adamant he would deliver a trophy this term, as has been the case in the past.",
      "Postecoglou has been able to continue with his trend and back up his words by winning on the European stage, downing Manchester United in the final as Brennan Johnson came up with the only goal at San Mames.",
      "Tottenham have been poor domestically and sit 17th in the Premier League, but have been able to step up in Europe. They've seen off the likes of Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt en route to the final and the Liverpool icon has recognised Tottenham's success and their manager's claim.",
      "The Egyptian tweeted: \"He did say he’d win in his second season. Congratulations!\" - and it was reposted by Jamie Carragher. Postecoglou piled the pressure on himself earlier this season when he declared that, throughout his managerial career, he's delivered in his second season.",
      "He said several months ago as the pressure began to mount: \"Usually in my second season, I win things. That’s the whole idea. The first year is about establishing principles and creating a foundation. Hopefully, the second year is going on to win things.\"",
      "He doubled down on that bold claim and added: \"I’ll correct myself - I don’t usually win things, I always win things in my second year. Nothing’s changed. I’ve said it now, I don’t say things unless I believe them.\"",
      "The Tottenham boss has been able to back up his words and succeed where the likes of Mauricio Pochettino, Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte failed. They couldn't deliver the trophy the club so craved but they've now claimed silverware for the first time since the Carling Cup in 2008.",
      "Former Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson said on the BBC : \"The players, the staff, the supporters you can see what that means to the club. They have won a trophy. They have taken away that 'Spursy' tag and nobody can point that at them any more. 17 long years without a trophy, a really poor domestic campaign, it's all turned around.\"",
      "Postecoglou has presided over one of the worst league campaigns in Tottenham's history. They've been beaten more than 20 times, but the Australian has been able to cover for those setbacks by claiming glory in Europe and, in doing so, landing a spot in the Champions League."

      "Manchester United star Harry Maguire had to be separated from Cristian Romero moments after the Europa League final. Maguire's side were beaten by Romero's Spurs in a tight game at San Mames, with tensions boiling over after the final whistle.",

      "It was then that staff members began to intervene. Maguire continued pointing and speaking, while Romero appeared to reply to his fellow centre-back.",
      "The pair had clashed in an on-field incident during the latter stages of the game as well. Maguire was penalised for a foul on Romero, picking up a yellow card in an incident which saw players from both teams get involved.",
      "Ultimately it was Romero who finished the game on the winning side, with Brennan Johnson scoring the only goal of the game as Spurs beat United to win the competition and earn a spot in next season's Champions League. Romero, a World Cup winner with Argentina, now has another winner's medal to add to his collection.",
      "\"All the fans get battered, we get battered for not winning a trophy. We had to get the first one, I'm so happy. Ever since I came here it has been 'Tottenham, good team but can't get it done', but we got it done.\"",
      "Former Spurs boss Glenn Hoddle praised current manager Ange Postecoglou for his role in the win. \"Ange Postecoglou got it right in the end,\" he said.",
      "\"He played three in midfield and particularly in the first half that overpowered Man Utd. Second half, there was a case of holding on and hanging in there. They defended like trojans. Hopefully, it's a stepping stone for more.\"",

      "For the entire duration of a nerve-addled Europa League final, Ruben Amorim barely stood still.",
      "He probably covered more ground than Casemiro. And he did not know whether to have his hands in his pockets or out. In fact, Amorim’s anxiety was a tone-setter for a match that barely featured a confident passage of play from either side.",
      "Amorim always cuts an obsessed figure in and around the technical area but this was different level. And quite frankly, his uncertainty, his change of game-plan - leaving Alejandro Garnacho on the bench - was one of the key factors in this excruciating defeat for Manchester United.",
      "Amorim has been afforded considerable benefit of the doubt since his appointment at Old Trafford but this cannot be dressed as anything other than a failure on his part. Let’s put it this way, if Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s brains trust does not have a thorough inquiry into this loss against a very average Spurs side, it is not doing its job.",
      "Of course, Amorim needs better players - as do Spurs - and this match was glaring evidence of that. As far as the atmosphere inside a wonderful stadium goes, this occasion lived up to the pre-match billing.",
      "As far as the standard of football expected from two teams who have lost a combined THIRTY-NINE Premier League matches this season, this occasion also lived down to its billing. The 40 minutes that preceded a suitably ugly opening goal were not bad, they were spectacularly bad.",
      "Nerves? Perhaps. But as well as being a reflection of their standing in the English game right now, it was a luminous illustration of the challenges that lie ahead for both clubs. In terms of truly elite football, they have fallen off a cliff and scaling their way back towards the top is a seriously arduous task.",
      "It really is hard to describe how poor the first half of this match was. It was a litany of misplaced passes, clumsy fouls, shanked crosses, bad decisions and thoughtless attacking. It was dire. It probably did not help that both managers had been a little conservative in their team selections and set-ups but even so, the failure to be able to do the basics correctly was startling.",
      "And most of us knew how poor these teams were. In United’s case, this was indeed further evidence that the level of squad overhaul needed is extremely high. But one player who will be a big asset going forward is Amad Diallo.",
      "For good portions of this match, he was the only player worth watching, a player with both the attitude and technique that can make things happen. To be fair to Spurs, they were missing a couple of players who have that same mindset but they were still surprisingly afraid to commit men forward.",
      "And that fear was only heightened by Brennan Johnson’s goal. With a nod to Ange Postecoglou’s famous soundbite, it certainly wasn’t who they are, mate. To sit so deep was a risk but, apart from one dramatic Micky van de Ven clearance, they rarely looked in truly serious danger of conceding a goal that would have taken the final into extra-time.",
      "And that is because United were frantic and lacking calmness and composure. They had taken their lead from their manager - and it cost them dear."

      "Fernandes has given his best years to United and is closing in on 300 appearances for the club, but he hasn't got the rewards his performances deserve and defeat in Wednesday's Europa League final means he will have to forego a season in the Champions League next term.",
      "United's captain turns 31 in September and although he insists he is happy to remain a part of the Old Trafford rebuild under Ruben Amorim, he has just two years remaining on his contract, with the option of a further year, and they look further away than ever from returning to the top of the domestic game.",

      "United are confident of signing Wolves playmaker Matheus Cunha for £62.5million and are interested in Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap, who will be available for £30m due to a release clause.",
      "\"We have two plans even for the market,\" Amorim confirmed, \"and we need to understand that is tough for a club like us not to be in the Champions League.",
      "\"But we have to use the other side. So if we have more time, we have more time to think during the week and be better in the Premier League, that will be our focus.\"",
      "United have won six out of 26 Premier League games since Amorim took over on November 11. Tottenham eliminated them from the League Cup in the quarter-finals and Fulham knocked United out of the FA Cup in the fifth round on a penalty shootout to leave their season dependent on the Europa League.",
      "Since the domestic season resumed after the March internationals, United have not won a single league game and they are winless in eight. They have slid down to 16th but Amorim genuinely believes there have been signs of improvement.",
      "\"I think I was always really honest with you guys, we didn’t perform perfect today,\" Amorim added. \"We were better than the opponent. In the second half, we tried everything with central defenders, with players wide, crosses, going inside the box.",
      "\"I’m really honest with you, there are some days where I said we were really poor, today was not the day, we were not perfect, we have a lot to improve but I'm always honest with you guys.\"",

      "This is factually and undeniably the worst Manchester United team in 51 years. A team so bad they have lost four times to Tottenham in a single season. The United end emptied quickly at full-time.",
      "Players stood, dumbfounded. Amad sank to the turf and was motionless. All the bravado about United's trophy-winning pedigree counted for nought.",
      "In a season where relegation was never a tangible threat, it does not get more humiliating for United to be the wreckage above those three sunken ships in the table and losing to Tottenham in a final. The worst Tottenham team in living memory.",
      "United's followers belted out their Ruben Amorim chant louder than ever in the first half. Bonnie Tyler was played in Bilbao bars and at the stadium. If she was performing live she might have been outsung by the 14,700 red phalanx.",
      "Come the second half, it did not get a single airing. Glory was within touching distance, with the Europa League trophy pitchside at kick-off. If the glory days are to return under the incumbent United manager, it will not be until 2026. United players stayed to watch Spurs lift silver.",
      "There will be no European football at Old Trafford next season. For the first time since they re-entered the European Cup in 1993, it will be two years without Champions League football.",
      "The team that invested £108.5million on two strikers in successive summers sent Harry Maguire up front again. This time, lumping it up for the big man did not come off.",
      "This is what United get for not having the nerve to sack one manager, yielding to fickle fans, backing him in another Dutch-centric transfer window, only to replace him a third of the way into the season with a manager so far removed from his predecessor that he forecast a \"storm\". The gales are howling.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo also emerged in the last knockings, almost as if Amorim attempted to summon the spirit of Lyon. Joshua Zirkzee attempted to rally his teammates. Seven minutes were added on, much to the dismay of those in Lilywhite. They may have turned white when Guglielmo Vicario palmed away a header.",
      "After the late afternoon arrival time on Tuesday and the japes at the pre-match press conference, United's preparation looks casual in retrospect. Spurs touched down in Bilbao on Monday, their coach relished the siege mentality he cultivated and made good on his word. Ange Postecoglou can walk down the Seven Sisters Road with a winner's medal.",
      "United have not scored in 16 games this season and this was the first time they fired blanks in the Europa League. Three of those have come against Spurs, below them in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim, a stickler for pragmatism with the worst United squad since they were relegated, remained loyal to his instincts. There was one change from the team that started at Chelsea on Friday, which felt at the time like a dress rehearsal. Amorim did not dress it up.",
      "He will have to abandon that pragmatism next season. The ends have not justified the means. United are not only not good, they are not good to watch.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho did more in his first couple of minutes than Mason Mount did in his 71 minutes. Garnacho, benched for the second match running for the first time since January at Stamford Bridge, did not take his final snub well. He passive-aggressively posted images of his FA Cup final goal last year hours before the team news was announced.",
      "When the United line-up was confirmed an hour and 15 minutes before kick-off, Garnacho was their only player out on the pitch, in conversation with former teammate Sergio Reguilon. The injured Matthijs de Ligt was the only other United player who strolled around the turf in their Paul Smith suit. Garnacho, one of a handful of fan favourites, was serenaded when he warmed up.",
      "Garnacho, Zirkzee, Mainoo, Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot were the first five substitutes to pull on their bibs and limber up at 0-0. They hurtled down the touchline again as soon as the second half restarted, put through their paces by the fitness coach Paulo Barreira. United supporters were roused by Garnacho's and Zirkzee's belated introductions in the 71st minute.",
      "Mount, picked ahead of Garnacho on account of his familiarity in the 3-4-2-1 system and experience of starting five finals for Chelsea, did not justify his selection. Rasmus Hojlund barely got a kick but did get his head to the ball from Vicario's clanger, only for Micky van de Ven to acrobatically volley the ball off the line.",
      "Come the 54th minute, Andre Onana's order to wait to take a free kick inside the United third got some fans' backs up. They will have remembered that Spurs went 1-0 up against United in both league games and kept clean sheets. A minute later, Onana was ushering Leny Yoro forward with the ball.",
      "Amorim railed against United's fast-and-loose approach, berating Casemiro after Spurs almost came a Dominic Solanke first touch away from a chance to make it 2-0. The contest doubled for a tennis match with a sudden back-and-forth rally and Amorim welcomed the stoppage for Richarlison's injury to offer Harry Maguire some advice.",
      "There was some kidology pre-match, with United selecting a larger-than-normal travelling squad and Postecoglou electing Son Heung-min to attend a pre-match press conference only to bench him. It extended to the coin toss, with United instructed to kick towards their supporters in the first half.",
      "Fernandes alerted teammates, already primed for a huddle, to the switch. Tottenham's players then walked back into the half they originally occupied to form their own huddle in front of their lilywhite-clad followers.",
      "For a contest between the fourth and fifth-worst teams in the Premier League, this was not a spectacle. The only polished piece of play in the first half ended scruffily with an own goal.",
      "Of all the contentious calls, Luke Shaw did not fall into that category. A starter in four games in 14 months before Wednesday night, he was not just undeserving of selection but undercooked. Brennan Johnson capitalised on Shaw's sluggishness with the most rudimentary of near-post runs.",
      "Shaw glared at Patrick Dorgu, also blindsided and culpable. But Shaw started the game lethargically and ended it so. Amorim got what he deserved.",
      "United got the season they deserved."

      "United suffered a disappointing 1-0 loss to Spurs in Bilbao to confirm their worst-ever season in 51 years. Brennan Johnson's scrappy first-half goal was the difference to bring Champions League football to north London.",
      "Ruben Amorim's men came close to equalising through Diogo Dalot's stoppage time header in what was a frustrating evening in Spain.",
      "Garnacho, who was named on the bench at the Estadio de San Mames, came on the final 20 minutes on the left wing looking to cause damage. However, he was unable to break down Spurs' stubborn defence.",
      "The winger had started 10 of United's previous 14 Europa League fixtures but Mason Mount was selected ahead of him alongside Amad behind the striker.",
      "After Garnacho's brother, Roberto, caused a stir with his post on social media, the United winger spoke to some members of the media in the mixed zone as a visibly frustrated figure.",
      "Speaking to ESPN Argentina, he said: “I played every round to help the team reach the final, and today I only got 20 minutes… I don’t know.",
      "\"I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.” He added: \"This season was s***, losing the final and not beating anyone in the league.”",
      "Garnacho is one of the players at Old Trafford who could now be sold in the summer transfer window to raise funds.",
      "The Argentina international attracted interest from Chelsea and Napoli in January and his situation is expected to be monitored during the summer."

Amorim will have his first summer transfer window to try and change that soon but he will have to try and attract players without the lure of the Champions League."

      "There is only so long a team can ride its luck for and on a cloudy night in Bilbao, Manchester United found out they had rolled the dice once too often. There is to be no salvation this season. No silverware to wash away the stains of mediocrity that have engulfed this football club.",
      "For two years, United have been failing upwards. Last season, they lost 14 times in the Premier League and finished eighth. This season, they have lost 18 times (with one still to play) and could finish 17th. They've been getting worse, but somehow climbing closer to the promised land.",
      "On Wednesday night, they finally fell to Earth. Now the reality will sink in, and it will be a painful one for the players and Ruben Amorim and his staff. Amorim's song was still being belted out long into the night in Bilbao, but he is mostly responsible for overseeing United's worst season in more than 50 years.",
      "For months, United have clung to a Thursday night tightrope, overcoming a series of games that promised to define their season. But the journey was going to end one way or the other in the Basque Country, and this time, they couldn't keep their balance. Instead of the Champions League, there will be a season that could be as short as 40 games.",
      "There will be nine Premier League clubs in Europe next season, but somehow United won't be one of them. They will be watching along with the other also-rans, the Wolves and West Ham's of this world. Both are recent winners at Old Trafford.",
      "That is where United are in the food chain now, and Amorim knows it. He has delivered a very different message ahead of this final to Ange Postecoglou. Amorim knows his team aren't ready for the Champions League and he admitted as much last week.",
      "\"That is my feeling,\" said Amorim. \"We need more time with the team. We need to arrange a lot of things in Carrington that we need more time to do so we’re not thinking game by game by game. Then we have the squad.",
      "\"We proved this year that we need to be a better squad if we want to win European games and then be really competitive in the Premier League. That is going to be tough. My feeling is that.\"",
      "You wouldn't say Amorim has got his way, but he has no excuses now. He was desperate for the silverware and knows this is a club that belongs in the Champions League. But now he has those free midweeks, and he has to make the most of them.",
      "In 2015/16, Chelsea leapt from 10th to title-winners without European football. Moving United from 16th to sixth would be considered an achievement. Maybe just keeping his job would be a start.",
      "Amorim didn't want to join mid-season and this is why. He told everyone there were tough times ahead, and boy, have they been tough. Now he doesn't even have a trophy to show for a disastrous seven months. If results don't pick up quickly next season, then the spotlight will turn on Amorim fairly quickly.",
      "But they don't deserve to be at Europe's top table. They are closer to the Championship than the Champions League, and this summer has to be a turning point. Amorim will get the backing he craves, but plenty of managers have been sacked for less.",
      "As the United end emptied rapidly inside San Mames, it was worth remembering the origin story of this journey. The run here had encompassed 14 Europa League games, but this wasn't a route that began at Old Trafford against FC Twente back in September.",
      "They didn't qualify for this competition through the league but via the FA Cup. They had to beat Manchester City at Wembley 12 months ago to book a spot in the Europa League.",
      "So it's actually a journey that began in the freezing cold surrounds of Wigan in January 2024, on a bitterly cold Monday night in the FA Cup third round. To most observers, being 6-4 down to Lyon on aggregate with six minutes of extra-time to play was the closest this run came to ending for United. Maybe it was actually at Wembley last April, when the scoreboard read Coventry City 4 Manchester United 3 with the clock running dead.",
      "Victor Torp had already celebrated the goal that would have completed a comeback for the ages - and signalled the immediate end of Erik ten Hag's tenure. Some United fans had already left Wembley when the VAR spotted Haji Wright was a toenail offside in the build-up.",
      "Twenty games later, they had somehow slogged it all the way to Bilbao. But luck can only take you far. At some point, quality has to take over, and that is something United desperately lack."

      "Even while the question was being asked, Ruben Amorim was struggling to stifle a laugh. In fact, he found it so difficult to keep his composure that he had to reach for the glass of water in front of him. His chuckling started to set off Bruno Fernandes in the seat next to him.",
      "The subject of their fun sat on the other side of the United head coach. Harry Maguire has, in many ways, been the hero of this Europa League campaign. An injury-time equaliser at Porto and then that unforgettable winner in extra-time against Lyon that sent Old Trafford into a frenzy.",
      "There was also the twisting, turning dribble down the wing in this very stadium three weeks ago. He went one way, then the other, and then he whipped in a cross that ended with Casemiro setting United on their way to a Europa League semi-final cruise against Athletic Club.",
      "Manuel Ugarte flicked that cross on to Casemiro, so Maguire didn't actually get the assist, which is perhaps Exhibit A as to why these starts can be so worthless. Everyone knows the 32-year-old was the real hero of that goal.",
      "So it was that a journalist asked him if these \"inspirational moments\" in attack were all part of a new tactical plan. Amorim's laughter would suggest not, but Maguire played along.",
      "“The manager has me dribbling down the wing every day in training,\" he said to laughter.",
      "\"I found myself on the wing against Bilbao and managed to put a good cross in and Casa scored the goal. Someone just asked me before, I’ve gone up front in the later minutes of a game. Hopefully tomorrow night I’m not going up front, I don’t want to be going up front and chasing a game, I want to be defending a lead from my position in defence.",
      "“I’m always there to help and do my best, but I’m more than happy playing in my favoured position.\"",
      "Maguire will be a certain starter in that back three tonight, and it will be a reward for his years of service to United. Another question asked him how it felt to now be so important to this team when, for so long, the noise around him had been \"toxic.\" He swerved that one, but his recovery is one of the feel-good stories out of Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "It's easy to forget now, but the build-up to the Europa League final in Gdansk in 2021 focused on Maguire's fitness. He was nowhere near being fit, but United took him along and had him pictured in training to keep up the suspense.",
      "The next time United reached a cup final, he was a figure of fun, routinely jeered on pre-season tours and captain in name only. He was on the bench for the Carabao Cup final success in 2023 and came on for the final two minutes, sharing the trophy lift with Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Maguire stopped to speak to reporters in the mixed zone at Wembley that day and insisted he was happy to be part of a trophy-winning United side after six years without silverware, but he must have been hurting at seeing his role reduced.",
      "\"I don’t have any mixed emotions, it’s been so long since the club won a trophy, it’s a really good day for the club and the fans,\" he said that day.",
      "\"I am club captain and my main job is to move this club forward and to bring success back to the club and today has been part of it. Obviously, listen, I am a footballer who wants to play games and I want to lead the boys out of the tunnel at the start of the game but also like I said I understand this is part and parcel of football when you play at the top level and you have got huge competition for places.",
      "\"It’s a real good day for the club and for me and a proud day for my family who were in the stands and saw me lift my first trophy for Manchester United.\"",
      "United were in an FA Cup final later this season, and Maguire didn't get off the bench in the defeat to Manchester City. A year later, he was injured for the Wembley win against Manchester City.",
      "So in four cup finals since his £80million move from Leicester City in 2019, Maguire has missed two through injury and played a combined two minutes in the other. It sums up his fortunes at United.",
      "But over the last couple of years, the narrative has turned again. For all of those cup final disappointments, the winner against Lyon felt like his moment at United.",
      "“I've had some amazing moments at this club, been here six years now and I've had some great times and some bad times as well,\" he said.",
      "\"I think that game pretty much summed up my time at this club, to be honest! It was an incredible feeling to score that winner in such an important game, in a game that was full of emotion and the strangest, maddest game I've ever played in or witnessed.\"",
      "Now, finally, Maguire will get to play in a cup final. He's no longer captain, but he's more of a leader now than when he wore the armband. He's had to wait for this moment, but few players deserve this final more than Maguire."

      "Following the 2-0 defeat to West Ham at Old Trafford earlier this month, a downbeat Amorim insisted that he should resign as manager if he cannot change the culture of the club. This led to some fears that he may choose to step down in the summer or early next season if results do not improve.",
      "However, ahead of the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur, Amorim told CBS Sports that it is his desire to stay at Old Trafford for many years to come. \"That is clear, of course I am always open to any decision of the board, especially when I feel that I don't deliver what's supposed to be but I am 100 per cent,\" he explained.",
      "\"This is my dream club, I waited for so long to change my club because I just want this club and I am here to stay if the board want.\" Currently, Amorim has the firm backing of United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "The Ineos founder hailed the Portuguese head coach back in March. When asked about Amorim, Ratcliffe told the BBC: \"If I actually look at the squad which is available to Ruben, I think he is doing a really good job to be honest.",
      "\"I think Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do.",
      "\"He's an excellent manager and I think he will be there for a long time. You are beginning to see a glimpse of what Ruben can produce.",
      "\"I think you saw a glimpse of it against Arsenal. How many players against Arsenal on the bench did you recognise?",
      "\"How many have ever worn a Manchester United shirt for [the first team]… as there's no squad left. We are down to the last 10 or 11 men in the squad really, of proper first-team players. Ruben is doing a super job.\""

      "An agreement regarding his future, which allows him to leave for a set fee, was reportedly reached with his club earlier this year.",

      "Spurs should not be blamed for reconsidering the future of Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester United really ought to give Ruben Amorim another think.",
      "",
      "1) If history truly is written by the victors, the history of the Tottenham has been a second-hand account for too long.",
      "In the words of the scorer of the goal which salvaged from a wreckage of a season the club’s first silverware in 17 years: “We get battered for not winning a trophy, so we had to get the first one in a while today.”",
      "It didn’t feel particularly Spursy to take the lead in such a ridiculously critical final and defend it so diligently. It seemed like the conclusive appointment for Dr. Tottenham to treat an unimaginably ill patient back to miraculous health through unthinkable incompetence. The world was waiting for a moment of ultimate schadenfreude which never came.",
      "The team which finished third in a two-horse race. The Put The Pressure On merchants. The Europa League winners. Warra trophy indeed. The end-of-season DVD might be entirely unwatchable for the first few chapters but the final scenes were more euphoric than anyone dared to dream.",
      "",
      "2) It is ludicrous that from the embers of what should have been one manager’s stunning mic drop, another has delivered perhaps the single most vindicating middle finger in recorded history.",
      "“If they don’t want me, then I go somewhere else to win trophies because that is what I do,” said Erik ten Hag after inspiring Manchester United to a victory at Wembley which paved this absurd path to the Europa League final almost exactly a year later.",
      "That directly influenced Manchester United to bottle the decision to sack the manager, the ramifications for which have been severe, obvious and not yet fully realised; it remains to be seen whether this grants Ange Postecoglou the time and patience he believes is needed “to build a team that can be successful for four, five years”.",
      "“I don’t feel I’ve completed the job here,” he added. And there is a substantial difference between Manchester United collecting trophies under different coaches even in these directionless post-Ferguson years, and Spurs ending a drought which has crippled them for almost two decades. The manager who achieved that was always going to be hailed as an icon and a legend. It is almost impossible to remove emotion from that equation and until the final whistle blew in Bilbao it was difficult to compute or appreciate how much this would change the mood, the complexion, everything.",
      "This muddies the decision over Postecoglou’s future considerably and there honestly doesn’t feel like a clear answer exists any more in the same way it absolutely did at Old Trafford 12 months ago. Spurs would be completely forgiven for basing the call on one game in a way Manchester United never should have. As far as counter-arguments to finishing 17th go, few can ever be as compelling.",
      "",
      "3) Postecoglou will, either way, always have his “I always win things in my second year” conversation-ender. It has a slightly more positive ring to it than Jose Mourinho’s third-season syndrome, and thankfully overshadowed most of the talk about what Spurs should do next.",
      "The 59-year-old deserved his moment away from the idle speculation which has followed and taunted him for months. There are legitimate criticisms to be levied over a great many aspects of this Spurs season, and questions worth asking as to whether this suddenly eradicates those problems heading into next season, but far too much commentary has crossed over into something more personal against Postecoglou, whose infrequent tirades have been understandable.",
      "This is a career-defining success more than 40 years in the making. He is the first coach from outside of Europe or Argentina to ever win a European trophy, and it is almost impossible to fathom the farcical amount of barriers he has faced from the beginning of his journey to this incredible peak.",
      "“The strategy was to bring in a trophy manager and we did it twice. You have to learn from the mistakes,” said Daniel Levy in September 2023. Spurs broke Mourinho and Antonio Conte, but not Postecoglou.",
      "",
      "4) A couple of months after that revealing statement from Levy came the quote which, until now, had encapsulated Postecoglou’s Spurs reign.",
      "“It’s just who we are, mate. It’s just who we are. It’s who we’re gonna be for as long as I’m here.”",
      "Premier League leaders Spurs, down to nine men after less than an hour, had continued to deploy a high line, kept attacking Chelsea whenever possible and fell on their swords in an eventual 4-1 defeat. It was a stirring performance and message but one which summed up a naive stubbornness they could not possibly use as solid foundations upon which to build.",
      "It has not been especially relevant for some time, particularly in this tournament. Spurs have kept as many clean sheets in the Europa League this season as they have in the Premier League despite playing 23 more games in the latter, having shown a willingness to compromise and evolve.",
      "This was a continuation of the quarter and semi-final second legs: a sacrifice of principles to focus on resolute, organised and compact defending to consolidate a position of strength. It might have felt a little early for some when Postecoglou substituted his goalscorer to form a five-man backline in the 79th minute but it paid off handsomely.",
      "Spurs had the fewest shots, possession share and completed passes of any major European finalist on record. And they won. It’s just who they are now, mate.",
      "",
      "5) That makes for an uncomfortable contrast with Ruben Amorim, who might well have overseen his worst Manchester United game at the least opportune time.",
      "An ineffective set-up was compounded by a lethargic approach and a bizarre reluctance to change anything which played into Tottenham’s hands. The first substitutions came about 20 minutes too late and it is remarkably damning that the one concession Amorim seems willing to consider at the expense of his system is to stick Harry Maguire up front for the final five minutes and get it into the mixer.",
      "That worked against Porto and Lyon in this competition and Leicester in the Carabao, but even at their worst Spurs were fully prepared for the best Manchester United had to throw at them.",
      "Even after the game Amorim said he “will not change” how he operates and if that remains his stance after abdicating their Premier League responsibilities for six months in the name of a final they didn’t bother to show up for, it is worth wondering whether Manchester United should simply cut their losses again.",
      "It seems unlikely but when the £21.4m it cost to install Amorim is added to the £4.1m paid to hire and fire Dan Ashworth, the millions lost in prize money and the spiralling expenses required to rebuild this mess in the transfer window, it is increasingly difficult to envisage the manager surviving any vaguely efficient end-of-season review without the hierarchy contorting itself to justify their apparent foolishness.",
      "Of course, this is Sunk-Cost Fallacy Football Club we are talking about here, and they will plough on for at least a few more months after things become clearly untenable.",
      "",
      "6) It might be simplistic but the differences in how these two teams approached the final in the build-up alone were stark.",
      "The Manchester United pre-match press conference featured Amorim, Maguire and Bruno Fernandes all cracking jokes, while the Spurs equivalent was headlined by Postecoglou admonishing a journalist for suggesting he could be labelled a “clown”.",
      "The Australian has defended his players to a fault, with Amorim desperate to publicly immolate both himself and his squad.",
      "He also said winning the Europa League “will not change anything in our problems” and openly wondered whether not qualifying for the Champions League would be more beneficial in the long run; Postecoglou showed no shame in underlining how it meant everything to him, the players and the club itself to win it and “change things”, from their trajectory to how they are perceived.",
      "Even the starting line-ups were diametrically opposed. Spurs made ten changes with Pape Matar Sarr the only survivor, and Manchester United made one with Victor Lindelof the sole casualty. The former favoured rest while the latter opted for rhythm, but long before a ball was kicked it was resoundingly apparent who this meant more to.",
      "",
      "7) The last disparity came just before kick-off. The Manchester United starting line-up gathered in a huddle near the centre circle, oblivious to the Spurs players who walked past them to applaud and appreciate the fans rocking in the end they would be attacking.",
      "They formed their congregation in front of that riotous travelling support in a show of unity between the players and the fans. It was a small but meaningful gesture which had no bearing on the result but it summed up the fractious nature of Manchester United in 2025 that they didn’t think to do the same.",
      "",
      "8) The first 20 minutes or so were characterised by high pressing, manic defending and nervous goalkeeping from both sides.",
      "The plan for Manchester United seemed entirely contingent on getting the ball to Amad; with Spurs it was a little less obvious beyond testing Andre Onana with quick deliveries into the box.",
      "Postecoglou’s side had 13 crosses to Manchester United’s 12 in the first half. In the second half it was zero to 20 as Spurs turned their best form of attack into an obdurate defence. Cristian Romero reached such a flow state that he started a war with Maguire just to keep himself busy.",
      "",
      "9) On that note, here is a passable impression of Sean Dyche on co-commentary a minute before Crystal Palace scored in the FA Cup final:",
      "‘Against a Man United side who don’t generally require a great deal of breaking down and offer frequent gifts, the presence of Spurs’ first-choice backline may be of far greater significance than any absences further forward.",
      "‘Most obviously, Man United’s back three is vulnerable specifically to wide players ghosting in at the far post to score from crosses. They have conceded almost the exact same goal five times in their last three Premier League games – twice against West Ham, twice against Brentford and against Chelsea.",
      "‘It is a goal Spurs score frequently, with Brennan Johnson’s Temu Raheem Sterling act a genuine potential gamebreaker here.’",
      "What a shame it was a front-post Johnson ghosting which ultimately decided the game. Tickers, you fraud.",
      "",
      "10) But what a worthy goalscorer, even if UEFA’s insistence that Luke Shaw did not administer the final touch feels slightly hollow.",
      "It was Johnson’s goal in spirit either way, his run which caused communicative ripples in the opposition defence, his presence which proved such a nuisance as to render Manchester United’s eight-to-three numerical advantage in the box from Sarr’s cross wholly moot.",
      "For a player who was compelled to deactivate his social media accounts due to fan abuse in September, and who felt uneasy enough in his relationship with those supporters not to celebrate the goals he scored soon after, it was a stunning moment.",
      "Johnson’s movements off the ball might genuinely be among the best in the Premier League and this was further reward for his work. If Nottingham Forest qualify for the Champions League this weekend there might finally be competition for Dan Burn in the What A Week For stakes.",
      "",
      "11) The ball came off Shaw but there were arguably three teammates more culpable for the goal. The cross could even have been cut out at source really but a clever Rodrigo Bentancur run did stretch the play well.",
      "Maguire seemed to choose not to get a touch when he could have cleared it. Onana’s reaction time was pitiful and perhaps even specifically designed to try and make the save which never came look better. But Patrick Dorgu can shoulder most of the blame.",
      "Shaw, monitoring Dominic Solanke, pointed to Johnson on multiple occasions to prompt his teammate to mark the Welshman more tightly. Dorgu was already a step or two behind when the ball came in, and Shaw only realised when Johnson emerged over his shoulder. The way it was bundled into the net was unfortunate from Manchester United’s standpoint, but the amateurishness of what came before made it possible.",
      "A few minutes earlier in the first half, a cross reached Dorgu at the back post with no Spurs player in the vicinity, but he chested the ball out for a corner to Onana’s frustration. It is unknown whether he received the call from a teammate to take his time or simply ignored it, but for a similar situation to unfold soon after is inept at this level.",
      "",
      "12) From that point Spurs were largely content to defend, as was their right. The unheralded key to success on that front was how they consistently broke up the play.",
      "They committed 22 fouls, at least three more than in any other game under Postecoglou, with the honours split evenly across the team and Pedro Porro the only starting outfielder not to pitch in.",
      "It prevented Manchester United from establishing any momentum and reached a glorious crescendo around the hour mark, when Richarlison forced about five different stoppages in the space of a few seconds. He was a fitting leader of the sh*thousing charge.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester United never really did identify a coherent solution and much of that was down to the performance of Fernandes. So often their stimulus, the captain became a burden.",
      "It was his passes which were intercepted in the build-up to the Spurs goal, he who missed a huge chance with an unmarked header from Noussair Mazraoui’s ball in, he who caused so many attacks to break down with poor decisions executed imperfectly.",
      "His teammates should not escape censure for failing to step up and share the burden, but there was a tangible sense that this particular glare was too much for Fernandes to handle. Postecoglou did say he planned to “overwhelm” the Portuguese but the occasion and pressure seemed to do that too.",

      "",
      "14) Might he have switched places with Mason Mount to exert more influence? The England international was anonymous on the left, with all attacks filtered down the other side through Amad.",
      "The one chance which fell to Rasmus Hojlund did so through the fingers of Guglielmo Vicario when the Spurs keeper let a cross slip away, but Micky van de Ven did wonderfully to hook the Dane’s header away.",
      "Mount and Hojlund were substituted in the 71st minute as Amorim finally looked towards his bench for solutions, and while Joshua Zirkzee and Alejandro Garnacho did spark an improvement it was not enough.",
      "The change Manchester United needed to make throughout the second half finally arrived in the 90th minute with Kobbie Mainoo replacing Dorgu. They needed a ball-carrier, a disruptor, a change in approach from the surfeit of crosses Spurs were happily heading away.",
      "Amorim keeping five defenders on the pitch for so long when the opponent had shown no attacking intent since around the hour mark was baffling and it cost them. There was enough quality on that bench to make an impact but it was used sub-optimally.",
      "",
      "15) Postecoglou ultimately nailed his decisions in a way Amorim categorically did not. That started with one of the biggest calls of all: to leave out Heung-min Son.",
      "There were echoes of the 2019 Champions League final, when a blatantly unfit Harry Kane was given the nod by Mauricio Pochettino to start and he was predictably ineffective. Son had played the previous two Spurs games on his return from injury but could not have argued when Richarlison was named in his place.",
      "Son has been more patient and understanding than Spurs have had any right to expect over the years, but Postecoglou was right to overlook sentimentality and make a choice which benefitted the team. Richarlison justified it completely, as did Son’s shaky start when he came off the bench.",
      "When the captain did settle into the motion of the game he did his bit to help Spurs see it through. Perhaps no-one has done more over the years to earn that trophy.",
      "How apropos that Spurs and Kane ended their long waits in the same season; by staying to complete the journey Son might have overtaken the legacy of his former teammate as the best player in the club’s modern history.",
      "",

They’ll be very fortunate if any club offers even half that much for him now.",

      "Rio Ferdinand blamed the goal entirely on Patrick Dorgu, but Shaw pointing at Brennan Johnson at least twice in the few second before he nipped in ahead of him to score was pretty damning evidence that he knew he was there despite the pundit’s claim to the contrary.",

      "Spurs’ £50m asking price represents a significant markup, even from the £33m they paid Sporting in 2023, and quite the coup if they can get it for a footballer who has retained his value after a standout first season at the club through an inauspicious second campaign in which his quality on the ball has been good in the main but his defending has been found wanting on multiple occasions.",

      "Manchester United have got “a real baller” on their hands in Joshua Zirkzee, who’s been tipped to become a “superstar” under Ruben Amorim by a former Red Devil despite being ‘up for sale’.",
      "Zirkzee joined United from Bologna for £36.5m last summer and has managed just seven goals and three assists in a debut season which featured him being jeered off by his own fans during a defeat to Newcastle in December.",
      "His performances before suffering injury in mid-April were more positive though, certainly better than those of fellow striker Rasmus Hojlund, and Lee Sharpe reckons with a consistent run in the side the “real baller” can become a “superstar” at Old Trafford.",
      "“I like Zirkzee – he was unfortunate to get injured when he did, but he’s a real baller and I think he can be a superstar for Manchester United if he can get games under his belt,” Sharpe told Metro via Coin Poker.",
      "“He needs a regular run. I don’t think he’s had a 10-game stint where he has actually played week in, week out.",
      "“There were reports that he wasn’t quite fit when he signed, so it took him a bit of time to get up to speed. I think he was just finding his feet when he got injured but I think he’s going to prove a real key player next season.”",
      "Zirkzee made a shock return to training this week but the Europa League final clash with Spurs may have come too early for the Dutchman.",
      "Football Insider claim United have put both Zirkzee and Hojlund are ‘up for sale’ ahead of the summer transfer window in order ‘to make way for top striker target Liam Delap’.",
      "The report states that the Ipswich striker is ‘set to arrive at Old Trafford in a £30million deal with United in pole position to secure his signature ahead of Chelsea and Everton’.",
      "It is understood that at least one of Zirkzee or Hojlund will need to be sold ‘to free up space in the squad and raise funds for further summer business’.",
      "Matheus Cunha’s arrival at Old Trafford in a £62.5m transfer from Wolves looks to have been sewn up and Sharpe believes both he and Delap will be good additions to Amorim’s squad.",
      "“I think both players look like good acquisitions,” Sharpe added.",
      "“I’ve seen Delap a few times this season and he’s a good, big strong typical number nine. He holds the balls up well, which is what you need in any team but he also knows where the goal is and puts defenders under pressure.",
      "“He’s still young enough to improve and for the position United are in – not quite challenging for the league but looking towards that top six – and I think he would be an ideal signing.",
      "“Cunha speaks for himself. In a team like Wolves, which have struggled at points this season, he’s been the standout player.",
      "“He’s a little bit like Kobbie Mainoo in that he can beat players, create a chance and score a goal. I’d like him to calm his temperament down at times – you don’t want him getting sent off and costing his team games just because he’s losing his rag – but ability-wise I think he’s really good and a great addition to the squad.”",

      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United are eyeing five priority signings during this summer’s transfer window amid one concern with their ‘primary’ target.",
      "The Red Devils have a lot of work to do during this summer’s transfer window as they look to make wholesale changes to their squad.",
      "This is required with Man Utd’s current squad not fully suited to Ruben Amorim‘s preferred 3-4-3 formation, while most of their players have not done enough to justify sticking around beyond this summer.",
      "Results in the Premier League have been abysmal this season as they could finish 17th, but they could still salvage something from this campaign as they face Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "A trophy, Champions League football and a huge injection of cash are up for grabs in the Europa League final, so a victory should set Man Utd or Spurs up for a significant upturn heading into next season.",
      "READ: Man Utd and Spurs so stupid they’ve broken the supercomputers ahead of Europa final",
      "Man Utd are currently miles away from challenging for the Premier League title, with upgrades required in most positions.",
      "It has been widely reported that United’s priority is to strengthen in forward positions this summer, with Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap among their preferred targets.",
      "Now, a report from The Times claims Man Utd ‘will have £100m to spend even if Spurs win the final’, though club chiefs believe this budget could reach £200m via selling Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "The report deems this viewpoint a ‘tad optimisic’, with Chelsea and Aston Villa not guaranteed to sign Sancho and Rashford permanently. Regarding Sancho, it’s noted that Chelsea ‘could prefer to pay a £5million penalty’ instead of investing £25m to make his deal permanent.",
      "Cunha is said to be Man Utd’s ‘primary’ target, with Man Utd ‘confident that Amorim can tame his temper’.",
      "Delap is another named target, while United are planning three more signings.",
      "‘The striker Liam Delap, who is available for £30million after Ipswich Town’s relegation, is a target while the wingback positions need strengthening and Bayindir is likely to be sold to make way for another goalkeeper to rival Onana for the No1 jersey.’",
      "It is also revealed that Man Utd’s summer transfer window ‘will be led by the technical director Jason Wilcox’, with INEOS ‘happy with his work so there are no plans to recruit a director of football’.",
      "Man Utd could also raise funds by sanctioning pure profit exits for Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho, but they ‘will only leave if a club makes a substantial bid for either’. While the latter is ‘most likely to depart’, the Red Devils ‘would like to keep both players’.",
      "Man Utd have put Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee on the transfer list as they prepare for an imminent new signing, according to reports.",
      "Emiliano Martinez has established himself as one of the world’s best. The bravado that made him so might not work at Man Utd if he replaces Andre Onana…",
      "Man Utd and Chelsea could face fresh competition for the signature of Liam Delap from a fellow Premier League club, according to reports.",
      "Matheus Cunha “loves Man Utd”. It gives them an advantage, but the Brazilian might be part of the last generation who see them as special.",
      "Jamie Carragher has warned a Premier League striker to steer clear of a move to Man Utd, naming Everton as a more suitable destination.",

      "The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss was initially keen to wait until this summer to make the move, but he decided to join early after being given an ultimatum by co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and United‘s board.",
      "The 40-year-old has struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation as Man Utd’s current squad is not suited to this set-up and performances in the Premier League have been shambolic.",

      "READ: Man Utd losing Europa League will lead to ‘relegation and even bankruptcy’",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd’s best performances have come in the Europa League as they have reached the final.",
      "The Red Devils face Tottenham Hotspur in the final on Wednesday night and this is a massive game, with a trophy, Champions League football and much-needed prize money at stake.",
      "A loss would be disastrous for either side, but a report from The Times claims ‘the noises coming out of United are that Amorim will be in charge next season, regardless of the result of the Europa League final against Tottenham’.",
      "This is partly to do with Amorim’s strong relationship with Ratcliffe, as the co-owner ‘would try to talk him out of walking’ if it came to it ‘because he rates him so highly’.",
      "The report has also lifted the lid on Amorim’s relationship with Ratcliffe, who ‘speak every week by phone’.",
      "It is also noted that they ‘occasionally communicate in a WhatsApp group that contains other senior figures’, with ‘Amorim sharing his thoughts on games in a mini-match report and data is fed into the group too’.",
      "One such message was about Casemiro, who Amorim praised for ‘running 10.5km in the first leg of the semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao, more than any other player’.",
      "Amorim’s ‘man-mangement skills’ are ‘admired’ by United’s hierarchy, with Casemiro going from being an outcast to being ‘close’ to the head coach.",
      "The report also reveals Man Utd’s ‘main reason’ for standing by Amorim. They explain:",
      "‘The main reason why Ineos have so far refused to pull the trigger on Amorim’s reign is because they truly believe that with a full pre-season under their belts, and a revamp of the squad, he will have the tools he needs to start making United successful again.\nManchester United player in team uniform.",
      "‘There is an acceptance that he has had to spend much of the season placing square pegs in round holes. Noussair Mazraoui, for example, spent most of his career playing as an orthodox right back, but there is a chance the Moroccan will be asked to continue at wingback against Spurs, although Diogo Dalot — along with Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee — returned to training on the eve of the final.’",
      "The Man Utd star has opened the door to a summer exit after being dropped by Ruben Amorim for the Europa League final having “played every round”.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has hit out at Ruben Amorim for his team selection as a Man Utd star was ‘thrown under the bus’ ahead of defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has offered to fall on his sword for Manchester United this summer and admits sacking Ruben Amorim would be the “easy” decision.",
      "Spurs should not be blamed for reconsidering the future of Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester United really ought to give Ruben Amorim another think.",
      "Ruben Amorim says he will leave “without conversation or compensation” if Man Utd want to sack him after losing the Europa League final.",
      "Ruben Amorim has an atrocious Premier League record which cannot be entirely masked or excused by Manchester United reaching the Europa League final."

There has been talk from BBC suits of the need for the show to feature ‘more chat’ and Mediawatch finds itself in broad agreement with McEvoy’s central thrust that this would be a bad idea, that people want to watch the highlights and a bit of analysis and not just the analysis. But also not just the action. There are plenty of other options for those who want those things. As McEvoy puts it, Match of the Day should be…",

What is he going to do? He took the right decision. He dealt quite well with the game, I think. He cannot do much more. It’s obvious he’s not the one that has made a mistake today,” he said.",

I don’t know what we have to do to change something but obviously it’s costing us a lot. We haven’t won on Sunday because of VAR and we are out of the cup because there is no VAR,” he said.",

      "“I think it was clear what happened, I asked for an offside and for VAR but they think I asked for a yellow card and it wasn’t even a foul for Liverpool. Probably they understand why but they cannot accept any appeal for yellow cards they told me, so I will be upstairs, yes,” he said of his suspension.",

      "“I was booked because I was complaining about the tackle against Joel. For me, of course we can mistake that in the Premier League that it’s a yellow card but I think nobody can complain if it’s a red. Not because of the foul but it’s more like the way he’s going into the duel,” he said.",

      "“I know what the fine will be and I also know that I will be on the sideline against Chelsea. I also have to learn out of this situation, how fast you can get a red card here in this league. But, of course, the fine we will accept. If you give a red card for this, you have to ban a lot of coaches during the games because in an emotional situation of the game it will happen that you make a step on the pitch. Of course we are role models and we have to act like this. But I think sometimes you also should bring out your emotions. In this case it was to protect Joao Pedro because it was a hard tackle on him. If I don’t show emotions there, me as a player, I would say, ‘the coach isn’t interested in me’, so that’s why I try to show emotions in some part of the games,” he said.",

      "“In the end, you can give the penalty but you can’t not give the foul on Bart. When it continues like this, you see it every weekend the blocking goalkeeper – if the Premier League doesn’t find a clear rule it will end in a different sport. In a normal game when a player is blocked when the ball is not near from him, it’s always a foul, so I don’t understand why it’s not a foul, they have to find an answer. It can be part of the game, but it should be a clear rule as to what is allowed and what isn’t. When it happens during the game you always get a foul in the midfield if you’re blocked, so why not blocked on a set-piece?” he said.",

I have to deal with it, deal with the pressure and the disappointment. I will try and be a role model in the case of finding the right solutions. That is my job now,” he said.",

Eight yellow cards probably because these sort of games are about duels and fight and this can happen. Sometimes the game demands the way you have to behave,” he said.",

So this is the reason why I left the pitch immediately and then when we scored the second one I celebrated and this is the reason why they gave me a yellow card. But for sure I think it was a nice moment for the players and for the fans to share that moment,” he said.",

      "“I think everybody in the stadium would have been booked if the referee could have got around to it. I’ve just accepted that the refereeing is where it is. The key message to us was that the threshold for tackles and duels, in this beautiful English game that we love, was going to be raised. I can remember it clearly. And then we get that,” he said.",

      "“We were very disappointed with a foul not being given on Vards for the first goal. And although we don’t come into games trying to get players sent off, why he hasn’t sent off Calafiori is a little bit beyond belief. Because of the spell we’re in and the spell that I’m in personally, I’m trying to not let referees’ decisions be the headline, as I’m trying to take responsibility for a team that needs to get better results. But we feel those were two poor decisions,” he said.",

      "“Maybe there’s a bit of sympathy for the linesman. He’s a Premier League linesman and he’s used to the protection of VAR. But he can’t make a mistake like that. It was a big moment in the game. We score soon after and it should be 1-1. It’s 2-1. The referee’s enjoyed giving me a yellow card as well. He looked like he had a good time tonight. That was that. But I want to stand up for my team. You can’t just see an image on the bench and just accept it,” he said.",

So it was a handball, I don’t know if it was, but everybody was screaming for it, so I did as well. Then there was the red card situation, then there was the penalty situation just afterwards. So there were a few things going against us, and I think sometimes you cannot hold your emotions, and that’s what you saw with me as well. He deserved to give me a yellow card. He should have given me, which he did. I deserved it. I have to put it like this,” he said.",

      "“Last time, I said I completely deserved the yellow card. This time I don’t think I did. So many times they were on the floor, which can happen in football, I don’t blame them for that. But they always fell down after they had ball possession and that took the energy out of the game in my opinion. I said to Ibou Konate, ‘This is a f**king joke.’ The fourth official thought I said to him: ‘You are a f**king joke.’ That’s definitely not what I said. I got a yellow for that so now I’m on two and I have to be careful,” he said.",

      "“There were a few moments when I could have been given a yellow card. It’s an emotional game and we were a man down, it’s frustrating. It’s good to see our performance after so many setbacks. It’s difficult to judge for me because I only see it in real-time like the referee. We have to accept what VAR sees. You know how important these decisions can be. We ended up with a draw and I don’t think we can blame the referee for that,” he said.",
      "Fourth booking\nEverton (February 12) – shown a red card by Michael Oliver after the game for persistent foul and abusive language after Everton’s late equaliser; Abdoulaye Doucoure and Curtis Jones were also both sent off after the final whistle.",
      "“I won’t go into details. I think what happened was the extra time ended up being eight. It happens a lot. The emotions got the better of me, if I look back I would love to do it differently. There is an ongoing process and I will respect that. Many things happened in extra time that led to me being quite emotional. There was a VAR review for two minutes and I thought, maybe the only thing that could happen is he looks back at the foul, or maybe it’s offside. Of course then, after 10 minutes you hear there fans cheering and you [realise] it’s not offside. It is an emotional sport and sometimes individuals with emotions make the wrong decisions. That is definitely what I did,” he said.",

It was clear for me and for you. We have to respect the decision but it had a massive impact in the game. If it’s a penalty, he should’ve been sent off, he didn’t try to play the ball.

Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Ollie Watkins and Alexander Isak.",

      "9) Liam Delap (Ipswich Town)\nEvery Premier League club – except Arsenal – is chasing Liam Delap, hopefully resulting in an exciting transfer saga that ends at the right time instead of dragging on and on and on.",
      "Despite attracting interest from several competent football clubs, it’s reportedly Manchester United (or Chelsea… or United again) leading the race. Delap is open to the move, which should be enough of a red flag for everyone else to back off and let United crack on.",
      "Twelve goals in 36 matches in a debut Premier League season is a very solid return for the 22-year-old. Not long ago it was 12 in 30, which looked even better and explains the hype.",

      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",

      "Still, the hype is real. Chelsea seem very keen – him and Delap fit their ‘project signing’ blueprint. This is why Arsenal prefer Gyokeres, who is more of a ready-made title winner.",

It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",

      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Liverpool, though Man United and Arsenal are obviously in the picture.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",

Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",

Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea now seem to prefer Sesko and Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",

      "Manchester United are at \"rock bottom\" according to Luke Shaw after losing the Europa League final 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur; Ruben Amorim claims he is still the right man for the job - but would leave if the fans and board do not want him",
      "By Pete Gill",
      "Thursday 22 May 2025 09:08, UK",
      "Manchester United's season, already their worst ever in the Premier League, hit a new low in Bilbao as they lost to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Victory would not have turned United's season into a positive, but it would have provided a glimmer of light and reason for optimism.",
      "Instead, after losing for the fourth time this season to the team 17th in the Premier League, United's road back to the elite looks longer than ever. Once again, more questions are being asked of Manchester United and their head coach than answers are being provided.",
      "What is the identity of Amorim's United?",
      "United's performance in Bilbao raised familiar concerns, not merely about their quality but also their style. Amorim stuck rigidly to his favoured 3-4-3 formation even into the final stages when every Tottenham player was behind the ball. \"I will not change,\" Amorim repeated afterwards and his resilience is admirable.",
      "But the evidence this formation does not suit his players is close to overwhelming, a consistent pattern of play still has not emerged, and Amorim's belief in his system felt a stubborn streak too far deep into the final stages in Bilbao when United, predictable and stifled, kept three centre-halves on the pitch despite Tottenham's obvious refusal to leave their own half.",
      "Is the head coach's position under threat?",
      "If it is, it should not be. Amorim needs more time and, given the size of the problems he inherited, deserves it too. Practically, United probably could not afford to change their head coach again, and certainly could not afford to accept that if Amorim goes, everyone involved in his appointment will have to go too.",
      "But it is also fair to say that Amorim had a very bad night in Bilbao. Never mind the formation, what about the team selection? Starting Mason Mount was a colossal misjudgement, immediately exposed when Alejandro Garnacho did more in his first five minutes on the pitch than Mount had done in the previous 70. Ange Postecoglou did not only beat Amorim tactically, he also won the selection battle - the decision to start Richarlison and leave Heung-Min Son on the bench was comprehensively vindicated.",
      "Amorim showed up well in his post-game press conference. But he almost always does. Likewise, Luke Shaw was outstanding in his summing up of the situation and post-final support of his head coach. The problem is that United only ever seem to impress these days in their off-field media duties.",
      "How many players do United need, to the nearest 10?",
      "Ouch. It is a question that was posed midway through the final and it is tough to answer it is only 10.",
      "Do United have the finances and clout to overhaul their squad?",
      "While Amorim predicted at the start of the week that a win would only help deliver one more summer signing, the bottom line is that victory in Bilbao would have been worth an estimated £100m for a club who have lost £300m over the last three years.",
      "United simply may not possess the financial clout this summer to overhaul their squad half as much as they want or need to.",
      "It was especially worrying to hear Fernandes acknowledge as much late on Wednesday night.",
      "\"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cash in or whatever, it's what it is,\" said the United captain.",
      "Hardly the assurance.",
      "What is Matheus Cunha thinking now?",
      "And what about Liam Delap?",
      "United will not have any sort of European football next season.",
      "Never mind the finances, and they are a huge obstacle to the overhaul, do United still have the pulling power?",
      "Andre Onana - twist or twist?",
      "From a footballing perspective, it is tough to argue that United's worst decision in the last few years has not been replacing David de Gea with Onana. There have been flashes but no more than that. What there has not been is enough saves or convincing performances. United need a new goalkeeper. But they also need at least two new forwards, a couple of wing-backs and some authority in midfield. Given the choice, where do you place a goalkeeper in that list of actions?",
      "Do 'pure profits' Mainoo and Garnacho have to be sold now?",
      "From an all-important PSR perspective, selling 'homegrown' Kobbie Mainoo and Garnacho would be hugely beneficial. But when an overhaul begins with selling your best players, just how far back are you?",
      "Does playing once a week, with up to 10 teams in Europe next season, actually help United?",
      "It does and it does not.",
      "Postecoglou was very clear after the final that he had given up on the Premier League in order to focus on the Europa League. But there was a whiff of convenience to that explanation. To what extent are Tottenham simply not that good? The problem with the Premier League is that there is not an equivalent of playing Bodo/Glimt in the semi-final and United may well find, even with the extra rest of inactivity, that it makes no decent difference without good enough players. True, they will not be tired. But just because they are not tired does not mean they will not be terrible.",
      "What United really need is new players, and a lot of them, to start hauling themselves out of this rut, and it is far, far harder to attract and finance those new players without European football.",
      "Champions League qualification was not a cure for all their ills but it would have been a significant route forward in their road to recovery.",
      "It would have been both an escape route and escapism.",
      "Now United have neither."

      "Thursday 22 May 2025 08:55, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has said he will leave Manchester United tomorrow if the club's board and fans no longer want him - after their Europa League final loss to Spurs left him at rock bottom.",
      "Amorim took over at United in November with the club 13th in the table. They have slipped three places with Amorim knocked out of the three cup competitions in the process. But the Portuguese coach believes he is still the right man for the job.",
      "\"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation,\" said Amorim. \"But I will not quit again. I am confident in my job. As you see, I will not change anything in the way I do things.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not here to defend myself. It's not my style. I have nothing to show to the fans. In this moment [I need] a little bit of faith.\"",
      "Man Utd are facing another summer rebuild under Amorim, whose side sit 16th in the Premier League and have now fallen at the final hurdle in Europe.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, who was speaking moments after Amorim vowed not to quit but admitted he would walk away without compensation if United's board and fans wanted him to, backed the United boss to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "\"We just agreed that he's the right man,\" Fernandes said of his compatriot, who succeeded Erik ten Hag in November.",
      "\"He has done a lot of good things. We know that the manager is looked at by the results. Obviously we see more than that as players.",
      "\"We know for everyone it will be about him bringing back the positivity in the club, trying to bring the club back to fight for trophies, fight for the big trophies. And we all agree that he's the right man.\"",
      "Asked what he would have to say to co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the club's decision-makers, the skipper said: \"It's not my decision, but I do think the manager is the right one.",
      "\"I don't think that it will be a better person to come into the job and to do the job. I know it's difficult to understand that, it's difficult to see that, but I still do think that he's the right man to lead the club.",
      "\"I do think that obviously the club is in a situation where it's easier to get a different one in because the results haven't been there.",
      "\"But as my other team-mates said, and I repeat myself, I do think he's the right man.\"",
      "Speaking after the final, a dejected Luke Shaw also claimed Amorim is the right man - with every single player needing to \"question ourselves on if we're good enough to be here\".",
      "\"We're all gutted, it's not how we saw the outcome to be honest,\" Shaw said. \"But it's not just tonight, this whole season, it's been nowhere near good enough. I think all of us have to question ourselves on if we're good enough to be here.",
      "\"For a team like Manchester (United), for the season we've had, it's not acceptable. We know that, we all know that, I know that. It's not where Manchester (United) should be.\"",
      "But asked about Amorim's credentials, Shaw said: \"I can say 100 per cent right now he's the right man. Results have not been good at all. I've been here for a long time now and been through different managers.",
      "\"Ruben, for me, I talk on my behalf and I can talk on behalf of all the players, he is 100 per cent the right manager to take us back to where this club should be.",
      "\"It's going to be a very difficult process, us as players, we've let a lot of people down, including Ruben. I will say it again, we've been nowhere near good enough the whole season.\"",
      "Shaw - who was involved in the calamity defending in the run-up to Johnson poking over the line for Spurs' first-half winner - apologised to the fans, admitting the club are now at \"rock bottom\".",
      "\"A lot has to change, it's clear to see,\" said Shaw. \"That's why I say Ruben is 100 per cent the right person. He knows what is to be done at this club, I believe he will do everything to make that change and put Manchester back at the top.",
      "\"I think the fans? I understand that right now they are going to be annoyed. And rightly so. But all I can say is thank you so much for the support.",
      "\"Everywhere we go, including where we are in the table, the results we've had this year, they've always still been there.",
      "\"I can only say firstly thank you so much for your support, and secondly we're very sorry for what they've had to go through this season. It's been nowhere near good enough and I can only apologise for that.",
      "\"We have to look at the positives and the only positive is we can only go up from here. We're at rock bottom now, we have to find a way to drive ourselves back and get back to where this club deserves to be.\""

      "Tottenham beat Manchester United 1-0 in the Europa League final thanks to Brennan Johnson's winner; Cristian Romero was a rock at the back for Ange Postecoglou's side while Micky van de Ven saved Spurs in second half; Bruno Fernandes, Andre Onana and Rasmus Hojlund had nights to forget",
      "Thursday 22 May 2025 01:18, UK",
      "Tottenham are Europa League champions, ending their 17-year wait for a trophy by beating Manchester United 1-0 in Bilbao.",
      "Brennan Johnson's winner late in the first half was enough for the north Londoners to book a spot in the Champions League next season - and increased the pressure on Ruben Amorim at Manchester United, who will be subjected to their lowest-ever Premier League finish and nothing more.",
      "Got away with it, then became a hero. An early stumble but Rasmus Hojlund could not take advantage, and he then gifted a chance to the same United striker, only to be saved by Micky van de Ven's acrobatic heroics. Produced two good saves to deny Alejandro Garnacho and Luke Shaw late on to redeem himself. At least one goalkeeper turned up…",
      "Two excellent halves for different reasons. The first half saw him use his wand of a right boot to create some good openings, then he had to be defensively secure in the second period.",
      "He's never lost a final and you can see why. The Argentina defender showed excellent awareness throughout as he marshalled his side's low block brilliantly, making more clearances than any other Spurs player. He even got into Harry Maguire's head when the United centre-back started to threaten in the box. Spurs have to keep him to develop - but will he stay?",
      "That clearance. That athleticism. The Dutchman was just as solid as Romero but his acrobatic heroics to deny Hojlund that leveller will be remembered just as much as Johnson's goal. What a way to make yourself a hero.",
      "Looked nervous early on, swiping at a Man Utd corner and getting turned by Amad Diallo too many times. But he then grew into it and shut down the United winger in the second half. His game was summed up by a great tackle in the box to deny Amad a decent opening, before breaking to set up Dominic Solanke's big chance for 2-0. He did so much running, it is no wonder he had to come off late on.",
      "Solid. Won the second-most duels out of any Spurs player on the pitch - behind Romero - and the second-most tackles behind Udogie. Will be one of the more underrated players from this success.",
      "Like Bissouma, a good water carrier, doing a lot of the dirty work without being spectacular. All three of Spurs' midfielders kept Bruno Fernandes very quiet, giving the Manchester United danger man next to no space.",
      "Superb cross for Spurs' opener - exactly what was needed after his side lost James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski to injury for this big game. Did not hold the ball well enough but that did not really matter in the end. It was not punished.",
      "Caused all sorts of problems early doors for Luke Shaw and you could see his opener coming. That trademark run from back post to front under Ange Postecoglou's tactics is destined in Spurs' folklore for generations. Did his work in the other direction too.",
      "You felt for the Spurs forward - he did so much running off the ball without getting many touches. Should have done better with a chance on the break for 2-0 but set up a decent chance on the break for Heung-Min Son at the same time. An important moment.",
      "A shock inclusion over captain Son - but you can see why he got the call up. Less of an attacking presence and did not do much in the air against Noussair Mazraoui, but his defensive performance and selfless display was excellent. He was taken off with an injury, which showed how much he committed.",
      "Actually, you could see why the Spurs captain did not start. He came on and even then he struggled, being beaten in a race by Patrick Dorgu despite playing an hour less football than his counterpart. Has he lost his legs?",
      "Brought on to shore up the backline as another centre-back and helped with the low block, including one huge clearance from an Amad cross. Had half a chance from a free-kick but did not take it.",
      "Nervy, shaky, unconvincing in his decision-making. Onana's frequent reluctance to come out and claim crosses or back passes created nervousness in defence for United - and gave Spurs an invitation to cross. He was not totally at fault for Spurs' opener but the indecision took its toll. More cons than pros this season by quite a way - time for United to move on?",
      "Not great but not bad. Nearly caught out by the Spurs press in the first half but not helped out by more Onana indecision. He could have scored in the second half but it is harsh to criticise the second-youngest player to feature in a European final for Man Utd.",
      "The centre-back was player of the half for United in the first period - until the opener. Solid in defence, put his body on the line and caused issues in the other penalty box. But he then fell asleep towards the end of the half, letting too many balls bounce, including for Spurs' opener. He was rattled by Romero - no goalscoring heroics this time.",
      "Beaten easily by Johnson a couple of times early on so it was no real surprise to see him overcome by the same player for the goal. Not good enough with the ball either going forwards. A sharper Shaw may have fared better but United miss Lisandro Martinez in that position.",
      "Like Yoro, he cannot be blamed too much. Good in the air against Richarlison, including a good, well-timed header to deny the Brazilian early on at the back post. He won 12 duels overall and got forward well, setting up that glorious Bruno Fernandes chance. Harshly taken off but can understand the need to bring attack-minded Diogo Dalot on.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder had some flashpoints with some big tackles, which showed he could still deliver in a big game, but that is where his influence was limited to. You cannot help but think how he has gone from Champions League finals with Real Madrid to this.",
      "Anonymous throughout as the Man Utd captain struggled against Spurs' flat midfield three. His frustration was summed up by lashing out at Udogie to concede a free-kick and having a simple pass cut out by Johnson, which led to a Spurs counter attack. He then missed that big chance to level. It was just not a captain's performance.",
      "Not bad going forwards and got into good areas, but spent a lot of time tracking back to help Shaw out. The youngster did not communicate enough for Johnson's goal - he wil learn.",
      "United's bright spark. The young wide man caused Udogie a lot of problems and provided United's only two shots in the first half, plus the cross for Hojlund's decent chance just after the break. A light in a dismal Ruben Amorim era.",
      "From light to dark. Mount was given a chance and did not take it. Mount actually got in the way of his United team-mates a couple of times in the first half, while he lacked the final ball throughout. Rightly taken off as United's need for a goal became more urgent - and Alejandro Garnacho did more in four minutes than Mount did in 70. Matheus Cunha will take his slot next season, no doubt.",
      "The young forward's hold-up play was actually not bad. But United lacked a penalty box presence needed from a striker in a cup final. Needed to take that second-half chance from Amad's cross and unlucky to be denied by Van de Ven's stunning clearance. But Man Utd need better. Ten Premier League games without a shot, as well.",
      "Brought on for Hojlund and got as many yellow cards as he had shots. Just six touches of the ball in around 20 minutes. He's just not a striker, is he? But if Fernandes, Cunha and Amad are the No 10 options then where does it leave the Dutchman?",
      "Probably should have started given Mount's performance and kept out by Vicario well. But if he and Kobbie Mainoo are not trusted for a European final, where does it leave them in Ruben Amorim's plans, especially as they are both available to be sold for pure profit?"

      "A bullish Ange Postecoglou said he will \"never be a clown\" and insisted his work at Spurs is not done - even if they beat Manchester United in Wednesday's Europa League final.",
      "In an explosive press conference ahead of the game in Bilbao, the 59-year-old hit out at a newspaper headline which described him as \"teetering between hero and clown\" amid speculation over his future as the club's head coach.",
      "Spurs' poor Premier League campaign, which has seen them slump to 17th place on 38 points, having lost a club-record 21 games, has led to suggestions that he could leave even if he guides them to their first trophy in 17 years in the Europa League.",
      "But Postecoglou insisted his future is not a distraction and urged his team to seize their chance to make history by winning a trophy which would also earn Spurs a Champions League spot.",
      "\"I'll tell you one thing, irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and I never will be, mate,\" he told a reporter in reference to the article relating to his Spurs legacy.",
      "\"I'm really disappointed you'd use such terminology about a person who, for 26 years, without any favours from anyone, has worked his way to a position where he's leading out a club in a European major competition.",
      "\"For you to suggest that, somehow, us not being successful means that I'm a clown... I'm not really sure how to answer that question.\"",
      "Postecoglou has faced repeated questions relating to his future in recent months but insisted his sole focus is on ensuring his players are ready to take their opportunity to win silverware.",
      "\"Does it matter, really?\" he said when asked about his future. \"It doesn't matter because the reality of it is the opportunity is the same for me and, more importantly, for the club.",
      "Postecoglou said the injured Lucas Bergvall is not available to play against Manchester United despite having travelled with the squad to Bilbao. Pape Sarr is fit, however, despite having been taken off with back pain during Friday's 2-0 loss to Aston Villa.\n\n\nJames Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also missing due to injury but like Bergvall, have travelled with the squad to Bilbao to support their team-mates.",
      "\"I've said before, whatever happens beyond tomorrow is kind of irrelevant when you think about the opportunity that exists right now and that is to provide something special for this football club, for the supporters, for everyone who's worked so hard, not just this year, but for the last 15, 16 years since we last won a trophy and 41 years since a European trophy.",
      "\"If I were worried about my tenure at this football club, it's fair to say we wouldn't be in this position as I would've been distracted long ago. I'm pretty good at making sure all my focus is on giving this football club the best opportunity to do something special.",
      "\"Whatever happens after that, I'm very comfortable that I'll continue on trying to win trophies wherever I am.\"",
      "The Spurs boss insisted he has not spoken to his players about his future ahead of the final, adding: \"Again, that would not really be helpful in what is before us right now.",
      "\"I've said to the lads from day one, nothing is guaranteed in life, nothing is guaranteed in sport, so you've got to make sure you take every opportunity before you.",
      "\"That's what I've done my whole career. I've been in this position before where the big game was the last game I managed, so it's not unusual territory for me and I've always navigated that pretty well.",
      "\"For me, nothing is more important than my responsibility at this football club and to its fans tomorrow. Me and the players' minds are on one thing and that's trying to create something special.\"",
      "Pressed again on his future, Postecoglou insisted: \"I wouldn't be the first person who changes jobs. We all change jobs.",
      "\"My future's assured. I've got a beautiful family, I've got a great life, I'll keep on winning trophies until I finish, wherever that is, so don't worry about my future.",
      "\"My future is not entwined with anything. Provided, God willing, my health remains and my beautiful family and friends are beside me... there's nothing wrong with my future.",
      "\"Don't stress. Sleep easy at night. I'll be OK.",
      "\"I don't think my job is done here. I really feel like we're building something and what a trophy does is hopefully accelerate that.",
      "\"I still think there's a lot of work to be done, that's quite obvious with the challenges we've had this year, which are well chronicled. There's some reasoning in the context of that, but also there's been some growth that I'd like to see through.",
      "\"Whether that happens or not is not that important right now. I don't think this job's finished and I certainly feel like there's some growth there that we can take this club to where it needs to be.\"",
      "Spurs captain Heung-Min Son insisted he is ready to make history by winning his first trophy at the club after admitting he was affected by nerves in the 2019 Champions League final loss to Liverpool.",
      "\"It would be very special,\" he said. \"It would be a historic moment, I stayed here 10 years. I just want to win the trophy, which nobody has done in 10 years.",
      "\"Tomorrow is going to be a massive day for the club and for the boys, and for me as well. It has been such a tough season but we have always been together and that's why we are here.\"",
      "Son, who also revealed he had chatted to Bundesliga winner Harry Kane ahead of Wednesday's game, continued: \"Six years ago I played my first final. It was a very nervous moment.",
      "\"It was exciting but I was very nervous. I couldn't believe I was in the Champions League final.",
      "\"Six years later I'm a grown man, I'm experienced and just want to prepare in my way, calm.",
      "\"So many players have changed, also my role has changed. I'm captain of this club and leader of the boys and I want to help lift the trophy together.",
      "\"That is my dream. Tomorrow, I hope we can make a historic day that I can never forget.\"",
      "Son only recently returned from injury but insisted he feels physically prepared for the challenge ahead as Spurs aim to change their history of falling short.",
      "\"If we win the trophy, we can change the mentality and the history of the club. Then hopefully we can compete for other trophies.\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim reiterated his stance that winning the Europa League would not solve the club's issues but admitted it would help him build their future.",
      "Amorim's side sit only a point ahead of Postecoglou's in 16th place in the Premier League after a similarly difficult campaign but while the Spurs boss has preached optimism, Amorim has favoured brutal realism.",
      "\"We need to be excited and confident, but we already know the problems,\" he said.",
      "Manchester United have been given a boost with Diogo Dalot, Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro all available to feature having recovered from injury.\n\n\n\"They recovered quite well,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we respect the feelings of the players, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to part of the team and that is a very good sign.\n\n\n\"They are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of things we need to change in our club; the way we do everything in the week at Carrington, the recruitment, the academy. I think we need to improve.",
      "\"It's hard to point at one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.",
      "\"We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow will be important for us, for our fans. That feeling of winning can help us have strength to do every job we have to do.",
      "\"But nothing is going to change our season. We have a lot to do at our club, not just winning tomorrow. But winning a European title can help us to have that feeling that can help us to build the future.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire insisted Manchester United have shown their quality in the Europa League, despite their domestic struggles.",
      "\"When you play for this club, you want to win every football match and this season we've been far too inconsistent, we haven't won enough in the Premier League. It's not been good enough, we know that.",
      "\"The Europa League has been different. We've performed at a high level and we have proven again this season we can beat anybody.",
      "\"I'm sure, next season, we will improve an awful amount, with a full pre-season and, as players, we're all looking forward to that, but we've got a big game tomorrow night, first and foremost.",
      "\"It's a special night, a special occasion. We've prepared well and it's one we're looking forward to.\"",
      "Maguire has earned plaudits for some of his attacking contributions during United's run to the final, including scoring the winner in their comeback win over Lyon in the quarters, but hopes he won't be needed up front on Wednesday night.",
      "\"The manager has me dribbling every day in training, running up and down the wing,\" he joked.",
      "\"I found myself on the wing against Bilbao, managed to put a good cross in and Casemiro scored the goal.",
      "\"I've gone up front in the later minutes of games; hopefully tomorrow night I'm not going up front.",
      "\"I don't want to go up front chasing a game, I want to be defending a lead from my position in defence.",
      "\"I'm always there to help, always there to do my best, but I'm more than happy playing in my favoured position.\""

      "\"Every game has its history…\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said these words when asked about the prospect of playing Tottenham in the Europa League final - a team that has beaten the Red Devils three times already this season.",
      "But the question is, will their recent history matter when it comes to who wins the trophy - and that crucial Champions League place?",
      "Perhaps the performance Spurs will take the most encouragement from is their first of the season against United, an utterly dominant 3-0 win at Old Trafford in September to put even more pressure on United's former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The game is evidence of why Ange Postecoglou is wrapping Micky van de Ven in cotton wool ahead of the final.",
      "Van de Ven was not just defensively impressive in this game, as he typically is, he also carried the ball over half the length of the Old Trafford pitch to set up Brennan Johnson for their opening goal in the third minute.",
      "The game then was seemingly over at the end of the first half when Bruno Fernandes was sent off - a red card that was later overturned through appeal.",
      "But this is a different United side. Although you cannot suggest their position in the Premier League of 16th is evidence they have moved forward under Ruben Amorim, they do look better defensively, they concede fewer chances, and have shown in these big European nights that they can be a threat going forward, more so anyway, then under Ten Hag.",
      "The second time these two sides met was in the Carabao Cup quarter finals in December - a fun encounter that Postecoglou's Spurs won once again, this time 4-3, with Amorim having taken over from Ten Hag.",
      "But when you look at lessons both sides could take to the final, it is challenging when you consider the context around it.",
      "First of all you look at the make-up of both sides. Spurs had Archie Gray and Radu Dragusin making up their centre-back partnership, with Fraser Forster in goal. Spurs' main three at the back of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario and defenders Van de Ven and Cristian Romero were all injured.",
      "For United, again, a side that will be much changed for the final with Altay Bayindir starting in goal, Lisandro Martinez, who is out for the remainder of the season, as well as Antony, who is now starring for Real Betis in Spain, also featured.",
      "On this occasion, although Spurs were injury-hit and did well to progress, Amorim also took a calculated risk to heavily rotate many of his first-team players. It did not work out as they lost their next three games in the Premier League as well.",
      "February was the last time these two sides met and Spurs won 1-0 but I don't think Amorim will look back at this game too closely.",
      "That's partly because the goal United conceded was a poor one. Andre Onana should have done much better to palm away a Lucas Bergvall shot, which ended up leaving James Maddison with a comfortable finish right in front of goal.",
      "Amorim had very limited opportunities to change the game when you look at the squad he had to pick from at that moment. It was an injury-ravaged United side. Victor Lindelof was the only substitute who had any sort of Premier League experience.",
      "Spurs had injuries too, with Kevin Danso and Ben Davies their centre-back pairing, two players who again are not likely to start in the final, while Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski also started but will play no part on Wednesday due to injury.",
      "Not much, really!",
      "Spurs will take confidence despite the circumstances. When they have taken on Untied this season, they have been able to pull out performances and perhaps more importantly, results.",
      "Dominic Solanke has three goals in three meetings against United too, which may give him that extra edge against their opponents in the final.",
      "Asked about facing a side who have beaten United three times, Amorim said: \"If you look at the odds, we are closer to winning than losing. Both teams will play like all or nothing.\"",
      "Those last three words perfectly describe Manchester United in Europe this season: all or nothing.",
      "United looked like they'd be out of the competition when they were 4-2 down at Old Trafford against Lyon in the quarter-finals but they miraculously came back.",
      "In the semi-finals, as I travelled to Bilbao for their tie against Athletic Club, most pundits and fans alike would have thought a draw away to a team who had lost just once in LaLiga since August at home would have been sufficient",
      "Man Utd won 3-0 in San Mames and 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "We also have to consider the tactical tweaks Amorim has made since the two sides last met in February.",
      "In the most important games, he has now settled on a midfield duo of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Brazilian especially has become revitalised under Amorim in recent months.",
      "Amorim told me this has been mainly down to Casemiro working on his own fitness as well as the United boss tweaking the way they press, more so with their wing-backs going high, enabling Casemiro to stay in front of the defence and not be caught out on transition.",
      "Amorim and the players have spoken about how the physicality levels of European opponents are more suited to the players, which does pose the question of how they will deal with a physical Spurs side who will look to impose themselves as they have done in this season's previous meetings.",
      "But United have been illogical and unpredictable when it comes to the Europa League this season. When you consider all of the circumstances of their previous meetings with Spurs, it is clear that they won't have much relevance.",
      "Wednesday's game is a different proposition for both sides."

      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Man Utd are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let (Marcus) Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with (Alejandro) Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's (Joshua) Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."
