      "Ruben Amorim has been told he's put his Manchester United players in an uncomfortable position with his comments after their derby defeat at Manchester City. The Portuguese coach indicated he has no plans to change his approach despite underwhelming results, saying the higher-ups will need to find a new manager if they want that kind of hard reset.",
      "A 3-0 reverse at the Etihad Stadium left United with four points from four games and just one point clear of the relegation places. Across Amorim's entire reign, the total is 31 from 31 games, the lowest points-per-game return of any United boss in the Premier League era.",
      "\"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man,\" Amorim said after the City game. \"We will talk about that every game that we lose. I don't believe in that, in the system, or whatever.",
      "\"I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change. My message is that I am going to give everything. I will do everything, always thinking about what is best for the club.",
      "\"That was always the same message. It is not my decision, the rest (on whether United change manager). Until I am here, I will do my best. I really want to win games. I am suffering more than them.\"",
      "The pressure is mounting on Amorim as United prepare for a trio of games against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland before the international break. Whether or not the results in those games will bring about Amorim's dismissal, former Liverpool and Sunderland star Fabio Borini made his feelings clear about the language being used by the boss.",
      "\"It's harsh on even the players, at times, because the players maybe don't feel comfortable,\" Borini said on the No Tippy Tappy Football podcast. \"Even the way he said, 'I'm really happy today because of the effort of every player,' that's standard, that's the bare minimum, you shouldn't be happy for that.\"",
      "Co-host Sam Allardyce then raised the subject of Amorim's conversations with his squad as well as his public words, asking: \"Is that because he wants out?\" Borini then replied: \"Do you think he can ask the players [their thoughts] or not?",
      "\"Culturally, I've seen that happen in Italy, the manager - when he's in a difficult position - he has his staff, he wants to also hear the dressing room's thoughts, which sometimes can be productive or counterproductive because [it depends] how well you take the dressing room opinion.",
      "\"Because sometimes you ask for an opinion and then it kind of backfires on you, and you say, 'Oh, I didn't like what they actually think.' Sometimes that's also the case [as a player], are you saying the things that you want the manager to hear or are you saying the things you're actually thinking.",
      "\"Because there's two different ways and I think both [happen] in my experience. The priority needs to be Manchester United... When [the captain] goes and knocks on the door, the priority is only Manchester United and not players or manager. It's difficult.\"",
      "Reference has also been made to the lack of European football this season giving Amorim nowhere to hide. Last season, a run to the Europa League final excused some domestic sins, but this time around it's all about what happens in the league - starting on Saturday against Chelsea.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester City defender Joleon Lescott claims Manchester United didn't need to sign Matheus Cunha. But Bryan Mbeumo will be pivotal for Ruben Amorim and will enjoy a better season.",
      "With just one win this campaign and a 3-0 embarrassment in the Manchester derby behind him, Red Devils head coach Amorim has seen enormous amounts of pressure begin to mount. The Portuguese manager was backed over the summer and was given a new striker in £74million man Benjamin Sesko, as well as two of the Premier League's most revered forwards in Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "The Cameroon international starred for Brentford and set United back an initial £65m, whilst Cunha cost £62.5m from Wolves. The Brazilian is currently nursing a hamstring injury, but Lescott thinks he's a player United could have done without.",
      "Mbeumo, on the other hand, is a star the ex-City centre-half believes could be a difference-maker this season and must play weekly. He also tipped the 26-year-old to have a better and more influential season than team-mate Cunha.",
      "\"I reckon Mbeumo has a more impactful season than Cunha,\" said Lescott, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet. \"They don't need [a player like Cunha].",
      "\"They're trying to build, or probably rebuild now, by buying second-tier or third-tier players and creating the foundations that get you there.",
      "ALL OUT FOOTBALL ON YOUTUBE: Subscribe now to be the first to watch the latest episodes of In The Mixer and other original shows, brought to you by Sky Bet. Follow All Out Football on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and X .",
      "\"Mbeumo is more of a foundational piece to their puzzle than Cunha. They're now a mid-table team, not a mid-table club, and Mbeumo needs to play.\"",
      "Speaking about Mbeumo's hefty total £71m fee, he added: \"This might be a way to explain what I believe, how you value players. Their value shouldn't be value to both parties. It only has to be that value to one entity, whether it's United or whether it is Brentford.",
      "\"I'll use, say, Jack Grealish as an example, or even Harry Maguire. When Jack Grealish was leaving Aston Villa, he was worth more than £100m to Aston Villa. Because if he's not there, they go down.",
      "\"He may not be worth £100m to Man City, or whatever, and Mbeumo may not be worth £64m to Brentford, but he's worth that to Man United. To them, he needs to play and they do well, and so for me, that's the value.\"",
      "Mbeumo has started all of United's first four league games this season, scoring just one goal. His penalty miss saw them exit the Carabao Cup. Cunha has also played a starring role and missed a spot kick in the Grimsby Town defeat, but was substituted during their 3-2 win over Burnley with a hamstring issue.",
      "Whether he will be fit for their next fixture against Chelsea is unknown, but Amorim suggested he won't be on the sidelines for much longer and could return for Saturday evening.",
      "Speaking after the loss to City, he said: \"If you talk with Cunha, if you catch Cunha outside, he will say he can play this game [vs City]! So I don't know. We will manage day by day, but they are pushing hard, and that is a good thing.\"",

      "As Barcelona prepare to take on Newcastle without Lamine Yamal, whose minutes are being managed among fitness concerns, it could be time for Marcus Rashford to step up. Thursday night's game will be Rashford's first taste of non-knockout Champions League football since a red card with Manchester United in 2023, and it was one of his current Barcelona team-mates who stole the show that night.",
      "Rashford showed he still has plenty to offer at this level of football when he impressed on loan at Aston Villa in last season's knockout rounds. He set up a goal in the round of 16 victory over Club Brugge and repeated the trick against PSG as Villa came close to a memorable comeback against the eventual champions.",
      "Back in the autumn of 2023, Rashford's dismissal against FC Copenhagen turned what looked like being a comfortable away win into a dramatic defeat. United led 2-0 through a Rasmus Hojlund brace when the England international landed on the ankle of Elias Jelert, with referee Donatas Rumsas showing him a straight red after a VAR check, and it was 2-2 before half-time.",
      "United retook the lead from the penalty spot midway through the second half, but they couldn't hold on. Lukas Lerager snuck in at the back post to make it 3-3, and Roony Bardghji - a week shy of his 18th birthday - completed the turnaround with his first ever Champions League goal.",
      "Fast forward two years, and Rashford and Bardghji could find themselves sharing a pitch for Barcelona as they look to get their European campaign off to a winning start. And he has had to do things the hard way.",
      "Bardghji, a Sweden Under-21 international, had been in high demand across Europe even before that match against United. The English club were one of a number in the Premier League keeping an eye on him, but a big move was put on hold in May 2024 when he suffered an ACL injury in training.",
      "\"We all feel for Roony, and everyone in and around the club will do everything we can to help him get back on the pitch again,\" Copenhagen's sporting director Peter Christiansen said at the time. \"Right now he needs to take it easy to process what has happened, but we all know him as a dedicated and deeply serious footballer who we know will come back even stronger.\"",
      "It wasn't until March this year that he stepped back onto the pitch. After sitting out the entirety of the regular season in Denmark, he came off the bench during the Superliga's Championship round as Copenhagen looked to chase down Midtjylland and lift the title.",
      "They did just that, triumphing by a single point, and completed a league and couple double at the end of May. Bardghji got minutes in the cup semis against Viborg but that would end up being his final game for the club, with injury keeping him out of the final before Barcelona clinched a cut-price summer transfer to ensure he joined them a few months before his contract in Copenhagen was set to expire.",
      "In his first interview as a Barcelona player, the winger - now 19 - said he has always been a Barca fan and always had the goal of joining the Catalan club. “I feel at home. I’ve fitted in really well with my teammates and I’m very comfortable,” he told club media.",
      "Bardghji made his senior debut for Barcelona over the weekend, starting in place of Raphinha as Hansi Flick's side romped to a 6-0 win over Valencia. The reigning champions' financial situation meant they had to wait to register him, but approval arrived during the international break and he's now ready to get up and running.",
      "With Yamal missing from the travelling squad, a first European opportunity could arrive sooner than anticipated. He's joined Rashford for the trip to Newcastle, but perhaps he's not yet ready to bring up their last meeting in the competition.",

      "Manchester United's nightmare is showing no signs of coming to an end. The club invested over £200million in new signings in the summer, but that has not paid any dividends as of yet.",
      "Following a shock second-round Carabao Cup exit to League Two side Grimsby Town, United were brushed aside in a 3-0 defeat in last weekend's Manchester Derby. Fans and critics had essentially written off last season, where manager Ruben Amorim led the club to their worst ever Premier League finish down in 15th place, and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur",
      "But Amorim's fortunes have not improved despite his exciting new additions. He now has the lowest win percentage of any permanent United manager since World War II, having suffered an 18th defeat in 47 games in charge on Sunday.",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has put OGC Nice up for sale, according to French outlet Ici. Ratcliffe and INEOS bought Nice for a sum of £89m (€100m) in 2019, with fans of the club initially hopeful that their financial muscle would help them become genuine contenders in a domestic league that has been dominated by Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "But that has not been the case, with Nice failing to finish above fourth under INEOS’ stewardship. Speculation grew over Ratcliffe looking to sell the club in March this year, when the billionaire admitted to The Times that he didn’t particularly enjoy watching Nice because the quality of football wasn’t “high enough” for him to get excited.",
      "He also noted that Nice's best campaign was last season, when INEOS were forced to adopt a less hands-on model due to multi-club ownership rules, admitting: “They’ve been so much better without our interference!”",
      "It’s now been claimed that Ratcliffe has put Nice up for sale, having been deemed to have forsaken the club since becoming United’s minority owner and heading its football strategy. The aforementioned report states Sir Jim is demanding £173m to part ways with the French side.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have been approached for comment by Mirror Sport.",
      "Manchester United may hold off on sacking head coach Amorim, even if they decide he is not the right man to lead the side until the end of the season. The Portuguese signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with the Red Devils less than a year ago on a salary of £6.5m-per-season.",
      "His contract also includes a 12-month extension, having been rushed into the role after United paid Sporting £9.2m to buy him out of his contract. And, according to the Daily Mail, the club would have to directly pay him £12m in compensation if they sack the 40-year-old before he reaches one year in the job.",
      "His coaching staff would also be in line for a pay-off. That means Ratcliffe and INEOS may look to hold off on dismissing him before November 1, after which his payout will decrease, potentially giving them a huge saving.",
      "Amorim’s next three games in charge against Chelsea, Brentford and Sunderland could essentially be the last chance to save his job. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe will be glad to save money, with the club having forked out an astonishing sum of over £54m in compensation on the five different managers they have sacked since Sir Alex Ferguson’s departure.",
      "Elsewhere, Newcastle are reportedly keeping tabs on Kobbie Mainoo’s situation and could make a move for the midfielder in the January transfer window. According to talkSPORT, Eddie Howe is known to be an admirer of the player.",
      "Mainoo, 20, wanted to leave United in the lead up to transfer deadline day after losing his place in the starting line-up under Amorim. But the Red Devils blocked their academy graduate from sealing a potential £50m move to Napoli, where Scott McTominay has thrived since leaving the Red Devils.",
      "The youngster was once again left on the bench ahead of Sunday’s 3-0 defeat in the Manchester Derby. That will have only added to his frustrations after playing just 73 minutes in the Premier League this season, despite being one of the first names on the team sheet under previous manager Erik ten Hag.",

      "However, his hefty price tag - thought to be around £100 million - led United to put their interest on hold for now. While they might reconsider a move for the 21-year-old next year, other names like Adam Wharton, Morten Hjulmand, and Elliot Anderson have also been mentioned.",
      "According to the Daily Briefing, Neves is keen on a return to European football after two seasons at Al-Hilal. He previously had a successful stint in the Premier League with Wolves, playing a crucial part in their promotion to the top tier in the 2017/18 season.",
      "The report suggests that Newcastle United and Tottenham are likely to compete for the player's signature, with Ruben Amorim reportedly showing particular interest in signing him.",
      "Despite the speculation, Neves seems focused on his current role in the Middle East, having recently reached 100 games for Al-Hilal.",
      "He acknowledged the club's tribute on Instagram with a simple blue 'love heart' emoji.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese channel Sport TV back in August, Neves expressed his desire to return to his childhood club, FC Porto.",
      "\"I've said it in all the interviews - it's not coming back to finish your career, it's going back to play and be competitive: that's my big goal,\" he declared.",
      "\"Fortunately, I'm 28 years old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club, it's something I want to give them and experience [for myself].",

      "Tom Victor has been part of the Reach Sport team since 2021, writing across national and regional titles. He is based in London and reports on a range of sports, specialising in men's and women's football and tennis",
      "It took just one match away from Manchester United for Andre Onana to earn plaudits, and he's far from the first to thrive as soon as he moved away from Old Trafford. The Cameroonian goalkeeper ended up on the losing side on his Trabzonspor debut, but still earned plaudits after keeping his new side within touching distance of Fenerbahce while a man down.",
      "Former West Brom midfielder Okay Yokuslu was sent off in the 20th minute of the game, but only a solitary Youssef En-Nesyri goal - for which Onana was arguably at fault - separated the two sides. Onana, who only joined on loan from United in the week of the match, earned praise in the Turkish media for \"single-handedly\" keeping his team in the game.",
      "When explaining the decision to let Onana leave, United head coach Ruben Amorim hinted at the \"big brother\" qualities the Turkish press would end up pointing to after his Super Lig debut.\" He was really good on working, trying to help the players, but sometimes you can have all the quality in the world but you need to change the environment to return to your level, and I think that was the feeling not just for us but Andre as well,\" the Portuguese said.",
      "Onana is far from the only United player to thrive upon securing a move away. The most dramatic success story is surely that of Scott McTominay, whose performances for Serie A title winners Napoli have propelled him into Ballon d'Or contention.",
      "McTominay found minutes hard to come by in his final season in Manchester, even as he enjoyed some difference-making cameos - not least in a comeback victory over Brentford under Erik ten Hag. He has moved into a wholly different environment in Naples, though, as evidenced by the comments he made after that title win.",
      "\"The sacrifice that every single player in the group has put forward to the cause,\" McTominay said after Antonio Conte's side clinched top spot \"I'm lost for words. It's incredible.",
      "\"The people deserve it because they've been behind us from day one, and for me to come and experience this is a dream,\" he added. While Napoli were able to dig deep and make big sacrifices to earn the biggest prize in Italian football, the same hasn't been forthcoming at Old Trafford.",
      "McTominay might be an extreme example, but he's not the only one. Marcus Rashford felt he had nowhere to go at his boyhood club but thrived at Aston Villa, while even Jadon Sancho - without a minute of football in months after his relationship with former boss Ten Hag proved unsalvageable - played his part in runs to two European finals with Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea.",
      "Much has been made, too, of the fact that few players have seen their stock rise since joining United. It's not as if they have been bringing in misfits from elsewhere, either - these are footballers who have performed to high levels in different environments, only to struggle to replicate it in their new surroundings.",
      "Onana, like McTominay before him, might well be the latest reminder that no player can reach their full potential until the wider environment changes. And making that change, clearly, is no easy task.",

      "Louis Saha reckons the chatter surrounding Marcus Rashford's rocky beginning at Barcelona is 'extremely damaging' after his Manchester United departure.",
      "The 27-year-old, who departed Old Trafford on loan in the summer, is eager to revive his career after a brief stint at Aston Villa last season. In Spain, he suffered a sluggish beginning, managing no goals or assists in his opening three La Liga outings, fuelling whispers of a potential January return to Manchester.",
      "Chatting to Flashscore, who provide the latest bookmaker offers, Saha warned it could prove harmful for the player, who is desperate to silence his doubters. \"It would be extremely damaging for Marcus Rashford if Barcelona ended his loan,\" he said.",
      "\"Even the talks, the rumours are really bad already. The thing is that we know that he's back in the England squad, he has appreciation from people who know football and understand that there is a big World Cup coming soon. So I wish him the best. That's for sure that he needs to play, maybe better to shut down all these rumours coming from Barcelona.",
      "\"There is a moment where I see the rush for maybe sometimes from the frustrated side. There is a moment that he has to take control back of his career. Yes, you could find some excuses because things happened in Manchester and so on. But at some point you have to look at the mirror and there will be something that you are not doing and that's it.\"",
      "\"Whether you're chuffed or at ease discussing it, it's all well and good, but it's on the pitch where you need to really cement everything and ensure there's no room for doubt. There's a talented lad playing there, I don't reckon he's being questioned. There's something Rashford needs to do.\"",
      "Rashford chalked up an assist in Barcelona's 6-0 thrashing of Valencia last weekend, with Saha adding: \"It's a fresh start. It's a new environment. It's a different league, a new language. So there are loads of things you have to adapt to and people need to understand that.",
      "\"Perhaps the journos are spreading these sorts of rumours, we have to wait and see what the gaffer thinks about him. And that's that.",
      "\"But he has to be resilient, those types of challenges will come. People want him to hit rock bottom. This is when they can critique. But I'm certain that Rashford is going to net goals, he's going to assist and hopefully he'll make the England squad and perform there as well.\"",
      "The Spanish heavyweights have the option to make Rashford's move permanent next summer.",

      "Manchester United's chances of signing Carlos Baleba have been lifted by their recent financial results. The Red Devils recently revealed the results of their fourth quarter trading period for the year ended June 30, 2025, showing their financial power.",
      "Despite a challenging time on the pitch for Ruben Amorim's team, who suffered a resounding 3-0 defeat to Manchester City in the derby on Sunday, the club continues to perform well commercially. After raking in £164million in revenues for the fourth quarter, their annual income reached a record-breaking £666.5m.",
      "The club also confirmed that these figures put them in a strong position regarding the Premier League's Profitability and Sustainability Rules (PSR). This will significantly boost their hopes of making a renewed bid for Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "They could revisit their interest in the 21-year-old in 2026, as the club's midfield has been a noticeable weak spot. United have also been linked with a move for Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton as an alternative.",
      "Thanks to their robust financial performance, United will have some extra funds, which could be used to potentially move players like Baleba. Speaking on the Reds' financial results, CEO Omar Berrada stated: \"As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas.",
      "\"On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men's and women's first team squads over the summer, as we build for the long-term. Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.",
      "\"We are also investing to upgrade our infrastructure, including completion of the £50m redevelopment of our men's first team building at Carrington, on time and on budget, following prior investment in our women's team facilities, to create a world-class environment for our players and staff.",
      "\"Meanwhile, planning continues to meet our ambition of developing a new stadium at Old Trafford as part of a transformational regeneration of the surrounding community. To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United.",
      "\"Our commercial business remains strong as we continue to deliver appealing products and experiences for our fans, and best-in-class value to our partners. As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.\"",
      "The Red Devils have been grappling with midfield issues throughout Amorim's tenure, with Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte being his preferred choices. Meanwhile, United academy starlet Kobbie Mainoo has been vying for a spot in the team against the club captain.",

      "Manchester United may be kicking themselves for not appealing after Grimsby were penalised for fielding an ineligible player in their legendary Carabao Cup second round triumph over the Red Devils. The Mariners were slapped with a £20,000 fine for playing Clarke Oduor in the memorable victory.",
      "Despite having grounds to file a complaint, United chose not to, allowing Grimsby to progress to the fourth round of the League Cup after defeating Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 on Tuesday evening.",
      "United manager Ruben Amorim is feeling the heat following the team's League Cup exit and the crushing 3-0 defeat in the Manchester Derby on Sunday. If United had appealed and been successful, they could have been facing off against Wednesday on Tuesday evening instead of Grimsby, who could have been booted out of the tournament.",
      "A tie against a team currently struggling in 23rd place in the Championship could have been just what the doctor ordered for Amorim. A game against Wednesday would have been seen as winnable and could have potentially put United in the fourth round, with dreams of Wembley glory providing a much-needed boost for the beleaguered boss.",
      "United are currently languishing in 14th place in the Premier League, one spot up from their final position last season, and have secured one victory in four matches this campaign. Amorim had been hopeful of leaving last year's disappointments behind, particularly following United's Europa League final loss to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "However, despite an influx of new talent, United's midfield seems sluggish and their strikers are lacking service. Their defence appears increasingly vulnerable each week, as players struggle to adapt to Amorim's preferred 3-4-3 formation, a strategy that has yet to prove successful at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite these issues, the club reportedly still believes in Amorim's capabilities, although concerns are mounting. Reports state that some first-team squad members are beginning to question their manager, suggesting that the former Sporting CP boss is too rigid in his philosophy rather than focusing on improving results.",
      "United's decision not to contest Grimsby's continuation in the cup, while commendable, could serve as a pivotal moment for the club, given the favourable draw in the third round.",
      "Grimsby introduced Oduor against United in the second half of their cup tie, with the player having joined on loan just the day before from Bradford City. The club later discovered that the player had been registered one minute and 59 seconds after the 12:00 deadline.",
      "After United staged a comeback from 2-0 down, the match went to penalties. Oduor's penalty was saved by Andre Onana, resulting in Grimsby winning the lengthy shootout 12-11.",
      "However, Grimsby subsequently reported their own breach of rules. They stated that the \"club's non-compliance was not deliberate with no intention to deceive or mislead\".",
      "The League Two team was slapped with a £10,000 fine, with an additional £10,000 suspended until the end of the current season. The EFL stated that the decision to fine David Artell's squad was made after a \"comprehensive review of all the evidence and considering prior decisions taken in respect of offences in the League Cup\".",

      "Ruben Amorim has not even reached a year as Manchester United manager and he is already under huge pressure for his job.",
      "United’s 3-0 defeat by Manchester City on Sunday has seen a fresh wave of doubt over his future in the role. The loss not only surrendered local bragging rights, it meant United’s worst start to a season since 1992/93 and left Amorim’s record at eight wins from 31 Premier League matches since he arrived last November.",
      "Wayne Rooney has been among the high-profile names to openly question Amorim’s position, with the team having taken four points from four games in the league and been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby.",
      "Should those games not go to plan then United could consider sacking the Portuguese boss in the October international break. Here we take a look at the bookies’ favourites for the job and assess their suitability.",
      "The Crystal Palace manager has burnished his reputation recently by turning his side into a supremely organised and efficient machine. He led Palace to the FA Cup in May – an historic achievement which should have led them into the Europa League – and his leadership has been crucial to the side punching above their weight.",
      "The Austrian has worked with a tight-knit squad, getting the best out of them with little rotation. One thing that won’t have escaped the United hierarchy is that he plays a very similar tactical system to the one Amorim has been trying to implement. Should they pull the trigger on Amorim, that could ensure a smooth transition, with Glasner - who threatened to resign at Palace over the proposed sale of Marc Guehi to Liverpool - likely to continue with the 3-4-2-1 formation.",
      "However, looking at it in a different way, that could be an issue. One of the biggest concerns about Amorim is how wedded he is to the three-man defence, which means fielding captain Bruno Fernandes in a two-man midfield. Hiring a new boss who subscribes to the same philosophy may not make sense.",
      "The former Manchester United midfielder is available after losing his job at Middlesbrough in June. The 44-year-old was at Boro for two and a half years, but left after they failed to reach the Championship play-offs last season.",
      "Carrick was previously an interim boss at United in between Jose Mourinho's departure and the arrival of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and served as caretaker after the Norwegian was sacked. Having spent 12 years with the club as a player and most of his years post-retirement at United as a coach, he wouldn’t take long to settle at Carrington and Old Trafford. He would be a popular choice among fans.",
      "However, there is no doubt that United represents a significant step up the ladder from Boro and the Championship, with the pressure involved and the need to manage egos a potential question mark for him.",
      "Southgate has been without a job since stepping down as England manager last summer. He is no stranger to being linked with the United job, having been on INEOS’ radar before. Sir Jim Ratcliffe is a fan of Southgate’s and he was considered before Amorim took over from Erik ten Hag last year.",
      "The 55-year-old won plaudits for his work with England, where he built strong relationships with the players and became a good communicator. Having spent eight years in the Three Lions hot seat, he would command the respect of the United squad.",
      "However, there are bound to be question marks over his long absence from club football, which is a completely different job to that of an international boss. Southgate has only previously managed Middlesbrough – and that ended in 2009. Since then, he has only worked for the FA, first as England under-21s boss and then with the senior squad.",
      "Silva has a wealth of Premier League experience, having led Fulham since 2021 after stints at Everton, Watford and Hull. That longevity puts him third in the Premier League, behind only Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta and shows how much his work is valued in west London.",
      "The Portuguese is a pragmatist who bases his sides around structure and organisation and is not afraid to adapt his game plan to suit the opponents. While he may be able to conjure improved results in the short-term at United, there may be doubts over long-term progression.",
      "Silva has worked at mid-table Premier League sides for a significant period now and, although there is an argument which says that is exactly what United have become, INEOS may be wary of an uninspiring appointment.",
      "A left-field proposition, albeit one who has previously been linked with the United job and has admirers inside the club. Pochettino is now the head coach of the United States, who are preparing to host the World Cup next year, so is unlikely to jump ship back to club football in the Premier League.",
      "Pochettino’s reputation has taken a dent since his success at Tottenham, with spells at Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea not working out. He has been under pressure with the USMNT recently and stepping into the glare of Old Trafford may not seem like a good idea for the Argentine.",
      "At his peak, Pochettino’s Southampton and Spurs sides were renowned for their high-intensity pressing and front-footed football. While that idea may appeal to United right now, it hasn’t been in evidence from a Pochettino team for some time.",

      "Despite the Old Trafford hierarchy's public backing of his capabilities, Mail Online reports that first-team squad members are beginning to doubt his tactical approach. It's believed United would face a £12million compensation bill should they choose to dismiss Amorim, though supporters might consider this a modest investment in the club's future success.",
      "Former United coach Meulensteen has shared his perspective on the club's next move if they part ways with Amorim, identifying his preferred candidate for the role. Ex-Red Devils midfielder Carrick is being touted for the top position, with the Dutchman convinced the former Middlesbrough boss would thrive at his old club.",
      "Speaking to football betting site BetVictor, Meulensteen said: \"Michael Carrick might be the obvious option if Ruben Amorim is to go. Obviously Michael Carrick still knows quite a few players that were there when he was there.",
      "\"So he's still got some good inside information. He obviously knows the club. He knows what's expected from the club.\"",
      "The 61-year-old also referenced former United boss Jose Mourinho, who looks to return to Benfica, but remained steadfast in backing Carrick, insisting \"common sense\" is what's required to handle the troubled giants.",
      "He said: \"Well, you always get that and there's always names being thrown around. Jose Mourinho's out of the job as well. So that will be thrown around and there's all other managers as well.",
      "\"But the key is that you need to have a guy that obviously has got a clear idea but puts some kind of a structure in place that the players buy into and that you get a spark from the players. Because they're not bad players, there's plenty of good players there.",
      "\"I'm sure that if they would play in a system that suits them, they really play at the best. I think you could see a fantastic Manchester United. Maybe Michael could well be the guy.",
      "\"It's not magic. It's common sense more than anything, that's it and Carrick has got plenty of that.\"",
      "Carrick has previously stepped up as interim boss twice - following Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's departures - and remains unbeaten in temporary charge.",
      "Across three matches in the hotseat, the former midfielder secured two victories and one draw. He departed United to take over at Boro, where he spent three years managing the Championship outfit.",
      "From 136 matches in charge, Carrick claimed 63 wins, 24 draws and 49 defeats. In contrast, Amorim has had a tougher time with United, albeit under very different circumstances, with more losses than wins under his belt - 18 defeats compared to 17 victories, along with 12 draws.",

Sancho has had a tough spell at Old Trafford after his move from Borussia Dortmund in 2021, struggling to replicate his Bundesliga success in the Premier League.",
      "Last season saw him loaned out to Chelsea, where he managed five goals and 10 assists in all competitions. Despite Chelsea's obligation to purchase Sancho for £25million due to their fourth-place finish, they chose to pay a £5m fee to return him to Manchester instead.",
      "With Sancho not fitting into Ruben Amorim's vision for 2025/26, he currently finds himself on loan once more, this time at Villa Park. In his first full outing for Villa, Sancho featured in a 1-1 draw against Brentford in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday night, with Villa exiting the competition after a nail-biting penalty shootout.",
      "Despite the disappointing result, Sancho took to Instagram to share his enthusiasm for his new beginning, posting photos from the match with the caption: \"Happy to make my debut for @avfcofficial, not the result we wanted but something to build on.\"",
      "Young talents Ethan Wheatley, on loan at Northampton Town, and Joe Hugill, currently playing for Barnet, also showed their support, while former teammates Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Jesse Lingard and Tosin Adarabioyo were among those who also liked the post.",
      "Aston Villa defender Ian Maatsen even left a couple of love heart emojis in the comments section. Sancho's loan move comes as he enters the final year of his contract with United, although the club can extend his deal by a year to avoid losing him on a free transfer next summer.",

Now, the 21-year-old is adjusting to life at Stamford Bridge, having made his debut in a 2-2 draw against Brentford over the weekend.",

Another player to leave United this summer was Antony, who secured a permanent move to Real Betis after a successful loan stint with the Spanish outfit last season.",

      "Senne Lammens' brother harboured \"doubts\" about his deadline day switch from Royal Antwerp to Manchester United. The Belgian keeper sealed his move to United in an £18.2million transfer just hours before the summer window closed, having caught the eye in the Belgian Pro League.",
      "Whilst Ruben Amorim had initially maintained he was content to persist with Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana for the campaign, it seems underwhelming displays from the pair prompted him to reconsider his stance.",
      "And whilst countless United supporters will have been delighted to witness a fresh goalkeeper move to Old Trafford, Lammens' elder sibling, Tom, wasn't wholly persuaded that United represented the ideal destination.",
      "The 25-year-old, who turns out for Borsbeek in Belgium's lower tiers, told Nieuwsblad: \"There's a lot of quality, you play for trophies there, and Senne could probably immediately make his mark in the Champions League.",
      "\"I was initially sceptical about a move to United, because many players there had already succumbed to the pressure and couldn't reach their full potential. But ultimately, it was Senne who had to make the decision.",
      "\"United gave him the best feeling. Partly because Tony Coton, United's goalkeeping scout, had been following him for almost a year and was very convinced of his qualities. It would also be great if the club could return to its former glory and if Senne could contribute to that.\"",
      "Bayindir, United's current No. 1, has been struggling to meet expectations this season. The goalkeeper, who was favoured over Onana after appearing regularly in United's pre-season tour while the Cameroonian was sidelined, is yet to keep a clean sheet in the club's first four Premier League matches, conceding seven times.",
      "His performance was particularly criticised during United's season opener against Arsenal last month, where he fumbled a corner, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to sneak in and score the winning goal.",
      "Meanwhile, Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan two years ago for £47.5m, is currently on loan at Trabzonspor in the Turkish Super Lig. The Cameroonian has also had his share of high-profile blunders since joining United.",
      "He was in goal for United's Carabao Cup match against Grimsby Town last month, where he conceded two goals before his side were knocked by the League Two team on penalties. His debut for Trabzonspor didn't go as planned either, with him being partly responsible for a 1-0 loss to Fenerbahce.",
      "As United gear up for another Premier League clash on Saturday, Lammens could make his first appearance for his new team.",
      "However, with United set to face an undefeated Chelsea at Old Trafford, the newcomer might have his work cut out unless Amorim can shore up his defence.",

      "Andre Onana has shown his true colours after leaving Manchester United on loan, despite his Trabzonspor debut not ending the way he would've hoped.",
      "The United goalkeeper found himself on the losing side against Fenerbahce on Sunday, as the Turkish Super Lig clash finished 1-0 to the second-placed side courtesy of a Youssef En-Nesyri strike just before half-time. Now, behind-the-scenes footage has surfaced of the shot-stopper voicing his thoughts in the changing room during the interval.",
      "Trabzonspor defender Okay Yokuslu received his marching orders in the 20th minute for a reckless challenge on Fenerbahce forward Kerem Aktürkoğlu, forcing his side to battle for over an hour with 10 men. Despite this, Onana refused to let the setback dampen his spirits as he was spotted rallying his team-mates during their half-time break.",
      "In the clip shared on social media, the keeper can be heard shouting: \"We have to win this game for him,\" before preventing Yokuslu from saying sorry for his red card, gesturing with his hands and declaring: \"No need for sorry.\"",
      "Numerous supporters responded to the footage, expressing their admiration at Onana's reaction and display of leadership in a squad he has only recently joined. One said: \"He's here to win.\"",
      "Another commented: \"He'll find himself there.\" A third added: \"Go to where you're valued.\" One supporter even suggested: \"Manchester United almost ruined him.\"",
      "Not everyone was impressed by Onana's rousing speech, though, with one frustrated supporter remarking: \"All this to lose 1-0.\" Another commented: \"Dude you just got here wtf.\"",
      "Whilst a third added: \"I've been in many changing rooms over the years... this looks to me like he interrupted the captain's team talk. However it went down, this is not a good look for him.\"",
      "Whilst the majority of fans welcomed Onana's reaction, he couldn't keep Fenerbahce out for long, as he pushed away a strike from former United midfielder Fred just before half-time. However, he failed to clear the ball from danger and reacted sluggishly to the follow-up effort that En-Nesryi scrambled home from close quarters.",
      "Whilst the backline offered little protection for the goal, it proved to be a moment the shot-stopper would prefer to erase from his memory. This blunder cast a shadow over what was an otherwise encouraging display from Onana during the remainder of the match, as he pulled off eight stops against Fenerbahce on his debut.",
      "This disastrous beginning will probably already be forgotten by the 29-year-old as he targets more positive performances during his temporary spell away from United. The goalkeeper was allowed to depart Old Trafford this summer following the club's deadline-day signing of youngster Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp, with Ruben Amorim convinced Onana will flourish away from the demands of the Premier League.",
      "Discussing his decision to allow Onana to depart temporarily, the United boss said: \"We saw Andre had a very, very good season in Inter. The quality is there, but we are in the club sometimes, in the moment, things are getting harder and harder. And you can be really experienced.",
      "\"But in this club, the pressure is sometimes so hard on every detail. Sometimes you need a change. I think we understood that he needed a change. Sometimes it's hard to point why. It's the performance, the moments. The bad luck in some moments was hard on him, and it was hard on us. Our thinking is to have a change in the goalkeepers.",
      "\"I wish the best for Andre. He was really good at working, trying to help the players. Sometimes you can have all the quality in the world, but sometimes you need to change the environment to return to your level. That was a feeling, not just from us, but also from Andre.\"",

      "Jose Mourinho may be a Premier League legend but he's decided that his next job will not bring him back to these shores. The Portuguese icon is now closing in on a return to Benfica, but he has previously highlighted two conditions that could see manage in the English top-flight again one day.",
      "After just over a season with Turkish giants Fenerbahce, Mourinho was sacked in late August and found himself back in the market for a job.",
      "Reports in Portugal now say he is set to return to Estadio da Luz, the place were top-flight management began for him. His impending appointment came after Benfica coach Bruno Lage was sacked following the club's shock loss in the Champions League to Qarabag this week.",
      "Mourinho, 62, made an instant impact upon arriving in English football after he won the Premier League with Chelsea in the 2004/2005 season. This came off the back of a stunning Champions League triumph with Porto a season earlier.",
      "A second spell with the Blues, a marginally successful time at Manchester United and a stint at Spurs followed. Mourinho's love affair with the English game has often seen him touted to return to the UK, and he once claimed he would like to manage a team in the Premier League who are not involved in a European competition as well as one that's based in London.",
      "Mourinho fell foul of UEFA officials in a Europa League clash against United, while operating as Fenerbahce coach, in October 2024. After he was sent to the stands by the referee, the 62-year-old hinted at a return to England.",
      "Firing a barb in the direction of UEFA, his tongue-in-cheek remarks didn't stop the rumour mill from churning with clubs such as West Ham and Nottingham Forest rumoured to be circling Mourinho at the time.",
      "\"I think the best thing I have to do is, when I leave Fenerbahce, I go to a club that does not play UEFA competitions,\" Mourinho said. \"If any club in England from the bottom of the table needs a coach in two years, I am ready to go.\"",
      "However, he later clarified his stance. While he couldn't foresee himself battling it out at the foot of the table, insisting that only \"brave guys\" take on such jobs in the Premier League, he did reveal his enormous soft spot for London.",
      "“I had three clubs in England, Chelsea twice, so in four different periods I’ve coached in England and I loved it,\" Mourinho said in October 2024.",
      "“I’ve been so, so lucky to live in beautiful countries and beautiful cities like Istanbul, Rome, Madrid, Milan but my family lives in London. London is home so one day I want to be back, unless nobody wants me.\"",
      "The self-styled 'special one' and his entanglement with the Premier League saw him win three titles, three League Cups and an FA Cup with Chelsea over two stints. He also won the League Cup and Europa League with United after signing on with the Red Devils in 2016.",
      "A spell with Tottenham Hotspur followed in November 2019. While he didn't win silverware with Spurs he did guide them to the League Cup final, only to be sacked before the game itself.",
      "Outside of the UK, Mourinho won the treble, including the Champions League, with Inter Milan in 2010. A spell with Real Madrid from 2010-2013 wielded a La Liga title and a Copa del Rey.",
      "He made his way back to Italy with Roma in 2021 where he won the UEFA Europa Conference League. He also reached the Europa League final with the Serie A giants a season later.",
      "Mourinho is now expected to sign on with Benfica, taking him back to work in his home nation for the first time since 2004. However, it's fair to say that the door that could bring the enigmatic coach back to the Premier League someday is not closed just yet.",

      "Adebayo Akinfenwa hopes Alejandro Garnacho is \"just average\" with Chelsea this season. The Argentine struggled to find his footing with Manchester United last term before being deemed surplus to requirements by Ruben Amorim.",
      "As a result, he found himself joining Chelsea in a £40million move this summer, with hopes of finding his stride in the English capital under Enzo Maresca. However, former Northampton, Wimbledon and Wycombe striker Akinfenwa, who is a long-time Liverpool fan, hopes he \"doesn't tear it up\" with his new club.",
      "\"I don't want to wish bad on him, but I hope he's just average. And the Liverpool players, I want to tear up everything.\"",
      "Akinfenwa also highlighted why he believes Garnacho struggled to make a mark with United before moving on to Chelsea, citing how the pressure of playing for one of the world's biggest clubs may have been too much for the 21-year-old.",
      "He added: \"The one thing I'd say is I can empathise, but I don't know the level of scrutiny at these top clubs. I know the levels of the clubs I was at and sometimes you're like, 'Oh, right.'",
      "\"Just sometimes being in a small city, I remember in Torquay and people knew where I shopped, and it was a running joke. I like my Bourbons and the manager was like, 'Oh, you was in there buying Bourbons.' But that's on a small scale. So I couldn't fathom the likes of the pressure that comes with a Chelsea, with a Man United.",
      "\"I think environments play a massive part and with different managers coming in, with the level of scrutiny, I think it's a lot of pressure and some players can deal with it, some players can't. We've all seen it.",
      "“I think Antony left Man United, went to Betis and hit the ground running. Some people may turn around and say, 'No, these footballers need everything to be perfect,' which again, I won't argue that point. But things need to go in your favour.",
      "\"That's on a day-to-day, especially being young, and having the weight and the pressure of the likes of Man United on his, and you do, you need a consistent base.\"",
      "Akinfenwa also suggested deeper issues at United may have a major effect on the performances of their brightest talents, instilling a belief that it has been shown time and time again that the club lacks a sturdy support system for developing talents.",
      "He added: \"You need a core support system, which is like, 'This is what we play, this is how we are.'",
      "\"Sometimes we'll be like, 'Oh, look, very emotion based.' But if you've got that core system that always allows, 'Look, this is the culture we set, this is what we do regardless, win, lose or draw.' I don't think Man United's had that for a long time. I think with [Marcus] Rashford, I think with [Jadon] Sancho, and I think with Garnacho, I think these are players where [this is clear].",
      "\"Again, [Scott] McTominay's left on one at Napoli. So these are elements where you're talking about, 'Okay, you know what, fundamentally, at its core, there's something not quite right with United.'\"",
      "Garnacho made his Chelsea debut from the bench on Saturday as the Blues were held to a 2-2 draw by Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium, entering the fray in the 79th minute. He crucially lost his man, Fabio Carvalho, defending at the back post for the stoppage time equaliser.",
      "However, he may see more time to flourish when Chelsea take on Bayern Munich in their Champions League opener on Wednesday evening.",
      "It comes as Akinfenwa has teamed up with Tony's Chocolonely to become the brand's first-ever Bar Breaker in a brand new campaign. Speaking about his role, Akinfenwa said: \"I'm humbled to be the first official Bar Breaker for Tony's Chocolonely.",
      "\"You know their ethos, their look, chunky – I hear that people be struggling to break how chunky it is. So they have to come to Mr Beast mode to try and help the nation – both break the bar and then also try and get people to get on board with their mission. I do think it's a nice fusion, it's a nice balance. The official Bar Breaker!\"",
      "Adebayo 'The Beast’ Akinfenwa has been named Tony’s Chocolonely’s first official Bar Breaker. The Beast is motivating the nation to flex their thumb muscles to help more people enjoy more of the chunky, unequally divided bars with ease - ultimately bringing more people along on the brand’s mission to end exploitation in cocoa.",

      "The decision to let the talented 22-year-old go was met with criticism at the time, but Eddie Howe's side were forced to sell to meet Profit and Sustainability (PSR) rules. In a simultaneous move, reserve goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos was transferred to Newcastle for £20m.",

      "There were concerns that Newcastle might rue letting Anderson go, given his potential to become a top-tier Premier League player, and it seems he's now living up to those expectations.",
      "Indeed, Anderson was instrumental in Forest's impressive seventh-place finish last season, earning them a spot in this season's Europa League. His stellar performances have continued this season, culminating in an England senior debut against Andorra earlier this month under Thomas Tuchel.",

      "With Anderson turning heads both at Forest and on international duty, rumours about his future are heating up. According to ex-United boss Brown, the Reds are mulling over a potential move.",
      "\"Man United have been looking at Anderson,\" Brown told Football Insider. \"He's done a tremendous job at Nottingham Forest and then he's come into the England side and turned in a man-of-the-match performance. United see him as exactly the type of midfielder they would like to bring in.",
      "\"He gets up and down the park, he's confident and secure in possession of the ball, and he's not afraid to put in a tackle which is something they need.",
      "\"Anderson would solve, or certainly help with, a lot of the issues they've had under Amorim. Everybody knows they wanted a midfielder in the summer but they couldn't find the right one who was available at the price they wanted.",
      "\"I don't know what Anderson would cost, but he is somebody who's been on their radar. He would be the ideal player to fill the gaps they've had in the squad.\"",
      "Reports suggest Forest rate Anderson at a minimum of £70m - twice what the Reds paid for him just over 12 months ago. At present, it's believed the midfielder has no intention of departing The City Ground.",
      "However, should he make the switch to Manchester, would Newcastle be entitled to compensation through a potential sell-on agreement?",
      "Chronicle Live believes the Magpies don't possess a buy-back option despite suggestions the club can trigger specific clauses in his deal with Forest.",
      "Should Newcastle want Anderson back, they'd need to pay the full market rate for the midfielder, with his worth rising after every display at present. It's been hinted that Newcastle may not have a sell-on clause in Anderson's contract, which could be a significant setback if he is sold for a hefty sum.",
      "Anderson wasn't the only player Newcastle had to let go last season to comply with PSR rules. The Magpies also offloaded Yankuba Minteh to Brighton and Hove Albion in a deal worth roughly £30m.",

      "The former Premier League defender spent 10 years coaching City's U16s before taking a job at a sports agency in February 2024.",
      "Wright worked closely with Jason Wilcox, who is now the director of football at Old Trafford, during his time at City, but it's understood Travis Binnion advised Wright for the role.",
      "Binnion is known to supporters as the U21 manager, but his official title in United's academy is head of player development and coaching, which reflects his large responsibility in the youth set-up.",
      "The appointment of Wright has not been finalised, but he is expected to take up the position.",
      "Wright has a UEFA A Licence and played a small part in creating more than £350 million of revenue in sales for City during his time coaching in their academy, which has built a reputation for exporting talent.",
      "Wright played more than 300 games for Aston Villa and also represented Blackpool, Blackburn Rovers, Middlesbrough, Sheffield United, Cheltenham Town and Fleetwood Town during his career. Binnion played alongside Wright at Sheffield United before being forced to retire early due to injury.",
      "Torpey is another former City academy employee. He joined City in 2014 and gradually worked his way up in their academy to become the head of coaching between the Under-15 and Under-23 age groups, a role in which he oversaw trophy wins.",

      "Manchester United have announced the results of their fourth quarter trading period for the year ended June 30, 2025.",
      "United have reported revenues of £164 million for the fourth quarter, which contributes to record revenues for 2025 of £666.5m.",
      "Those revenues were made during a period in which United finished in 15th place in the Premier League, their worst performance in the competition since it was created in 1992.",
      "Due to their competing in the Europa League, the final of which they lost to Tottenham Hotspur, United saw broadcasting revenues slump by £50m to £173m given their participation in the Champions League the season before.",
      "United expect an improvement to retail and merchandise revenues and a slight uplift in broadcasting revenues given an increase in Premier League broadcasting money offsetting the absence of the club from UEFA competition this season.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "£35",
      "The club also added that it 'remains committed to, and in compliance with, both the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules and UEFA’s Financial Fair Play Regulations'.",
      "“As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas,\" CEO Omar Berrada said.",
      "\"On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men’s and women’s first team squads over the summer, as we build for the long-term. Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.",
      "“We are also investing to upgrade our infrastructure, including completion of the £50m redevelopment of our men’s first team building at Carrington, on time and on budget, following prior investment in our women’s team facilities, to create a world-class environment for our players and staff. Meanwhile, planning continues to meet our ambition of developing a new stadium at Old Trafford as part of a transformational regeneration of the surrounding community.",
      "“To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United. Our commercial business remains strong as we continue to deliver appealing products and experiences for our fans, and best-in-class value to our partners. As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.”"

      "There are three certainties in life: death, taxes and people questioning the future of the Manchester United manager.",
      "Sources reiterated Ruben Amorim retains the backing of the board following a bruising defeat to Manchester City, but it's clear Amorim desperately needs results.",
      "Sack the manager, hire a new coach and usher in an exciting new era by spending in the transfer market. That is the nature of football, but United have become specialists in failure when the club has been built on success.",
      "Amorim needed a fast start after overseeing the worst season at Old Trafford for 51 years, but United have made their worst start to a Premier League campaign for 33 years.",
      "The situation is depressingly familiar, and you only have to look back to last season to see a United manager who needed to start the campaign well, failed to do so, and was axed.",
      "It was the wrong decision to keep Erik ten Hag after the FA Cup final triumph. Ten Hag managed to survive the September and October international breaks, United scraped a win against Brentford, drew against Fenerbahce and the Dutchman was finally shown the door after a defeat to West Ham on October 27.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked the day after the loss to the Hammers. The season was still salvageable at that stage, but United did not enjoy a new manager bounce when Amorim was appointed in November.",
      "The October international break is synonymous with managerial sackings. History tells you the next few weeks are crucial for Amorim.",
      "United could beat Chelsea this weekend and enjoy further wins against Brentford and Sunderland before the October break, but Amorim is yet to win successive league games during his tenure.",
      "United's head coach has the unwanted record of having the lowest win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "It's not unthinkable that Amorim could turn the ship around, but the number of fans who doubt he will be a success is increasing, despite the vocal support for the 40-year-old at Old Trafford.",
      "There was a show of support from Amorim from the Stretford End before the Burnley win. Banners were unfurled, flags were flown, and one had the message: \"The good days are coming.\"",
      "A picture of Amorim jumping on the touchline (his reaction to Harry Maguire's winner in the special victory against Lyon at Old Trafford last season) accompanied the message. And it didn't take long for the Stretford End to sing \"He'll turn the Reds around\".",
      "The fanbase is split on, just as it was with Ten Hag, although the situation with Amorim is not as grave as it was in the final weeks of Ten Hag's reign.",
      "Having said that, Ineos' decision to sack Ten Hag just nine game into the 2024/25 Premier League campaign shows they are open to the idea of an early change, and United play Chelsea, Brentford, Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton before the anniversary of Ten Hag's sacking.",
      "The Liverpool fixture at Anfield immediately after the international break already looks ominous. Arne Slot's side are favourites to win the Premier League title and could smell blood when United visit next month.",
      "Four games into the Premier League season, it feels ridiculous that the conversation around Amorim's future has started, but results dictate the narrative and United only have four points.",
      "Just last month, someone who has worked at United for six years said the mood in the camp was \"genuinely different\" this summer. Pre-season was full of positivity, Amorim boosted morale by looking to cut ties with anyone who didn't have a future at the club and there was excitement about what could be achieved.",
      "Everyone is hoping Amorim will overcome the slow start to the new campaign and become a success at Old Trafford. But he is facing an almighty battle to silence the doubters.",

      "Ticket prices have been a source of controversy since Sir Jim Ratcliffe acquired a minority stake in United last year.",

      "\"I don't want to end up in a position where the genuine local fans can't afford to come, but I do want to optimise the ticketing. We need to find a balance. And you can't be popular all the time either. Here, we're talking about three per cent of the tickets. That's not the issue.",
      "\"The issue, as you say, is whether this is the thin edge of the wedge. I don't think it makes sense for a Manchester United ticket to cost less than a ticket to see Fulham.\"",
      "Told that wages are higher in London, Ratcliffe continued: \"I get that. I'm not sure there's an answer that keeps everybody happy, but we need to keep the majority happy.\"",

      "Former Tottenham Hotspur player Jamie O'Hara continues to call for the return of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Manchester United as a replacement for Ruben Amorim.",
      "Solskjaer is currently without a club after being sacked by Besiktas late last month after losing a Conference League play-off tie to Lausanne-Sport, who are coincidently also owned by Ineos like United. They drew 1-1 in Switzerland, but the visitors won 1-0 in Istanbul a week later.",
      "That was his first head coaching role since being sacked by United in November 2021. Solskjaer spent over three years away from management, but took charge of just 29 matches.",
      "\"He can come in, he can be a stopgap manager, interim manager, get players back onside.\" O'Hara explained: \"I believe that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, if you get him back in, go back to the formation that they were playing before, get the players back onside, give them a bit of freedom, and I think they can maybe just calm everything down.\"",
      "Weeks later, O'Hara has doubled down on that stance. \"I can't believe Ruben Amorim is still in charge,\" he said on talkSPORT.",
      "\"When are they going to let it go? When are they going to just… do what Sheffield United have done, just swallow their pride [and say] 'we got this wrong?'",
      "\"Get Ole back in. They can't carry on doing this. They'll go down. They'll be playing Rotherham next season.\"",
      "Sheffield United recently relieved Ruben Selles of his duties and appointed Chris Wilder three months after the latter mutually agreed to leave the Championship club, with the former replacing him.",

      "Manchester United announced record revenues in their financial results despite the club recording their worst season on the pitch in 51 years. The results for the fourth quarter trading period for the year ended June 30, 2025, show revenues of £164million, a contribution to record revenues of £666.5m for 2025.",
      "Despite finishing 15th in the Premier League last season and losing the Europa League final under Ruben Amorim, United have enjoyed a good financial year off the pitch. Commercial revenues stood at £88.2m - £333.3m in fiscal 2025, while matchday revenues hit £37.2m - £160.3m in total for the year.",
      "In the release accounts, the club also added that it 'remains committed to, and in compliance with, both the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability Rules and UEFA’s Financial Fair Play Regulations'.",
      "“As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas,\" CEO Omar Berrada said.",
      "\"On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men’s and women’s first team squads over the summer, as we build for the long-term. Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.",
      "“We are also investing to upgrade our infrastructure, including completion of the £50m redevelopment of our men’s first team building at Carrington, on time and on budget, following prior investment in our women’s team facilities, to create a world-class environment for our players and staff. Meanwhile, planning continues to meet our ambition of developing a new stadium at Old Trafford as part of a transformational regeneration of the surrounding community.",
      "“To have generated record revenues during such a challenging year for the club demonstrates the resilience which is a hallmark of Manchester United. Our commercial business remains strong as we continue to deliver appealing products and experiences for our fans, and best-in-class value to our partners. As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.”",
      "However, despite the record revenue for this quarter, United has made an overall loss of £18.4m. This is an improvement on the operating loss of £69.3m in fiscal 2024.",
      "It means that, despite the positive numbers from the announcement on Wednesday, another transfer window of activity isn't expected. PSR rules insist that clubs must not lose more than £105m over three years, and the club's lack of European football this fiscal year means they will bring in less revenue in the next results.",
      "Like in the summer, the club's ability to sell players will massively help any movement in the January window or at the end of the season.",

      "Ruben Neves has reached a special milestone for Al-Hilal amid links to Manchester United.",
      "The 28-year-old has emerged as a surprise candidate to reinforce the Reds' midfield, having entered the final year of his contract at the Saudi Pro League side. Earlier this summer, United were looking at a move for a central midfielder and identified Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba as a target.",
      "However, his steep price tag - believed to be around £100 million - led United to shelve their interest for the time being. While they could revisit a move for the 21-year-old next year, other names such as Adam Wharton, Morten Hjulmand, and Elliot Anderson also emerged.",
      "On Wednesday, the Daily Briefing reported that Neves is open to returning to European football after two seasons at Al-Hilal. He previously enjoyed a successful spell in the Premier League with Wolves, playing a key role in their promotion to the top flight during the 2017/18 season.",
      "The report states that Newcastle United and Tottenham are likely to vie for the player's signature, while Ruben Amorim is reportedly particularly keen on signing him.",
      "However, Neves appears focused on the job at hand in the Middle East after reaching 100 games for Al-Hilal. Taking to Instagram, he shared the club's tribute with a simple blue 'love heart' emoji.",
      "Back in August, during an interview with Portuguese channel Sport TV, Neves revealed his wish to return to his boyhood club, FC Porto.",
      "\"I've said it in all the interviews - it's not coming back to finish your career, it's going back to play and be competitive: that's my big goal,\" he said.",
      "\"Fortunately, I'm 28 years old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club, it's something I want to give them and experience [for myself].",

      "If there is a team that can turn the apparent advantage of no European football into a disadvantage it is Manchester United.",
      "Already, the six or seven-day gap between games feel inauspicious. The downbeat mood festers for longer and there is not even a League Cup third round tie to play and fuel confidence that can be channelled into the next weekend fixture.",
      "One of the reasons why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in such immediate peril after United's 5-0 shellacking by Liverpool four years ago was that they did not have a midweek match. United were caught short and had no succession plan, so Solskjaer limped on for another four weeks.",
      "But the club had decided he would have to go and began devising a plan, incurring two more damaging defeats to Manchester City and Watford. In the Sir Elton John Stand at Vicarage Road, Solskjaer was barely still standing.",
      "Louis van Gaal only survived United's Boxing Day loss at Stoke - their fourth in a row - due to the tight turnaround. They hosted Chelsea two days later and performed spiritedly in a watchable goalless draw.",
      "The weeks drag in the wake of a defeat. United's next three fixtures are all Saturday kick-offs, so the gaps will be a day longer than the six days between City and Chelsea.",
      "Then it is another international fortnight. United had decided by last year's October internationals that Erik ten Hag would go. It was just a case of when. Inexplicably, they swung the axe three games after the October internationals.",
      "There was a rendition of \"sacked in the morning\" at the Etihad on Sunday. Ten Hag was dismissed on a Monday last year. That gave Ruud van Nistelrooy a full week in caretaker charge. United are not wavering on Ruben Amorim.",
      "United have one win from their opening five games, as they did in their last campaign devoid of European football in 2014-15. United did not maximise their lighter workload that season and scraped fourth place with one win from their final six games.",
      "Their season was salvaged by two six-game winning sequences in the winter and the spring. The latter featured victories against Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City that remain among United's best against those sides in the post-Ferguson era.",
      "It was during that sprightly spring that Van Gaal settled on a winning formula. Six days after Arsenal ended United's chances of silverware in the FA Cup quarter-final, Van Gaal paired Chris Smalling with Phil Jones, moved Daley Blind to left back and recalled Juan Mata to the right wing. United were 3-0 up against Spurs at half-time.",
      "United were unchanged a week later at Liverpool, where they produced what remains their best performance at Anfield since the back-to-back 3-1 triumphs in 1997. That same XI started the Manchester derby three weeks later when United battered City 4-2.",
      "Amorim has made six changes across United's four league games. He has only ever picked an unchanged XI once, at Lyon four days after the goalless Old Trafford derby.",
      "Losing to a City side devoid of their fear factor and beaten in their previous two games by tactically astute teams warrants a major rethink. Amorim is never going to compromise on the failing 3-4-2-1 system he is wedded to and his stubbornness extends to some selections.",
      "Overpromoting Altay Bayindir to first choice has not worked. Amorim said Bayindir could be like Edwin van der Sar. He is not as good as Raimond van der Gouw and Senne Lammens may as well go in goal sooner rather than later.",
      "Amorim talked his way into trouble by labelling Luke Shaw, who has broken the 40-appearance barrier in three out of 11 seasons, \"world-class\". Shaw has been reinvented as a centre half but remains an auxiliary option and Amorim has reduced Harry Maguire to a goalscoring impact sub.",
      "Managers can be too dogmatic about right-footed and left-footed centre backs and a few of them (Van Gaal, Amorim and Erik ten Hag) have ended up at United. United are better off with Maguire than Shaw. Maguire played on the left of a back three of only the third England team to reach a World Cup semi-final.",
      "For a 24-year-old, Manuel Ugarte is too naive as the designated defensive midfielder. Fulham coach Marco Silva and winger Alex Iwobi admitted they preyed on United's numerical disadvantage in midfield last month as their centre backs \"want to jump\". Ugarte has to take a back seat otherwise Amorim will revert to the less mobile Casemiro.",
      "Bruno Fernandes' redeployment in midfield is anathema to many accustomed to seeing him higher up the pitch yet he excelled from deep in the second half of last season, so much so he scored a hat-trick from there against Real Sociedad. United have a surfeit of No.10s and a paucity of midfield options. Keeping Fernandes further back is better for the team's balance but his defensive shortcomings have to be cut out and can be if Ugarte stays deeper.",
      "The wingers are a growing concern. Diogo Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui and Patrick Dorgu are inadequate in the final third. Given Amorim's preference for a left-footer on the left wing, Amad is worth a go as he is a superior footballer to the raw Dorgu.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are certain picks as the two playmakers when both are fit. Benjamin Sesko is pleading for time but his time could be up before he knows it unless he starts scoring. He has to consistently start, at least until the October internationals.",
      "The October international fortnight will be scrapped next year. The bad news is the September break will be extended to three weeks.",
      "Woe betide United if they are still out of Europe then.",

Hojlund opened his account on debut after Napoli bolstered their attacking options in the wake of an injury to former United striker Romelu Lukaku.",
      "He has already made an impact for the reigning Italian champions, and Conte is confident the striker has even more to offer. The Napoli boss has thrown his full support behind Hojlund ahead of Thursday night's Champions League clash with Manchester City.",
      "He said: \"I knew Rasmus because he played with Atalanta and then he came to Man United. In my opinion we are talking about a player with great potential and he is only 22, so he has a whole career ahead of him. When we spoke with him, I felt he was really happy to get this new experience and he said he was ready and wanted to play for me and for Napoli.",
      "\"He has great potential and now it's up to me to improve him and to grow and to become a really really top striker. Whether they come from the Premier League or any other championship, the important thing is that the players who arrive or come onto the pitch can give something.\"",
      "The Danish striker endured a difficult time at Old Trafford, scoring just 36 goals in 95 games in all competitions across the last couple of seasons. Last campaign, Hojlund managed just four goals in the Premier League.",
      "\"Hojlund didn't have much luck or a great experience in the last couple of years at Man United,\" Conte added. \"He is a 22-years-old who has a whole career in front of him. He's shown that he has so much potential and so many things that I need to work on to try and implement even more and make them even better.",
      "Hojlund reunited with Scott McTominay in Naples after a brief spell together in Manchester. Since leaving United last summer, ending a 22-year association with the club, the former Reds' graduate has become a key figure for Conte.",
      "The Italian boss also admitted he was initially surprised Napoli managed to land McTominay.",
      "\"I saw great potential in this player and my mind was why Scott McTominay is not dominant in England because he has great potential. When the possibility happened to sign him for Napoli, honestly in the first moment I didn't believe that it could happen,\" Conte revealed.",
      "\"It happened and now he is enjoying it. For a player like him, he was born in Manchester United and there is a point in your career and life where maybe you need to change and to try another experience. It happened with us and we are really really happy because we are not only talking about a fantastic player but also a good person.\"",

      "Altay Bayindir wanted the ground to swallow him up when he conceded the third goal. Haaland finished with ease to net his second of the game and a desolate Bayindir stared at the turf.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo was spotted on the halfway line trying to get Bayindir's attention. Mbeumo was screaming at his goalkeeper, trying to tell him to keep his head up, and he eventually got the message across.",
      "Ruben Amorim confirmed at his pre-match press conference that Bayindir would start, despite making mistakes against Arsenal and Burnley. That backfired because Bayindir was shaky from the first whistle.",
      "He was a bundle of nerves and went down to the ground far too easily for Haaland's first goal. Mbeumo sensed he was low on confidence after conceding City's third and tried to encourage him.",
      "It feels like only a matter of time before Senne Lammens is the first choice goalkeeper.",
      "City fans do the Poznan",
      "City fans brought out The Poznan after going three goals ahead. The fans in front of the press box turned around in glee to face journalists and the dance spread around the entire lower tier.",
      "United only trailed by a goal at the interval and could have found a way back into the contest, but they capitulated in the space of 15 minutes and a lot of fans in the away section started to leave early.",
      "Amorim has overseen some humiliating defeats and a 3-0 loss to City will be added to the catalogue.",
      "The terrace exchange",
      "Former City director of football Txiki Begiristain was shown on the big screen. He received warm applause from the home support, but United fans responded: \"You cheating b*******, you know what you are.\"",
      "There was another rendition of the chant just minutes into the contest, but City fans fired back after taking the lead through Foden, singing their own version of the Amorim chant.",
      "\"Crying from the Stretford End... He'll turn the Reds around,\" they taunted before reverting to \"Old Trafford is falling down, Amorim is a f****** clown. Glazers staying 10 more years\".",
      "There was a debate on a radio station about whether United and City are still proper rivals, but you only need to listen to matchgoing fans to know that was a stupid suggestion.",
      "United fans who work with City supporters will dread going to work this morning.",
      "United need more leaders",
      "Noussair Mazraoui went down with an injury just outside the City box at the start of the second half and Doku approached him to gesture that he was exaggerating the extent of the issue.",
      "City fans whistled at Mazraoui while he took his time to get back to his feet. Leny Yoro began to make his way over, seemingly looking to protect his colleague from Doku's rant.",
      "Yoro was the only United player to offer protection to Mazraoui. The dressing room needs more characters like Yoro.",
      "The midfield is a problem",
      "The decision to start Ugarte raised eyebrows. The midfielder had been hooked at half-time against Grimsby Town after failing to track back for their first goal and was an unused substitute against Burnley.",
      "Amorim was expected to continue with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but he handed another chance to Ugarte because he felt the 24-year-old's pressing ability and energy would be valuable.",
      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",
      "The midfield is a problem for Amorim, but United didn't believe that area was a priority in the summer.",
      "Beautiful tribute for Hatton",
      "The death of legendary boxer Ricky Hatton was announced on Sunday morning. Hatton was a lifelong City supporter and was expected to attend Sunday's derby.",
      "There was a minute's applause held for Hatton prior to the game and the players wore black armbands. Both sets of fans joined in with the tribute and chanted together: \"There's only one Ricky Hatton.\"",
      "Hatton was a proper Mancunian icon and it was heartwarming to hear City and United fans sing his name together.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim defended his decision to play Bruno Fernandes in central midfield for the fourth game running at Manchester City.",
      "United lost 3-0 at the Etihad to leave them with four points from their first four Premier League games, their worst start to a season since 1992-93.",
      "Fernandes has dropped back into midfield this season following the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who had occupied the two playmaker roles before Cunha suffered an injury against Burnley two weeks ago.",
      "Amorim picked Amad alongside Mbeumo behind Benjamin Sesko while Fernandes was partnered by Manuel Ugarte, having started alongside Casemiro in the previous three league outings.",
      "United only have three out-and-out central midfielders in Ugarte, Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo, with the latter yet to start in the league this term.",
      "\"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives. Against Arsenal, who is playing against Arsenal? Do you think we play well? Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",
      "\"Sometimes it is the dynamic of the team. Sometimes it is an opportunity that you score. I see it that way. I know that it is really hard for people [to understand]. The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",
      "\"I am trying to be rational and I don't lie to myself. I see the record. I understand the frustration of everybody and I understand any decision that came with that. But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",
      "\"Today when you imagine the game, why not use Amad, Bryan, Sesko and Bruno behind with the ball? To be the first guy receiving the ball and then with a lot of pace in front.",
      "\"I am trying to do different things, trying to imagine the game. And then when you don't win, it doesn't work, you take the critics. But that's it.\"",

      "Amie is a football writer covering clubs across the country, she has been a football fan all of her life and supports Leicester City. She graduated with a degree in Sport and Exercise Psychology in 2015. Amie has previous experience in local radio in Leicester and Leicestershire.",
      "It has been a disappointing start to the Premier League season for Manchester United.",
      "One win, one draw, and two losses in their first four games of the season have left them in 14th place in the table, with four points from a possible 12 available. A 3-0 loss against rivals Manchester City on Sunday afternoon was one to forget for United fans.",
      "It has also raised questions again about Ruben Amorim's future. The summer transfer window saw the club spend around £200 million on new players, including striker Benjamin Sesko and forwards Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "The first games of the campaign have, however, shown the problems that remain in the squad. With the summer transfer window now closed, work will have to be done in January to address those issues.",
      "Amid growing pressure on his position, Amorim may already be looking to the work he can do when the window reopens if he is still at the club. Addressing problems in the winter window could relieve some of the pressure on the Portuguese boss.",
      "Here’s a look at what a dream January window could look like for Amorim and United.",
      "There’s no doubt that midfield reinforcements should be the priority for United going into the January window. The club did make moves for players in the summer.",
      "Brighton’s strong not-for-sale stance on Carlos Baleba caused them to walk away from any potential deal. But United could potentially try again in January in the hope that the Seagulls may be more open to a sale.",
      "If that’s the case, then negotiations could start, with an agreement between all parties hopefully being reached. The arrival of Baleba could potentially help give Bruno Fernandes more freedom, even if he is playing in a deeper midfield role.",
      "Another player linked with United in the last few days is Nottingham Forest’s Elliott Anderson. The player caught the eye with his performances for England against both Andorra and Serbia in the international break.",
      "The former Newcastle man has shown how he can control games and dictate the play, something that United have been missing so far this season. However, like with Baleba, a deal may not be easy to do with Forest, who will be keen to keep hold of a key player, especially during the first transfer window with Ange Postecoglou at the helm.",
      "Away from midfield, one other area where United probably need more cover is at right-back. Currently, Diego Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui are the two recognised right-backs in the squad.",
      "An injury or suspension to just one will leave United short on options. United have again been linked with an interest in Inter’s Denzel Dumfries.",
      "The full-back has recently admitted that he would be open to a Premier League move, and would add experience and quality to that side of defence.",
      "If United did complete the signings of both Baleba and Anderson, or two deeper midfielders in the January window, then it would allow Kobbie Mainoo to leave the club on loan for the second half of the season. The midfielder outlined his desire to leave on a temporary deal during the summer, but United refused.",
      "If the club can add to their midfield options, then it would free up the academy graduate to go out and get regular game time.",
      "Another player who could go out on loan is Tyler Fredricson. Lisandro Martinez is expected to be back from injury in the next couple of months, if the centre-back can get up to speed quickly then it would provide enough defensive cover to allow the 20-year-old to go out and get more games.",
      "Chido Obi could be a third candidate to go out on loan. After making his United debut last season, the striker is yet to make a matchday squad this season, and has been back playing for the U21 squad.",
      "A loan deal could see him get more of a taste for first-team football in the second half of the season, and hopefully return a better player.",
      "One player who could leave permanently is Tyrell Malacia. The full-back was linked with a move away in the summer, but a transfer never materialised.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Goalkeepers: Senne Lammens, Altay Bayindir, Tom Heaton",

      "United lost 3-0 to Manchester City in the Manchester derby on Sunday and Amorim became the target of criticism from pundits. The Portuguese has now only won won eight of his 31 league games in charge since taking over from Erik ten Hag last November.",
      "Despite being highly regarded in his native Portugal for his outstanding work at Sporting Clube de Portugal - ending their 19-year league title drought and leading them back into Europe - the last few months in England have not been easy for him.",
      "Outsiders are keeping an eye on his situation and reports in Portugal claim he is being considered as a potential manager for Benfica.",
      "Next month, the Portuguese giants will hold elections for a new president. Candidate Joao Noronha Lopes, together with former Benfica and Portugal international Nuno Gomes, who is running as vice-president, are reportedly considering Amorim as a potential coach.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The pair were in attendance at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday and, upon their return to Lisbon, were quizzed about the latest rumours.",
      "Noronha Lopes explained: \"We went to Manchester to watch the derby, and when we are together, we take the time to have meetings and prepare the future of Benfica.",
      "\"We didn't meet up with Bernardo Silva or Ruben Amorim after the game. I want to bring to Benfica a winning culture, which has talent, dedication and people who know how to win.\"",
      "When quizzed if he would like to see Amorim as manager of Benfica in the near future, Noronha Lopes added: \"Ruben is under contract with Manchester United and I won't comment on that.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Gomes denied that their trip to Manchester had anything to do with the United manager. \"I don't want to speak about that, I'm a friend of Ruben Amorim, and he has a contract with Manchester United,\" he added.",
      "\"We watched the game, Joao [Noronha Lopes] is a passionate football fan and I enjoyed this experience with him.\"",

      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "A striking recall yet Ugarte was United's best player in the first half and operated at a level that was the polar opposite of his 45 minutes at Grimsby. Unable to halt City's second-half charge. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Guilty of failing to track the runner for another goal that United conceded three weeks after Emile Smith Rowe evaded him at Fulham. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Could have intercepted the switch of play which eventually led to Foden's goal. Had chances to service Sesko but his crossing was abject. 4",

      "United travelled to the United States to compete in the Premier League Summer Series this summer, preparing for the new season with friendlies against West Ham, Bournemouth and Everton.",
      "Ruben Amorim included a handful of youngsters from the academy in the travelling tour squad. Williams made the cut and scored his first senior goal in a 4-1 win against Bournemouth.",
      "In August, Williams signed for Falkirk on a season-long loan. The forward made 17 appearances during his six-month loan with Cheltenham Town last term and will now try to develop his game in Scotland.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Record, Williams said: “I played about 15 minutes against Bournemouth in Chicago in the summer. We won 4-1 and I scored. The whole team was really warming to me and the other young players. To play and score on tour was life-changing. Something I will never forget.",
      "“Coming off the back of that, getting the opportunity to play here in a good league against good teams is really important to me. I just can’t wait to get my foot in the door and start pushing for starts.\"",
      "Explaining his move to Falkirk, he said: “I’d been speaking to the manager (John McGlynn) and his coaches for quite some time over the summer. Going on tour with United it was quite difficult, communication wise. But once it was set in motion I was ready to come here. I’m happy to be here.",
      "“It’s always good to know that a manager trusts you. For him to come to me and be interested is quite flattering. I’m proud to be here.",
      "“The team has had back-to-back promotions and want to play aggressive football against the top teams. It’s a style I like as a winger. That’s what sold it on me.",
      "“The Scottish Premiership is a very good league, comparable with leagues in England. My first experience of it was good. It was a really proud moment and I’m thankful the manager trusts me and gave me minutes.\"",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as United's Under-18 manager in the summer, but his previous role involved keeping tabs on academy prospects and reporting on their progress.",
      "Williams discussed his relationship with Fletcher, adding: \"I’ve been a United fan for a long time. Him being in the team with the likes of Ronaldo and Rooney, they were the glory days of Man United.",
      "“It’s quite an unreal experience when you step back and think ‘wow’ I’m actually talking with Darren Fletcher. It’s a mad experience for a young kid. But being up here and around it is a good thing.",
      "“Darren was one of the first team assistant coaches, he’s with the U18s now but I’m in contact with him. He knows the game and is a big part of Manchester United. He’s someone that is looking to help me in my journey.",
      "“He’s been asking how everything’s going. I told him I’ve settled well and the team is really welcoming. Everyone is really heartwarming with me and getting around the lads has been a good experience.\"",
      "Williams' professional contract with United started in June 2024 and he was given the chance to train with FC-Lausanne's first team in October as part of an innovative agreement between the Swiss club and United.",
      "Williams joined United's academy from Rochdale at Under-14 level. He is the nephew of Alex Williams, who rose to prominence in the early 1980s as one of the first black goalkeepers in the modern top flight, making more than 100 appearances for Manchester City in a trailblazing career.",

      "Napoli head coach Antonio Conte struggled to believe that Man Utd sold Scottish midfielder Scott McTominay to the Serie A side.",
      "The Red Devils allowed McTominay to join Napoli for €30m (£25.4m) in the summer of 2024 with the Scot winning the Serie A title in his first season in Italy.",
      "McTominay contributed 12 goals and four assists in 34 appearances as Napoli won their second Scudetto in three years, while Man Utd struggled to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League.",
      "And former Chelsea and Tottenham boss Conte struggled to believe that Man Utd would allow “fantastic player” McTominay to leave the club.",
      "Conte said: “I knew him when he played with Manchester United because I coached two times in England.",
      "“I saw great potential in this player and was [asking] why Scott McTominay is not dominant in England because he has great potential.",
      "READ: Next Man Utd manager: Ranking Amorim’s replacements puts Southgate second",
      "“When the possibility happened to sign him for Napoli, honestly in the first moment I didn’t believe that it could happen. It happened and now he is enjoying it.",
      "“For a player like him, he was born in Manchester United and there is a point in your career and life where maybe you need to change and to try another experience. It happened with us and we are really, really happy because we are not only talking about a fantastic player but a fantastic man.”",
      "Man Utd could have also made another mistake by allowing Rasmus Hojlund to join Napoli on loan, with an option to buy, over the summer transfer window.",
      "Conte added: “I knew Rasmus because he played with Atalanta and then he came to Man United. In my opinion we are talking about a player with great potential and he is only 22, so he has a whole career ahead of him.",
      "“When we spoke with him, I felt he was really happy to get this new experience and he said he was ready and wanted to play for me and for Napoli.",
      "“He has great potential and now it’s up to me to improve him and to grow and to become a really, really top striker. Whether they come from the Premier League or any other championship, the important thing is that the players who arrive or come onto the pitch can give something.",
      "“Hojlund didn’t have much luck or a great experience in the last couple of years at Man United.",
      "“He is a 22-years-old who has a whole career in front of him. He’s shown that he has so much potential and so many things that I need to work on to try and implement even more and make them even better.”",
      "Manchester United will be weighing up the ‘eye-watering’ severance fee due to Ruben Amorim, but it wouldn’t even be in the top ten biggest manager pay-offs.",
      "Ruben Amorim is experiencing deja vu with one Manchester United summer signing, while his predecessor shines away from the ‘graveyard’…",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",
      "Man Utd legend Peter Schmeichel reckons the Red Devils could have saved £73m by keeping Rasmus Hojlund and not signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Man Utd defender Patrick Dorgu has revealed he was “shocked” to see Rasmus Hojlund leave Old Trafford in the summer transfer window.",
      "Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund ‘considers himself better’ than summer signing Benjamin Sesko after signing for Napoli on loan, according to reports."

      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "The bookies aren’t often wrong so we’ve gone through the top 10 favourites to become United’s next manager.",
      "Frankly, it’s a s*** list. Bad enough to think that maybe 3-4-2-1 might work in the Championship after all.",
      "Please, Ruben. Just consider for a second that there might be a better way. Otherwise United should be bringing either the ex-England manager or a Barcelona legend back into management.",
      "Here’s how we’ve ranked the 10 current favourites to replace Amorim…",
      "",
      "Carrick failed to meet expectations at Middlesbrough in the Championship. Which makes a mockery of the fact that, at the time of writing, he’s third favourite for Amorim’s job.",
      "Of course, that’s down to his United legacy as one of the finest midfielders of the modern era. He also served as a coach and retains an unbeaten record as caretaker boss. Carrick’s link to United’s glorious past will always stand out on his CV. But the rest of it needs expanding and polishing before he can be considered a credible candidate for the top job at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Nuno’s stock has probably never been as high despite being sacked by Nottingham Forest. He left the City Ground after falling out with a man who falls out with everyone eventually, with Forest back in Europe for the first time in 30 years on his watch.",
      "Which is very commendable. Just not commendable enough to give him the keys to the Manchester United clown car.",
      "He would be far better off at West Ham.",
      "",
      "The nearly man of Dortmund has been out of work for over a year having left his boyhood club in the wake of their Champions League defeat to Real Madrid. Prior to that, he was a game away from winning the Bundesliga before blowing it spectacularly on the final day in 2023.",
      "Since leaving Dortmund, Terzic has spent his time preparing for his next opportunity, tapping into others’ knowledge to make sure he’s ready for wherever that might be. It was thought the German was on United’s list when they moved for Amorim.",
      "But Terzic seems to be looking for a project, the time for which he would never be afforded at Old Trafford.",
      "We have him pegged for Aston Villa.",
      "",
      "It was thought that Nagelsmann was only passing through international football and that he would be looking for a return to club management after the European Championships on home soil last year.",
      "But he then extended his stay to next summer’s World Cup, and subsequently signed a contract to manage Germany at Euro 2028. Presumably, he’s having a whale of time.",
      "So United would struggle to get the one-time coaching prodigy away from managing his country, especially given the mess he would be walking in to. That’s that then.",
      "",
      "The German won the FA Cup with Crystal Palace – a marvellous achievement that makes him an Eagles legend. Beating City also made him pretty popular at United. But it doesn’t make him qualified to put out the Old Trafford bin fire.",
      "Those lobbying for Glasner also point to the fact that he’s had success with 3-4-2-1, which Amorim is more wedded to than his wife. But Glasner would suffer the same as Amorim from the woeful lack of a midfielder than holds the system together.",
      "Doubtless Glasner would deserve a step up if he was to leave Selhurst Park. But there would have to be a bridging club between Palace and United.",
      "",
      "Much of what we think about Glasner applies to Iraola too. The Spaniard has done a wonderful job with Bournemouth. But Manchester United – especially THIS Manchester United – is a different proposition altogether.",
      "Iraola’s success at Bournemouth has come from high-press, high octane football. Which we know the current United squad is not built for.",
      "Would he get the time and breathing space to get them up to speed? Not a f***ing chance.",
      "",
      "Emery has already curried favour at Old Trafford by relieving United of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. Though that goodwill must be tempered by concerns over the Spaniard’s judgement if he really believed signing Sancho to be a good idea.",
      "Emery has done a very fine job at Villa, taking a once-proud club flirting with relegation back in to the Champions League, all the while dealing with restrictive budgets and an unsustainable wage bill.",
      "Which makes Emery an ideal candidate. And given the general feeling of uneasiness at Villa Park right now, the timing could be perfect.",
      "But, for reasons we’re struggling to explain, it’s a very difficult proposition to get excited about. Perhaps it is the memory of his attempt at succeeding Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, from which he has bounced back from superbly. His subsequent body of work at Villarreal and Villa has restored his reputation. And no one at Old Trafford should be looking down their nose at the 53-year-old. So any lack of anticipation would probably say more about United’s perception of themselves than it does about Emery.",
      "🚨 Top 10 available managers: Nuno to be in demand as ex-Man Utd bosses seek jobs…",
      "",
      "Pochettino has had his fingers burned by United before, who might have hired the Argentine to replace as many as three of their previous managers. But every time, they have gone in a different direction.",
      "All of which led Pochettino to the United States job. And it is very difficult to imagine him walking away from that gig less than a year from hosting a World Cup.",
      "But not impossible. It seems that Pochettino and the United States remain to be convinced by each other, and if United finally make a serious play for the former Spurs, PSG and Chelsea boss, he might be tempted. He might also fancy telling them to shove it after multiple missed opportunities in the past.",
      "Out of sheer curiosity, we would be up for this.",
      "",
      "“I won’t coach in the next year, for sure. I’m certain of that,” said Southgate. A year ago…",
      "The ex-England boss doesn’t spark much excitement among United fans. Actually, we’re not sure he prompts any. But in that respect, he’s in very good company on this dreary list.",
      "His brand of football with England was hardly swashbuckling, but that is not what United need right now. First they have to stiffen up before they can zhuzh it up.",
      "Had his mate Dan Ashworth not been binned after 20 minutes as sporting director, Southgate may already have been fitted for his club blazer. And he is one of very few among the candidates who have experience with the level of scrutiny being United boss brings.",
      "On paper, after his success with England – let’s not pretend his record makes him anything else – Southgate has the credentials. He’s available and, according to his own timetable, he should be good to go. After the tacticians, maybe it’s time for the statesman.",
      "",
      "Xavi has already managed one giant basket case. Quite successfully too. While juggling financial levers, the Catalan guided his boyhood team to the La Liga title in his first full season in charge.",
      "He left after his second, initially of his own accord then the club’s, and Xavi spent last season on sabbatical. The 45-year-old is ready, though, for his next gig having used his break to broaden his coaching horizons.",
      "Yeah, why not? Xavi has a track record with one of the game’s big beasts and as one of the greatest midfielders in the modern game, his playing career ought to make him beyond reproach among the players.",
      "Are those late Liverpool winners sustainable after all? Unlike Arsenal, this Liverpool side are never boring.",
      "Manchester United will be weighing up the ‘eye-watering’ severance fee due to Ruben Amorim, but it wouldn’t even be in the top ten biggest manager pay-offs.",
      "There is no point pretending we didn’t all laugh at Newcastle this summer, but they have emerged from that mess stronger and Eddie Howe has what he needs.",
      "If given a choice between Mainoo and Amorim right now, most would surely side with the guy who’s already proven himself at Manchester United.",
      "Solskjaer to replace Amorim at Man Utd? Hey, he ‘knows the club’. But he also did the first time. Also, what happened to Lampard at Chelsea again?",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble."

      "",
      "With the realisation having finally dawned about halfway into a three-year contract that Emery and Arsenal were incompatible, the decision was made to part and replace the Spaniard with the far more suitable manager whose appointment they bottled in the first place.",
      "",
      "It should forever go down as one of the more absurdly diabolical managerial succession plans in history. Manchester United let Ten Hag survive an internal review, oversee another £200m worth of signings he wanted or had previously worked with, sacked him a couple of months into the season and somehow found someone even worse to take his job.",
      "",
      "Even though the Russian Football Union was in significant debt to the point that billionaire Alisher Usmanov had loaned them £3.9m for some unpaid wages owed to Capello, it was felt that one of the more financially lucrative contracts in international football should have been worth more than a dreadful start to Euro 2016 qualifying which put Russia eight points behind Austria and four off the pace of Sweden in their group.",

      "It looks like Ruben Amorim has picked a fight with the wrong man in Kobbie Mainoo, who’s up on points despite barely raising a fist and won’t need to do much more to land a knockout Manchester United blow.",
      "A video of Pep Guardiola putting his hands on his head as Mainoo diddled Phil Foden before nutmegging Nico Gonzalez to launch a Manchester United attack has been doing the rounds this week, suggesting the Manchester City manager may actually be more appreciative of the 20-year-old’s talents than the man currently in control of his career. And our friends at TEAMtalk reported on Wednesday that that may indeed be the case.",
      "‘TEAMtalk understands that Pep Guardiola, widely regarded as one of the game’s finest tacticians, views Mainoo as one of England’s brightest prospects.",
      "‘While transfers between Man Utd and Man City are rare, Guardiola’s admiration could make this a situation worth monitoring closely.’",
      "Mainoo’s teammates are ‘perplexed’ at him being sidelined by Amorim, Gary Lineker is “really worried” about him being “dismissed” and “baffled” by him not starting, and so too is Owen Hargreaves, who quite rightly said he was United’s “best player by a country mile” having come off the bench at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim believes he’s “helping” Mainoo, but it’s hard to see how and the academy graduate must be similarly confused as to why he’s not playing in a team performing so poorly. Just how bad do they have to be for him to be given a fair chance?",
      "He’s been told by Amorim that it’s either him or Bruno Fernandes, but we refuse to accept that Mainoo – ill-suited or not – would fail to do a better job alongside the Manchester United captain than competition winner Manuel Ugarte. And what has Fernandes done to merit his spot in the team over him other than scoring a last-minute penalty against Burnley?",
      "Mainoo is currently the second biggest stick to beat Amorim with aside from his failing philosophy and formation. It works in Mainoo’s favour with regard to his supporters and champions that his absence from the team is directly linked to that system, and very much against Amorim in the minds of those believing he should be sacked by Manchester United. Not only are they terrible, but there’s no place in the team for someone deemed by many to be the future of the club. It’s not a good look.",
      "United may have been a mess before Amorim arrived, but Mainoo was brilliant, for them and then for England at Euro 2024, and his cameo against City goes to show that very same dynamic, skilful player is still in there.",
      "It remains to be seen whether it’s a performance which will push Amorim to stick him in the starting lineup against Chelsea, but that surely won’t be the case if he sticks to his either/or stance vs Fernandes. He’s not about to drop the United captain.",
      "The obvious suggestion amid United’s poor start to the season and the decision not to grant Mainoo’s wish to leave the club on loan at the end of the transfer window is that he need only wait out Amorim to play regular football again.",
      "Guardiola’s admiration, along with longstanding interest from Chelsea, links to Real Madrid and recent rumours of a January move for his services by Newcastle suggests Amorim is one of very few managers not valuing Mainoo’s quality enough to rely on him as a key cog in a starting lineup.",
      "Most, we suspect, would be building the team around him.",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "Solskjaer to replace Amorim at Man Utd? Hey, he ‘knows the club’. But he also did the first time. Also, what happened to Lampard at Chelsea again?",
      "Manchester United have been told to sell Bruno Fernandes and build around Kobbie Mainoo, but they face the ‘most excruciating’ outcome.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "It’s a rollercoaster of emotions for Manchester United fans today with ‘music to their ears’ here and ‘more embarrassment’ there."

      "“It’s a pretty easy decision. This is my club. I have a lot of emotions and feelings. I’ve come with a belief I can come and help the cause until the end of the season. I’ll give my utmost to give the fans what they want.”",
      "Not the imagined words of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when he takes back the Manchester United reins during the October international break, but those of Frank Lampard in April 2023 as he returned for an interim spell at Chelsea two years after his sacking, for a two-month nightmare which should serve as a warning to the man now being mentioned as a possible replacement for Ruben Amorim.",
      "“This is the worst Man United team I’ve seen,” Jamie O’Hara said on talkSPORT. “Honestly. I can’t believe Ruben Amorim is still in charge, honestly, when are they going to let it go?",
      "“When are they going to just…do what Sheffield United have done, just swallow their pride [and say] ‘we got this wrong?’ Get Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] back…get Ole back in. They can’t carry on doing this. They’ll go down. They’ll be playing Rotherham next season.”",
      "We can understand why Solskjaer would be seen as an attractive short-term appointment by some fans. What you could never say about his Manchester United is that they weren’t entertaining. His tactics board featured no coloured magnets and simply had ‘United Way’ written on it in permanent marker, with the old ‘go out there and express yourselves’ mantra clearly evident in what was some fantastic football to watch at times. The best since Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Sure, “Ole’s at the wheel” was shouted back at them by goading scousers when Liverpool spanked them 5-0 at Old Trafford, but for a fair while the Manchester United fans chanted it with nothing but joy in their hearts at seeing one of their favourite sons leading them by playing a similar – if significantly less polished and gritty – style to that which saw him win nine major trophies in his playing career at Old Trafford.",
      "There’s no chance United would offer him anything but an interim role until the end of the season. Like Lampard upon his return to Chelsea having been sacked by Everton, Solskjaer is currently picking up the pieces of his managerial career after just 29 games in charge of Besiktas. And as evidenced by him not being good enough the first time, there’s only so much benefit to ‘knowing the club’.",
      "United hiring a manager whom they’ve already sacked once would be a bad look. But it wasn’t the INEOS regime that got rid of him and assuming they won’t make the same grave ‘now or never’ ultimatum error to force Amorim to take permanent charge mid-season, we could absolutely see them plumping for an appointment in a bid to get the fans back onside, with that fanciful ‘Manchester United DNA’ so far removed from the current football being played that it’s no longer even part of the ‘what’s wrong with United’ rhetoric.",
      "Solskjaer would also usher in the return of 4-3-3, which may be United’s best bet of getting back into Europe with the current crop of players, many of whom have now taken against Amorim’s doomed formation and philosophy, and would presumably welcome Solskjaer’s – let’s call it fluid – style.",
      "But we would urge Solksjaer when asking himself ‘why wouldn’t I?’ to consider Lampard at Chelsea.",
      "“I’m not getting ahead of myself,” Lampard said when asked about what the future might hold at the end of the 2022/2023 season. “I want to do the best I can to impact the club in this period and we will see what happens afterwards.”",
      "He arrived believing it possible he would be handed a permanent contract. He won one and lost eight of his 11 games in charge and Chelsea scored just nine goals, and left that role with many of us wondering whether that would be that for him in management before showing his worth at Championship level with Coventry.",
      "We imagine Solskjaer is poised for the United call. We can’t imagine a world in which he refuses an offer to return. But while the worst outcome for United would be another terrible season, the worst for him would be the demolition of an already broken reputation, and the best merely a few months of paid work and the Stretford End chanting his name before he’s out on his ear looking for further employment.",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "If given a choice between Mainoo and Amorim right now, most would surely side with the guy who’s already proven himself at Manchester United.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford.",

      "According to reports, FC Barcelona have a clear stance on whether to sign Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford permanently next year.",
      "In the summer window, Rashford secured a dream move to join Barcelona as the Spanish giants settled on a loan with a buy option deal with Man Utd.",
      "Barcelona were tempted to sign Rashford after he returned to form during his impressive loan spell at Aston Villa, in which he grabbed four goals and six assists in all competitions.",
      "Raphinha and Lamine Yamal sparkled for Barcelona last season, but Barcelona’s priority in this summer’s window was to sign a new attacker to provide competition for places.",
      "Hansi Flick’s side eventually settled on Rashford as their preferred target after missing out on Luis Diaz and Nico Williams, with the England international’s versatility mooted as a key factor behind the decision to sign him.",
      "READ: Man Utd suffer ‘more embarrassment’ as Amorim ‘impacted’ and ‘cash windfall’ imminent",
      "However, the 27-year-old has endured a slow start at Barcelona as he has only registered one goal involvement in his first four appearances.",
      "This has fuelled speculation that he could return to Man Utd in 2026, though a new report in Spain claims he is part of their plans moving forward.",
      "It is suggested that Barcelona already have a ‘priority 2026 plan’ regarding signings as they want a winger, a centre-back and a ‘galactico’.",
      "The report claims Rashford currently stands out as an obvious option for the wing and they would be willing to ‘pay’ to sign him on one condition.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘The second focus is on the wing. The club reserves the option of signing Marcus Rashford permanently if his loan agreement goes through this season. The Englishman is popular for his power, dribbling, and versatility, and if he maintains a high-level season, Barça will seriously consider paying the 30 million euro option. This would ensure an attacking trident with Lamine Yamal and Raphinha as their strike partners.’",
      "Elsewhere, it is noted that Julian Alvarez and Erling Haaland are their main options to be their next ‘galactico’, though the Man City superstar is their ‘ultimate dream’ signing.",
      "Regarding Barcelona’s interest in these players, the report adds:",
      "‘Haaland is the ultimate dream: he would be the signing that would define an era at Camp Nou. However, his signing is presented as a highly difficult transaction due to competition from other European giants and the financial implications. Meanwhile, the option of Julián Álvarez appears to be a more realistic option: young, versatile, and with elite experience, he could fit perfectly into Flick’s model.’",
      "Amad and Lisandro Martinez are both among the highest scorers in Premier League games against the Big Six in the current Manchester United squad.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona would be given an ‘unexpected window’ to sign Manchester City sensation Erling Haaland on one key condition.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has revealed whether he’d rather have Erling Haaland or Kylian Mbappe with the Manchester City star “blitzing” teams like he did Manchester United.",
      "Man City striker Erling Haaland has become an ‘obsession’ for Barcelona president Joan Laporta as he looks to bring in a new forward, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd were given more indications over the weekend that they could be the problem as Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana shone out on loan.",

      "According to reports, a Manchester United ‘midfielder transfer’ is ‘gaining momentum’ ahead of the winter transfer window for four reasons.",
      "Man Utd had a mixed summer transfer window as they invested around £230m on signings, landing Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens.",
      "The Red Devils also offloaded several unwanted stars, including Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund.",
      "However, Ruben Amorim‘s side did not land all of their desired targets as their failure to sign Brighton standout Carlos Baleba means they are lacking a top-tier No.6.",
      "This means that rival Premier League clubs have found it easy to play through Man Utd, who sit 14th in the Premier League after only winning one of their opening four matches.",
      "READ: Amorim to be sacked by Man Utd on one condition with players ‘perplexed’ at Mainoo decision",
      "Therefore, Man Utd’s January transfer priority will be to sign a centre-midfielder, though they are linked with alternatives to Baleba.",
      "Crystal Palace standout Adam Wharton has also been mentioned as a possible target, while former Wolves star Ruben Neves is a left-field option.",
      "The 28-year-old was heavily linked with several Big Six clubs before he left Wolves to join Al-Hilal in 2023, though a possible move to Man Utd has been mooted in recent weeks.",
      "Now, a report from journalist Mark Brus for The Daily Briefing has revealed an ‘interesting update’ on Neves to Man Utd, with this transfer ‘gaining momentum’ for four reasons.",
      "Neves is said to be ‘open to offers’ and ‘willing to return to the Premier League, while Man Utd boss Amorim is a “fan”.",
      "A ‘trustworthy source’ told Brus: “There’s the Portuguese connection there, and he’s seen as someone who would adapt well and fit in to Amorim’s system.”",
      "Another factor in Man Utd’s favour is that Neves could leave Al-Hilal ‘on the cheap’, though they do face competition from other Premier League sides.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Newcastle and Tottenham will also likely be in contention as long-time admirers of Neves, but there’s also a particularly strong interest from United boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "‘My source added that Neves could also move on the cheap, perhaps as little as €20m, which will likely make him a tempting market opportunity. Still, it’s worth emphasising that there haven’t been any talks yet, or any offers made, so it’s just one to keep an eye on.’",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "If given a choice between Mainoo and Amorim right now, most would surely side with the guy who’s already proven himself at Manchester United.",
      "Solskjaer to replace Amorim at Man Utd? Hey, he ‘knows the club’. But he also did the first time. Also, what happened to Lampard at Chelsea again?",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",

      "The return of European football this week means the phony war phase of the 25/26 season is over and real test now begins with a diet of two games a week the order of the day for all the big clubs apart from Manchester United between now and the Busy Festive Period.",
      "Squad depth inevitably becomes a key factor over these next few months, so let’s take the opportunity to rank the Premier League’s ‘Big Eight’ based on their preparedness for the task.",
      "Obviously Manchester United don’t really belong here, but it’s still fun to look at their second XI anyway, isn’t it? Shut up, it is. And let us tell you this: it’s just as well they haven’t got two games a week.",
      "There are, inevitably, fudges here. There is not really such a thing as ‘first XI’ and ‘second XI’ in the modern squad game. So just try and remember that it’s all a bit of fun, yeah? A distraction from the bad things that happen.",
      "Among the biggest fudges we’ve made are those around injured players. On the one hand it felt daft to include, say, James Maddison even in a hypothetical Tottenham team. But at the same time it seemed silly to deny ourselves Noni Madueke in Arsenal’s back-up XI just because Bukayo Saka is out for a few weeks.",
      "The rough rule of thumb is that injured players expected to be back before 2026 are included; those not expected to be seen until next year are not.",

      "And while we do think it’s past time they stopped whingeing about PSR and got on with it, it’s still easy enough to share or at least understand their frustration. The Thursday-Sunday workload for a team that have already made an alarmingly poor Premier League start could be killer looking at this lack of squad depth. We’ve had to include more injured players than would ideally have been the case as well, although that does at least mean we all avoid the indignity of Lindelof in midfield. Every cloud.",

      "The midfield looks a touch flimsy, and goals may well be the problem for this team. We also retain the right to change this team about a bit once we know how exactly Newcastle plan to deploy Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa, but our current best guess is that both are in that first-choice XI, which does at least give this underpowered Newcastle team a couple of useful wide players.",

In the real world, of course, one imagines he’d sooner actually deploy Casemiro back there than go with two rookies flanking poor old Harry Maguire, but it only shifts the problem elsewhere with Lisandro Martinez out of contention for the foreseeable.",
      "Diogo Dalot being in the second XI feels like a quirk given he nearly always plays when available, but it does always feel like that’s because he’s actually first reserve in about six different positions rather than first choice anywhere.",

      "Can argue around the fringes of a few of these, especially Gittens v Garnacho, but it’s a solid enough team. As it ought to be for the BlueCo Player Trading Facility. It’s going to feel very odd when Liam Delap is fit again and Chelsea have two actual strikers to choose from.",
      "What does quickly become clear with a lot of these second XIs is that the defence is very often the primary cause of concern, and that’s definitely the case here. Doesn’t help when even your first-choice keeper is no confidence-inspirer, mind.",

That means poor old Archie Gray gets shoehorned into this fictitious team just as he was shoehorned into so many actual Spurs teams last season.",
      "Ben Davies as a first reserve in big 2025 is a hilarious situation, and Spurs fans will just have to keep everything crossed that Frankball continues to place far less stress on Micky van de Ven’s twangy hamstrings than Angeball did.",
      "Further forward… it’s not too bad, although Xavi Simons’ status as the only real lock-picker in the long-term absence of both Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison leaves a front four where perspiration would appear to significantly outdo inspiration.",
      "We’ve had to go for a 4-2-3-1 here rather than Frank’s preferred 4-3-3 just on a numbers game; and even then we’ve had to include the apparently discarded Yves Bissouma, who was not named in Spurs’ Champions League squad.",

      "If you want an XI with more creative oomph, then Oscar Bobb could come in for O’Reilly and turn it into more of a 4-2-3-1, we guess. But the front three is good fun regardless. So it balances out. Kind of.",

      "It has been a bewildering decade or so for goalkeepers caught in a Pep-prompted identity crisis. But Guardiola may finally have brought some relief for keepers at all levels still confused as to who and what they really are.",
      "It was already brewing around 2016, but the public’s perception of goalkeepers really became skewed when Guardiola rocked up at the Etihad and immediately binned Joe Hart. At that point, Hart was still England no.1 and widely regarded as one of Europe’s top goalkeepers.",
      "A playmaker, though, he was not. So out he went for Claudio Bravo. The Chilean took the form of a hologram when his goal was being targeted, but he could spray passes for fun.",
      "Guardiola found the necessary balance at Benfica. From there he bought Ederson in 2017, since when coaches across the land have sought to imitate the City boss by turning their keepers into quarter-backs.",
      "It was entirely reasonable to demand more from goalkeepers in possession. But by that point, no No.1 had ever reached the top level without a solid grounding in the basics. Pep came a quarter of a century after the back-pass ban in 1992 which was genuinely seismic for goalkeepers in comparison to what the Guardiola movement demanded.",
      "Still, keepers have endured a disorienting time in recent years. At all levels, they have so often been judged more on their feet than their hands. Which ignores the primary purpose of a goalkeeper entirely.",
      "Maybe for many it was a matter of convenience. Judging a goalkeeper is very difficult – coaching one even more so – when you have no knowledge of the position. Why learn about the role when you can change it to something else closer to what you’re already familiar with?",
      "Mercifully, the man who prompted a million p*ss-poor imitations may be redressing the balance himself. For goalkeepers particularly, Guardiola’s signing of Gianluigi Donnarumma could be as influential as the slinging of Joe Hart.",
      "There should be some caution over reading too much into Donnarumma’s arrival since it was clearly an opportunistic move on City’s part. Even up to the first weekend of the season, Ederson was staying and he would compete with James Trafford. The chance to sign one of the world’s best goalkeepers was, evidently, too good to miss. Though not if you’re Manchester United.",
      "But it does give an insight into Guardiola’s instinct and the way he sees the game going.",
      "“He is so tall, he is so huge. From all the keepers, what we want is safe balls, give confidence to the team, have personality and a big presence.”",
      "In goalkeeping terms, those are almost old-school traits. But as necessary now as they ever were with so many teams at the top level opting to take a more direct route, with long throw-ins and set-pieces slung under the bar back in vogue.",
      "The Goalkeepers’ Union is yet to elect its first spokesperson – who would that be? – but reports from the ground suggest the feeling in the ranks is one of relief. Where Guardiola goes, others inevitably follow, so perhaps the obsession with goalkeepers being playmakers might diminish to a more reasonable balance.",
      "That’s a positive thing for everyone, right? Who among us wants to watch a formulaic, overly-prescriptive game where goalkeepers and centre-backs spend much, much more time on the ball than the attacking players? Supporters don’t show up for rondos in their own box while the flair players stand high and wide on the off-chance a centre-back can beat a rabid press. Do they?",
      "That absolutely isn’t to dismiss entirely the idea of building from the back. The principle is sound – especially if you are Guardiola with City’s players to put it into practise. But somewhere along the line, it became the only way to play.",
      "That saturation point, thankfully, seems to have passed. Managers at all levels, from the Premier League down through the EFL to the park, if not ditching the theory completely are choosing their moments far more wisely. Many are again embracing the direct route. To the point that the cycle perhaps might again take us on Route One to POMO football.",
      "We don’t want those methods across the board in the same way that building from the back should not be forced on absolutely everyone; football needs different styles, rather than being the homogeneous lump it threatened to become while everyone jumped aboard Pep’s bandwagon.",
      "From a goalkeeper’s perspective, there remains some way to go before the world has properly healed. After all, when Donnarumma became available in the summer, there was a queue of just one, rather than the clamour there ought to have been to land one of the greats in his prime. His wages, of course, were a factor, but too many still overlooked his shot-stopping genius because he’s not passing like Pirlo.",
      "Guardiola can see past that, so it should not be long before everyone else has their priorities straight too.",
      "Are those late Liverpool winners sustainable after all? Unlike Arsenal, this Liverpool side are never boring.",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "Manchester United will be weighing up the ‘eye-watering’ severance fee due to Ruben Amorim, but it wouldn’t even be in the top ten biggest manager pay-offs.",

      "Amorim looks to be on the brink at Man Utd, who have only won one of their opening five games across all competitions this season.",
      "Under Amorim, Man Utd reached an embarrassing new low last season as they finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to win a trophy.",
      "Despite this, Amorim was not criticised too harshly as he joined Man Utd mid-season, while it was always going to take time for him to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation.",
      "Still, Amorim needed a strong start to this campaign to silence his critics, but the opposite has happened and he’s currently the second favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked.",
      "READ: Amorim to be sacked by Man Utd on one condition with players ‘perplexed’ at Mainoo decision",
      "The pressure on Amorim has increased in the days following Sunday’s one-sided 3-0 loss against arch-rivals Manchester City, and he needs a result when Man Utd face Chelsea on Saturday.",
      "Ahead of this game, a report from The Mirror claims Amorim has been given ‘three games to save his job’, with upcoming matches against Chelsea, Brentford and Chelsea said to be pivotal.",
      "‘Despite privately insisting they still have faith in Amorim, United’s football leadership team gave the same assurances to Erik ten Hag, before pulling the plug on him nine league games into last season.",
      "‘United’s league fixture with Sunderland will be their eighth of the season and Amorim is acutely aware he will continue to come under fire and test the faith of those who hired him if he cannot take the team on a winning run.’",
      "The same report names ‘five candidates to replace Amorim’, with Crystal Palace’s Oliver Glasner, former England head coach Gareth Southgate, Fulham’s Marco Silva, Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola and current USA head coach Mauricio Pochettino mentioned.",
      "Spanish outlet Fichajes, meanwhile, have outlandishly claimed that they have ‘found a replacement’, with former boss Jose Mourinho appealing to club chiefs for three reasons.",
      "The Portuguese coach, currently free after his abrupt departure from Fenerbahçe, is beginning to be strongly considered as an alternative to take over the coaching job. His experience, knowledge of the Premier League, and past at United place him in a prime position to return.",
      "‘He also left behind a divisive streak in the dressing room and a complicated relationship with the board. Still, many believe his strong character could be just what a club in crisis needs to get back on track.’",
      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "Manchester United will be weighing up the ‘eye-watering’ severance fee due to Ruben Amorim, but it wouldn’t even be in the top ten biggest manager pay-offs.",
      "If given a choice between Mainoo and Amorim right now, most would surely side with the guy who’s already proven himself at Manchester United.",
      "Solskjaer to replace Amorim at Man Utd? Hey, he ‘knows the club’. But he also did the first time. Also, what happened to Lampard at Chelsea again?",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Manchester United have been “blamed” for one Red Devils star becoming a “sacrificial lamb” during his time at Old Trafford."

      "Manchester United shares dropped by eight per cent in trading in response on the New York Stock Exchange, but rebounded to finish 6.28 per cent down at $15.38 (£11.29).",
      "United still saw revenue marginally increase by 0.7 per cent to £666.5m, with the accounts for the year ending June 30, 2025 showing their operating loss fell from £69.3m to £18.4m compared to the previous 12 months.",
      "United bosses have hailed their five-year shirt sponsorship with Snapdragon as the most valuable of its kind in world sport, and that played a significant role in boosting revenues with four years remaining on that deal.",
      "United posted record commercial revenues of £333.3m while achieving record matchday revenues of £160.3m.",
      "Overall losses dropped from £113.2m to £33m after co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe oversaw a raft of cost-cutting measures.",
      "The accounts show total operating expenses were £733.6m, a decrease of £34.9m, or 4.5 per cent, and employee expenses by 14.1 per cent, or £51.5m, to £313.2m.",
      "This was achieved by several high-earning players, who were not part of the first-team plans, going out on loan or being sold, and wider club restructuring. More than 250 members of staff at Old Trafford were made redundant in the first round of cuts.",
      "The club said they spent £36.6m in terms of exceptional items, which included pay-offs to employees as part of their \"transformation plan\" along with former boss Erik ten Hag and his staff.",
      "The results released on Wednesday showed broadcasting revenue for the 12 months ending June 30, 2025 decreased by £48.9m to £172.9m after the men's team played in the Europa League rather than the Champions League.",
      "More cost-cutting and difficult decisions are expected as INEOS completes its restructuring of the football club.",
      "Ratcliffe warned United would have gone \"bust at Christmas\" if they had not taken \"really tough decisions\" - something chief executive Omar Berrada believes will help moving forwards.",
      "\"As we settle into the 2025/26 season, we are working hard to improve the club in all areas,\" he said.",
      "\"On the field, we are pleased with the additions we have made to our men's and women's first-team squads over the summer, as we build for the long term.",
      "\"Off the field, we are emerging from a period of structural and leadership change with a refreshed, streamlined organisation equipped to deliver on our sporting and commercial objectives.",

      "\"As we start to feel the benefits of our cost-reduction programme, there is significant potential for improved financial performance, which will, in turn, support our overriding priority: success on the pitch.\"",
      "United are expecting the next financial year to bring in revenue of £640m to £660m despite being without European football for the first time since 2014/15.",
      "\"The Manchester United bosses will be pleased with these figures, which they will feel show real progress towards cutting costs and growing revenues. But theirs is a long-term plan to rejuvenate and regenerate the club, and while record revenues show that the club still has a huge commercial pull as one of the biggest in world football, fans shouldn't think that will mean bumper spending in the January window, or next summer.",
      "\"Deloitte said in January that United was the fourth biggest club in the world, only behind Real Madrid, Manchester City and PSG in terms of revenue. These latest figures will show that they have maintained that strong position, despite their worst performance on the pitch since 1974, when the club was relegated. A lack of Champions League football and a 15th-placed finish in the league cost them tens of millions of pounds.",
      "\"But the chief executive's statement has made the strategy clear: make United more and more commercially successful, and in future, there will be more and more funds to invest in the football squad, which they hope and believe will then lead to better results on the pitch, and a return to the days when they won trophies.",
      "\"We should not forget the underlying financial problems that United have, however, been brought about by the Glazer family takeover in the early 2000s.",
      "\"That 'leveraged buy-out' effectively lumped £790m of debt onto the club, which the Glazers used to buy a controlling stake at Old Trafford.",
      "\"These latest figures show that debt has reduced somewhat (by around £39m to £471.9m), but that reduction is because of a change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar, rather than any of the debt being specifically paid off.",
      "\"In addition, the \"revolving credit facility\" that the club has (in effect, like a personal credit card) now has £165.1m of additional debt on it - up from £35.6m last year.",
      "\"While the record revenues and reduced losses are no doubt a sign that United are making impressive commercial strides off the pitch, the Glazer debt and the continued under-performance of the team on the pitch are two nagging negatives.\"",

      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 13:03, UK",
      "It is four years ago now that Nicky Butt made headlines for his claim that Declan Rice is no better than Scott McTominay. While Butt acknowledges that the England midfielder has improved since then, there is more respect on McTominay's name now too.",
      "McTominay was the driving force behind Napoli's Serie A title win last season, scoring a dozen goals and winning the competition's player of the year award. It has made a mockery of the notion that he was not good enough to be a Manchester United player.",
      "\"Scott is an amazing person. He is a really great lad.\" Butt, who made 387 appearances for United, including one in the 1999 Champions League final, knows him well. He was an academy coach at United when McTominay broke through. \"He had it tough,\" he adds.",
      "\"He had a lot of growing problems, a lot of injuries.\" That growth spurt has been well documented. \"Back in the day, he was only small and slight.\" But his great strength was his resolve. \"His determination and his drive, you could not ever question,\" says Butt.",
      "\"Scott would be the first to sit here and say he was not the most gifted and talented footballer on the planet, which I wasn't, Roy Keane wasn't. But when you've got that kind of drive, which Scott has and obviously Roy had, you get yourself through the levels.",
      "\"And that is what Scott has done. Scott had the disappointment of leaving Man Utd, I felt that was wrong to let him go because he is one of your own, he would run through brick walls for you, a Manchester United fan from a family of Manchester United fans.\"",
      "McTominay returns to Manchester this week to play against City in the Champions League on Thursday. United themselves are not in European competition. \"It is the same old thing,\" says Butt. \"You don't know what you have got until you've not got it.\"",
      "He adds: \"He is a god in Napoli now. You go there and his picture is on all the walls. It is great. He has earned all that. He has grafted, worked hard, had knockbacks and fair play to him he is a player now. If he'd stayed, he might have stagnated and never got better.\"",
      "Indeed, Butt believes that even the famous Class of '92 would have struggled in the current climate. He made his Premier League debut alongside Bryan Robson in midfield with Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister behind him, Brian McClair and Mark Hughes ahead.",
      "\"Everybody talks about our group,\" says Butt of a crop of talent that included Paul Scholes and David Beckham. \"If we had been brought into this environment now, you would never have heard of us. We would have played seven, eight, nine or 10 games.\"",
      "Why is that? \"We got brought into a football team that was successful with world-class players but more importantly world-class professionals, good men. They made us, really. Trust me, it was more the fact that we had professionals around,\" he explains.",
      "\"When you come into a football club it is hard enough to put one young lad into a team. If you have not got real men to look after you then you will struggle. If we had got into this group now together, we would not have survived, we would have had a nightmare.\"",
      "Nicky Butt came close to making his own move abroad in 2004 when he was a target for Real Madrid. \n\n\n“I had a conversation with the club and they said that if you can find the right club for yourself and Manchester United then you can go. So I started looking around. Carlos Queiroz was Real Madrid manager at the time, he wanted me.”\n\n\nButt went as far as getting a passport sorted for his dog. “I am a big dog man so I made sure they were coming straight away. But it never transpired.” Sir Alex Ferguson decided to block the move.\n\n\n“Player power was not around then but even if it was I was not the kind of bloke to kick up too much of a fuss. I went to Newcastle which was an amazing club and I enjoyed my time there.”",
      "Speaking ahead of the launch of his new podcast with Scholes, The Good, The Bad and The Football, United's ongoing malaise is a recurring theme of the conversation. Having worked in United's academy between 2012 and 2021, Butt saw this unfolding up close.",
      "It remains a source of frustration. \"The worst thing you can do is bury your head in the sand,\" he says of City's rise to become the destination of choice in Manchester. \"Kids saw other clubs coming to them with better facilities. It was a massive pull for them.",
      "\"All over the country, academies upped their game. At Manchester United, we got a bit lacklustre, thinking we were the biggest and the best and did not have to go out and do all the things that the others were doing, but you have to stay on top of your game.\"",
      "Given his prominent role, could he not have arrested that slide himself? \"You're a small cog in a big machine.\" In 2021, he walked away. \"There were things happening at the club where there were people with different philosophies to what I was brought up on.\"",
      "An example. The separation between the academy and the senior players annoyed him. \"Young kids are moving further away from the first team,\" he says. \"I did not agree with the idea that the first team gets everything there and everyone else is on the other side.\"",
      "It was far removed from his own experience as a young player. \"When I was coming into the first team, I knew Brian Robson. I knew Mark Hughes. I knew Peter Schmeichel. I knew Brian McClair. All these superstars that you have on your wall,\" he says.",
      "\"Three years earlier I was at school. But I knew them because I was having dinner with them every day. I was training with them every day. And there was one big family. And when you go into the first team, they know your name and you know how they play.",
      "\"I could not ever imagine playing in front of 75,000 people and not even knowing who these people are. I think they have got to be a lot more together, a lot tighter. And my way, I felt, was changing. That was because other people were coming in from outside.\"",
      "If the sense is of Butt being wistful about United's past, do not mistake him for a sentimentalist. His take on the prospect of the club's proud record of having an academy graduate in every squad for 88 years and counting might just surprise.",
      "\"I'm a bit 50-50 with that. Unless you are bringing players in who are going to play for the club for years, it's pointless because anybody can put someone on the bench from the academy. They don't have to be good enough, it is just to keep the tradition going.",
      "\"If it is someone who you are putting on like Kobbie Mainoo or some of the other names that you can throw about, where you know they are a real player, an international who is going to improve the team and be there for the longevity, then that's brilliant.",
      "\"But if you are just going to bring in little Billy from the under-16s, who is nowhere near the level and you are just doing it to keep the tradition, it can be false, that. It is a bit of a sham. You have to be brave enough to go against the tradition. It will happen one day.\"",
      "United's future remains a fascination. And Butt, one of their own, is not optimistic that Benjamin Sesko can change their fortunes. He argues that it is not fair to expect too much of him. \"I hope he goes and gets the golden boot this year but it is highly unlikely.\"",
      "He is more encouraged by the investment in the training ground. \"The fundamentals of any club have to be solid.\" But how long until the title returns? \"That is the big question, isn't it? My heart says one thing,\" concludes Butt. \"My head says something else.\"",

      "Also, The Magic Man discusses Arsenal's Premier League title hopes after their 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest and Liverpool's interesting start to the season after Mohamed Salah's late penalty got them out of jail at Burnley.",
      "Read on for Merson's thoughts in full...",
      "Ruben Amorim, the way he wants to play, is a worry.",
      "He won't change. He'll look at it and say 'I've got where I am today by playing the way I play', using three at the back and high wing-backs.",
      "He would have been a perfect fit for Chelsea. They've got world-class wing-backs in Reece James and Malo Gusto, they've got the best holding midfield player in the league in Moises Caicedo. It would fit the players.",
      "You look at Man United and this system does not suit the squad they've got at all. The two wing-backs are nowhere near it, nowhere near good enough. And they are a big part of this formation working. No legs in midfield. Everything is up against him.",
      "You've got to be able to change now and then. You can tweak it, it's horses for courses, that doesn't mean you are abandoning your beliefs.",
      "I don't see them finishing anywhere near it this season, there's too much work to be done. They haven't got the quality.",
      "They were decent against Burnley, but it ends up 2-2 and they need a penalty in the last minute. Their best two players are Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha, they cannot afford to be missed.",
      "He still hasn't won back-to-back games in the league, nearly a year in. That's unthinkable for a club like Man Utd. Unthinkable.",
      "I just wish he would change it every now and then and adapt to the personnel he's got available. It's worrying because he doesn't know his best team, the back three don't even play together every week. He's been there a year, that's a big, big worry.",
      "It's a hard week for Arsenal.",
      "I thought they played really well against Nottingham Forest, a solid result. The performance showed their depth. No Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice was a sub, Martin Odegaard had to go off - it just showed their quality.",
      "If they get through these next couple of weeks, I see them as the team. They are the ones. If they get through these next couple of games, you go advantage Arsenal. They have got ample quality to win the league.",
      "They were very good against Liverpool. That's the most comfortable I've seen an Arsenal team at Anfield in 20 years. If it had ended 0-0 we would be saying 'who is going to touch Arsenal this season?'. Liverpool didn't look like scoring for toffee and then Dominik Szoboszlai scores a worldie from nothing.",
      "Noni Madueke needs to keep on performing, it's only just started.",
      "Arsenal play a certain way, he's been positive, but the way Arsenal play compared to Chelsea will suit him.",
      "Arsenal move the ball quicker, it goes into his feet quicker and then he's one-vs-one in a flash. Chelsea are slower, by the time the ball is moved out to the winger the other side have doubled up. Arsenal don't do that.",
      "He's done outstanding so far - his goal for England against Serbia was really good - better than what I thought. But this has got to go on for the rest of the season. So far, so good.",
      "I'm unsure about Liverpool. They should be mid-table. They've been gifted six points.",
      "They never looked like scoring against Arsenal, Newcastle last kick of the game, then Burnley a penalty in stoppage time. What Hannibal Mejbri is doing there I do not know. You could take six points off Liverpool and no one would have argued. No one would say 'oh that's a bit harsh, they were bang unlucky'. All three should have ended up as draws, and they would be mid-table.",
      "I'm not convinced yet. There is a lot of work for Arne Slot to do. I don't think this Florian Wirtz one is working. I like Wirtz, a terrific player, but teams are sitting back against Liverpool and it's so claustrophobic for him. Their midfield three, for me, won them the league last year. I thought Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Szoboszlai were outstanding for long parts, dominating midfields - I don't see that this season. Teams are getting at Liverpool.",
      "Alexander Isak has got to come in, you can have all the best players in the world but if they don't gel, it doesn't work. So they could be mid-table, but you could also say they haven't started playing yet and they have won every game. That's the sign of a very good team.",
      "It's not like Aston Villa have been unlucky, you can't say they have been peppering opposition goals and been unlucky not to score. It's a slow burner. It's shocked me, I thought they would be right up there. It's worrying times.",
      "They will be okay because I think the manager is outstanding, but they have been caught behind. They didn't bring in a forward, Ollie Watkins looks lost. Hopefully one comes off his backside and he goes on a run but Villa don't look like scoring and that's the worry.",
      "They don't look right. A lot of stuff happened in the market - clubs spent, Villa didn't. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were taken away, goals have dried up. And these are players that can make chances for other people as well, they aren't getting those anymore. I look at that Villa team and it doesn't inspire me.",
      "I'm a big fan of Unai Emery, and so if anyone can turn it around, he can.",

      "Amorim reiterated his commitment to it despite the result. \"I'm not going to change,\" he said. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is understood the club remain patient and have no plans to change their head coach. But can Amorim's three-at-the-back set-up still bring success to Old Trafford, or is it doomed to fail?",
      "Between the Lines returns with a look at his approach, a breakdown of how formations have evolved in the Premier League, and an examination of the system's issues at Manchester United.",
      "When Amorim says he won't change, history suggests he means it.",
      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Ruben Amorim has promised he won’t change his footballing philosophy and his bosses at Manchester United have no plans to change the head coach.",
      "The club has a long-term plan and while there is obvious and growing frustration with results, there will be no knee-jerk reaction or regular reassessment of the head coach's future after every defeat - however loud the noise grows from outside.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left 12 years ago, there have been two caretakers, and eight 'substantive' bosses. There is no desire to start afresh with a ninth.",
      "With four points from their opening four games, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also went out of the Carabao Cup - one of only three competitions they had the chance to win in 2025-26 - against Grimsby Town of League Two.",
      "This, after last season which saw their lowest ever Premier League points tally (42), and their most Premier League defeats (15).",
      "It is painful to watch. Amorim acknowledges and understands the supporters are hurting, but he says he is suffering still more as he battles to turn things around.",
      "He knows that his bosses are patient, and that they are realistic in their assessment that there are no quick fixes at Old Trafford. But there is also a recognition on all sides that currently things are far from good enough.",
      "There is no doubt Pep Guardiola's team definitively deserved the victory, and there is dismay at the three goals United conceded - with Erling Haaland's second a particularly tough one to swallow after the visitors vacated their entire defensive half to allow the Norwegian striker to run through unchecked.",
      "But there is pragmatism in the Old Trafford boardroom too recognising that, had Bryan Mbeumo's wondrous volley not been met with an equally wonderful Gianluigi Donnarumma save when the score was 2-0, or had Casemiro not missed a sitter at the back post later on in the game - there might have been a better gloss to the result.",
      "Amorim and the United hierarchy feel they are losing out on the fine margins right now.",
      "There are other mitigating circumstances too - the injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are particularly damaging, especially because United's squad doesn't have the strength in depth of any of the other \"Big Six\" clubs right now.",
      "It will take several transfer windows and clever recruitment before that is a reality. Mount and Cunha should both be back available soon.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is still adapting to life in the Premier League, but there is optimism that he is beginning to feel more comfortable - albeit with very limited service. That was his first Premier League start for United on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness over his playing system - with a defiant three centre backs - is very much a live debate. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change,\" the manager said on Sunday evening. \"If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is not the first time that he has effectively said \"back me or sack me\" in front of the media. But when Amorim was appointed in November last year, the United hierarchy knew what they were getting, and the specific way in which the Portuguese coach chooses to play.",
      "There remains a belief, beyond Amorim's coaching staff, that the system can be a success.",
      "But there is some consternation that, with United's midfield struggling to hold its own so far this season, Amorim is repeatedly overlooking the talent of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The midfielder looked bright when he came off the bench for the last 30 minutes against City, and that again has prompted many a United fan to ask why he is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "What is clear is that Amorim doesn't think he is the finished article and that, at 20-years-old, he still needs to develop. The United boss is working hard and personally with Mainoo behind the scenes, but rightly or wrongly - Mainoo's involvement will be managed. He is not currently in Amorim's first-choice line-up.",
      "For the Manchester United bosses, they feel little has changed after this weekend's game against their bitter rivals. That is not to say they will wait for change indefinitely. Rather, they accept that correcting United's malaise is a long-term project.",
      "And there is little or no desire to rip up the current plan, change the man in charge of the football team, and start (again) from scratch.",
      "Club legends are lining up to say enough is enough - Wayne Rooney, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more among the voices saying the pressure on Amorim is mounting, and things have to improve quickly.",
      "That is true. And no one knows it more acutely than Ruben Amorim himself."

      "\"But he is being asked to do something different. It is normal for a No 10 like he is to be able to do it for two or three games, to fill in when a midfielder is injured or suspended or something. But then you get a little bit bored of going back into position to defend.\"",
      "It is the voice of experience. \"I did both roles. As a No 10, the last thing you want to think about is defending. Once you go back into a two in midfield, all of a sudden you are thinking about defence, about what your runner is doing. It's a totally different mindset.\"",
      "There is a view now that Scholes was a natural deep-lying playmaker, England's answer to Andrea Pirlo or Xavi Hernandez. It is true that he took on that role late in his career but, now 50 and reflecting on his career, it is not necessarily how he sees himself.",
      "\"When I first came into the team I was a centre-forward,\" he recalls. And while Sir Alex Ferguson had always insisted that he would end up playing as a central midfielder, that took time. \"I ended up playing as a No 10 for three, four, five years, which I loved.\"",
      "They were some of his happiest and most successful years. \"Defending was not my strong point. I didn't like having to think about defending and as a No 10 you didn't have to. All you think about is getting your team to play, creating chances, scoring goals.\"",
      "In truth, the obsession with possession was never his. When watching old clips, he has been known to groan at the sight of himself passing backwards. \"It was not until my late twenties when I went into that controlling role as the manager wanted me to do.\"",
      "It required a mentality shift. \"I remember a game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League where he did not really want me to go over the halfway line, which was something different for me, because we were getting done in Europe quite a bit.\"",
      "Scholes' job was not to unlock the opposition but to stifle them. \"He wanted us to just be controlled and not vacate that area. It was something new for me to learn.\" Even now, he still recalls his surprise at the United manager's reaction to his performance.",
      "\"I remember after that game, I had not had a shot on goal and I don't think I created a chance. I didn't do anything attacking wise very well. He said, 'Brilliant, that is what I wanted from you'. From that day on, it just seemed to grow. I became used to the role.\"",
      "As such, you might expect Scholes to be an advocate for Fernandes making the same positional journey. The United skipper turned 31 this month, after all. Instead, it seems he would prefer the Portuguese playmaker to be the one still trying that killer pass.",
      "\"That is the way I was brought up. That is the way the manager wanted us to play. Pass forward and run forward. It was all about playing attacking, being entertaining. So, to go back, just passing it back, I hate seeing it now and I hated seeing it when I did it.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging conversation at a Manchester pub where he is even volunteering to pull pints to help promote his new podcast The Good, the Bad and the Football with fellow Class of '92 graduate Nicky Butt, Scholes touches on subjects old and new.",
      "He has been following the debate about the relative merits of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as teenagers. Scholes played with both. Owen even nicked the ball off his toe when scoring his wonder goal against Argentina in 1998. \"He could have left it for me.\"",
      "His own view? Succinct but definitive. \"At that age, Michael was the better goalscorer, Wayne was the better footballer.\"",
      "But he is keen to stress that Owen was a phenomenon in his own right, his pace setting him apart from the rest. \"With Michael in the early days, I just had to look and he would spin in behind and I just had to hit the ball into 20 yards of space. It was an easy job.\"",
      "Easy for Scholes, perhaps. He had a connection with many top-class strikers for club and country. \"As a midfield player you need to know your players' strengths.\" But Ruud van Nistelrooy was his favourite. \"I had the feeling that I knew what he wanted to do.\"",
      "Scholes wonders whether too much is being expected of the latest United striker Benjamin Sesko. Will he really be able to succeed where Rasmus Hojlund failed? \"He is a 22-year-old kid replacing someone of a very similar ilk. It is a difficult job to adapt.\"",
      "He would have liked the club to opt for a more experienced goalkeeper such as Emiliano Martinez too. \"He would have been a lot safer.\" And that is crucial. Scholes saw up close the difficulties that the club faced in trying to find a replacement for Peter Schmeichel.",
      "He is reluctant to criticise Massimo Taibi too much. \"He made a couple of mistakes. It did not work out.\" But he is less delicate on Mark Bosnich's footwork. \"Would he be able to play in this day and age for some of the best coaches in the world? I don't see it.\"",
      "On United more broadly, Scholes describes himself as \"more hopeful than confident\" that Amorim can bring the good times back. \"I like the way he speaks,\" he says, before later adding: \"The results are not really there to have massive confidence in him yet.\"",
      "Perhaps he would have more confidence if Fernandes were given more freedom to express himself further forwards. \"If you watched some of the Europa League games last year, he was really good in that [deeper] position so he can do it,\" says Scholes.",
      "\"I think if you asked him to do everything then he would try to do it all, almost in that Wayne Rooney type of way as well. But I think with him playing in that deeper-lying area it is taking away some of the important qualities that he has further up the pitch.\"",
      "Paul Scholes. Still a No 10 at heart.",

      "The Debrief column this week focuses on Patrick Dorgu's ineffectiveness despite getting in good positions for Manchester United and what that says about Ruben Amorim's system. Plus: Jeremy Doku's creativity and Brentford's long throws...",
      "Monday 15 September 2025 12:01, UK",
      "Being in Ruben Amorim's press conference after Manchester United's 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Sunday, it was striking once again just how open that he is about his team's ongoing struggles. More than that, he is aware of what he calls the narratives.",
      "There were more questions about Bruno Fernandes, while Amorim himself referenced the debate about Kobbie Mainoo. But more troubling for the United coach is the growing feeling that even if he succeeds in shaping this side in his own image, it might not work.",
      "Patrick Dorgu's role in the derby was fascinating. He had more touches in the opposition penalty box than any other player on the pitch. In fact, with 12 touches there, he became the first United player to hit double figures in the area so far this season.",
      "So often the space was his. But he was not particularly effective. There was one completed dribble. Crosses were looped in. But even late in the game, with City having long since sealed the points, there was a toothlessness to United in the final third.",
      "It seems extraordinary to think that this is by design but that is how it can feel with Amorim's United. So much depends on the quality of the wing-backs in this system but even though Dorgu is seen as a specialist in the role, does he have the tools required?",
      "Two seasons ago, the player to find themselves in the most one-on-one situations in the Premier League was Arsenal's Bukayo Saka. Last season, it was Liverpool's Mohamed Salah. This suits those teams. Get your best player isolated against the opposition.",
      "The United player to have found themselves in the most one-on-one situations is Dorgu. If that is the plan with Amorim's 3-4-3 then it is a concern because on Sunday that is probably the United player Pep Guardiola would have wanted to have the space.",
      "Any system that compromises the strengths of your most talented players and highlights the deficiencies of your most limited ones is surely doomed to fail. For Amorim, the wing-backs are key. And Manchester United's are not good enough to make this work.",
      "For proof that isolating a wide player against the opposition defence can be effective, look no further than the other end of the pitch and a hugely impactful performance by Jeremy Doku who provided assists for Manchester City's first two goals of the game.",
      "Jack Grealish's improved end product has been a feature of the Premier League season, racking up four assists already since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City. But Doku's impressive display in the Manchester derby was a reminder of his talent.",
      "The Belgian forced himself ahead of Grealish in the mind of Pep Guardiola and certainly justified his inclusion against Manchester United. It was Doku's skill that opened up the defence for Phil Foden's opening goal, dancing past two opponents to set it up.",
      "Guardiola has described the winger as the best in the world over five metres and that explosivity was the key factor in that goal but the City boss has urged him to improve other facets of his game and there was some evidence of that with his second assist.",
      "It was his measured pass through to Erling Haaland that ended any hopes of a United comeback. It is the first time that Doku has registered two assists in a Premier League game since producing four of them in one game against Bournemouth in 2023.",
      "Grealish, who had a season-high 16 touches in the opposition box in Everton's goalless draw with Aston Villa, still ranks second for chances created from open play in the Premier League so far this season, but the one man ahead of him on that list is Doku.",
      "The return of the long throw remains a big talking point in this Premier League season but after Crystal Palace found the net as a result of one against Aston Villa before the international break, it was time for the masters of it to make their own statement.",
      "Brentford's stoppage-time equaliser against Chelsea was finished by Fabio Carvalho but it came from a Kevin Schade long throw. According to the expected-goals data, the Bees have now created better chances from throw-ins than any other team this season.",
      "No surprise there. That was the case last season, and the season before that, and the season before that, and the season before that. Other teams are finally cottoning on to the fact that the throw-in is an opportunity to do more than just recycle possession.",
      "\"It is not new to us,\" said Brentford boss Keith Andrews. How true. Over the past five seasons, their expected-goals tally from throw-ins is 21.47. The next best in the Premier League in that period is just 5.49 by Nottingham Forest. The rest are playing catch up.",
      "Speaking recently to Thomas Gronnemark, the renowned throw-in specialist who has worked with Brentford for the past three seasons, he believes that this is inevitable because paying attention to the importance of this set piece just makes sense.",

      "This is as bad as it gets unless you were watching Man Utd in the 1970s when they were relegated.",
      "Here's the thing, though, United fans who were there have great memories of that 1974/75 season in the Second Division. Tommy Docherty was in charge and there were new grounds to visit.",
      "The team still had players you could look up to like Stuart Pearson, Lou Macari, Sammy McIlroy and Brian Greenhoff. Despite playing in the second tier United still had the highest average home attendance in England.",
      "After an instant return to the First Division, United also denied Liverpool the Treble a year later by beating Bob Paisley's side in the 1977 FA Cup final.",
      "Even in the 1980s when United went through long dark periods, they still had teams full of club legends like Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside, Mark Hughes and Paul McGrath.",
      "In recent years there have been so many changes at every level of the club that it's difficult to put your finger on what makes United that special anymore.",
      "Of course, there is the history and the trophies and the fans. More than 2.2m of them watched games at Old Trafford last season. There wasn't much to celebrate with United finishing 15th in the Premier League, but that made them the best supported team in Europe.",
      "Many of those fans will not have been around in the 1970s and 1980s so for them this is definitely as bad as it gets. And that's a view that would probably be shared by at least some of the older fans who were there in those days.",
      "Ruben Amorim was defiant in Sunday's post-match press conference after his side's 3-0 defeat to Man City, and made it clear, again, that he is not going to change his philosophy.",
      "No matter how bad things get, it seems he will carry on playing three at the back even though it is pretty obvious to everyone that the system is not working and it does not suit his players.",
      "If nobody at United can convince him to be more flexible, then they just have to hope the players will eventually look at home playing the way Amorim wants them to play.",
      "The only other option is to replace the head coach, but that it is a road United have been down too often since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down 12 years ago.",
      "You could make a pretty good case that United would be in a better state if they had stuck with any of the managers who followed Ferguson: David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Erik ten Hag.",
      "Although, judging by the fact that they wasted so much money in the transfer market when Ten Hag was in charge, perhaps it was the right decision to sack him nine months ago, when United were 14th - exactly where did they are today.",
      "Even Ten Hag, though, could point out that since Amorim's first game in charge, no ever-present Premier League team have performed worse than United - 31 points from 31 games means United are bottom of the table.",
      "Not if he only has one way of playing.",
      "The Premier League is ferociously competitive and United are too easy to play against at the moment. Opponents know exactly what to expect when they face United and the fear factor has totally disappeared.",
      "It used to be a shock when United lost; now it is a shock when they win. So-called smaller clubs are better run, have better balanced squads and can spend tens of millions of pounds on players every summer.",
      "United have been left behind and Amorim has a massive job on his hands. He is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve and comes across as extremely honest and transparent in all his dealings with the media. That is a breath of fresh in one sense, but it can also diminish his status as a strong leader.",
      "Managing Manchester United is like managing Real Madrid. Everything you say is going to be a headline. United are back-page news every day.",
      "Perhaps the ideal United head coach is someone who wears a suit and tie and gives little away. It worked in the old days, but these are not the old days any more.",
      "It is too early to answer that question properly because the window closed only two weeks ago.",
      "United focused their spending on buying a new forward line when many outside observers would have thought that the money would have been better spent on a new spine for the team. They also had the option of selling Bruno Fernandes for a big transfer fee to Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The captain stayed and his new team-mates Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo need to be given more time to show what they can do. Senne Lammens could also turn out to be an exceptional goalkeeper if he lives up to expectations and adapts to English football.",
      "There is a nagging feeling, though, that a club the size and stature of United should be going all out to buy the best players in the world - players like Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Not being in the Champions League and cutting the wage bill means United fans have to get used to a new reality, a new reality which means the very best players going to their rivals for the time being.",
      "Even the fact that United managed to move out so many players this summer who were surplus to requirements was not a cause for celebration. United have taken a big financial hit on the transfer fees paid for the likes of Rasmus Hojlund, Jadon Sancho and Antony but at least they were able to get their wages off their books.",
      "United were sixth in the table when INEOS completed their deal to buy their minority stake and take over sporting control in February last year.",
      "There has been very little to get excited about on the pitch, apart from a shock FA Cup final win against Manchester City, which earned Ten Hag a new contract but left United counting the cost - some £13m - when they fired him just five months later.",
      "There's no point going through all the statistics and defeats here - there are too many losses - but it is safe to say that this has been one of the worst periods in the history of the club.",
      "INEOS have put their own money in and are making big changes off the pitch, including redeveloping the training ground, but there have been just as many mistakes as good decisions. With the benefit of hindsight, flying to Ibiza to give Ten Hag a new deal was absolutely the wrong decision and hiring and firing Dan Ashworth was another costly mistake.",
      "At least INEOS have a plan. The plan changes from time to time as all plans do, but they do have a plan and they have put their own money on the table. It is just extremely unfortunate that the plan has also meant so many people losing their jobs and a new controversial ticketing policy.",
      "The Glazer family also had a plan and if you wanted to start an argument, you could whisper very quietly that the results, league tables and trophies, taken in isolation, show that United were better off when the Glazers and executives like Ed Woodward and Richard Arnold were in charge.",
      "The priority has to be getting back into the Champions League or any European competition at the very least.",
      "The League Cup is already gone thanks to that calamitous night in Grimsby and you can get odds of 100/1 on United to win the title so, trophy wise, the FA Cup is all United realistically have to play for.",
      "Winning the FA Cup would mean a place in the Europa League, but the Champions League is where United have to be. The commercial benefits of being back in the expanded top-tier European tournament are huge and it would make it easier to sign the best players in the world.",
      "Finishing in the top five is likely to mean Champions League qualification but United are a long way off that standard at the moment. At least the lack of European competition this season means Amorim has more time to work with his players in between league games. It is not much of a silver lining, but it is something at least.",
      "United's next game is against Chelsea next weekend. Luckily for them, Chelsea have a terrible record at Old Trafford - no league win for 12 years - and they were not particularly convincing in their 2-2 draw with Brentford on Saturday night.",
      "The six teams below United at the moment are all capable of beating them but that is not to say United are in a relegation fight - yet.",
      "If they carry on the way they have started, they will probably end up where they finished last season - in the middle of the bottom half of the table.",
      "And if that is the case, it is likely that INEOS will make a change at the top - just as they did last October when United were 14th."
