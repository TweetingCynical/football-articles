      "Manchester United are nearing their biggest game of the season so far, with a trip across Manchester to the Etihad Stadium just days away.",
      "After welcoming their players back from international duty, United face Manchester City on Sunday afternoon. The game will have a fresh feeling for both sides, who could start new goalkeepers in the form of Senne Lammens and Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "United signed Lammens on transfer deadline day and are sending Andre Onana out on loan to Trabzonspor as Ruben Amorim tinkers with his goalkeepers. He has decisions to make all across the pitch, with the new-look attack of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha yet to click into gear, and midfield issues persisting.",
      "\"I just hope they're not making the same mistake with this player, because he's only young, had no experience in the Premier League, and I think that's where I would have liked maybe Ollie Watkins or someone coming in to Man United, who's been there, seen it, knows the league, can help a young player.",
      "\"So I hope they don't expect him to come straight into the football club and go and hit the ground running and scoring goals. Certainly, obviously, everyone wants him to do that, but it's a really tough ask to go into that football club and have a young player who has no experience to go in.\"",
      "Andre Onana flew from Paris to Trabzon in Turkey yesterday to complete his season-long loan deal with Trabzsonspor. The Cameroon international joined United two seasons ago and has been the No.1 goalkeeper ever since, but has been ousted this summer.",
      "After Altay Bayindir started the opening three Premier League games, United paid £18.2m to sign Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on deadline day. The 23-year-old Belgian could make his debut in the derby on Sunday, while Onana has departed to play football elsewhere.",
      "It is some turnaround for Onana, who arrived for £47m from Inter Milan, having helped them reach the Champions League final, but has seen his reputation destroyed at Old Trafford.",
      "It's fair to say that Manuel Ugarte has not proven to be the transformational signing United fans hoped. The ex-Paris Saint-Germain midfielder joined the club a year ago in a deal potentially worth £50.5million, but he's yet to make his mark in a position the club desperately need filling.",
      "Casemiro is still preferred in holding midfield, while Kobbie Mainoo and Ugarte have to be happy with a place on the bench under Amorim's management. Ugarte is an experienced Uruguay international, but former Scotland player Craig Burley is bemused by him.",
      "Laying into the player on ESPN, he said: \"Manuel Ugarte is just absolutely nothing. He's just like a wet blanket. Put him in with the kids and even the kids would be going, 'Who the hell is this guy?' Seriously.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Andre Onana will double his money at Trabzonspor after finally sealing a loan escape route from his Manchester United misery.",
      "Cameroon goalkeeper Onana flew into Turkey with his wife Melanie on Thursday afternoon to seal a switch to the Turkish Super Lig club having only appeared once for United this season, in the shock Carabao Cup loss to League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "Ruben Amorim brought in Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp on transfer deadline day, and that move coupled with Onana's shaky form since his £47.2million move from Inter Milan two years ago effectively sealed the 29-year-old's exit.",
      "However, the Mail report that there is no option for Trabzonspor to buy Onana next summer included in the loan deal, and nor have the Turkish club paid United a loan fee to recruit him for the campaign.",
      "Perhaps most surprisingly, the report adds that Onana will double his weekly wages with Trabzonspor covering them in their entirety for the year. Onana recently saw his wages drop from around £170,000 a week to £120,000 a week - £67,000 a week after tax - due to United failing to qualify for the Champions League, and Turkey has a more favourable tax rate.",
      "United wished Onana well in a statement, saying: \"In his first season at United, Andre was part of the squad that lifted the Emirates FA Cup following a 2-1 victory over Manchester City at Wembley Stadium.",
      "\"Onana played 50 times in his second campaign and our no.24 has now agreed a loan move to Trabzonspor. The move has been completed ahead of the Turkish transfer window closing on Friday. We would like to wish Andre good luck.\"",
      "But after a string of high-profile errors during his time at the club, plenty of United fans welcomed the move on social media.",
      "Responding to the club's Instagram post, one fan wrote: \"Good Riddance. Better late than never!\"",
      "Another added: \"Please just let him leave for free in case they bring him back, we won't mind,\" while a third said simply: \"End of an error.\"",
      "Onana did receive some support online after the move though, with one fan writing: \"The problem isn’t you, the problem is the Manchester United dump. Everyone who escapes from that dump ends up hitting their prime anyway, Onana.\"",

      "Paul Pogba has provided a cryptic update on social media as he nears a return to professional football for the first time in two years. The former Manchester United midfielder hasn’t played since failing a doping test during his second Juventus spell, but is now well and truly on the comeback trail.",
      "The Frenchman's original four-year ban was reduced on appeal, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport accepting his doping offence was 'not intentional', and he was free to return to the pitch in March. The wait has gone on a little longer than that, but he has found a new club in the form of Monaco and is nearing a senior debut.",
      "\"You stay grounded in faith, even when the path isn’t clear,\" Pogba wrote in an 11-word message on Instagram. He was given a provisional October return date upon moving to Stade Louis II, though manager Adi Hutter appears set to give him a little longer to return to the point where he’s ready to deliver at the top level.",
      "Per reports in France, Monaco boss Hutter doesn’t expect to have Pogba back available before the October international break but hopes to have him back shortly after that. It’s a different story with fellow summer signing Ansu Fati, though, with the Spain international close to making his bow after joining on loan from Barcelona.",
      "\"We can’t wait to have him on the pitch,\" Hutter said of Fati. The 22-year-old was back at Barca last season after a year on loan at Brighton but played just six-times in La Liga during an injury-hit campaign.",
      "The Monaco boss also gave an update on Poga, insisting the former United star is \"on the right track\" but that his first game back may not come for a little while longer. He said: \"After the next international break, I think we'll be able to see him play for AS Monaco.",
      "\"He's on the right track. It's taking a little longer than for Ansu, but he's doing well.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I'm surprised, but I'm impressed by what he's doing every day to come back. He's a very professional player. I hope to see him again after the next international break.\"",
      "Pogba’s suggested return date means he is unlikely to be back in time to face Manchester City in the Champions League on October 1. Hutter has named him in Monaco’s Champions League squad, though, and the French international could feature later in the league phase against Tottenham, Real Madrid of Juventus.",
      "The World Cup winning midfielder was visibly emotional in his signing video, and has spoken about the moment with club media. \"It’s true that I was overwhelmed with emotion at that moment. I must say that it’s very rare to see me cry like that, so I hope you enjoyed it,\" he said with a smile.",
      "\"A lot of images that came to mind, in relation to what I went through. So to come back and sign for AS Monaco, for a club that believed in me, all of that came back to me at the moment of my signing, which meant that I couldn’t hold back.",
      "\"But above all, it was a moment of joy! But I also feel a lot of determination in me, and I think I made the best choice in coming here.\"",
      "Monaco finished third in Ligue 1 last season to qualify for the Champions League, and sit fourth in the table after three games of the new season. On Saturday they travel to Auxerre with the goal of earning their first away points of the new campaign.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim will be without Lisandro Martinez, Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha against Manchester City, but he could reintroduce Noussair Mazraoui into the starting eleven.",
      "Amorim, 40, has endured a difficult start to the campaign, but secured an unconvincing 3-2 victory over Burnley before the international break. The Portuguese boss will be hoping that victory is the catalyst to jumpstart his United side, who struggled against Arsenal, Fulham and, for most of the game, the Clarets.",
      "Having won only one of their first three Premier League matches of the 2025/26 campaign, United have had a fortnight to gear up for the season's first Manchester derby. Amorim's squad will be eager to become the third side to topple City, who have lost to Brighton and Hove Albion and Tottenham.",
      "The international break arrived at an ideal moment for the Red Devils, with several players nursing knocks whilst others have regained full match sharpness. One player Amorim could deploy from the starting whistle at the Etihad Stadium is Mazraoui.",
      "Throughout both Erik ten Hag and Amorim's reigns, the Moroccan has been a consistent player for the Reds. The defender featured 57 times across all competitions before picking up a knock on the final day against Aston Villa.",
      "Having made his comeback in the 3-2 triumph over Burnley last month, Mazraoui looks primed to start. Speaking recently to The National, the 27-year-old reflected on his debut campaign and the gruelling nature of Premier League football.",
      "He said: \"On a personal level, my fitness and the amount of games I played, I can look back to a good season. In fitness, the Premier League is always different than the other competitions. No winter break, obviously. The games were following up really fast.",
      "\"You hope to stay fit and play as much as possible. That hadn't always been the case for me.",
      "\"The Premier League is a bigger demand than other competitions, so you must take even more of your body. I had a switch in my mindset - be fit and ready and I think that helped me play so many games.\"",
      "United head into the derby with injury concerns over Cunha and Mount. Both limped off during the clash with Burnley, leaving Amorim uncertain about their availability.",
      "After the match, the United boss said: \"It was hard to lose a player like Cunha and Mason Mount - Mount played like 30 minutes with an injury. I don't know [if they are long-term injuries], I don't know, but I'm concerned about that. They are so important for us, so we'll see.\"",
      "On a brighter note, Martinez is moving closer to a comeback. The 27-year-old Argentina defender has been ruled out since February with an ACL problem but is now training on the pitches at Carrington.",
      "However, it will still be a while until the World Cup winner returns to the first team. Amorim has not been able to call upon the ex-Ajax defender in the Premier League since February 2nd, when United lost 2-0 at Old Trafford to Crystal Palace.",

The ex-England international defender joins a number of European football icons on the La Liga club's exclusive list, with previous winners including AC Milan legend Paolo Maldini and multiple Champions League winning Barcelona captain Carles Puyol.",
      "Carragher is the third former Premier League player to be added to the list by the Bilbao club. Former Southampton star Matt Le Tissier was the first recipient in 2015, with Ryan Giggs - a 13-time Premier League winner with Manchester United - winning the award in 2020.",
      "“After winning the Champions League, being a one-club man is the biggest achievement of my career,” Carragher told Athletic Club in August. “It was an honour when Athletic Club got in touch. Athletic are respected everywhere in the world of football. They’re a truly unique club.",
      "“I’m very honoured to receive this award and to know my name will always remain alongside some great footballers like Paolo Maldini and Carles Puyol. As soon as I started playing for Liverpool, I knew I wanted to be a one-club man.",
      "\"I like the idea that when people ask: ‘Who did you play for?’ You respond: ‘Liverpool’ and nothing else. I was a supporter on the pitch.”",
      "Liverpool and Athletic faced off in a pair of pre-season friendlies on the eve of the new campaign, with the Premier League champions winning both. Carragher will make the trip over to Bilbao himself before the end of September, receiving the award in person at San Mames before Athletic take on Girona in La Liga.",
      "Fans have been congratulating Carragher on his award on social media, with one writing \"Well done, Jamie! Well deserved\" and another telling Carragher: \"You are one of the reasons I fell in love with Liverpool FC\". Athletic's official account wrote: \"See you at The Cathedral, Carra!,\" while Liverpool marked the award with a statement on their website.",
      "Carragher, 47, ended his career in 2013 with 737 senior Liverpool appearances to his name. He won the UEFA Cup with the Reds in 2001 and picked up a Champions League winner's medal four years later, playing the full 120 minutes in the dramatic victory over AC Milan in Istanbul.",
      "The versatile defender also won five domestic cups with the Merseyside club and a pair of Super Cup trophies. His international career brought 38 senior England caps, and he played for his country at the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.",

      "Ex-Manchester United striker Louis Saha believes his former club could swoop for Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi, after his move to Liverpool collapsed. Guehi looked set to become the Reds' 11th signing of the summer window on transfer deadline day until the Eagles pulled the plug on the move at the last minute.",
      "Saha believes all bets on Guehi's future are now off and that the Red Devils could steal a march on their fierce rivals and hijack any future deal the England centre-back has with Liverpool. The ex-Fulham striker also reckons Guehi would jump at the chance to join United.",
      "Guehi had already agreed personal terms with Liverpool and completed a medical as his £35million transfer looked all but finalised. Yet it's understood that Palace boss Oliver Glasner threatened to quit if his skipper left, leaving Palace owner Steve Parish no choice but to block the deal.",
      "Guehi is in the last year of his Palace contract, meaning the club will have to cash in on him in January or let him leave free in the summer. The player is reportedly not interested in signing a new deal.",
      "Meanwhile, United boss Ruben Amorim is determined to make his favoured 3-4-3 formation work at Old Trafford after a poor start to the new season. Saha thinks Guehi, who has experience playing in a back three for Palace, could be a key addition for Amorim as he looks to reverse United's failing fortunes.",
      "“Marc Guehi is very strong, very solid, very reliable, quick and a good leader. There is a lot of quality in that boy. I do think that he is the type of player who can really help Manchester United's season,\" the Frenchman said to Flashscore.",
      "“It’s definitely an opportunity to hijack this and stop Liverpool getting stronger. It would be a smart move. I don’t think he would turn down United if the bid goes in correctly. There will be only six months left on this contract, there is definitely an opportunity there.”",
      "Guehi was reported to be disappointed that his move to the Premier League champions didn’t materialise. There is now an expectation that Palace will attempt to sell Guehi in January as they look to recoup some funds for their talisman after missing out on the £35m Liverpool would have given them.",
      "Liverpool had been expected to return with a new bid at the start of 2026, but it is now suggested they will bide their time as the Reds believe Guehi is determined to make the move to Merseyside.",
      "The Anfield side are facing life without centre-back Ibrahima Konate, who is out of contract next summer, while veteran defender Joe Gomez is expected to move on, after almost leaving the club this year. However, Guehi is also able to talk to overseas clubs from the start of next year about a pre-contract agreement.",
      "Despite the shock of his move stalling, Guehi looks to have quickly put the drama behind him and was back in the line-up for England as the Three Lions hammered Serbia 5-0 on Tuesday.",
      "He scored the fourth in Belgrade as Thomas Tuchel's side put one foot in next summer's World Cup. Asked by ITV how the last eight days had gone since his transfer collapsed, Guehi seemed surprisingly upbeat.",
      "\"It's been great,\" he said. \"It's always easy coming here, such a good group of players, good group of staff. We are all working towards one goal.\"",

      "After a long and arduous international break, the Premier League is back this weekend – and there are plenty of juicy narratives to enjoy alongside the football.",
      "England did give us something to snap out of the boredom of the international break by smashing five goals past Serbia on Tuesday night, but most fans have been desperate for the return of club football after two weeks in the wilderness.",
      "The end of the summer transfer window coming on the eve of the break has only served to build the excitement for game week four, with many debuts coming this weekend. The standout fixture undoubtedly comes at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, when the out-of-form Manchester City host Manchester United – a side that recently lost to Grimsby – but there is more to look out for too.",
      "Alexander Isak spent all summer desperately trying to force through a transfer from Newcastle to Liverpool. After lots of frustration, accusations and counter-accusations, he got his wish on transfer deadline day, with a £125million move going through. Now he has to deliver.",
      "The problem for Isak is that he is lacking match sharpness, having barely trained in the final months as a Newcastle player. “Since he only had three training sessions and no pre-season and of course no match time, the risk was too great to use him today,” Sweden manager Jon Dahl Tomasson said last week after he sat out of a 2-2 draw with Slovenia.",
      "Liverpool have posted clips of Isak finding the back of the net in training, but it will likely take time for the Premier League’s record signing to get back to his level. Expect Arne Slot to start him from the bench against Burnley.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo became the first managerial sacking of the season during the break after falling out with Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis and recruitment chief Edu Gaspar. In came Ange Postecoglou and what promises to be a required viewing for the next few weeks.",
      "Postecoglou is the tactical antithesis of Nuno, his non-negotiable attacking instincts replacing his predecessor’s pragmatism overnight. Forest have lots of good players, but how will they cope with such a handbrake turn of an appointment?",
      "Tottenham finished 17th under Postecoglou last season, so one thing we know is that there will be difficult days. They start away at Arsenal this weekend in what promises to be box-office viewing.",
      "The Manchester Derby is on Sunday afternoon and there will likely be two new goalkeepers between the posts at the Etihad.",
      "City have swapped Ederson for Gianluigi Donnarumma, who is expected to usurp James Trafford in goal, while United have waved goodbye to Andre Onana – exiled to Trabzonspor on loan – after the £18m signing of Senne Lammens.",
      "The 23-year-old Belgian may get the nod ahead of the unconvincing Altay Bayindir for what could be a baptism on fire. However, it could be a good time to play City, who are reeling after back-to-back defeats against Spurs and Brighton in the league.",
      "Nevertheless, with Donnarumma no stranger to massive matches, the odds would favour Lammens being the one to drop a clanger.",
      "Isak is finally gone. Eddie Howe will no longer have to answer questions about his wantaway striker. Now the focus turns to the new arrivals Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa.",
      "There is the potential for a classic little and large strike partnership, although Newcastle’s usual 4-3-3 shape suggests it is more likely to be one or the other. The Magpies spent big to land the £69m Woltemade and £55m Wissa and those fees – however inflated due to circumstances – come with expectation.",
      "The service should be good at St James’ Park, where Howe has a tremendous midfield three and exciting wingers, so chances should come their way as Newcastle host Wolves, who will come armed with Jorgen Strand Larsen – a player who they saw two major bids rejected for.",
      "Everton host Aston Villa on Saturday in their second Premier League game at Hill Dickinson Stadium, who already have a new hero. Jack Grealish has won near-universal approval as a reborn superstar since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City and can provide the template for Jadon Sancho, who is hoping to do something similar at Villa after escaping Manchester United once more.",
      "Grealish already has four assists in three league games for Everton and is feeling good after just celebrating his 30th birthday (hopefully not too heavily). He has made it plain that he wants to be in Thomas Tuchel’s squad for the 2026 World Cup, so will need to continue on a similar path to make that dream a reality.",
      "Sancho will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of fellow United exile Marcus Rashford by resparking his career at Villa. He showed in patches how talented he is at Chelsea last season, but can he sustain it?",
      "Marc Guehi was furious after his deadline-day transfer to Liverpool collapsed at the last-minute due to a change of heart by Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish. In the heat of the aftermath, there were suggestions he could step down as Palace captain having been so annoyed by what he saw as punishment for his own professionalism.",
      "The centre-back scored for England against Serbia and now returns to his club, who host Sunderland on Saturday. Guehi will no doubt just get on with his job, but speculation will be a continuous part of his life in the lead up to the January transfer window.",
      "Palace manager Oliver Glasner threatened to resign if Guehi was sold. He has got his way and now needs to make the most of him while he’s still there.",

      "Manchester United are all in on Ruben Amorim and the impending departure of Andre Onana proves it. That's the opinion of United legend Rio Ferdinand, who's glad to see the club backing their manager's decisions.",
      "Amorim made a 'big statement' by dropping Onana, 29, at the beginning of the season, installing Altay Bayindir as his new first-choice goalkeeper. But following Bayindir's string of mistakes in the Premier League, United decided to bring in a new goalkeeper on transfer deadline day, hoping to solve their problems once and for all.",
      "Senne Lammens arrived from Royal Antwerp, as the Red Devils agreed to pay an initial £18.2million plus £3.5million in potential add-ons. In the wake of Lammens' arrival, Onana has decided to leave.",
      "The Cameroon international is due to land in Turkey within the next 24 hours to finalise a season-long loan to Trabzonspor. According to Ferdinand, the way things have panned out is sufficient evidence that the Old Trafford hierarchy fully support Amorim.",
      "\"I was happy that the manager is being able to make his mind up on things and the recruitment team are executing behind that,\" Ferdinand told the Mail. \"They are backing the manager.",
      "\"If people were thinking there were any doubts about the club backing the manager or Amorim being at the football club, it's only going to be his decision whether Onana stays or Lammens comes in. It's a great sign in that respect.",
      "\"Whether you think Onana should have stayed or not is irrelevant. The manager has made his mind up. He played Bayindir early on and said he's in because of football reasons. That was a big statement from the manager and his intentions of what he wanted to do with Onana.\"",
      "Ferdinand went on to say that United have done 'magnificently well' this summer to offload the vast majority of players who aren't part of Amorim's plans. \"In years gone by, say we wanted six players to leave the football club - Onana being one of them - I would argue that minimum three to four of them would have stayed,\" the former defender explained.",
      "\"That wouldn't have helped anybody, the player or the club. As important as the ones that came in and upped the levels, it was as important to get out the players who were deemed not right for the club for whatever reason.",
      "\"They've done magnificently well. Yes, they are only loans, most of them, but to clear the decks of those players was as powerful as bringing in good players.\"",

      "Gary Neville has revealed how he has lost a significant amount of money after a failed pension investment. And former Manchester United team-mate Roy Keane sympathised by acknowledging his own monetary missteps during his career.",
      "The comments came in response to a recent BBC documentary, 'Football's Financial Shame: The Story of the V11'. The show uncovered how a group of footballers who rose to prominence in the 1990s and 2000s, including Danny Murphy, Brian Deane and Rod Wallace, felt they were the victims of financial abuse after investing with Kingsbridge Asset Management.",
      "After watching the programme, Neville relayed his own experience in being let down after a friend's tip-off led him astray. And Keane, 54, has urged today's footballers to \"get a good accountant\" to look after their financial affairs before placing too much trust in someone with their own interests.",
      "\"I've been able to withstand it, but I got advised from a player to invest in a pension, and move my PFA pension into this different pension,\" said Neville on the Stick to Football podcast. \"Because I was frustrated by the PFA pension, because it was just stuck there [and] wasn't doing anything.",
      "\"I was quite entrepreneurial [and] thought, 'Okay, is there another pension I could go to?' So this player came up to me and said invest in this pension. I'm not talking any player, a player I really trusted. I put my money in this pension, where you could actually then go and invest in commercial property, [which] means you can actually see some benefit at least.",
      "\"The whole thing - [this was] about 10 years ago - locked up to this day. So I've got three properties I can't even touch, can't go in, can't get any money out of. I've lost all the money in it.\"",
      "It was revealed in 2022 that United legends Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand were part of a footballer group that lost £25million after investing with Kingsbridge. However, allegations against the firm ran by David McKee and Kevin McMenamin, who deny any wrongdoing, date back years prior.",
      "Upon being probed for more information by Arsenal icon Ian Wright, Neville explained the trustees are in control of the money. Keane sympathised with those who had lost out.",
      "\"I think all of us will have stories,\" he added. \"I've gone into one or two things [and] lost a lot, a lot of money. Again, people you trust. That's why I go back to it, any young sportsperson, get a good accountant!\"",
      "Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher echoed that same sentiment and joined the chorus by suggesting he too had lost out in the past. However, he suggested athletes should stick to what they know without getting involved in affairs outside their wheelhouse.",
      "Of course, it hasn't all been bad for Neville, who has been celebrated for his business acumen over the years and is estimated to be worth tens of millions. The former England full-back is a part-owner in two Manchester hotels, the Stock Exchange and Hotel Football, and also has his own production company.",
      "Neville was even featured as an honorary Dragon on several episodes of Dragons' Den in 2024, recognising his entrepreneurial spirit. As for Keane, his work ethic has clearly rubbed off on his children after daughter Caragh debuted her superfoods brand in response to being diagnosed with lupus.",

      "Kai Rooney has been shooting up the ladder at Manchester United, with the aim of following in his dad's footsteps at Old Trafford. The 15-year-old is the son of Red Devils icon Wayne Rooney, who won a multitude of major trophy at the club during his legendary career.",
      "He was recently called up to United's under-19s squad after impressing in the under-18s, scoring a heroic volley that attracted the attention of the more senior squads. The eldest son of Wayne and Coleen joined the United academy in 2016, and has been a force to be reckoned with on the pitch.",
      "The young right-winger has only made two appearances in the U18 Premier League, scoring one goal in 35 minutes of playing time - but he did score 56 goals in one season for the youth set-up. However, any hope of a sharper ascent to the top will be paused for now, as he'll be spending some time out of action.",
      "This is thanks to an unknown leg injury that Kai recently sustained. The severity of the leg issue or how long it will stop him playing is unclear, but his own feelings suggest it may be a while before he steps foot onto the pitch again.",
      "He uploaded a mirror selfie where a protective boot can be seen on his right foot, alongside the caption \"life can't get worse\" with a crying emoji. While Rooney fans will be saddened by the news, Kai's parents, Wayne and Coleen, will likely be supporting him well given the insider knowledge his father has of dealing with injuries while playing at a top level.",
      "Despite Wayne being a Premier League icon and the perfect role model for his son, it was revealed that he is actually banned from attending his child's matches. This rule wasn't put into place by the club or any manager, but rather by Kai himself, as explained by Coleen during her stint on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! last year.",
      "During her time in the jungle, the 39-year-old discussed her son's difficult yet selfless choice with her fellow campmates and how it was made to benefit his career in the long run. Coleen said: \"That's the thing with kids I think, it's hard to go on days out.",
      "\"Kai told Wayne to stop coming to football games, when he played grassroots tournaments and stuff because he used to get swarmed and he couldn't even watch the game. How do you say to all of these kids, 'Go away, I'm watching my son?'",
      "\"Adults, it's different, you could speak to them, so he just said, 'Oh, dad there's no point you coming because you don't even watch me play anyway.' Which is sad, but it can't be helped anyway. At the same time, the fans help you along the way and get you where you are.\"",
      "However, it isn't just Wayne's presence that affects Kai while he is playing, as the 15-year-old often dodges verbal abuse from opposition players regarding his dad. During an appearance on the Stick to Football podcast, Coleen recalled a moment where Kai missed a penalty in a tournament - and blamed it on his dad.",
      "She said: \"A few years ago, I remember my son Kai took a penalty at St George’s Park, where we were for a tournament. It went to penalties, Kai stepped up and just skied it.",
      "\"Afterwards I asked him how he could take a penalty like that, and he told me he was just fuming as the goalkeeper was saying, 'Your dad’s s***', and he got dead angry.",
      "\"It doesn’t happen to him very often, but it did then, and you can see in some games where they give you a little push. He’s strong-minded though and usually shrugs it off.\"",
      "While it is clear that being the son of such a Premier League powerhouse could be a lot of pressure for a teenage football starlet, Kai has proven in recent times that he is able to handle it with ease. It's likely he'll be itching to return from injury and continue on in the same path he has carved out so far.",
      "United fans will assume that if his father's achievements are anything to go by in terms of premonitions, then they have a real talent on their hands in the Carrington academy.",

      "If Ruben Amorim thought his goalkeeping issues would be solved by sending Andre Onana out on loan, he would be advised to think again. Error-prone Onana flew from Paris to Trabzon to complete his season-long loan move from Manchester United to Trabzonspor on Thursday, after two lamentable seasons at Old Trafford",
      "When it comes to costly flops at United in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, Onana is up there with the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Jadon Sancho and Antony, all of whom have permanent residency in the Old Trafford hall of shame.",
      "United bought Onana from Inter Milan for £47million, despite him having been a free agent a year earlier at Ajax. Due diligence and shrewd investment are, it seems, still hard to come by in the corridors of power at United.",
      "Onana's two years as United's No.1 were marked with high-profile blunders, his long overdue departure a relief for players and fans who had known for some time he was more of a liability than an asset.",
      "But even with Onana now out of the picture, Amorim still faces a conundrum between the posts, in terms of who to pick in goal for Sunday's Manchester derby at the Etihad Stadium – Altay Bayindir or new signing Senne Lammens.",
      "Throwing £18.2million deadline day signing Lammens into the heat of a Manchester derby for his Premier League debut is a risky move, one sources close to Amorim say the United head coach is unlikely to make.",
      "If Amorim did pick Lammens on Sunday and the 23-year-old keeper were to make a mistake, the United boss would be criticised for not giving him time to settle in and adapt, after just a handful of training sessions.",
      "Yet Bayindir, 27, has not looked convincing this season and was guilty of errors against Arsenal and Burnley. But he will know what to expect at City, given his greater experience, in contrast to Lammens.",
      "Against that backdrop, Amorim is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't, whoever ultimately gets the nod on Sunday. Yet one thing is certain and that is that Lammens is viewed as United's No.1 keeper in the years ahead.",
      "United sources have disclosed that he was not identified and signed with the expectation that he would go straight into the starting line-up, but his potential was recognised amid a belief he can grow into the role long-term.",
      "The major strength Lammens brings is his shot-stopping ability. No keeper across Europe's top 10 leagues has saved more penalties – five from seven faced – than the Belgium Under-21 star since the start of last season.",
      "Lammens is also arguably stronger in the air than Bayindir and more comfortable in congested areas, when teams try to target the opposition goalkeeper, blocking him from trying to come for the ball. Lammens stopped 44 crosses last season, more than any other keeper in Belgium, underlining his confidence in coming out for the ball.",
      "There would appear to be many long-term positives from United's acquisition of Lammens and the offloading of Onana, but that does not provide an immediate solution to Amorim's problems.",
      "Establishing a recognised No.1, as United had in the past with Peter Schmeichel, Edwin van der Sar and David De Gea, all of whom became club legends, will be the first step towards doing that.",

      "As we look ahead to Sunday's Manchester derby, both camps have a goalkeeping dilemma. Both Mancunian clubs brought in new shot-stoppers on transfer deadline day, signalling their shared uncertainty between the posts.",
      "Manchester City signed Gianluigi Donnarumma after striking a £27million deal with Paris Saint-Germain, who decided to cut their losses when the Italian failed to agree a new contract. Over at Manchester United, Senne Lammens arrived for an initial £18.2million plus £3.5million in potential add-ons.",
      "Pep Guardiola will almost certainly install 26-year-old Donnarumma as his new No.1 but for Ruben Amorim, he's got a decision to make. Lammens, 23, comes to the Premier League with everything still to prove, having made his name at Royal Antwerp and impressed Red Devils scouts.",
      "United decided to sign a new goalkeeper in light of Altay Bayindir's shaky start to the season. That was after Amorim made the bold call to put his faith in the Turkey international and drop Andre Onana, who's now set to join Turkish side Trabzonspor on a season-long loan.",
      "So, does Amorim chuck Lammens into a baptism of fire at the Etihad? Does he stick with Bayindir? Or could veteran Tom Heaton even be called upon?",
      "I was at Old Trafford for Andre Onana's Premier League debut. It was obvious from that night what a liability he would become and although he avoided giving away what was the most obvious penalty in history, the dye was cast.",
      "Onana was never able to shrug off that reputation and his confidence was immediately shot. Amorim will be desperate for that not to happen to Lammens, who would face a daunting baptism of fire against City.",
      "But if the alternative is Bayindir, the United boss has no choice to make. If Lammens was the choice over Emi Martinez - he has to be ready straight away.",
      "Bayindir wouldn't start for any other Premier League team. Lammens should prove to be significantly better, but it will still be a nervy Sunday for the debutant.",
      "Which goalkeeper would you start? Let us know your pick in the comments section.",
      "It's sink or swim for anyone who plays in goal for Manchester United. Bayindir has already sunk and Heaton has had his chance - so why not give the new boy a go?",
      "Bayindir has been a disaster for United and doesn't even start for Turkey, so he is a no-go as far as I'm concerned. Senne Lammens, meanwhile, hasn't been backed by too many people either.",
      "Many pundits have claimed he is too inexperienced for arguably the most pressurised goalkeeping position in world football. But United have just spent £18m on him and opted to sign him instead of Emiliano Martinez, so they must be pretty confident in their purchase.",
      "We'll never know how good Lammens is until we see him in action against the best teams, so Ruben Amorim should throw him into the deep end. Some of the best goalkeepers have started shaky and grown with confidence (looking at you, David de Gea).",
      "It surely can't get worse than Andre Onana and Bayindir… can it?",
      "Manchester United have got themselves into a mess of their own making in the goalkeeping department and it is a far from ideal situation this weekend.",
      "While Pep Guardiola will likely have no gripes about throwing Gianluigi Donnarumma into the firing line, given his vast experience of big games, the same can't be said of Ruben Amorim and Senne Lammens, who is 23 and only has played in Belgium (where he isn't considered one of the three best 'keepers in the country).",
      "Tom Heaton is out of the question, so that leaves Altay Bayindir as the most sensible pick in my mind. The Turkey international hasn't been convincing at all, but at least he has trained and played with United's back line before.",
      "His real weakness has come at set pieces and - in theory at least - that isn't one of Man City's big strengths. For me, Bayindir gets the nod simply by default due to the nature of the game and the lack of time on the training ground since deadline day.",
      "For me, it's simple: Senne Lammens should be straight in. Altay Bayindir has already cost United enough points this season and if the Red Devils really believe that Lammens was a better buy than Emiliano Martinez, they should trust him on a big stage like the Etihad two weeks on from his deadline-day move.",
      "Bayindir felt like a bizarre buy from United; he wasn't highly rated at Fenerbahce and Erik ten Hag was reluctant to play him regardless of the competition. I'm glad he got his moment at Arsenal in the FA Cup last season after putting together an excellent string of saves, and he looks a great character to have in the squad, but Bayindir should be watching from the bench on Sunday.",

      "The ex-Paris Saint-Germain player joined the Red Devils a year ago in a deal potentially worth £50.5 million, but he's yet to make his mark despite being at the club for over a season. Only Leny Yoro commanded a higher fee than Ugarte during Dan Ashworth's summer stint overseeing United's transfers, with the former sporting director stating: \"Signing Manuel was another of our primary targets for this summer.",
      "\"He is among the very best ball-winning midfield players in the world and has an excellent record at both club and international level. His qualities, experience and passion will be a great complement to our strong group of midfielders.\"",
      "Burley has been far from impressed with what he's seen. The former Scotland international didn't hold back on ESPN, stating: \"Manuel Ugarte is just absolutely nothing. He's just like a wet blanket. Put him in with the kids and even the kids would be going, 'Who the hell is this guy?' Seriously.\"",
      "The 53 year old pundit also had strong views on United's goalkeeping situation. Burley doesn't think Altay Bayindir can continue between the sticks, especially with Andre Onana's expected departure, and believes Senne Lammens could face a tough introduction to the Premier League.",
      "\"He looked the real deal when he was in Italy,\" Burley said of Onana. \"I thought he was going to come in and have a Schmeichel-esque aura about him. Remember he was bossing about Harry Maguire and he had a go at him.",
      "\"If this young lad from Belgium comes in and is flapping about all over the place, it's going to be a mess isn't it? Altay Bayindir, they can't play him. He might be okay at shotstopping but he's absolutely useless at balls into the box.",
      "\"The lad who has come in [Lammens] needs to be able to communicate, marshal a back four, be good with the ball at his feet, make saves and he needs to have authority and make a statement when teams are rattling the ball into the box. That is what every team will do now, they're going to pile it on into this goalkeeper.",
      "\"He's going to sink or swim. They went halfway down the road to Martinez at Villa and I think that would have been the perfect scenario because he's got arrogance. But they've gone the other route again and we've no idea how the young lad is going to handle the scenario.\"",

      "Nicky Butt has warned Ruben Amorim that history may repeat itself at Manchester United with Benjamin Sesko, unless he finds him a support player. The Portuguese mastermind is expected to deliver in the Premier League this season after receiving the backing of the board this summer.",
      "The 40-year-old has brought a wealth of top-tier talent to Old Trafford over the past three months, spending more than £200million on the likes of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, as he looks to bounce back from last term's 15th-place finish.",
      "But club legend Butt believes that United fans can't expect £74m man Sesko to hit the ground running in the league right away, given he is still far from a finished product. And the former midfielder, who racked up 387 appearances for the Red Devils between 1992 and 2004, has shared a concern that the Slovenian could suffer a similar fate as Rasmus Hojlund, who has failed to live up to his own £72m price tag since arriving from Atalanta two years ago.",
      "\"He had a couple of players in [Marcus] Rashford and certain other players at the start of it who were out of form and they weren't performing right, so the onus was on him, the young players, to go and score goals. And in a football club that's got the eyes all over the world on them, and that's not performing, it's really difficult.",
      "\"I just hope they're not making the same mistake with this player, because he's only young, had no experience in the Premier League, and I think that's where I would have liked maybe Ollie Watkins or someone coming in to Man United, who's been there, seen it, knows the league, can help a young player.",
      "\"So I hope they don't expect him to come straight into the football club and go and hit the ground running and scoring goals. Certainly, obviously, everyone wants him to do that, but it's a really tough ask to go into that football club and have a young player who has no experience to go in.",
      "\"It's easy when we come through, because when you're coming into a football club that's performing well and has experienced world-class players, and you can come in as a young player, it's so much easier. But when you go into a struggling team with the eyes of the world on them, it's really tough, so it's going to be a tough start to the season for him, I think.\"",
      "While Hojlund showed glimpses of world-class talent during his first season with Manchester United, scoring 10 goals in 30 games, the 22-year-old's form dipped last term. Despite leading the line in 32 outings for the club, Hojlund managed to find the back of the net just four times before his future at the club was cast into speculation.",
      "While the Dane was initially insistent on fighting for his place in Amorim's starting XI, he secured a deadline day loan back to Serie A to play under Antonio Conte at Napoli. Speaking about the move, he said: \"I come with a lot to prove, I want to show myself in the best team in Italy, and Napoli is going to be very, very good.",
      "\"I always work hard, I like to say I want to die on the pitch, to give everything for the team, to score goals, create, and fight for everything. I’ve been looking forward to this opportunity. I’m very, very grateful and I’m going to do my best to make us win something this year again, and to do the fans and club proud.\"",
      "It appears as though the Red Devils are being cautious with how they deploy Sesko early into his Manchester United tenure, with the 22-year-old entering the fray from the bench in the club's opening three Premier League matches against Arsenal, Fulham and Burnley.",
      "He meanwhile played the full 90 minutes in his side's Carabao Cup exit to Grimsby Town last month, failing to find the score sheet before the club were omitted from the tournament via a tense penalty shootout. It comes as Amorim may turn to the star to start when the Premier League returns this weekend, with United set to clash with bitter rivals Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium come Sunday, September 14.",
      "While Cunha has been deployed as Amorim's trusted striker in the Premier League this term, the Brazilian picked up a hamstring injury during United's 3-2 win over Burnley ahead of the international break. And at the time of writing, it is uncertain as to whether Cunha will be fit to feature in the Manchester derby.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Anthony Martial's career is set to take another twist, as he continues his fall from grace one year after leaving Manchester United. Martial, 29, was once tipped to be a Ballon d'Or winner, so much so that a clause was inserted into his contract when United signed him from Monaco for an initial £36million in August 2015.",
      "The deal would've risen to £57.6m had all three bonuses clauses been met. One of those stipulated that if the French forward won the Ballon d'Or while playing for United, Monaco would be owed a further £7.2m.",
      "Ultimately, Martial was never in contention for the prestigious award during his nine-year stay at Old Trafford. In June 2024, after scoring 90 goals in 317 appearances for the Red Devils, the 30-capped France international left United upon the end of his contract.",
      "Three months later, Martial ended his stint as a free agent and signed for Greek giants AEK Athens. The 29-year-old scored nine goals and registered two assists last season, helping AEK finish second in the Super League 1.",
      "But their form fell off a cliff in the Championship play-offs, losing all six games to finish bottom of a four-man table. Manager Matias Almeyda, who'd brought Martial to Greece, left following the disappointment and was replaced by Marko Nikolic.",
      "The appointment of Nikolic has been bad news for Martial, who's played just 31 minutes of football this term. The ex-Monaco starlet was left out of AEK's squad to face Anderlecht in the Conference League play-offs, as the Greek side won 3-1 on aggregate to qualify for the league phase.",
      "Now Martial is surplus to requirements, with his club willing to send him out on loan. According to reports in Mexico, Liga MX outfit Pumas are exploring a move.",
      "The deadline for new signings to be registered is Friday but, as things stand, Martial is unwilling to reduce his salary. If he doesn't get the move, Martial could find himself kicking his heels in Athens until at least the January transfer window.",
      "His time at Old Trafford ended on a sour note, with injury restricting him to just 19 appearances in all competitions during his final season. In an emotional farewell message, Martial said: \"Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you.",
      "\"I'm leaving to take on new challenges, I'll always be a Red Devil and I'll continue to follow the club's results with passion. Thank you again for everything, and see you soon. With all my affection, Anthony Martial.\"",

      "Joleon Lescott has cast doubt on Ruben Amorim's squad choices this season. The 43-year-old warned that Manchester United's new goalkeeper Senne Lammens should not make his debut against Manchester City.",
      "The Red Devils' shaky start to the season has been characterised by some uninspiring performances between the sticks. Turkish shotstopper Altay Bayindir was given the nod in their opening match against Arsenal, where he was at fault for the solitary goal in a 1-0 defeat.",
      "Andre Onana was then selected for the Carabao Cup tie against Grimsby Town. His pair of blunders handed the hosts two goals, and despite United managing to level the score at 2-2, Onana did little to aid his team as they were knocked out of the competition via a penalty shootout.",
      "Onana now appears to be on his way out of the club, heading to Trabzonspor on loan, with promising young Belgian No. 1 Senne Lammens snapped up for £18.2million on deadline day. However, Lescott believes Bayindir should remain in goal for United's trip to the Etihad on Sunday, warning that a defeat could dent Lammens' confidence regardless of his performance.",
      "Pep Guardiola's team might also introduce a new goalkeeper after securing the services of Gianluigi Donnarumma on the final day of the transfer window. While Lescott acknowledges both Lammens and the Italian could make their debuts, he has urged United to refrain from making a potentially lose-lose decision similar to the one that may have cost them the Grimsby match.",
      "Lescott, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet, said: \"It wouldn't surprise me if both the new goalkeepers [Donnarumma and Lammens] start. But what is there to gain with the new United goalkeeper playing?",
      "ALL OUT FOOTBALL ON YOUTUBE: Subscribe now to be the first to watch the latest episodes of In The Mixer and other original shows, brought to you by Sky Bet. Follow All Out Football on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and X.",
      "\"They could still lose by four, and he could have a great game. What that does for his confidence would radiate for weeks. Is there a benefit? You risk that happening.",
      "\"If Bayindir goes in and they lose, there is a question mark over him regardless. They should just keep him [Lammens] until there is an easier opportunity than City away. The manager, the club and he as an individual may benefit from that more.",
      "\"I just think the risk is bigger than the reward for him to start for United. I thought that against Grimsby. I'm like, why have you picked Onana? I don't understand the decision.",
      "\"There was no benefit for the manager. If he did well in that game, then you've got a decision to make at the weekend. If he doesn't do well, then you're out of the competition. So I just didn't grasp that as a rational decision, and I'm the same this weekend. I'm thinking keep it the same and give [Lammens] a different opportunity than City away.\"",
      "He added: \"I expect Donnarumma to start. Who knows what condition he'll come back from his national team, which will have an impact. But the expectation of City is higher. There is more pressure on them to win. [Trafford] is top, I definitely believe he felt he was ready to compete with whoever came in, and he should. He's top. As long as they give him a fair opportunity.",
      "\"If Trafford's out now, and Donnarumma's in, given an opportunity to play, if he makes a mistake, then it's back and forth. That's what players want. I just want it to be fair. 'If you're judging me by one thing, then judge the opposing player by the same thing.'\"",

      "Michael Owen believes Ruben Amorim will succeed at Manchester United if given time, blaming their struggles on more 'deep-rooted' problems. United boss Amorim was appointed in November 2024 and has since won just eight of his 30 Premier League games in charge.",
      "The Portuguese was under huge pressure ahead of the international break before his side snatched a 3-2 win at home to Burnley thanks to Bruno Fernandes' 97th-minute penalty. Off the back of the Red Devils' worst-ever Premier League finish last term which saw them miss out of European football, Amorim was backed with £216.8million worth of signings in the summer transfer window.",
      "\"I do,\" Owen replied. \"I would be pro Amorim. I like what I hear and what I see. I'd like to see quicker progress. And I'm not saying he's exempt from any criticism at all. I expected him to be doing better sooner.",
      "\"United have churned so many great managers that people need to realise that it's not the managers. There's something more deep-rooted within the club, the players, the staff, the ownership, the manager, the whole thing has got to grow and improve. That will take a bit of time.",
      "\"Changing the manager every two minutes is going to put them back rather than forward. So I would stick with him. Absolutely. He's got the right head on his shoulders. It'll take time, but I think he will get it right in the future.\"",
      "Owen went on to argue that barring their humiliating defeat to fourth-tier Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, United have had a 'solid enough start' to what Amorim hopes will be his first full season at Old Trafford. \"Grimsby was pretty grim, wasn't it?\" the former England star acknowledged.",
      "\"But apart from that, I think it's been a solid enough start. Being the better team against Arsenal, drawing away at Fulham and beating Burnley, on the face of it, they're reasonably positive results.",
      "Will Ruben Amorim be successful at Manchester United? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"Listen, I'm not saying it's been great, but four points out of three games, it's not the worst. It's not the worst start. The Grimsby game was a killer. That was just not pretty at all. That was something that obviously the club didn't need at all.",
      "\"But I like some of the signings that they've made and think they'll be a better team this year. I think there will be progress. It will be slow progress, but they seem to have gone for a few proven players in their business this year and this season.\"",

Owen, who starred for the likes of Liverpool and Real Madrid, assertively claimed in conversation with former Manchester United team-mate Rio Ferdinand that he was better than Rooney at the age of 17.",

You were aware of players and his name, but didn't see him unless it was on Match of the Day or something like that.",

      "It would be a huge boost if Cunha is available for the derby at the Etihad. It feels like only a matter of time before he scores his first goal for the club and it was a shame to see him forced off against Burnley.",
      "Cunha has hit the ground running after signing from Wolves this summer, which shows the benefit of signing Premier League-proven players, as they do not need time to adjust to the league.",
      "There was excitement in the stands every time Cunha touched the ball against Arsenal, he hit the post and was denied by Bernd Leno against Fulham and looked just as sharp before picking up an injury against Burnley.",
      "And aside from Cunha's obvious attacking qualities, he is exactly the player you want to start in a derby because he fights for every ball, runs himself into the ground and battles for duels.",
      "Every United fan will be hoping for a positive update when Amorim speaks at his press conference.",

      "Andre Onana has completed his loan move from Manchester United to Trabzonspor.",
      "The goalkeeper has moved to Turkey for the rest of the campaign having fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford. Trabzonspor will cover Onana's entire wages during the stint.",
      "United added Belgian stopper Senne Lammens to their squad on deadline day, while Altay Bayindir has started all three Premier League games so far this season.",
      "Onana's only involvement has come in the Carabao Cup. He played the full game in the shock defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town and was at fault for at least one of the Mariners' goals as United lost on penalties following a 2-2 draw.",
      "The 29-year-old has not played a league game for United since mid May's defeat to Chelsea and missed pre-season due to injury.",
      "He was then overlooked for the season opener against Arsenal despite being fit and has remained behind Bayindir despite unconvincing appearances from the Turkey international.",
      "Bayindir seems set to retain the number one jersey for the Manchester derby on Sunday while veteran Tom Heaton is the third senior option.",
      "Onana departs a little over two years since joining United from Inter Milan for an initial £43.8million. He had helped the Serie A side to the Champions League final in 2023 but has failed to convince since joining United, making a number of high-profile errors.",
      "He could make his debut for Trabzonspor in Sunday's game against Fenerbahce, where he could come up against former Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson who recently left the Etihad for Istanbul.",

      "Amad turned the Manchester derby on its head in the space of just a few minutes in December.",
      "Manchester United were trailing 1-0 with three minutes of the 90 remaining. Amad intelligently won a penalty, which Bruno Fernandes converted, and he scored a winner almost immediately after the restart.",
      "\"You're getting sacked in the morning,\" came from the Etihad away section. Amad was pushed towards the travelling fans by his teammates at full-time and he kissed the badge on the shirt.",
      "It felt like Amad's coming-of-age moment. The 23-year-old single-handedly inspired a spectacular comeback victory against City at the Etihad, and he built on that display by scoring an equaliser against Liverpool at Anfield and a hat-trick against Southampton in the next month.",
      "Amad was in contention to win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award. Fernandes described him as \"unstoppable\", which is why he had earned undroppable status in the dressing room.",
      "It has been just nine months since Amad's heroics in the Manchester derby, two of which were pre-season, and it's possible he will be benched for United's clash with City on Sunday.",
      "Amad and Fernandes were the only players to start in each pre-season friendly this summer, which reflected their importance, but Amad was named on the bench for the opening Premier League game.",
      "Ruben Amorim introduced Amad in the second half against Arsenal. Amad subsequently started at right-wing back against Fulham at Craven Cottage, but he was replaced in the 52nd minute.",
      "Amad played his first full 90 minutes of the season against Burnley before the international break and he won the penalty in added time to win the game. Amad performed much better against Burnley, but Amorim may feel it's best to start him on the bench against City for tactical reasons.",
      "Amorim predominantly used Amad at right-wing back throughout pre-season. The role wasn't new to him, as he sometimes played in that position last term, but there are doubts about whether he is effective there.",
      "There have been teething issues with his partnership with Bryan Mbeumo down the right, and there are question marks about Amad's defensive qualities.",
      "It wasn't a surprise to see Amad hooked at Craven Cottage last month and he was poor against Grimsby in the Carabao Cup (he was relocated to the right side No.10 role at Blundell Park).",
      "All the evidence from the opening few weeks will play into Amorim's dilemma for the derby: should he play Amad at right wing-back or go with the tried-and-tested option in that role?",
      "Patrick Dorgu is likely to start on the left, leaving Amad and Diogo Dalot as the options for the right. Dalot withdrew from Portugal's squad during the international break with a minor muscle injury, but he is practically always available and it would be a surprise to see him fail a fitness test to be involved.",
      "Dorgu and Dalot were selected to start against Arsenal on the opening day of the season. Amorim went with the pragmatic option, Dalot, instead of selecting Amad, who is more attack-minded down the right.",
      "The decision will be taken out of Amorim's hands if Dalot is ruled out of the derby, but Amorim has often adopted for a risk-adverse approach against 'better' opposition, which suggests Dalot might get the nod.",
      "It would be a blow for Amad to miss out on starting at the Etihad, the scene of one of his finest moments in his United career. However, he may have to settle for a role from the bench.",
      "That could also be in Amorim's thinking ahead of Sunday. Amad's fresh legs from the bench could have a game-changing impact, and he is an excellent option considering he would start for most top-flight teams.",
      "Amad would be disappointed to be named on the bench, but Amorim might feel it's for the best.",

      "The Glazer family approved Antony's departure from Manchester United on deadline day.",
      "Antony enjoyed a successful loan at Real Betis in the second half of last season and he held out for a permanent move to Seville throughout the summer transfer window, but negotiations went down to the wire.",
      "The winger travelled to Spain on a private jet alongside his agent, Junior Pedroso, to complete a move to Betis with hours of the transfer window remaining. United received a fixed fee of €22million (£19m), with a potential €3m (£2.6m) in add-ons, and included a 50 per cent sell-on clause in the deal.",
      "Speaking to ABC Sevilla, Real Betis' CEO provided an insight into the negotiations. Ramon Alarcon admitted it was a difficult transfer to get over the line and revealed Betis were forced to wait for the Glazer family to sign off the deal.",
      "Earlier this year, sources confirmed the Glazers retain the right to sign off and veto deals, even though co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has control of football operations at Old Trafford.",
      "“There was a moment when we saw it was lost because United’s position was difficult,” Alarcon said of the discussions to sign the winger.",
      "“We had a difference of €5m/€6m and had already reached our limit. In the end, we all made an effort, we did our part, and so did the player and United.",
      "“On Sunday, during the match against Athletic, the relationship was very tense. Around noon, United sent the draft contract and asked us to make the changes. It was clear that they were going to comply with our requests.",
      "“In the early hours of Sunday morning, at 2am, we received confirmation. In the morning, we closed the accounting for Antony’s future capital gains because we wanted to have the ability to recover the investment.",
      "\"It was one of the most problematic points, but we resolved it. Sunday at 2am is when the situation was unblocked, and we started looking for a plane so he could come on Monday afternoon.",
      "\"There was still a bit of stress because everything was agreed upon, but we had to wait for the Manchester United owners in the United States to sign, and they did so at 3pm on Monday.”",
      "Betis struggled to finance a deal for Antony and Alarcon had to get creative to get the deal done.",
      "“We’ve launched a clothing line with Antony, we’re participating with him through royalties, and he’ll also have some non-sporting income from that merchandising,\" he explained.",
      "“If he ends up being the world star he has been, we at Betis hope to recover the investment and even what it cost us the previous year. It carries a certain risk because this is locked in for five years and at a high cost, but you can potentially reap benefits.",
      "“It’s the most difficult signing I’ve made as CEO because there was a lot of pressure from all the Betis fans. It was taken for granted that he was coming, everyone was asking when he was coming.”",
      "United signed Antony in an £86m deal from Ajax on a five-year contract in the summer of 2022. The winger scored just five Premier League goals during his time at Old Trafford.",

      "Despite the transfer window closing over a week ago, Manchester United are still being linked with players from across Europe. With Ruben Amorim unable to bring in more players, the focus has now shifted to offloading some of the squad.",
      "The transfer windows in Saudi Arabia and Turkey remain open, so there may see some departures from Old Trafford. Although the summer transfer window has closed in England, several United players could be on their way out as the trading periods in Saudi Arabia and Turkey are still active.",
      "Goalkeeper Andre Onana is one player who has left after securing a season-long loan move to Trabzonspor on Thursday. Tyrell Malacia's loan move to Elche fell through, but a temporary switch to Eyupspor is reportedly on the cards.",
      "However, there were reports on Wednesday evening suggesting that the defender was not keen on the move. Meanwhile, potential future signings are also being considered, with a long-term plan in place for Brighton's Carlos Baleba after United were unable to finalise a deal this summer.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is reportedly being 'monitored' by Juventus. Tuttosport claim that the Dutch forward has 'fans' in Turin.",
      "Juve have been linked with Zirkzee in the past - mainly during the January transfer window. Although a move did not materialise, Juve chief Giuntoli has not dismissed the prospect of the Serie A club making a move for him. As quoted by Football Italia, he said: \"Zirkzee? It's not appropriate to mention names, but we are keeping an eye on any interesting opportunities, and we will move to strengthen.\"",

      "Onana made just one appearance for United this season which came in the Carabao Cup.",
      "There have been conflicting verdicts on how much Adam Wharton is worth amid Manchester United transfer links.",
      "A new midfielder was wanted by Ruben Amorim in the summer but United failed with their move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba. Interest in Wharton followed soon after that with the 21-year-old perhaps not receiving the plaudits his performances deserve.",
      "The lack of external hype in his game is reflected in his CIES Observatory ranking, which states a \"fair market\" value for his services is between £39m and £46m.",
      "It's far away from Palace's reported £100m price tag - a figure slated as \"mad\" and \"daft\" by Jamie Carragher - but's it's a significant rise from his January value of £28m, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "Manchester United were focused on a goalkeeper signing in the final hours of the summer transfer window but attempts were made to bring in an attacker, according to reports.",

      "Remember, Mike Maignan is a free transfer next summer, so there will be experienced goalkeepers available.",

      "Bruno Fernandes departing Manchester United for the Saudi Pro League in January has not been ruled out, according to reports.",
      "Approaches from the Middle East were made for the United captain this summer but those were turned down. Interest remains though with journalist Graeme Bailey, via TBR Football, claiming a move could even go through in 2026.",
      "At one point in the summer, the Pro League thought Bruno was coming, but they understood his reasoning for staying. It is Amorim’s first full campaign as United boss, so he felt the need, as captain, to stay.",
      "However, I am told that Fernandes’ situation is far from settled and come the New Year, it is one to keep an eye on when it comes to the Pro League. Fernandes is one of the few players they are prepared to pay good money for.",

      "Manchester United defender Noussair Mazraoui appreciates Ruben Amorim's \"harsh\" way of communicating.",
      "Mazraoui came on from the bench against Burnley to make his first appearance of the season. He had been absent since suffering a small injury in the opening pre-season friendly against Leeds in Sweden.",
      "The Morocco international is now in his second season at Old Trafford. Mazraoui was signed from Bayern Munich for €15million (£12.8m), with a possible €5m (£4.2m) in add-ons, in the summer of 2024 and he made an impressive 57 appearances in all competitions in his debut campaign.",
      "Mazraoui was signed by Erik ten Hag, who he previously worked with at Ajax, but he continued to be an important member of the dressing room following Ruben Amorim's appointment.",
      "Speaking to The National, Mazraoui was asked about Amorim and said: \"He is a great manager, a great person. I really love to work with him. I like him a lot.",
      "\"His way of thinking, his way of managing, his way of talking. He's like a manager with a lot of values, which I have the same. So, yeah, that works great together.\"",
      "Explaining Amorim's values, he added: \"Being always respectful, being always honest. Never lies, says how it is without any edge. Sometimes it can be harsh, but I'd rather have that it's the truth and a little bit harsh than a lie. And that it's, you know, it kind of sweetens things up.\"",
      "Mazraoui admitted it was difficult when Ten Hag was sacked. \"Yeah, of course, because he was also a reason I came to the club. You come to a club because for the club itself, but also for the manager,\" he said.",
      "\"I worked some good years with him at Ajax, so that's also one of the reasons I came here. And then if he's gone after two or three months, that's never nice, because you feel also responsible for that. Because if the players perform, the manager stays, it's that simple.\"",
      "Mazraoui went on to discuss the different positions he has played in at United. \"I've been playing now a very long time as the right full-back. And lately also the right centre-back,\" he said.",
      "\"Right full-back is my favourite position, my best position as well. That's where everything goes automatic. When I get the ball, I know my options. I know what I can do, what I can't do. I know how to defend. It's less thinking, it's more enjoying.\"",

      "The price on Carlos Baleba's head was reportedly £100million during the summer transfer window just gone.",
      "Having already spent close to £200m on Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, Manchester United were unsurprisingly reluctant to part with such a huge some of money. The £89m United forked out to sign Paul Pogba in 2016 is still United's record transfer, despite other big money flops coming and going at Old Trafford.",
      "At the time, the former United academy star had reached the Champions League final, scoring and assisting at will for Juventus. Ruben Amorim's side would have had to break the £100m barrier for the first time in United history to sign Baleba, a promising defensive midfielder who does not command the same reputation as Pogba did at the time he completed his move to Old Trafford.",
      "The CIES Football Observatory states a \"fair price\" for Baleba is estimated to be between £65m and £75m. However, his value is only going to get larger, as Transfermarkt states his value was as low as £17m in January 2024.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "We are all through the looking glass, a world where three of the Premier League's top five most expensive players are deep-lying midfielders (Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez and Declan Rice).",
      "The latter is particularly significant, as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanted to sign Rice before his fee shattered the £100m barrier. In April 2021, a matter of months before Rice impressed for England in the Three Lions run to the Euro 2020 final, Solskjaer was interested in the then West Ham United ace.",
      "Figures from Transfermarkt at the time stated his market value was hovering at around £52m, a price tag which was deemed to be too much by United. Similarly to Baleba, West Ham demanded £100m for Rice, with ex-United boss David Moyes making it perfectly clear he did not want to sell the midfielder.",
      "In March last year, Solskjaer made it clear he wanted to sign Rice while speaking to the Overlap. He said: \"I really like him [Declan Rice] as a player – we discussed him a few times, and I think we would’ve done well with him in midfield.",
      "\"His legs, covering the pitch, and I think he improved a lot on his playmaking as well. Obviously, he would’ve cost some money, but we could’ve and should’ve gone for him.\"",
      "Energy is a huge problem for United and unless there was a huge fallout, Rice would still be anchoring the Reds' midfield, perhaps as captain, if Solskjaer had got his way. Baleba would require a huge investment, but at the age of 21, his value is only going to grow.",
      "Dithering and delaying may result in United being completely priced out or falling out of favour in Baleba's mind, with other clubs such as Chelsea also previously expressing their admiration in the Cameroonian. Defensive midfield has quickly become, arguably, the most important position on the pitch.",
      "Most of United's struggles can be traced back to their difficulty to dominate the midfield. A long term solution in Baleba may be within their reach, but they must act fast if they want to avoid missing out on another gem, just as they did with Rice.",

      "The Manchester derby needs no introduction but this weekend's offering feels one of the most pivotal in recent memory.",
      "Neither side is in great shape after the opening three games of the Premier League season, with City heading into the contest on the back of successive defeats as questions linger over whether the Blues can challenge for the title.",
      "For United, the victory over Burnley last time out provided a much-needed fillip for Ruben Amorim heading into the international break and means United head into the derby above City in the table.",
      "United won the corresponding fixture last season with two late goals in a dramatic 2-1 win and a repeat outcome would give Amorim and his squad a shot in the arm.",
      "The United chief faces several intriguing selection calls for the cross-city trip, not least over who to start in goal.",
      "With Andre Onana set to secure a loan switch to Turkish side Trabzonspor in the coming hours, Altay Bayindir will compete with new arrival Senne Lammens for the No. 1 spot.",
      "Bayindir has started all three league games so far this campaign but has failed to convince, while throwing Lammens in for a derby would be a big call.",
      "Amorim has shown he is not afraid to make significant decisions and if Lammens is the future, then making him the present has to be the move.",
      "Perhaps the other big call for the weekend comes at wing back, even if the biggest issues are in midfield. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes have been the first-choice partnership in the middle this season and it's hard to see Kobbie Mainoo or Manuel Ugarte coming into the side unless Fernandes is moved further forward amid injury concerns to Mason Mount and Mathues Cunha.",
      "The latter has teased the prospect of being fit for the weekend on social media and if one of him or Mount is available, you feel Fernandes stays in a deeper role. Even without either, Joshua Zirkee or Amad could fill in.",
      "The latter was the matchwinner at the Etihad last term but has been pushed into a wing back role for United this season. Having his ability and work-rate on the pitch feels imperative.",
      "Yet Amorim may well prefer the security of Diogo Dalot - who is an injury concern himself after pulling out of the Portugal squad last week - with Patrick Dorgu on the other side.",
      "Leaving Amad out for a big game would feel unfair on the 23-year-old, and would raise questions as to whether the Ivorian will find minutes in high profile games this season.",
      "Derby day will provide a clear indicator of Amorim's trail of thought. It's a thinking process the United boss has to get right.",

      "Paul Pogba has shared a mysterious message on social media as he edges closer to his return to professional football following a two-year absence.",
      "The former Manchester United midfielder hasn't featured since testing positive for a banned substance during his second stint at Juventus, but is now firmly on the road back to action. The Frenchman's initial four-year suspension was cut to 18 months following an appeal, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling his doping violation was 'not intentional', clearing him to resume playing in March 2025.",
      "The wait has extended slightly beyond that timeframe, but Pogba, whose £89million return from Juventus is still United's record transfer, has secured a new club in Monaco. Perhaps after looking back on a difficult four years, Pogba had a cryptic message for his Instagram followers.",
      "In an 11-word message uploaded to his social media page, he said: \"You stay grounded in faith, even when the path isn't clear.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Pogba was handed a provisional October comeback date upon his arrival at Stade Louis II, though manager Adi Hutter seems prepared to allow him additional time to reach the standard required for top-level performance. According to reports in France, Hutter doesn't anticipate having Pogba available before the October international break but is optimistic about his return shortly afterwards.",
      "Speaking about the Frenchman, Hutter said: \"After the next international break, I think we'll be able to see him play for AS Monaco. He's on the right track.",
      "\"It's taking a little longer than for Ansu (Fati, who arrived on loan from Barcelona), but he's doing well. I wouldn't say I'm surprised, but I'm impressed by what he's doing every day to come back. He's a very professional player. I hope to see him again after the next international break.\"",
      "Pogba's projected return date suggests he may not be fit in time to face Manchester City in the Champions League on October 1. However, Hutter has included him in Monaco's Champions League squad, meaning the French international could potentially play later in the league phase against Tottenham, Real Madrid or Juventus.",
      "The World Cup-winning midfielder was visibly moved in his signing video and discussed the moment with club media. He said: \"It's true that I was overwhelmed with emotion at that moment.",
      "\"I must say that it's very rare to see me cry like that, so I hope you enjoyed it. A lot of images that came to mind, in relation to what I went through.",
      "\"So to come back and sign for AS Monaco, for a club that believed in me, all of that came back to me at the moment of my signing, which meant that I couldn't hold back.",
      "\"But above all, it was a moment of joy! But I also feel a lot of determination in me, and I think I made the best choice in coming here.\"",
      "Monaco secured third place in Ligue 1 last season to earn Champions League qualification and currently sit fourth in the table following three matches of the new campaign. On Saturday they make the trip to Auxerre with the aim of claiming their first away points of the new season.",

      "Manchester United rebuilt their frontline without maintaining the engine over the summer.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have looked bright this season, while the jury is most definitely still out on Benjamin Sesko. The club is more than aware they will often find themselves overpaying for players, as a result of reckless and vast spending habits from the past.",
      "A £100million price-tag was slapped on Carlos Baleba, who remained at Brighton and Hove Albion this summer. In and amongst the headlines linking the Cameroonian to Old Trafford, Adam Wharton was pirouetting and passing his way through games under the radar at Crystal Palace.",
      "With his buzzcut short back and sides, rolled down socks and modest goals and assists tally - seven goals and 18 assists in 147 appearances in all competitions including the Championship - Wharton has not been heralded in the media like many of his English counterparts. His less than glamorous exterior may prompt many to brand him a hard worker, rather than the technically gifted maestro he is.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "He is dictating games for Palace, moving the ball forward at will and acting as a defensive blanket for his backline. Elliott Anderson grabbed the headlines, rightly, for his display against Serbia for England, but it may have been Wharton's name up in lights, had the Palace man not pulled out of the squad with an injury.",
      "The lack of external hype in his game is reflected in his CIES Observatory ranking, which states a \"fair market\" value for his services is between £39m and £46m.",
      "It's far away from Palace's purported £100m price tag - a figure slated as \"mad\" and \"daft\" by Jamie Carragher - but's it's a significant rise from his January value of £28m, according to Transfermarkt.",
      "It could rise even further, as reports from the Sun before transfer deadline day claimed Wharton has Real Madrid's attention. The Spanish powerhouses have been sniffing out free agents like bargain hunting sharks.",
      "But, their interest in Wharton, whose deal at Selhurst Park does not expire until 2029, suggests they view the midfielder as an investment potentially worth making.",
      "Real Madrid know few players turn them down. The European heavyweights will happily wait for contracts to expire or prices to drop when they've planted visions of the iconic white shirt and the Bernabeu in their target's mind.",
      "United still hold significant cache, as Cunha and Mbeumo's snubbing of Newcastle and Tottenham respectively, has demonstrated. But this will continue to wane with every poor campaign.",
      "The Red Devils may need to act fast, maybe even in January, if they want to bring Wharton to United. If a bidding war with Real Madrid takes place, Los Blancos will fancy their chances.",
      "They may not have the stomach to win a financial bidding war, but they are in a better position to win the player's minds. Wharton may not get the crowd of their feet with goals and assists, but he can plug all sorts of holes in the United midfield, in which there are many.",
      "In the same way United pinpointed their forward line targets in the summer window just gone, similar action may be needed for the Palace ace next year.",

      "It is unclear at the time of writing how long the teenager will be out of action, but his caption of \"Life can't get worse\" points to how heartbroken he is at being unable to play the game he loves.",

      "Born in London when his father Robin played for Arsenal, Shaqueel van Persie is now 18 and a Dutch youth international. The forward has begun his career at Feyenoord, where his dad took over as first team manager in February, and has played for the Rotterdam side's academy in the UEFA Youth League.",
      "United legend David's middle son Romeo had a bit of a false start to his football career, spending time out of the game after a stint in Arsenal's academy. After returning to the game with Inter Miami, he had a year with Brentford's B team but ended up hanging up his boots for good at the age of 22.",
      "Kasper Schmeichel was just seven years old when he was pictured during United's double celebrations with father Peter in 1994, but 22 years later he became a Premier League champion in his own right. Now 38, the former Leicester and Manchester City keeper is on Celtic's books.",
      "Scotland international midfielder Darren came through United's academy before winning the Champions League with the club, and his twin sons are looking to follow suit. England Under-18 midfielder Jack was on the bench for five Premier League games last term, while his brother Tyler has played in the same team as him for United's Under-21s this season.",
      "Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo fired United to trophies in the first of two Old Trafford spells, and his 15-year-old son - also named Cristiano - made his Under-15s debut for Portugal in May. The teenager, currently in the academy of his father's club Al Nassr, scored twice for his country's under-15s in a win against Croatia this year.",
      "Jamaica striker Johnson came through United's academy but arguably played his best football with Nottingham Forest. His son Brennan also made a big impact at the City Ground, and scored the winner against United for Tottenham Hotspur in last season's Europa League final.",
      "Henrik's Manchester United spell was short but sweet, and son Jordan - like Brennan Johnson - came back to haunt his father's former club. The Sweden international, who has also played club football in Russia and Germany, was part of the FC Copenhagen side which stunned United in the 2023/24 Champions League - though he missed a penalty in the reverse fixture",
      "Plenty of former United stars have carved out solid lower-league careers, including Andy Cole's son Devante and Steve Bruce's son Alex (who also had a couple of years in the Premier League). Paul Ince's son Tom has been a real mainstay up and down the pyramid, though, coming through the academy of United's rivals Liverpool and is now closing in on a 500th senior league appearance at the age of 33."

      "Andre Onana furiously ranted at Harry Maguire when a slack pass from the defender gifted Borussia Dortmund a chance during Manchester United's final pre-season friendly in the USA in 2023.",
      "Maguire kept his cool while he was berated. Some fans said the reaction was unnecessary in a friendly, while other supporters were pleased to see Onana quickly lay down the law.",
      "Just weeks later, Onana was fortunate not to chuck away three points against Wolves on his debut when he crashed into Sasa Kalajdzic in the box and failed to make contact with the ball.",
      "Wolves were denied a blatant penalty and the PGMOL apologised to a dumbfounded Gary O'Neil.",
      "Onana got away with the huge error on his debut, but the episode foreshadowed his topsy-turvy stint at Old Trafford, which has culminated in Trabzonspor being on the cusp of signing him on loan.",
      "Onana signed from Inter Milan in a deal worth £47million and was expected to be a transformative signing. In reality, he has struggled to back up his vociferous nature with substance.",
      "The Cameroon international's performances in the Champions League group stage in his first season were error-strewn. And the first mistake Onana made came during a narrow defeat to Bayern Munich in September 2023, allowing Leroy Sane's tame shot to trickle through his fingertips.",
      "Onana requested to speak to the media following the final whistle, saying: \"I'm the one who let the team down. The team were good, but because of me, we didn't win this game, so we just have to move on. This is the life of a goalkeeper and if we didn't win today, it's on me.\"",
      "United fans respected Onana for taking responsibility for his error during the interview. Two clean sheets followed that night in Germany and it seemed like he'd turned a corner.",
      "But an awful performance in the Champions League against Galatasaray, in which he gifted the opposition a penalty and went down far too easily for the matchwinner, followed.",
      "There was redemption against Copenhagen, with Onana saving a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 1-0 victory, but United finished bottom of their group with just four points.",
      "Onana was partly to blame for the club's worst performance in the Champions League group stage.",
      "He began to improve in the winter, demonstrating impressive resilience to deliver strong displays in the Premier League. He notably kept a clean sheet in an ugly 0-0 draw against Liverpool at Anfield in December 2023, becoming the first goalkeeper to do so that season. He ended his first season strongly and started 2024/2025 in the same vein of form.",
      "Onana won the Premier League's save of the month award for his double stop against Crystal Palace in September 2024 and somehow bettered it against Fenerbahce in October. Then it all started to go downhill for when United lost 2-0 against Arsenal in December.",
      "The Cameroon international conceded two goals from corners, which was followed by a mistake against Nottingham Forest and another error against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League.",
      "Then the Lyon debacle happened in April. Nemanja Matic said Onana was \"statistically one of the worst goalkeepers in Man United modern history\" before the first leg, and Onana was subsequently at fault for both goals.",
      "United pulled off a special victory against Lyon in the reverse match at Old Trafford and Onana sprinted to embrace Ruben Amorim on the touchline when Maguire got him out of jail.",
      "But fans lost patience with Onana last season and will be relieved to see him leave on loan.",
      "Erratic is probably the perfect word to describe Onana. He is not a goalkeeper who can be relied upon and can make embarrassing howlers at unexpected moments during matches.",
      "United allowed David de Gea to leave upon the expiry of his contract in the summer of 2023 because his mistakes had become too regular and some performances were indefensible.",
      "Onana has made a similar number of errors at United without having the previous credit that De Gea had banked. It was still the correct decision to allow De Gea to leave because United needed to sign a modern goalkeeper, but it's impossible to reject the suggestion that the succession was botched.",
      "Onana prepared for this season under the assumption he would remain at Old Trafford, but Amorim has axed him from his plans and a joint decision was made to send him on loan.",
      "Altay Bayindir has begun the campaign as first choice between the sticks. Onana was recalled to face Grimsby in the Carabao Cup and made a mistake for their second goal, which means he has made a shocking nine errors leading to a goal since the beginning of last season.",
      "Sources close to the player have noted he will receive a pay rise in Turkey, partly due to the low tax rate for Super Lig players and the signing-on fee he will receive. They are clutching at straws to try to find positives.",
      "Onana has suffered a spectacular fall from grace. He started in a Champions League final in June 2023, but will now play for a club that is not even considered among Turkey's traditional powerhouses.",
      "The failure to cut out mistakes has cost Onana his career in Manchester.",

      "On deadline day, club sources were unable to clarify how Lammens' arrival would impact the goalkeeper hierarchy, but a decision has now been made to ship out Onana to Turkey.",
      "Onana made high-profile mistakes against Nottingham Forest, Viktoria Plzen and Lyon last season, and he clashed with Nemanja Matic on the eve of facing Lyon in the Europa League quarter-final first leg.",
      "Matic said Onana is \"one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United history\" at a press conference. The midfielder added Onana needed to \"take care\" of what he had been talking about.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Christian Eriksen has completed his move to Bundesliga club Wolfsburg after being released by the Reds at the end of last season.",
      "The Dane made over 100 appearances for United after leaving Brentford on a free transfer in 2022. After three years at the club, the decision was made to allow Eriksen to leave Old Trafford at the expiry of his contract.",
      "Eriksen was offered the chance to sign for Hollywood-owned Wrexham in the Championship but turned the opportunity down. Recently, he has been training at Swedish club Malmo to keep his fitness levels high.",
      "However, with the summer window now shut, the 33-year-old has managed to put pen to paper in Germany. Discussing his move to Wolfsburg, the Dane said: \"VfL Wolfsburg is my first club in the Bundesliga – I’m really looking forward to this new adventure.",
      "\"I’m convinced we can achieve something together at Wolfsburg. The talks with the club bosses went very well.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I immediately sensed that Paul Simonis has a clear vision for the team and for me personally. The fact that there are several familiar faces in the squad from the Danish national team makes VfL a particularly attractive proposition for me.\"",
      "Having acquired the signature of Eriksen, Wolfsburg's sporting director Sebastian Schindzielorz explained what drew the club to completing the deal. \"We’re really pleased that this opportunity has arisen for us at short notice,\" he said.",
      "\"In Christian Eriksen, we’re getting a player who has seen and experienced everything at the highest level. His enormous experience, his quality on the pitch and his personality will be a valuable boost to our young players in particular.",
      "\"We’ve deliberately made structural changes this summer and signed several talented youngsters with great potential. Christian will complement our experienced captain, Max Arnold, perfectly.",
      "\"He’s a true leader who can make a difference on and off the pitch.\" Eriksen could make his debut for his new club on Saturday when they host Koln in the Bundesliga.",

      "Manchester United loanee Rasmus Hojlund has sent his support to Ayden Heaven after the centre-back shared a cryptic post of boxing legend Mike Tyson.",
      "Heaven has found game time hard to come by so far this season having only made a three minute cameo in the Premier League away at Fulham. When the Englishman joined in January, he was thrust straight into the spotlight of the first-team as injuries forced Ruben Amorim into playing the teenager.",
      "The former Arsenal man is still a firm member of the first-team squad but could lose his place on the bench once Lisandro Martinez returns from injury. With Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw's long-term futures most likely away from United, this may well be just a temporary setback for the promising defender.",
      "During the September international break, Heaven was called up to the England U20s squad which hosted Italy at Chesterfield's SMH Group Stadium. The defender played 65 minutes in North Derbyshire before being replaced in the 2-1 friendly defeat.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Now back with United at Carrington, the 18-year-old shared a few images from his time with the England set-up before ending the post with an image of Tyson sitting in his dressing room with his trainer Cus D'Amato watching over him. The reason behind including Tyson in the post is unclear but a number of United players responded to the post.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes, Matthijs de Ligt, Patrick Dorgu and Leny Yoro were among the United players to 'like' the post while Hojlund simply replied: \"Cool,\" in the comments section. The striker is currently on loan at Napoli after agreeing a summer transfer deadline day exit to the Italian club.",
      "After Benjamin Sesko was bought from RB Leipzig, it became clear that Hojlund's game time was going to become seriously impacted. Once Italian clubs started to show interest, the Dane leaned towards Napoli as they offered him long-term certainty.",
      "Hojlund has joined Napoli on loan but will make his switch permanent for £38m should certain conditions be met this season. As for Heaven, he will be hopeful of a place in the United squad on Sunday when they travel to Manchester City.",

      "Manchester United agreed to sign Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers one day after their season ended this summer.",
      "Less than 24 hours after they concluded their post-season tour in Hong Kong, the club confirmed they had agreed to the signing, subject to visa and registration. United confirmed the transfer 11 days later on June 12, after Cunha signed a contract.",
      "That was the first time they signed a player in June for six years, dating back to Daniel James joining the club from Swansea City. United, though, will not be able to make moves at such an early stage of next summer.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Neither will any other clubs, because the summer window will not open until June 15. This year, the window began on June 1, the day United announced their agreement to sign Cunha, but that was an earlier date than usual due to the Club World Cup kicking off on June 14.",
      "As such, FIFA allowed for an extraordinary transfer window to run between June 1-10 before reopening on June 16. But with no Club World Cup this coming summer - the next edition is scheduled for 2029 - normal service will resume.",
      "The window will instead start during the early days of the World Cup across Canada, Mexico and the United States on June 15. Clubs, however, can still agree on signings before the market begins.",
      "It means that, in 2026, United will not be permitted to conduct activity as early as they did to sign Cunha. Instead they will be required to wait until the transfer window opens at a more regular time on June 15.",
      "Manchester United have unveiled their new third kit for the 2025/26 season.",
      "United director of football Jason Wilcox expressed the club's delight at being able to recruit Cunha so quickly this summer. \"Bringing in Matheus was one of our main priorities for this summer, so we are delighted to have completed his signing so early in the window,\" he said.",
      "The player also alluded to the advantage of signing before the players returned for training. \"I can't wait for the start of pre-season to get to know my team-mates and prepare for the season ahead,\" he said.",

      "The Premier League roars back after the international break with an absolute cracker of a weekend in store.",
      "There’s a Manchester derby where the Heavyweight Crisis Club belt is on the line, there’s the return of Ange Postecoglou, there’s the prospect of Alexander Isak and all manner of other shiny late-summer signings making their debuts, and in the Championship the long-awaited return of a south-coast derby to the league schedule after a 13-year absence.",
      "It is, in short, a very Big Weekend. Enjoy.",
      "A Sunday afternoon treat in store for us all in one of those games absolutely guaranteed to provide narrative out the wazoo no matter what happens.",
      "The fixture computer has been cruel indeed to Manchester City, compelling them to play their first two home games against the teams who inflicted the most embarrassing league defeats upon them at the Etihad last season.",
      "History has already repeated itself thanks to Spurs’ alarmingly controlled and tension-free 2-0 victory a few weeks ago, and City really cannot afford any kind of repeat of the late nonsense United pulled on them in a 2-1 win during the depths of City’s late 2024 despair.",
      "Whoever loses this really is in big trouble.",
      "If it’s United, then the difficulty of the fixture list will provide only scant mitigation for a poor league start (not to mention the Grimsby unpleasantness) in which Ruben Amorim has been lucky to nick a point against Fulham and even luckier to beat Burnley at home.",
      "He already sits atop the reformed Sack Race now Nuno Espirito Santo has been Marinakised and has both Chelsea and Liverpool to worry about in the weeks ahead.",
      "If it’s City, then the early crisis club mantle passes to the blue half of Manchester after three straight defeats and a title challenge petering out in mid-September and renewed questions about whether Pep Guardiola has the energy or desire to follow through on building himself another great City side on the back of all 24/25’s relative struggle.",
      "The most damning thing for City would be the fact that those three straight defeats would have come without a meaningful title rival in sight; that looms with next week’s trip to the Emirates which really would start to look like a fixture that could end City’s Premier League season before we’ve even reached the second international break.",
      "Or it could be a draw, in which case no firm answers can be reached but they’re probably both f*cked.",
      "So yeah. A Sunday afternoon treat for absolutely everyone, except for anyone who supports at least one and very possibly both of these clubs.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings: 14 places between Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "",
      "Here he comes. He’s back. Angeball is inevitable.",
      "Nottingham Forest insisted they really didn’t want to get rid of Nuno Espirito Santo and had no intention to do so right up until the moment they, alas and alack, felt they simply had no choice given the breakdown in trust for which they were in no way responsible. Which all means the negotiations to appoint a replacement they hadn’t given a moment’s thought to previously were conducted in record time, with Ange Postecoglou appointed mere hours after Nuno’s midnight axe.",
      "Really, it’s just another reminder of what an efficient, well-run club Nottingham Forest are these days. That’s just the speed at which they can get things done.",
      "And another example of how efficient and clear-headed Forest are is in the way they’ve gone straight out and snaffled themselves a manager to provide seamless, frictionless continuity given the obvious similarities in the way he and Nuno operate.",
      "Yes, if unfortunate circumstances outside your control just after the end of the transfer window force you to replace the manager who last season delivered success wildly beyond any reasonable expectation, then really all you can do is go out and appoint the closest thing you can find to what you’ve lost.",
      "Or, of course, there’s the other option, which is to look at what’s worked so well for you and that departing manager and the squad you’d built for him over the last 18 months, and then appoint literally the most polar opposite manager it is possible to imagine, one whose tactics led a bigger and wealthier and far more established club to 17th place last season.",
      "It’s a genuinely brilliant slice of nonsense, this, and one that has absolutely no downside. It’s a plan so stupid that it might in fact be genius and actually work, in which case: great. There really are few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works.",
      "But do you know what is one of the few things more entertaining to watch in football these days than Angeball when it works? Angeball when it doesn’t.",
      "If you’re not enormously excited by the prospect of Nikola Milenkovic playing a high line then we really are very different people.",
      "At the other end, though, Forest absolutely do have the attacking tools to cause teams serious pain when given freedom and licence to roam and with chests swelled with pride by one of Ange’s patented inspirational team talks.",
      "There’s a reason everyone who has played for Postecoglou seems to adore the bloke. It’s just who he is, mate.",
      "And of course the fixture computer has sent him to Arsenal for his first game back in the Premier League.",
      "It’s unlikely Ange has had time to get all his ideas across to his new charges, which for this game might well be for the best. It is a bit of a free hit for him anyway. Just pump the players’ tyres and send them out there. Get any kind of result and it sets him up for potentially the sort of instant ‘WTF?’ impact he had in those very early games at Tottenham.",
      "Lose, and he can just come out in the post-match interview and say ‘Warra trophy, mate’ and he still wins. Perfect.",
      "",
      "Always a highlight of this first post-interlull matchday, of course. We’ve all been starved of delicious Barclays for an agonising, drawn-out fortnight but when it comes back it comes back strong with all those late summer signings set for debuts, from Isak against Burnley to his assorted replacements for Newcastle, to Xavi Simons and Randal Kolo Muani at Spurs, or Harvey Elliott for Villa, and the quite brilliant fact we really don’t actually know with any compelling certainty who will be in either goal for the Manchester derby.",
      "But Isak is clearly the star attraction here. Given that he’s short of match sharpness and had precious little time with his new team-mates due to confirmation of his move coming so late in the window and having to head pretty much straight off to international duty with Sweden, it’s very possible – likely even – that he is only on the bench for Liverpool at Turf Moor.",
      "That’s only a minor consolation for Burnley, though, who will have to deal with a still-elite attack posing nightmarish threats from every direction while also knowing that just as the fatigue of chasing Wirtz and Ekitike and Salah around for an hour or so really starts to kick in, they’re likely to have to deal with perhaps the Premier League’s best centre-forward stepping off the bench with sky-high motivation and myriad points to prove. Very best of luck to you.",
      "",
      "West Ham’s 3-0 win at Nottingham Forest just before the international break was perhaps the single most discombobulating result of that entire 30-match intro to the new Premier League season.",
      "Kneejerk assessments had been made of West Ham in the previous fortnight, and the consensus was clear: they were rubbish, and many people feared for them, they really did. We did. We do.",
      "But the chaotic final 10 minutes at the City Ground changed everything. It provided cover for Forest to do what they obviously wanted to do to Nuno, for one thing, but also sent the Hammers into the international break looking a very different beast and with potentially a very different season to the one everyone had prescribed for them.",
      "There is still the sense that it was just a freak nonsense. The goals coming in a rush at the end as they did certainly adds to that sense.",
      "So the challenge for Graham Potter and his players is to immediately disprove that theory. To immediately use it as a springboard to launch a season that had started so miserably.",
      "And for that reason there really are few better fixtures to follow it for West Ham than Tottenham at home. Spurs fans have long mocked West Ham for this game being the Hammers’ cup final, noise which quietened when West Ham inconveniently reached and won an actual cup final while Spurs were languishing in trophyless banterland.",
      "Last season’s Europa League win means that noise will return for a fixture that has a compelling history of high-level nonsense, one that has featured dramatic late winners for Spurs from names as varied as Paul Stalteri, Eric Dier and Gareth Bale, to Manuel Lanzini halting Tottenham’s bid to put the pressure on Chelsea in 2017 and more recent match-winning exploits from Michail Antonio and Jesse Lingard.",
      "West Ham haven’t lost at home to Tottenham since 2019, when Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge of Spurs produced a chaotic 3-2 win that was in no way whatsoever a sign of things to come.",
      "The last three have ended in 1-1 draws, and even that would be enough to give West Ham something to work with moving forward. Which really didn’t look likely after those two miserable opening defeats and pitiful Carabao exit.",

      "Juventus haven’t, in truth, been wholly convincing against either Parma or Genoa, but two wins from two games without conceding a goal is never to be sniffed at.",

World-record signing Grace Geyoro could come straight into the side, while a thin-looking United squad could well be a touch weary after a 1-0 midweek defeat in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier against Brann.",
      "That result also leaves Marc Skinner’s side likely to have one eye on the crucial return leg next week and vulnerable to a London City side who will have laser focus and history-making on their mind.",
      "Alexander Isak teams up with his two replacements in this XI of new signings who could make their debuts this weekend…",

      "After a woefully-timed international break, the Premier League returns this weekend, giving us a glimpse of a host of new signings.",
      "Because some were made to fly off immediately after completing their late-summer switches, some managers might be tempted to play it cool with their new recruits and bed them in gently.",
      "Sod that, we say…",
      "",
      "We could see two new goalkeepers in the derby; we might see none. Donnarumma feels like a more likely debutant than Senne Lammens, even if United’s need for a new stopper is greater than City’s, because this is the Etihad and big games like this are ten a penny to the Italy No.1. Might we get sight of a different City, given the obvious clash in Donnarumma’s style compared to his predecessors?",
      "",
      "The Netherlands right-back could introduce himself to the travelling Mackems at Palace on Saturday, but Trai Hulme could consider himself extremely unfortunate to be dropped given his early season form for the Black Cats and through the international break with Northern Ireland.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings: 14 places between Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "The deadline-day arrival immediately flew off to South America for international duty, during which time the Ecuador defender sparked friction with Alexis Mac Allister which we desperately hope spills over to the Premier League. Arsenal will be without William Saliba for the clash with Forest, but given Hincapie will have been in north London barely a few days before the Saturday lunchtime kick-off, it seems much more likely that Cristhian Mosquera will deputise from the start.",
      "",
      "West Ham fans’ last sight of the Brazilian defender was of him choking on Jarrod Bowen’s dust in the Europa Conference League final so they will be hoping to form a better impression when Spurs show up at the London Stadium. Julio’s participation is likely to depend on whether Graham Potter shifts to a back five, or sticks with the four that shut out Forest a fortnight ago.",
      "",
      "Forest fans are denied a first sight of Oleksandr Zinchenko because the Ukranian belongs to Saturday’s opponents, so they may have to settle for a glimpse of Savona at the Emirates. Savona is predominantly a right-back, which is where he will play on Saturday, but he can play across the back four and since we’re short of a left-back here, the Italian is doing us a favour. Good lad.",
      "",
      "As a defensive midfielder, Luis could have his work cut out against Liverpool on Sunday, just as he does in this woefully-imbalanced XI. But it represents the 26-year-old’s first opportunity to impress while he looks to secure a club-record £20.8million permanent move that Burnley have the option of completing with Benfica next summer. Should he start at Turf Moor against the champions, it would be Luis’s first of the season having come off the bench three times for Benfica prior to his big move.",
      "",
      "We’re buzzing to see what Elliott can do in a more prominent role than the odd cameo he got at Liverpool. Villa certainly need the England Under-21 star to bring the creativity against Everton since they are the only team in the top seven tiers of English football yet to score a goal.",
      "",
      "It’s a toss-up here between Simons and Randal Kolo Muani over which of the Tottenham new boys gets to do a job on the right in this XI, with the Netherlands star getting the nod on the basis he’s more likely to start for Spurs at West Ham. Simons has also played for club and country in recent weeks; Kolo Muani has done neither. After the defeat to Bournemouth in which Spurs were desperately shot-shy, Thomas Frank needs Simons to start pulling strings immediately in the London derby on Saturday evening.",
      "",
      "Liverpool could place the nation’s most expensive signing on their bench at Burnley on Sunday while Arne Slot decides how to configure all the options in his attack. Isak will also have participated in a maximum of four training sessions in the lead-up to Turf Moor, owing to the fact he flew straight to Sweden after signing his contract on deadline day. However the game is going, though, surely the travelling Reds will get a glimpse of their £125million man in action?",
      "",
      "We hope Woltemade gets off to a positive start at Newcastle, purely because he seems like a good egg. That’s reportedly the impression he’s given his new team-mates in the few sessions he’s taken part in after returning from an international break with Germany that became a trying experience for the Toon’s record signing. Eddie Howe might prefer to bed Woltemade in gently, but Newcastle’s attack desperately needs some impetus and Wolves at home seems as a good a game as any to get going.",
      "",
      "Woltemade could benefit from sharing the spotlight with Wissa, who will surely make the debut he spent all summer sulking to manufacture. Howe might have been concerned about the ex-Brentford forward’s level of fitness given his lack of a proper pre-season but Wissa played both games for Congo during the international break.",
      "",
      "The Crisis Club belt is on the line at the Etihad, Ange Postecoglou returns at the Emirates, while Alexander Isak heads a shiny list of potential debutants. That’s a Big ...",

      "Arsenal settled for Viktor Gyokeres after giving up on their interest in new Liverpool signing Alexander Isak, according to Gael Clichy.",

      "Andre Onana is the latest Erik ten Hag signing to leave under Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim, with the goalkeeper joining Trabzonspor on loan.",
      "People will say Amorim has created much of his own mess at Old Trafford with his tactical stubbornness and outspoken, speak-before-you-think nature in press conferences and interviews.",
      "But he is cleaning up an unholy mess left by his predecessor. A mess that was, admittedly, enabled by the Man Utd hierarchy.",
      "The new-ish Red Devils hierarchy has already made several mistakes. One was keeping Ten Hag after a worst-ever Premier League campaign in 2023/24. Another might well be picking Amorim as his replacement less than four months after his contract extension.",
      "There may be a vastly different boardroom, personnel-wise, but the same mistakes the old hierarchy made with Ten Hag have potentially been repeated with Amorim. And if his fate is the same, a club in transition could end up in an even bigger mess than the one the Portuguese inherited.",
      "READ: Amorim sent resignation warning as Rangnick the only Man Utd manager of six still standing",
      "In Ten Hag’s first summer at Man Utd, he was backed with a monstrous, club-record transfer window, spending £227million on Antony, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro, while Christian Eriksen joined on a free transfer and Martin Dubravka on loan.",
      "Man Utd had their foreshadowing moments, such as the 7-0 defeat at Liverpool and the Europa League meltdown against Sevilla, but overall, it was a positive first season for Ten Hag, who guided the Red Devils to third in the Premier League, the FA Cup final, and Carabao Cup glory.",
      "The club clearly got giddy and backed Ten Hag with more of ‘his own players’. Rasmus Hojlund, Mason Mount, Andre Onana, Sofyan Amrabat, Altay Bayindir, Jonny Evans and Sergio Reguilon all joined for a combined £166million.",
      "Ten Hag was clearly obsessed with signing players he had previously managed, or at least those with Eredivisie experience.",
      "That approach was again evident in a 2024 summer full of uncertainty surrounding his future, as Matthijs de Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui were among those to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Fast forward to January 2025: Amorim is two months into the job, not being backed with heavy spending because Man Utd’s hands are tied, but supported with the signing of wing-back Patrick Dorgu — a clear sign that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his board are buying into their head coach’s 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Six months, two domestic cup exits, a Europa League final defeat, and a record-low 15th-place finish in the Premier League later, they did it again.",
      "Amorim was backed with an enormous transfer kitty as the club remained confident in his managerial ability and in a formation that’s still not working.",
      "But while he has been supported with new signings and patience, he has also been tasked with finding solutions for a host of underperforming players signed by his predecessor.",
      "Onana has now followed Ten Hag signings Antony and Hojlund out under Amorim’s watch.",
      "Those are three extremely expensive mistakes. There are suggestions that Ten Hag preferred other strikers, like Harry Kane, over Hojlund, but there’s no doubt the Dutchman desperately wanted Antony and Onana, both of whom he managed at Ajax.",
      "The goalkeeper situation was one Amorim wanted to address in the summer but knew it was easier said than done with more pressing issues in attack and a restricted budget.",
      "A pre-season injury suffered by Onana got the ball rolling, as Man Utd ended up signing Senne Lammens on deadline day, with the 29-year-old falling from first to third choice in just two months.",
      "Signed for a reported £47m from Inter, Onana has now joined Trabzonspor, who finished seventh in last season’s Turkish Super Lig, on a season-long loan.",
      "It’s another catastrophic transfer loss for Man Utd, who thought they were getting a world-class goalkeeper but ended up with one of the most error-prone and least commanding keepers in the club’s recent history.",
      "Amorim might be creating his own mess, but he’s hardly being helped when he has to find new clubs for a bunch of players he knows aren’t good enough, despite costing big money under Ten Hag’s watch.",
      "READ: Man Utd goalkeepers ranked: Onana flops out of top 10 ahead of Turkey transfer",

      "Man Utd are increasingly ‘unhappy’ at how head coach Ruben Amorim deals with certain situations in the media, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils had a nightmare first campaign under the Portuguese boss with Amorim guiding Man Utd to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League, while blowing their only chance of European qualification by losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Man Utd are currently in ninth position this season after a couple of close calls some them take four points in matches against Fulham and Burnley, while they were unlucky to lose 1-0 at home to Arsenal on the opening weekend.",
      "It took a last-minute penalty from Bruno Fernandes for the Red Devils to beat newly-promoted Burnley 3-2 at Old Trafford with Amorim reportedly told that missing out on European football this season will prove ‘fatal’.",
      "It is not just performances and results that are frustrating the Man Utd hierarchy with GiveMeSport claiming that the ‘unhappy’ board are ‘wanting Amorim to tone down his emotional public outbursts’.",
      "Amorim’s decision to publicly claim that Kobbie Mainoo will be competing with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot this season ’caused collateral damage that the Red Devils’ top brass could have done without as they negotiated a tricky end to the summer window’.",
      "READ: Man Utd exposed by latest transfer mistake as Amorim let down amid two worrying Onana details",
      "Jason Wilcox ended up having to persuade Mainoo to stay late in the window and not pursue a loan move away from Old Trafford and it was ‘seen as a stupid and unnecessary move by Amorim, one lacking emotional intelligence and empathy with Manchester United’s history of homegrown young stars’.",
      "While GiveMeSport adds that there is a ‘growing feeling’ that Amorim needs to be more careful about what he says in front of the cameras before and after matches.",
      "Former Man Utd chief scout Mick Brown – who is still well-connected at Old Trafford – reckons that the Red Devils will have to ask “more questions” of Amorim if he fails to beat Man City or Chelsea after the international break.",
      "Brown told Football Insider: “A win is a win, at the end of the day. But I don’t think anybody will take confidence in the manager from a 3-2 win when you’ve dominated the game and end up relying on a penalty in the last minute.",
      "“It’s not the type of result which makes you think they’ll be able to build on it. That is what he needs to do; he needs to put a string of results together and maintain their form.”",
      "“They need to continue winning games, that’s how you ease the pressure.",
      "“After the international break, it’s Man City and then they’ve got Chelsea after that, so it won’t get easier. It’s very easy to start the season and before you know where you are, you’ve lost three or four games and all of a sudden you’re tumbling down the table.",
      "“At the moment, he’s just papering over the cracks, but a win against Burnley isn’t enough to convince people you’ve turned a corner. Those Man City and Chelsea games are going to be big for him.",
      "“I don’t necessarily think they’ll sack him even if he loses those games, because at this point it’s to be expected, but more questions will be asked.”",

      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been more than happy to drop subtle digs at the previous regime at Old Trafford, with their failures used as an excuse for their post-takeover woes.",
      "Ratcliffe has been a busy man since taking control of Man Utd, with one of many tasks being to build a “world-class” recruitment team, which includes chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "The British billionaire finally looks to have settled on his preferred team following the Dan Ashworth fiasco, and they had plenty to do in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "It is too soon to fully write off any of their incomings, though the early signs suggest Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are more likely to prove their worth than Benjamin Sesko.",
      "As for Senne Lammens, we will get an idea whether he will be an inspired signing or another dud if/when he starts against Man City this weekend.",
      "But their failure to sign a suitable No.6 to play alongside Bruno Fernandes/Kobbie Mainoo is already coming back to haunt them as they opted to be patient with a long-term pursuit of Carlos Baleba, though this signing feels far from guaranteed as other Big Six clubs linger.",
      "READ: Premier League mood rankings: 14 places between Liverpool and Man Utd",
      "And there was equal importance on exits as Man Utd desperately needed to clear out the bad eggs to give Ruben Amorim a better opportunity to thrive.",
      "For the most part, this was done successfully as Antony and Alejandro Garnacho were sold, while Rasmus Hojlund (once Napoli qualify for the Champions League) and Jadon Sancho (when his contract expires) will be gone next summer.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s situation is less cut and dried as Barcelona are reportedly planning to ‘send him home’ on one condition, while Andre Onana is set to join the England international in leaving on loan.",
      "Recent rumblings have indicated that Amorim could not wait to get rid of Onana, who has been a disruptive figure as he’s ‘refused to acknowledge’ the head coach ‘in training’.",
      "The deadline day arrival of Lammens permitted Man Utd to sanction Onana’s exit, though the club’s hierarchy were clearly not stern negotiators when it came to sorting the goalkeeper’s move to Turkish side Trabzonspor.",
      "On Wednesday night, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano said on X: “Travels to Turkey in the next 24 hours together with his agent! Plan confirmed: he’s becoming new Trabzonspor player on loan from Man United until June 2026. No buy option clause or loan fee.”",
      "It is clear that the Red Devils wanted rid of Onana by any means necessary and have struck a deal with the first club willing to take the goalkeeper and vice versa.",
      "Though the terms of this “no buy option clause or loan fee” deal is a worry for Man Utd, who have repeated a trick pulled by the previous regime as they have kicked a problem down the road and let Amorim down.",
      "After clearly buckling down to get Onana out, Man Utd will have the same problem with the goalkeeper, who is under contract until 2028, when he inevitably returns to give Amorim (or his successor) a headache.",
      "Put simply, it’s not good enough and this deal provides evidence that Man Utd are far behind Liverpool and Chelsea, who are the two best selling clubs in the world.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim sees the departure of Andre Onana this week as essential to his rebuild of the squad over the summer, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘supported the decision’ to offload Andre Onana, which has taken the 29-year-old ‘by surprise’.",

      "The end of the interlull is upon us. Congratulations everyone.",
      "We’ve made it through, and some of us without developing a weird obsession in a national newspaper for making everything about the injured Jude Bellingham.",
      "But with a heavy diet of Premier League and European football to sustain us for the next month, and the first Sack Race casualty and replacement already in the books, the time has surely come to turn our attention once more to the deeply vital and scientific business of the Premier League Mood Rankings.",
      "Fair to say we got Newcastle a bit wrong last time. Who have we got catastrophically wrong now? Let’s find out. Newcastle’s and the other slightly less wrong mid-summer rankings are in brackets.",
      "We were baffled by the response when we had Newcastle that high less than two months ago. Fair enough, we’re less baffled now. Because what we actually were was wrong. Desperately, badly wrong.",
      "Sometimes it takes a big man to admit they’ve made a mistake. And sometimes the mistake is writing ‘No apparent need to or significant risk of selling any of their many very excellent players – most notably of course Alexander Isak’ and you are so bang to rights you have no choice but to admit you’ve f*cked it.",
      "It was hilariously soon after those fateful words that the whole Alexander Isak Saga kicked off and so dominated the final six weeks of the transfer window.",
      "The good news, at least, is that we are no longer baffled by Newcastle fans feeling down in the dumps, and that surely must lift their spirits significantly. Guys? Guys? No? Fair enough, suit yourselves.",
      "As bad as the drawn-out and bitter Isak saga was the ritual humiliations Newcastle endured in trying to source a suitable replacement, and the fact that when they eventually did in bringing Yoane Wissa to St James’ Park, it played out in such a way that they all had to look awkwardly at their shoes or abandon all semblance of self-awareness after spending the previous weeks declaring Isak’s open disloyalty had brought indelible and grave shame on him and his legacy for the rest of days.",
      "Newcastle did also manage to sign Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart, but – while we’re loathe to jump to any conclusions – we’re not sure there’s ever been a more conspicuous and desperate example of the Bundesliga Tax. Suffice to say this was one deal where Newcastle were in absolutely no danger of being hijacked or gazumped at the last by a rival bid.",
      "On the field, it’s been a largely grim start to the season. The goalless draws against Villa and Leeds exposed the already very obvious weakness in Newcastle’s squad to a sarcastic degree, while the admirable heart and fight shown with 10 men against Liverpool only ended up exposing them to the most sickening of sucker-punches.",
      "BREAKING NEWS: Actually we got it wrong on Newcastle and they are ‘absolutely buzzing’.",
      "",
      "Why are you always like this? Hmm? It feels like some kind of deep-rooted self-sabotage at this point. Managers come and go, players come and go, Wolves start the season looking absolutely sh*tbone awful.",
      "Three defeats from three for a side who really did look to have landed on something in the spring is just so dispiriting, yet so on brand.",
      "They didn’t win a Premier League game until November last season, won one of their first six in 23/24, one of their first nine in 22/23, and like this season lost the first three in 21/22.",
      "There’s a glass half-full element to this, of course, in that none of those seasons ended with actual relegation. Wolves are always apparently able to drag themselves out of the trouble they’ve created for themselves in the end.",
      "But this one feels especially galling. Most clubs outside the elite suffered player drain this summer, and Wolves were no exception with Rayan Ait-Nouri and Matheus Cunha heading to Manchester, but it still surely needn’t have become this bleak this quickly.",
      "Not for a team that was giddily winning six matches in a row, scoring 15 goals in the process, only five months ago.",
      "And yet it also feels just so predictable. That run ended any lingering relegation concerns for Wolves, but when they followed it by taking just a single point from the four remaining games of the season you already just knew how this one would begin.",
      "A maddening exercise in self-fulfilling prophecies at this point. Sure, they’ll probably be fine in the end. History tells us that.",
      "But history also tells us that a club that has had managerial changes in June 2021, October 2022, August 2023 and December 2024 might have to also make a sacrificial lamb Vitor Pereira in order to fulfil the prophecy. And that just feels like a terrible waste.",
      "",
      "There has perhaps been no individual result across the early days and weeks of this season more water-muddying than West Ham’s genuinely inexplicable 3-0 win over Nottingham Forest.",
      "It was a result that provided Mr Marinakis just enough cover to make the managerial change he – and increasingly obviously by the end even Nuno Espirito Santo himself – wanted to make at the City Ground, but what if anything does it mean for West Ham?",
      "Until then, it was all very straightforward: absolutely everything was f*cked. The team was playing football the fans hated at a stadium the fans hate under owners the fans hate and a manager whose departure already seemed to be a case of when not if.",
      "They had been slapped silly on the opening day by Sunderland, mercilessly thrashed by Chelsea, and dumped out of the Carabao by rock-bottom Wolves despite leading 2-1 going into the final 10 minutes at Molineux.",
      "A shambolic early exit from the Carabao on the back of chastening defeat to giddy promoted team and a shortcomings-exposing paddling from a title contender just appeared such classic staging posts on the road to an early managerial change that any other course of action appeared unthinkable.",
      "And then came those crazy closing minutes at the City Ground to cast doubt upon everything we thought we knew.",
      "If West Ham can follow that up with a result in their cup final on Saturday evening – and West Ham do historically reserve some of their very best nonsenses for Tottenham games – then we really won’t know what to think.",
      "",
      "We all know that league positions are decided across the entire 10 months of a season and not on the final day, but we’re all also simple creatures who love the appeal of pinning everything on that final twist of the fates.",
      "Sure, Aston Villa could have done any number of things slightly better or slightly differently at any other point of the season to ensure the final-day defeat to Manchester United didn’t end up costing them Champions League football.",
      "But they didn’t and so in the end it did. And it was such a stupid defeat, too, to such a stupid team. And the significance of its consequences are already starting to be laid bare.",
      "From Emi Martinez’s absurd red card against the team he would later unsuccessfully attempt to join to one of the more ridiculous disallowed goals we’ve ever seen in the VAR era, you have to be wilfully obtuse not to understand Villa fans’ gnawing frustration and hurt about it all.",
      "It shouldn’t necessarily have felt quite so much like a sudden jolting stop to three years of progress, and if last season taught us anything it’s that the Europa League can cover a multitude of sins, but it did feel like something ended that day.",
      "Having failed to make either Marcus Rashford or Marco Asensio’s blockbuster loan moves permanent, a slightly desperate Villa moved late in the window to throw a vast chunk of Jadon Sancho’s wages the way of a grateful Manchester United.",
      "It does rather scream of lessons not being learned at a club that continues to teeter and totter on the very brink of PSR ruin with an unsustainable wage bill.",
      "At no other club does the ranting about the unfairness of PSR feel more misplaced than Villa, who will be making all the same noise and looking anywhere but at themselves when they find themselves forced to cash in on Morgan Rogers next summer.",
      "Wild prediction time: Unai Emery won’t be at Villa Park by the time that happens. Yeah, we said it.",
      "",
      "Oh boy. The club is a mess, obviously, the team is a mess, obviously. Manchester United is now a club so consumed by banter that even when losing in the second round of the Carabao – a Carabao round where even just having to play in it while being Manchester United is already a sign of failure – to Grimsby Town isn’t the end of the banter.",
      "The revelation that Grimsby fielded an ineligible player in that tie left United in the grip of an inescapable banter prison. They had already committed the season’s most humiliating act by losing that game, and were now in a position where they either accepted that fate or looked to profit from either an expulsion or a replay. Which would arguably have been even more humiliating and would certainly have prompted even greater waves of banter.",
      "That the one saving grace of their season currently is managing to scrape past promoted Burnley 3-2 at home in a game where they tossed away two leads before having the good sense to take the third lead so late that not even they could spaff it is revealing in its own way.",
      "They are not very good, and even after spending vast sums of money after spending the last two years pleading poverty and making penny-pinching, miserly savings at the expense of ordinary employees, they are still not very good.",
      "They face Manchester City this weekend in a game that is both derby and an early-season Crisis Club play-off.",
      "And their beleaguered manager has already provided one of the season’s starkest memes by sitting playing with his little magnetic tactics board while 2-0 down. At Grimsby.",
      "Manchester United long ago stopped being the club that ruined your childhood, but through all their assorted post-Fergie struggles we’ve always just sort of blithely, unthinkingly assumed they’ll sort it all out and get back to the top one day.",
      "Just always felt like they’re simply too big for that not to happen. But as more and more time passes we find ourselves thinking that maybe they actually might not do that. This might actually be them. This might just actually be what they really are now. Quite a thought.",
      "",
      "On the field, four points from three games against Everton, Arsenal and Newcastle represents an enormously satisfactory opening to the season for any promoted team. It’s a return that sits somewhere right towards the top end of reasonable expectation for pretty much anyone outside the Big Six/Eight/Whatever from that set of games.",
      "But the mood is nowhere near as buoyant as it otherwise would be due to the unavoidable sense that Leeds and Daniel Farke were badly let down by the owners in the closing days and weeks of the window.",
      "There was some good work done early on, but the 49ers lads had made a lot of noise about setting Leeds up to truly compete in the Premier League, so to respond to Farke’s desperate yet obviously correct insistence after the final pre-interlull game that he needed two more attacking players by signing, in fact, no more attacking players has sucked all the early-season optimism out of Elland Road.",
      "Those four points have been amassed via a late and contentious penalty winner against Everton, a goalless draw against an at-the-time similarly toothless Newcastle and an in-your-place hiding from Arsenal. And it does feel rather like a blueprint has been set for Leeds games this year, one where they will be swiftly outclassed by the best and rely on everything going their way and absolutely nothing going wrong against everyone else.",
      "And the legitimate fear for fans now is that it’s all started to look like four points from those three games isn’t just a good return but an unrepeatably fortuitous one.",
      "",
      "Bournemouth are showing that good things can happen even if you lose three or four of your very best players, as long as you can keep hold of your very good manager.",
      "Brentford will, we suspect, as the season’s stagger unwinds show what happens when you lose three or four of your very best players but also what was perhaps pound-for-pound the league’s most irreplaceable manager.",
      "Even the win they have managed this season feels like one that said a lot more about the beaten Aston Villa than it did Brentford.",
      "We fear for them, we really do.",
      "",
      "Shall we be melodramatic and rule them out of the title race already? We’re very tempted to be melodramatic and rule them out of the title race already.",
      "Two defeats in the first three games of the season – neither of which came against title rivals and both of which came meekly and deservedly – is not the foundation upon which a modern title fight is built.",
      "How deep into the season will we get before Arsenal have shed six points to non-rivals? How deep before Liverpool have discarded six points to anyone?",
      "Man City are in the early days of a significant, complex and by definition difficult regeneration. But these early missteps are significant and potentially costly ones already, on the back of what was by the lofty standards Pep Guardiola has set a catastrophic 24/25 featuring no trophy of any kind and no meaningful sustained tilt at either of the big prizes.",
      "City’s and Pep’s pedigree means they do deserve to be cut more slack than others. Even his very best City teams were always (even) better at the end of a season than its beginning. There is, very, very obviously a vast amount of time for things to change.",
      "But this new-look City team is just so visibly a very early work in progress, and we remain wildly unconvinced the manager has the energy or inclination to see that progress through.",
      "READ: Amorim and United should smell City blood before Manchester derby",
      "",
      "One win, two defeats. That’s a start to the season most promoted teams would take, we reckon. And there was a fair bit of encouragement even in those defeats.",
      "The late heartbreak at Manchester United was brutal, but just being that close to that kind of away point this early in the season isn’t nothing. And even in the 3-0 opening-day defeat at Spurs, there were lengthy spells in the 55 minutes of play between Richarlison’s two goals – the second of which is an early goal-of-the-season contender – where Burnley were the better side and an equaliser appeared on the cards.",
      "But it’s still a start that comes with concerns and caveats. Their one win was against a fellow promoted side, and shipping three goals in both the games against established Premier League sides is a stark early reminder that ‘we will simply concede no goals’ was never likely to be as effective a survival tool as it was a promotion one.",
      "Burnley have already conceded only one goal fewer in the Premier League this calendar year than they did in the Championship. And their next three Premier League games are against Liverpool, a newly Angeballin’ Nottingham Forest, and Manchester City.",
      "We’re really not sure September is going to be very much fun at all, and when so many compelling survival bids from promoted teams are built on early-season momentum it still leaves us fearing the worst for them.",
      "",
      "Are running this season on a fuel of pure righteous anger and we are here for it. Had the summer window ended as it could have done, with Marc Guehi and Oliver Glasner both leaving, then all would surely have been lost.",
      "As it is, we do still see a route to everything turning out for the best. Sure, they’re going to lose Guehi for either peanuts in January or nothing in June, but we really do think that might be worth it.",
      "Even in the very simplest terms of being what it took to keep Glasner at the helm. They might have muddled through okay until January following the loss of Guehi, but there really wouldn’t have been a transfer fee imaginable that could have made up for losing Glasner with the season under way.",
      "And we don’t have Glasner down as the sort to make hasty idle threats. If reports he threatened to walk are accurate, then he meant it.",
      "The atmosphere is likely to be testy for a while now, we’d imagine. There are a few relationships that need some strains sorting out. But there’s also the chance for Palace to win an extremely winnable European trophy this season, and for Guehi to lift it as his final act for the club. What a thing that would be.",
      "Certainly at the very least it still feels like Palace have emerged blinking from a summer full of unpleasantness and difficulty and vast and varied challenges into a reality that could have been a lot worse than it is.",
      "",
      "As is their custom, treated the transfer window like something that only opens for a few days right at the arse end of August. Fine, that’s up to them.",
      "Results sit squarely in ‘adequate’ territory after draws with Brighton and Man United and a defeat to Chelsea. It’s classic Fulham in a sort of going along unnoticed kind of way.",
      "Will surely need some wins from an upcoming run of games against Leeds, Brentford and Villa lest they start being noticed for the wrong reasons.",
      "",
      "Sold some players for big profits, bought the next lot of players whose futures are the same, and had the usual Brightonian mix of results that range from okay, to midly irritating to quite sh*t to staggeringly good.",
      "It’s just all very Brighton so far, and that’s absolutely fine at this stage we reckon.",
      "",
      "Arsenal fans have had a fair bit to enjoy thus far across the summer and early part of the season. The transfer window had much to recommend it; Arsenal have strengthened all over the pitch and finally, finally, finally have the striker they hope will solve that particular long-standing problem.",
      "The signing of Eberechi Eze produced perhaps the biggest endorphin rush of any signing anywhere, perfect storm of a transfer that it was. Really exciting player, the chance to bring one of their own home, and most importantly of all the chance to once again thoroughly pants Tottenham. Carlsberg don’t do transfers, but…",
      "Winning at Manchester United when not playing well laid down a very early Hallmark of Champions marker, while flattening Leeds is something almost everyone enjoys.",
      "The defeat at Liverpool, and the air of timidity with which Arsenal approached a trip to such a key rival whose potential defensive frailties had been on display against both Bournemouth and Newcastle, was a buzzkill, though. No getting away from it.",

      "Frank was also the 13th and we now know last managerial appointment of Daniel Levy’s reign as Tottenham chairman.",
      "And that means that while yes, this is a club well used to constant churn, chop and change, this is still nevertheless a time of even greater flux and uncertainty.",
      "Because for the last 25 years, there behind it all has been Levy, a rare executive chair in a world of non-execs and CEOs.",
      "With his departure, the sands shift once again beneath Tottenham’s feet. There is huge celebration among plenty of fans who had grown tired and increasingly frustrated by Levy’s supposed penny-pinching and inability or unwillingness to make the sort of transfer splash – and thus accept not always getting the best possible price for every incoming and outgoing – that might allow them a fighting chance at achieving his stated goals of winning one of the two big prizes.",
      "There are others who are wary of the change, more appreciative of the work Levy did to transform Spurs from mid-table sleeping giant into a member of the Big Six. The idea that Levy has been great for Spurs off the pitch but disastrous for them on the pitch has always been a loud and compelling one, with plenty of reasonable frustrations underpinning it.",
      "But it’s also worth remembering that Spurs had been mostly crap on the pitch for most of the 90s having pretty emphatically missed the Premier League Boat they as a club did so much to help launch.",
      "The Spurs Levy leaves is unrecognisable – literally and figuratively – from the one he joined.",
      "And now at this club where uncertainty is always the watchword we find ourselves with even more of it.",
      "The Lewis family have always been largely hands-off owners, Joe Lewis wisely preferring to spend time with his money on his yacht in the Bahamas than worry too much what a stupid football club in North London is up to. But that seems to have changed.",
      "The abruptness and timing of Levy’s departure was a surprise, but in truth we should all have seen it coming. There have been plenty of signs, from Levy himself and around him.",
      "His new-found willingness to front up both for in-house interviews and with Gary Neville on The Overlap hinted at a man who suddenly, for the first time, felt it necessary to try and explain himself. There have been new arrivals that, in hindsight, always looked like they could be used to ease Levy out. Long-time Lewis confidant Peter Charrington – now in position as non-executive chairman – came to the club six months ago, followed by former Arsenal man Vinai Venkatesham.",
      "He is now the CEO and will be the closest thing to a replacement for Levy in the new, more standard structure.",
      "There is a very valid argument that Levy had taken Spurs as far as he possibly could. That everything he had achieved in repositioning the club as a 21st century behemoth off the field would never be replicated on the field while he remained wedded to retaining the Premier League’s lowest wage:turnover ratio.",
      "It might very well be a change that had to happen. Spurs might now compete more robustly in the transfer market with the rest of the Big Six, and are perhaps now in less danger of being instead swallowed up by Aston Villa and Newcastle and other upwardly-mobile members of the Premier League’s middle-classes.",
      "But it might also go catastrophically wrong, something that can never be entirely ruled out at Spurs.",
      "On the field there is little more clarity right now either, with a lot of the encouraging signs from Frank’s first few games undone by an alarmingly drab display against Bournemouth before the international break in which Spurs struggled to create anything at all.",
      "The new signings brought in to address that also feed into a general air of cautious excitement and a step into the unknown. Xavi Simons in particular feels like he should become a Premier League superstar and Face of the Franchise here. But he might also just be another Bundesliga flop.",
      "We just don’t know. What, precisely, ‘Lads, it’s Tottenham’ or ‘Spursy’ mean right now is less clear than ever before.",
      "And for the first time in a quarter of a century, Spurs fans don’t even reflexively and instantly know who they should blame if it does all go horribly wrong.",
      "",
      "The bittersweetness of it all is inevitable after leaving an evocative grand old ground so full of ghosts and memories as Goodison Park, but Everton have made a fine start to the season and appear to have themselves a new fan favourite in Jack Grealish.",
      "You’d need a heart of stone or to be of a relentlessly Liverpool disposition not to derive joy from seeing Grealish in full Just Feels Like He’s Enjoying His Football Again flow, and it does seem like Everton is an ideal place for him.",
      "Grealish is a player far more effective as the player that makes the whole thing tick rather than just another cog in a more impressive overall piece of machinery. There’s nothing wrong with that; being unsuited to Pepball is not a sign of moral failure.",
      "There’s not much we’re more invested in this season than Grealish and by extension Everton having just a lovely old time of it and couldn’t be happier with how that’s going now after the Toffees started the season in troublingly moribund fashion up at Leeds.",
      "That does seem to be very much out of their system now.",
      "",
      "Andoni Iraola is a genius. Here was a man who saw pretty much his entire defence ripped away from him by the game’s biggest beasts in a summer of intense feeding on smaller clubs. He had every excuse to walk away, and even more excuse for being a bit rubbish at the start of the season.",
      "Instead his Bournemouth side have scared the crap out of Liverpool at Anfield, beaten Wolves and then gone with an entirely new-look defence to a full-of-beans Spurs and shut their entire system down entirely in an enormously impressive victory the story of which barely has its surface scratched by a 1-0 scoreline.",
      "What Bournemouth did to Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was an even more thorough, and thoroughly impressive, version of what Spurs had done to Manchester City at the Etihad a week earlier.",
      "In the space of three games they’ve gone from Fear For Them to Potential Outsider For Europe, and that’s an outrageous early-season effort.",
      "Now to ensure the momentum isn’t lost across an easier looking set of games between now and the next interlull. For all that we’re huge fans of Iraola and what he’s doing with Bournemouth, throughout his time there they have been prone to baffling and infuriating slumps in form at the most seemingly unlikely of moments.",
      "",
      "For a while now, and to our enormous surprise, we’ve found ourselves coming round to the idea that Chelsea’s transfer model is actually good.",
      "But what’s key is how, precisely, we frame ‘good’. Good for the game? For players? For competitiveness within and across leagues and countries? Oh, dear me no. For all those things it is absolutely dreadful.",
      "But for Chelsea? And as a model in the specific transfer market and football economy that we have today? It is absolutely good.",
      "What you have to do with Chelsea is to stop viewing them as a football club altogether. It’s a stretch to say the football is incidental, but only a stretch rather than an absurdity.",
      "Chelsea obviously aren’t alone in placing significance on the future value of an asset (or ‘footballer’ as they used to be called) but are the only club where this at times appears to be the only significance. Or certainly the primary one.",
      "Everyone else is trying – some not as hard as others, looking at you, Aston Villa – to be financially responsible but the obvious primary goal is to build a successful, coherent and functional squad of football players to play actual football matches with an acceptable degree of success.",
      "That’s not really the model Chelsea are now pursuing. They will have good teams and good squads and the ensuing on-field success, but that feels more and more like a by-product of the primary business. Which is player trading.",
      "What Clearlake have done is taken what was the necessary evil of player trading and made it the core business. And it’s worth noting that all they’ve actually done is to just go further along a path Roman Abramovich had already started down.",
      "Chelsea now acquire players the way other businesses acquire assets. They might be useful to the side-hustle of trying to win football matches, they might not. It’s almost stopped mattering – to the business, if not the fans.",
      "The long contracts Chelsea tie their players down to are something we were all guilty of misunderstanding in the early stages. They weren’t just a ruse to help with amortisation but that would ultimately stitch them up down the line; they were key to the whole caper.",
      "If you’re signing players as tradeable assets, it’s no use if they’re just going to be available for free four years later.",
      "Sure, you’re going to run into problems with this approach from time to time and end up paying Raheem Sterling £300k a week to train with the youth team, but in the main what Chelsea are doing is protecting the resale value of every player they sign.",
      "It’s already visible on the balance sheet. The absurd front-end outlays and selling-hotels-to-themselves machinations of the early windows have gone. They have pretty much broken even this window despite another vast outlay running into the hundreds of millions.",
      "They’ll take a loss here and there, but they make a profit in the round, and every now and then accidentally sign a Cole Palmer who turns out to be a generational talent, so that’s nice.",
      "It’s also why blasting players for perceived lack of loyalty is only becoming more and more futile. You can shake your head sadly at Viktor Gyokeres or Alexander Isak doing what they did to ‘get their move’ but Gyokeres was entirely right to point out that this is a two-way street and clubs show no loyalty of their own to players they no longer want.",
      "It’s not a pleasant reality, but this is 2025. We don’t do pleasant realities any more.",
      "Chelsea’s multi-club structure helps provide further space to accommodate all the players they acquire, and potential shop windows via loans. And Chelsea know the reality of football right now and the sheer scale of the Premier League’s financial heft means there will (almost) always be takers when it’s deemed time to cash in.",
      "We’re already at a stage where even Bayern Munich aren’t above rummaging around in Chelsea’s garbage and handing over eye-watering sums for the privilege.",
      "It’s not the transfer model football needs, but it is the transfer model football deserves. One where players are treated not like athletes or even human beings but simply another commodity to be bought and sold.",
      "Even 74 charges brought by the FA cannot dim their light.",
      "",
      "We’ve actually delayed publication on this by a couple of days just to be sure of accurately reflecting the prevailing mood at Forest because we weren’t at all certain what it would be.",
      "Giddy and chipper would appear to be that prevailing thought after they sacked the manager who took them to Europe and replaced him with the manager who finished 10 points and 27 points behind them last season.",
      "Which we’d argue is an unusual response to such a scenario. But we’re being facetious, of course. Because Ange Postecoglou is a manager who inevitably prompts giddiness. It is very intoxicating as an idea, is Angeball.",
      "The obvious fear, of course, is that we’ve already seen what happens to it after extended exposure to the harsh glare of Premier League reality. And that was with a far more suitable squad.",
      "We’ve already made the point elsewhere that going for Ange at this delicate stage of their encouraging development as an improving Premier League side might prove a damagingly hubristic act, with the mischievous thought that of the two wild high-profile appointments that appealed to Mr Marinakis it really might be that Jose Mourinho was the less damaging.",
      "It really is hard to imagine more directly opposite methods than Nuno’s tight, compact, controlled football that had worked so well and Postecoglou’s chaos. And it’s also worth remembering that the times when Forest did come unstuck last season were often on the occasions when they tried to move away from or beyond what was working so well.",
      "But the squad isn’t entirely unsuited to Ange’s ways, especially the attacking players. It does also feel like it will make or quite literally break Elliot Anderson as an elite all-round midfielder.",
      "It’s the defence that we worry about, though. We suspect Oleksandr Zinchenko possesses the nous and technical quality to work quite well as a Pedro Porro-style full-back-No 10 hybrid, but nothing about the rest of that defence screams ‘set up camp on the halfway line’.",
      "There’s nothing wrong with a managerial change providing such a stark shift in style. It’s often, by definition, precisely what was needed. But it can also be an indicator of chaos, of uncertainty, of a lack of overall clarity in vision.",
      "We’re not saying for sure which one this is. Just that September is the worst possible month to attempt such a shift. And it’s not like Nuno has been removed because of his on-field methods.",
      "READ: Nuno sack among most brutal mid-season Premier League axeings, including ‘absolutely ridiculous’ Ferguson blast",
      "",
      "We couldn’t even bring ourselves to give Liverpool a summer rating, so soon as it was after the heartbreaking Diogo Jota tragedy.",
      "It was a reminder that however carried away any of us get, football really is never more than the most important of all the unimportant things and there was amid the horror of it all something undeniably reassuring about the way, even in the deepest midst of football’s unending and impossible tribal culture ways, a significant break in hostilities took place.",
      "We do, though, just as vividly remember thinking at the time that people saying this would represent a fundamental long-lasting shift in how football fans spoke and treated each other were always going to be well wide of the mark.",
      "And sure enough, two months later, everything’s gone back pretty much exactly to the way it was before, with the esteemed F365 Mailbox coming in recent weeks to be thoroughly dominated by other fans telling Liverpool they are buying the league and we thought you hated that, and Liverpool fans replying in their definitely not-rattled masses to explain why it’s different, actually.",
      "Nature is healing. And you know what? We think on balance we really wouldn’t have it any other way. Sure, we don’t all need to be going around being horrible to each other all the time, but at the same time football fandom isn’t and shouldn’t be some sanitised and pleasant thing. The rivalries, the needle, the niggle are all part of it. When done rightly, like for instance arguing relentlessly about net spend.",
      "One because it makes it slightly less likely they just run away with the league because let’s face it all of us without a dog in the fight would quite like a proper title race again please, but also because it already looks set to make Liverpool even more entertaining to watch even if they do run away with it again.",
      "There is a vulnerability to them that wasn’t there last season, and the fact it might not even actually matter at all is sensational.",
      "They are a new-look team that very clearly hasn’t fully bedded in yet, have vast scope for improvement, have already had those potential defensive flaws alarmingly exposed by Bournemouth and a 10-man Newcastle side who haven’t managed to score another goal anywhere else all season.",
      "And yet they’ve also won three games out of three, including a vital early three points against the team that looks like their biggest and very possibly only meaningful rival.",
      "So it’s going quite well, is what we’re saying here. Just maybe take a deep breath and get some fresh air the next time someone tries to bait you with the ‘buying the league’ stuff. It will never matter how righteous and valid ‘but net spend’ is as a response for any club; it always just sounds whiny.",
      "",
      "Have already won as many Premier League games this season as Southampton managed last season, and are already over halfway to taking care of the first order of business for any promoted side: going past Derby.",
      "The thrilling nature of their two home wins, running amok against West Ham and then staging a late comeback against Brentford, has already given Sunderland fans genuine high points that will do so much to help carry them across the inevitable lows.",
      "As well as the nature of the wins, the identity of the opposition is also just so important. They really could be perfect wins, providing both the confidence of belonging at this level by coming against a pair of established Premier League sides, yet also being six-pointer successes against teams that could absolutely be holding the Black Cats above the dropzone when everything starts to get properly real further down the line.",
      "The Crisis Club belt is on the line at the Etihad, Ange Postecoglou returns at the Emirates, while Alexander Isak heads a shiny list of potential debutants. That’s a Big ...",
      "Alexander Isak teams up with his two replacements in this XI of new signings who could make their debuts this weekend…",
      "The Daily Mail take aim at Jude Bellingham once again and pretend that Thomas Tuchel has not called up Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson.",
      "Remember when Gary Neville fed the Goat? Think you can recall the Manchester City team that won the last Maine Road derby?",
      "We are stuck in Florian Wirtz flop discussion until he runs the show against Burnley on Sunday, it seems.",

      "Nuno Espirito Santo has ‘won’ the Sack Race after the complete breakdown of key relationships at Nottingham Forest produced the inevitable international-break outcome.",
      "That has removed one of the few managers who had been providing some cover for Man United boss Ruben Amorim, who now once again finds himself top of the list nobody wants to top.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs. Pretty much every one of them would have avoided defeat to Grimsby Town, we reckon.",
      "",
      "There is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either. But against Arsenal they showed the ‘mettle of champions’.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening Iraola’s standing.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and it’s been two big steps forward and one huge step back from his first three Tottenham games. Frank is obviously a decent coach, but none of us really know how he’ll get on outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Especially as Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Frank clearly wants a few more bodies in, but their absence means he is less likely to be first in line if and when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate, especially after the Eze Fiasco and despite the Xavi Redemption.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun.",

      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",

      "West Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. Came back down to earth with a bump at Burnley, but the late turnaround to beat Brentford means it’s a hugely encouraging start for the Black Cats and their manager.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a troubling winless start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "Fixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victory over Sunderland was an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, but Parker will still need some fairly early evidence it can also work against established Premier League teams, which makes Burnley’s start so problematic and that win over Sunderland both vital yet potentially deceptive.",
      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United, but Burnley must now face Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if consecutive defeats brings back memories of last winter.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked.",
      "",
      "Just a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then he could technically be the first manager to go.",
      "",
      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and this season is off to a troubling start. But it’s still hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of the season. The latter months of the season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "A win over an Aston Villa side in the midst of their own funk certainly buys some time. At the very least it surely pushes any real sack talk firmly beyond the first international break, and this season that really might be enough to make you third or fourth manager out at worst.",
      "",
      "Feels both absurdly high to be on this list before a ball is kicked, yet also perfectly fair. Postecoglou’s football is high-risk, high-reward and the larger body of Premier League evidence does now point to it being quite dramatically and fundamentally flawed at this level.",
      "And that was when he was deploying it with a Spurs squad far better suited to the approach than Nottingham Forest’s, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability.",
      "While it’s all smiles now between Postecoglou and Marinakis, it’s really not that hard to imagine a world where that all changes very, very quickly.",
      "",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, as victory over a disappointingly passive Everton suggested, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "Arsenal away needn’t be a season-defining fixture, but Leeds had absolutely nothing to offer in that one from the moment the Gunners got going, which doesn’t bode well for future games against teams who aren’t as confused as Everton apparently are.",
      "Leeds were quietly impressive in a goalless draw against a despair-laden Newcastle, but the lack of goal threat is inevitably a concern.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "The nerves at Selhurst Park will really kick in if/when Ruben Amorim gets the tin tack.",
      "",
      "Wolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth and Everton.",

Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",

      "But Newcastle fans will have forced glee in seeing Anderson shine for England after being one of the best centre-midfielders in the Premier League last season for Nottingham Forest and not his boyhood club.",

      "Parker, who won two Premier League titles in Sir Alex Ferguson’s first trophy-winning team at United, believes the positive comments following United’s opening game of the season against Arsenal may have disguised bigger issues in Amorim’s team, as he reflected on a challenging start to the season that included the horrible defeat at Grimsby.",
      "“This season started encouragingly with an improved performance against Arsenal,” he added, reflecting on the 1-0 defeat against the Gunners. “That was probably a more uplifting performance than any we saw last season, when they only seemed to play well after a big setback or playing against a bigger team.",

Coming on the back of a post-transfer window international break, the preparation for derby no.197 will be sub-optimal for both sides even before you begin to consider the wider contexts.

The Reds and Blues face opponents fancied by many to struggle this season. That those teams, Burnley and Brentford, are on the same number of points as Guardiola’s men is a damning indictment on City, even at this early stage.",
      "That is what Guardiola will have spent most of the last fortnight stewing over. The City boss flew to New York for the US Open but he must have been preoccupied at Flushing Meadows by the thought of City pulling the chain on their title prospects with a derby repeat of the performances that reaped no points from Tottenham or Brighton.",

It is a turnover that City planned for – most of it, at least – but one that sees a lot of stoic experience leave a dressing room already on the back foot.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United failed with a ‘crazy attempt’ to sign a Liverpool target ‘in the last two days’ of the summer transfer window.",
      "Man Utd were very active in this summer’s transfer window. They were largely focused on overhauling their attack as they signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also signed Senne Lammens to be their new No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "The Red Devils also looked to offload deadwood as Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Jadon Sancho moved elsewhere.",
      "Lammens was their last summer signing, but they were also linked with other potential signings as it was reported that their next priority was to sign a centre-midfielder.",
      "Despite this, a new report from Foot Mercato claims Man Utd made a ‘crazy attempt’ to sign winger Malick Fofana from Lyon at the eleventh hour.",
      "READ: Marmoush out of Manchester derby: What his injury means for Man City against Man Utd (very little)",
      "20-year-old Fofana has been heavily linked with several Premier League clubs in recent months, with it reported that he has been on Liverpool’s radar as a long-term replacement for Mohamed Salah.",
      "Fofana grabbed five goals and four assists in 29 Ligue Un appearances for Lyon last season, with the report claiming Man Utd tried to ‘snatch’ him ahead of Liverpool and others.",
      "The report claims Man Utd moved for Fofana ‘in the last two days of the window’ in a reaction to Garnacho’s exit and Cunha’s injury.",

      "According to reports, a transfer involving Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo in the winter could ‘resurrect’ on two conditions.",
      "Mainoo has suffered a major fall from grace over the past year as he has slipped in the pecking order at Old Trafford.",
      "The England international’s career at Man Utd got off to a great start as he enjoyed a brilliant breakout season in 2023/24, while he also shone at the 2024 European Championships.",
      "However, injuries, a loss of form and the appointment of Ruben Amorim have negatively impacted Mainoo, who may not fit into the head coach’s preferred system.",
      "Mainoo was only a bit-part player for Man Utd under Amorim and it was reported in January that club chiefs were willing to sanction his exit as they looked to raise funds through a pure profit transfer.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘top target’ to replace Amorim revealed amid ‘growing unrest’, one reason for INEOS verdict",
      "The talented midfielder has attracted interest from Chelsea and several European clubs in recent months, with it revealed before the summer transfer window closed that he had requested to leave on loan.",
      "This request was submitted after Mainoo was an unused substitute in Man Utd’s opening two Premier League games of this season.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd refused to let their academy product leave as they have limited midfield options and did not have much time to secure a replacement.",
      "Earlier this month, Fabrizio Romano revealed co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe was “involved” in the decision on Mainoo’s future.",
      "“Kobbie asked to go on loan, he never asked to go on a permanent,” Romano said.",
      "“Never been a possibility, either for Man United or for Kobbie Mainoo. But he did want to go on loan. It was a priority for Kobbie Mainoo to go on loan.",
      "“Man Utd said no, they decided internally, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe involved, that they couldn’t sell Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "“This was a decision made with all the people involved: directors, CEO, coach and owner. ‘We can’t let Kobbie Mainoo go,’ that was the position.”",
      "Now, a report from ESPN claims Mainoo ‘first started having concerns’ about his future ‘in January’, with it noted that he ‘sought advice from one former player after stories emerged that the club would be open to offers for both him and Alejandro Garnacho’.",
      "And while United blocked his exit in the summer, it is claimed that a deal could be ‘resurrected’ in January on two conditions.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘Sources close to Mainoo have rejected suggestions he asked to leave permanently and insist he was only seeking a temporary move that could help force his way back into Tuchel’s England thinking.",
      "‘A loan move to Napoli was mapped out and United said no, though there’s a possibility it could be resurrected in January if Mainoo’s situation hasn’t changed. United would need a replacement, which is always tough to do mid-season.’",
      "Man Utd are increasingly ‘unhappy’ at how head coach Ruben Amorim deals with certain situations in the media, according to reports.",
      "‘There is still plenty going on at Old Trafford’ apparently, and that includes the Manchester United news that big Benjamin Sesko has shown his ‘true colours’.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s decision on Kobbie Mainoo after he looked to leave Manchester United last month.",
      "A ‘significant U-turn’ suggests Manchester United already regret a £100m transfer decision, which has exposed ‘furious’ Ruben Amorim…",
      "Kobbie Mainoo has every right to “not like” Ruben Amorim as the Man Utd manager is very clearly “the problem” in his case.",

      "Manchester City and Manchester United have a rebuild on their hands, but, despite indifferent starts, have they shown signs of promise going into the new season?;the Manchester derby takes place at the Etihad, live on Sky this Sunday, with kick-off at 4.30pm",
      "Friday 12 September 2025 07:02, UK",
      "The winds of change are sweeping through Manchester.",
      "Manchester City and Manchester United meet at the Etihad on Sunday as the validity of their respective rebuilds continues to be scrutinised.",
      "For the first time in four seasons, the Premier League trophy is in a different home. Tasked with bringing back what has been City's on six of the last eight occasions is Pep Guardiola, but he is in uncomfortable territory.",
      "United are all too familiar with the promise of a rebuild. Ruben Amorim represents the sixth permanent time of asking for a manager at the Old Trafford club to restore the glories of the past.",
      "While for Guardiola, after nine years - his longest spell at a club - he navigates another reboot to restore more recent success, for the first time in his managerial career.",
      "Still yet to provide proof that his footballing concepts can bear fruit, Amorim, on the other hand, must convince fans that a record low finish of 15th in the Premier League was a blip in his first full season at the helm.",
      "United have made an indifferent start to the new season. There was a sense of positivity despite defeat in the season opener to Arsenal. Old habits crept in as United gave away a lead at Fulham and Carabao Cup embarrassment at League Two Grimsby wearied both fans and Amorim himself of whether he could continue as the boss.",
      "After the penalty shoot-out defeat at Grimsby, the Portuguese boss suggested \"something had to change\", implying that it could not be the players leaving the door open to speculation over his future. Days later, Amorim backtracked on his comments, putting them down to emotion, explaining, \"sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years\".",
      "That frustration perhaps could be borne out of the fact that United are doing the right things but are lacking the results and points to reflect their improvements. United have only scored one goal from open play this season, but the underlying numbers appear much more favourable for United.",
      "It is very early on in the season, but Amorim's side have generated the most expected goals, have had the most shots and created the most chances in the Premier League so far this term, reflecting a freer, flowing attack.",
      "United have also hit the post four times across their three opening fixtures as their new-look forward line attempts to improve on their return.",
      "Incomings in the form of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have made for a more expressive United in forward areas, but there has also been a greater emphasis on a more direct style with United also leading the Premier League in long passes completed.",
      "Signs of improvement extend to United's newly-found willingness to battle, a side of their game that has often been criticised. Only one side has bettered United this season when it comes to duels won and aerial duels won.",
      "Amorim will be desperate for his side's promising numbers to translate into victories. United's win over Burnley before the break was a much-needed one but the Manchester derby offers further opportunity to reflect proof of concept.",
      "Guardiola is the only current manager that Amorim has faced more than once in the Premier League while remaining undefeated.",
      "Amorim beat Guardiola twice during the 2024/25 season, the first as he led Sporting to a 4-1 victory in the Champions League days before taking up his post at Old Trafford. Amad then sealed a late comeback win for Amorim at the Etihad last December. The Manchester derby ended goalless when the two last met in April.",
      "City's unprecedented dip in form last season pushed the club into uncharted territory. Their lowest points total under Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term prompted a summer rebuild. But their woes have dripped into the new season with Guardiola making his worst start to a league campaign since 2008.",
      "Kevin De Bruyne's departure signalled a new era at the Etihad. Summer signings James Trafford, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders added to January acquisitions of Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Omar Marmoush, among others to create a new-look City under a new director of football, Hugo Viana.",
      "However, with just one win on the table in the Premier League so far, the 'new Man City' have made a stuttering start.",
      "Changes to the technical staff appear to have had some impact. Former Liverpool assistant Pep Ljinders has joined Guardiola in the dugout alongside Kolo Toure. Lijnders, Jurgen Klopp's former right-hand man, was famed for his part in Liverpool's dynamic, high-octane approach.",
      "Jamie Carragher, after City's resounding opening victory at Wolves, noted City's \"rock-and-roll\" approach, akin to Klopp's Liverpool.",
      "\"It felt like in the game, it's almost like a little bit of an obsession, certainly in the first half, about catching them offside,\" Carragher said on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"We always know Pep's team like to push up. We get all that, but that was something a little bit different. It just makes me think of the influence of Pep Lijnders in terms of the offside.",
      "\"When you think of Liverpool as well, keeping back to Pep Lijnders, the amount of counter-attacking goals that Liverpool team would score with [Sadio] Mane and [Mohammed] Salah, breaking forward. When I looked at the goal from Reinders in the game. It was fantastic.",
      "\"But one of the goals was what you'd think of as a counter-attack, not maybe a Pep Guardiola goal. They win it, and then they're off.\"",
      "A change in approach has been evident. With Cherki now involved and the reintroduction of Oscar Bobb, there has been a slightly greater emphasis on individual flair, with City having completed the most take-ons of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Despite Rodri returning to fitness, City appear to have struggled to control games, giving up their lead over Brighton and being blown away by Thomas Frank's rampant Tottenham. It is that perceived lack of control that will be bothering Guardiola the most ahead of the derby.",
      "United head into the derby above City for the first time in five years, but that does not remove the feeling of trepidation that surrounds Old Trafford at the moment.",
      "The added context of key City absentees in the form of Marmoush and Cherki will offer confidence. As will Amorim's record against Guardiola and City's only win in their last four meetings, being the Community Shield shoot-out victory last season.",
      "Derby games are the proverbial great leveller, but when both sides have been equally uninspiring in terms of results, it becomes a must-win for both managers that could be indicative of the validity of their rebuilds.",

      "You couldn't get a more seismic shift in football philosophy from the pragmatism and safety of Nuno Espirito Santo to Ange Postecoglou's front-foot philosophy.",
      "It's a wild appointment from Forest, one showered with risk.",
      "There will be teething problems, especially at the heart of the defence.",
      "Nuno's centre-backs, often protected by a double pivot and narrow shape, were rarely exposed to isolation or high-line races. They weren't expected to be part of the attack, they were there to clear, block and survive. It's what made Nikola Milenkovic and Murillo such an imposing duo last season.",
      "However, Postecoglou doesn't just want control, he wants chaos. The press is high and aggressive. The defensive line creeps ever closer to halfway and centre-backs are no longer shielded - they become part of the plan in possession.",
      "Milenkovic and Murillo are going to take time to adapt which means their prices to be carded offer great value while being caught out of possession is going to be extremely likely. Both are 3/1 with Sky Bet to pick up a booking.",
      "This should be full of goals.",
      "Bournemouth press relentlessly, commit bodies forward in numbers, and play with almost a disregard for defensive structure that leaves their centre-backs asked to do lots of one-on-one work. It's high-risk, high-reward football that leads to goals at both ends when the opposition can hurt them. Brighton are the perfect dance partner in that regard with their last 16 away games in all competitions averaging 3.88 goals per game.",
      "The over 3.5 goals line is on offer at 13/8 with Sky Bet and that looks a price to take seriously.",
      "Oliver Glasner is arguably one of the best pound-for-pound managers in world football and his skills are going to be tested over the next few weeks to keep Palace moving forward. Eberechi Eze has gone while Ismaila Sarr and Adam Wharton are both set to be out for this one.",
      "One player who could take advantage of opportunities is Justin Devenny and if you're digging around the player shots market this weekend, him to have a shot on target at 4/5 with Sky Bet rates as a juicy price. With injuries forcing Glasner to shuffle his pack, Devenny looks set to be handed a more attacking remit and he does love to shoot as outlined by his 2.65 shots per 90 data from his appearances for Palace so far.",
      "There was a time when backing goals in an Everton game felt like throwing cash into a firepit. In recent years with Sean Dyche at the helm the football has been functional, efficient and predictable.",
      "They've been an under-goals gamblers dream.",
      "How times have changed though. Everton are now opening up the game. And the arrival of Jack Grealish has added the kind of attacking intent and tempo that's turning David Moyes' team into a great watch. Backing goals in their games looks to be a sweet spot of value to attack as the markets are sleeping and holding too much emphasis on the Dyche days.",
      "Over 2.5 goals here at Evens is one of the best punts of the weekend.",
      "Opposition centre-backs beware - there's a foul drawing supremo playing as the Leeds centre-forward. And as bettors we must try and take advantage of this edge when assessing the player fouls markets.",
      "Lukas Nmecha isn't renowned as a regular goalscorer but what he does do well is the dirty work needed from a striker. He wins fouls, he's good at the dark arts.",
      "Across his last 50 appearances, he's drawing 3.1 fouls per 90 and has drawn four fouls in his first two starts for Leeds. These types of markets rarely adjust foul lines for defenders based on the specific forward they're facing, so there's an angle to exploit here with Joachim Andersen's price of 5/2 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls standing out.",
      "This stinks of a Newcastle to win to nil betting opportunity at 13/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Eddie Howe's side may not get the plaudits they deserve for defensive organisation, but this is a team drilled to an elite level. Despite a tough fixture list of Aston Villa, Liverpool and Leeds, Newcastle have managed the best expected goals against process of any team this season, offering up just 1.58 worth of chances. They've also faced the fewest shots (18), showcasing just how strong they are as a unit.",
      "Meanwhile, without Matheus Cunha injecting his quality and class, Wolves look like a team running out of ideas already in the final third. Boosting the raw Newcastle win price of 2/5 with Sky Bet by adding in the clean sheet looks a smart play.",
      "The narrative of Mohammed Kudus returning to West Ham following his move to Tottenham for £55m adds lots of intrigue to an already spicy London derby. Kudus is the first player to join Spurs from West Ham since Scott Parker in 2011 and - as they should - Hammers fans have taken Kudus' move very personally.",
      "He's in for a hot reception and strikes me as a character who will embrace the hostility.",
      "This makes his price of 13/8 with Sky Bet to rack up five or more foul involvements very appealing.",
      "Across his last 50 games in the Premier League playing for West Ham and Spurs, his per 90 foul involvement average is 3.75. And in his four appearances for Spurs already, he's racked up 15 foul involvements.",
      "If you just pull his foul involvement averages against the bigger clubs - in his last 15 appearances against teams that finished in the top 10 of the Premier League and PSG in the Super Cup final, the number comes in at 5.4 per 90. He can hit that average here.",
      "If Chelsea are to challenge for the Premier League title this season, these are the meat-and-drink fixtures that require a no-thrills return of maximum points.",
      "It's something they are becoming very accustomed to doing, though, as Enzo Maresca's side have won 16 of their last 19 games in all competitions. Chelsea are a very reliable team to trust. There's a calmness and control about this team now.",
      "They possess a machine-like quality, quietly getting results in matches they're expected to win. That makes them a dangerous animal for Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City this season.",
      "These newly-promoted teams at home are going to be bigger forces to be reckoned with than last season. Ipswich, Southampton and Leicester only won five home games between them while the new boys are already at four wins combined from just five matches.",
      "Burnley at Turf Moor can make this scrappy and fiddly for Liverpool. Scott Parker's team are unbeaten in their last 24 home league games and although that run is likely to end here, there will be positive vibes with the players likely to feed off the fact they're very used to winning games in front of their own supporters.",
      "Despite Liverpool's perfect start results-wise, it has been clear they've struggled to find their flow and that stodge may just continue for another week due to the international break limiting time on the training pitch for Arne Slot. The Reds beat Leicester, Wolves and Southampton twice across all competitions by a one-goal margin last season on the road. It's 11/4 with Sky Bet to happen again at Turf Moor.",
      "The Premier League might be back on your screen, and you're ready to go goals galore with your punting after sitting through England vs Andorra for the 32,000th time but the trends suggest this is a time in the calendar where goals drop like a stone.",

      "The result? Slower starts, lower intensity, fewer chances.",
      "Across the last two seasons, this matchday immediately after the international break, the average goals per game sits at a lowly 2.35 which is way down on the overall average of 3.1 per game during those two seasons.",
      "Matches can be cagey and this one fits the bill where the market is overplaying the chances of goals. That makes the under 2.5 line at 13/8 with Sky Bet a nice edge to attack in a fixture which has only averaged 2.6 goals per game across the last 10.",

      "Thursday 4 September 2025 08:37, UK",
      "Manchester United came into the summer transfer window tasked with beginning to remedy the reasons for the club's worst-ever Premier League season.",
      "A 15th-place finish last term represented an all-time low for United, who failed to inspire on the pitch. The season ended in further disappointment in the form of a Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, denying them Champions League football, which further raised the importance of this summer window.",
      "Having arrived in November of last season, the last few months have represented Ruben Amorim's first summer window in charge at Old Trafford. United were busy from the off, getting Matheus Cunha done early before completing moves for Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and securing Senne Lammens' services on Deadline day.",
      "There were also departures for Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in permanent deals to Chelsea and Real Betis, as well as Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Rasmus Hojlund leaving on loan.",
      "Manchester United will reflect on their summer transfer business and ask four specific questions:",
      "Even the most critical supporter would have to admit that the answer to all of those questions is \"yes\".",
      "That is not to say that the issues at United are fixed. Far from it.",
      "It is a huge juggernaut of a club that has lurched in the wrong direction for far too long, crashing into plenty of obstacles en route.",
      "And they are still a long way from being Premier League title contenders and are long shots for the Champions League.",
      "But the club's hierarchy knows that it will take a lot of time and effort to make them regular challengers to Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "They won't shy away from that, and they feel confident they are now starting to put the fundamentals right and make inroads into the gap between them and the Premier League's best. This transfer window was the start of that.",
      "The juggernaut is at least now being steered in the right direction.",
      "United's transfer strategy this summer has been simple, strategic and is being based increasingly on data. The hierarchy at Old Trafford knows it will take several windows to get the squad to where they want it to be, and there will be some imbalance and pain in the meantime. Amorim is fully on board with that plan.",
      "Financial restrictions mean that they have had to prioritise - and it's very clear that the priority has been to make United an attacking force again, even if that means putting other positions of need on the backburner.",
      "So why have Manchester United focused on forward areas, with £207.2m spent on three players, at the expense of other positions? Director of football Jason Wilcox and his team forensically analysed the recent past. The focus was how the team performed last season, and this is the one statistic that leaps out: apart from the three relegated teams, only Everton scored fewer goals than Manchester United last season.",
      "For a club famed above all else for its attacking football and entertaining style of play, that was damning. It became an overriding priority, which is why they targeted Cunha (£62.5m), Mbeumo (£71m) and Sesko (£73.7m).",
      "Before trying to sign those three, the club analysts produced their reports, and the scouts produced theirs. Only when the two were put together - hearts and minds, if you like - did they produce a pecking order of targets.",
      "In United's eyes, those three players were the \"best in class\" for the specific roles the team needed, and they got each of them at fair market value, and on affordable salaries that are in line with the new structure.",
      "Very simply, the stats showed that in order for United to climb the table it was essential they scored more goals - and that is more important than keeping them out at the other end. If they scored the same number of goals again this season, the calculations went, it would be impossible for Manchester United to make the top six.",
      "By contrast, only Everton and Crystal Palace had better defensive records than United outside the top nine clubs in the Premier League last season. That might seem a strange statistic to most fans when you consider United conceded 54 goals in 38 matches, and had a goal difference of -10 over the season.",
      "In fact, United's defensive record last season was their third worst in the modern era - and the two that topped it, also occurred in the last five years.",
      "It would be wrong to suggest that United's recruitment team isn't aware of the defensive frailties and the need to strengthen in midfield. Rather, they identified the lack of goals as a more pressing concern, and know there is no quick fix to improving the squad as a whole.",
      "Look at United's goalkeeping targets as a case in point...",
      "Plenty of people in football will ask why, if you have one of the world's best goalkeepers available and keen to move to Old Trafford, would you turn him down and choose an unproven young stopper instead?",
      "That is the reality of United choosing Senne Lammens over Emi Martinez. The Argentina World Cup winner is without doubt one of the best in world football. But he is 33 years old. He was likely to cost over £30m. He would, quite rightly, demand a huge salary. And there would be very little value in any future fee United could demand for him, if they sold him. Exactly the same reasoning explains why United didn't choose to rival Manchester City for Gianluigi Donnarumma, one of the best goalkeepers of his generation.",
      "Instead, they went for Lammens. Not the finished article, not in the same league right now when compared to Donnarumma and Martinez. But a player who fits into the new wage structure, and who the metrics and scouts say has all the potential, with good coaching and development, to be a future Manchester United number one.",
      "Last season, he had one of the highest \"goals prevented\" statistics in Europe, made more saves than any other keeper in Europe's top 10 leagues, and proved he was good with his feet, too - making the most progressive passes for any goalkeeper under the age of 23.",
      "Just £17.3m? Half the price of Martinez? A good deal, as far as United were concerned.",
      "The club are determined to avoid the mistakes of the past, where some big-name players with big reputations ended up as expensive bench-warmers. Or worse, VIP viewers from the posh seats in the Sir Alex Ferguson stand, such has been the bloated nature of United's squad.",
      "And they are delighted that this summer has seen many of their extraneous players leave Old Trafford. Chelsea think they got a great deal for Garnacho, with a fee of £40m, but United are happy too, earning the largest sale ever for an academy player.",
      "Rashford has his entire wages covered by Barcelona for the coming season. Antony, Hojlund and Jadon Sancho are all out of the building too, which limits the external noise around the squad and the manager.",
      "There is no shying away from the fact that United have wasted big money on some big-name players who simply haven't cut it at Old Trafford in recent years.",
      "The \"bomb squad\" has cost them almost £100m in lost revenue. United paid Ajax £86m for Antony in 2022 and they have now sold him to Real Betis for £21.7m. Hojlund cost £72m from Atalanta two years ago - he is now on loan at Napoli, with an obligation for them to pay £43m for him next summer (if Napoli make the Champions League).",
      "Sancho's move to Aston Villa isn't a permanent switch, but United will recoup 80 per cent of his wages and earn a chunky loan fee. Only Tyrell Malacia remains at Carrington after the club's best efforts to move him on to Elche failed on Deadline Day.",
      "United won't shy away from the mistakes they've made in the past, and they accept that it will cost money to correct them.",
      "But this window has seen evidence of a new financial discipline, so that they hope there will be fewer expensive mistakes in the future. The fact that they weren't tempted to over-pay for Carlos Baleba - with Brighton reportedly wanting £100m for the 21-year-old - is a case in point. United like him; he fits their profile, the metrics are good... but the finances don't stack up. Hence, there was no approach.",
      "Many United fans will be questioning why the midfield wasn't deemed a priority position.",
      "Gary Neville said after the 1-1 draw with Fulham: \"In central midfield, I think United have to do a piece of business now. I would have liked to have thought that (Kobbie) Mainoo could step up and be that person, but it's quite clear that at this moment in time Amorim is not having him.\"",
      "Amorim has been key in tweaking the role of Casemiro, who he thinks is much fitter and more influential already than last season. And United see the captain Bruno Fernandes happily occupying the central midfield role alongside him for much of this season, with Cunha taking on the more advanced number 10 position.",
      "United would also point to the fact that Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and is waiting in the wings.",
      "A young midfielder who started for England in last season's European Championship final is currently struggling to get into Amorim's starting 11.",
      "Why would you try to buy more midfielders if a player of his quality can't get in? And United are adamant they will not sell him. It was only in the final week of the window when Mainoo went to the club and asked them to explore a possible exit, frustrated as he was by the lack of game time. Mainoo was met with a categorical \"no\" and told that Amorim and United want to keep him. He is on a long contract. He is not for sale.",
      "The United project is much more evolution than revolution. It is a work in progress. This summer's transfer window wasn't perfect, but United's bosses stuck to their principles and their strategy. They are pleased with the ins and the outs.",
      "They feel they have caught up some of the ground on the clubs ahead of them. But they know there is still a long road ahead.",
      "The hope inside Old Trafford is now that, with the juggernaut plotting a more steady and sensible course, there are fewer potholes to navigate.",

      "NFL UK general manager Henry Hodgson says the league is open to exploring opportunities to play in other stadiums across the country as it continues its global expansion with a historic international slate of games.",
      "The league will host three more regular-season games across Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Wembley Stadium in the 2025 season to take the tally of London match-ups to 42 since 2007.",
      "Such has been the sport's ascent on this side of the pond, there is an increasing appetite to enhance the game's presence beyond the capital, including the prospect of games.",
      "Football is living in historic times as it gears up for seven international games in 2025. Could Manchester United's proposed £2bn, 100,000 capacity stadium emerge as an option down the line?",
      "\"Would we look at other options? I think we'd certainly be open to those conversations. I'm very keen to make sure that we're taking the sport across the country.",
      "\"This year we have a kick-off event that's taking place in Manchester. We've got a tour going to Birmingham and to Bristol and to Cardiff. So we want to make sure that the NFL isn't seen as a London sport where we go and play games.",
      "\"We know that there are fans across the UK and we want to serve those fans across the UK. Somewhere down the road, if there are conversations to be had about that stadium or frankly any other new stadiums in the UK, we're certainly open to having those discussions. Again, for the same reason, to see how we can bring more NFL to more new people.\"",
      "Tottenham has emerged as the official home of the NFL in the UK having become the first purpose-built NFL stadium outside of the United States.",
      "Hodgson attributes its success to a long-term 'vision' of Tottenham Hotspur in accommodating the league, though accepts it can be a \"case-by-case\" basis regarding other prospective host stadiums.",
      "\"You look at the partnership we have in Tottenham, I think one of the reasons that I believe that stadium is so good is that that partnership happened long before the stadium itself started being built,\" Hodgson added.",
      "\"So it came with that as a real central part of their project. That was the vision of Daniel Levy and of Tottenham, as well as the NFL. So you'd think that that would lead people to, you know, if you were going to do it, that would be the way to go. But I'm sure different people would approach it in different ways.\"",
      "The NFL, meanwhile, remains committed to expanding its global reach, and earlier this year announced its first game in Australia at the iconic MCG.",
      "Germany is currently gearing up for its fifth regular-season game when Berlin follows in the footsteps of Frankfurt and Munich as a host city this year, while Madrid and Dublin enter as new territories.",
      "A trip to France could also be on the horizon next.",
      "\"Paris is certainly one of the cities we've looked at,\" said Hodgson. \"Everyone knows that the NFL continues to look around the world at cities that we could play games in and do that in a really considered way.",
      "\"We want to make sure that when we go and play a game, wherever it might be in the world, it's not simply for the sake of playing a game, but for growing a fanbase for the long term.",
      "\"And France certainly has a big fanbase of NFL fans existing, so Paris would lend itself as a city for us to play a game in.",
      "\"We continue to examine the opportunity to do that. And I would expect that it will happen. I think it's just a question of when. But there are a number of other cities around the world that we're looking at as well.\"",
      "Dublin's iconic Croke Park will welcome the Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings on Sunday September 28, before the latter stick around to face the Cleveland Browns at Tottenham the next week.",
      "The Denver Broncos then take on the New York Jets at Tottenham followed by the Los Angeles Rams against the Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley, before the Indianapolis Colts host the Atlanta Falcons at the Olympiastadion and the Washington Commanders meet the Miami Dolphins at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid.",
      "\"It's an incredibly exciting year because we're playing in three new cities around the world in Madrid and in Dublin and Berlin,\" said Hodgson.",
      "\"I think for each of those there's going to be a very different atmosphere, a new set of fans who are going to get the opportunity to experience an NFL game for the very first time and a new city that's going to kind of have its own take on how to embrace the NFL.",
      "\"And then on top of that, obviously we've got games in London where the first game will be the 40th so you've got this established city.",
      "\"But I think both Dublin and Madrid are going to be really exciting, really fun, different events. Dublin, in particular, a city that really lends itself to these kind of big events and I think you're going to see the whole of Dublin overtaken by NFL fans over the weekend.\"",

      "\"I think the NFL's in a fantastic period of really creating some very established, very fun rivalries,\" said Hodgson. \"You look at the AFC and you've had that sort of Chiefs, Bills, Ravens triumvirate over the last few years and who's going to get there, are the Bills and Ravens finally going to get over the hump?",
      "\"I think equally with the Chiefs, even more in the spotlight given some of the recent cultural news around the NFL as well.",
      "\"You've got a lot of teams that there are question marks around but could really come up and be very exciting. Washington Commanders last year, for a few people, sort of came out of nowhere, that was exciting.",
      "\"You've got the Lions who everyone seemed to be rooting for if they weren't an Eagles fan going into the postseason. You've got the 49ers who had a bit of a down year but maybe can bounce back and then across all of it the NFL throws up those surprises.\""
