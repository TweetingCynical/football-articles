      "It is the time in the season to start thinking about Premier League prize money. Arsenal missed out on not only the title but a record payout last campaign.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.84billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Manchester City were paid £175.9m as champions – just short of their own record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while runners-up Arsenal benefited from having the most games televised and were given £175.5m. They would have broken the record had they won the title.",
      "Sheffield United received £109.7m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £95m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£31.2m in 2023/24) and international (£55.7m in 2023/24) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £8.2m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was £3.1m per position in 2022/23 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Liverpool) – £56.4m",
      "2nd (Arsenal) – £53.5m",

      "19th (Leicester) – £5.7m",
      "20th (Southampton) – £2.8m",
      "",
      "Every club has played 35 or 36 games so far this season, and all but champions Liverpool and doomed Southampton can still mathematically finish in a range of different positions with varying prize money attached.",
      "The following is a breakdown of what each club is still competing to earn this season beyond European qualification or survival, based on their possible league finishes.",
      "Liverpool – 1st (£56.4m)",
      "Arsenal – 2nd (£53.5m) to 7th (£39.4m)",
      "Manchester City – 2nd (£53.5m) to 7th (£39.4m)",

      "Fulham – 8th (£36.7m) to 12th (£25.4m)",
      "Crystal Palace – 8th (£36.7m) to 17th (£11.3m)",

      "Southampton – 20th (£2.8m)",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2023/24, Arsenal had 31 games televised in the UK, for which they received £26.9m in facility fees. Liverpool had 29 matches and were paid £25.2m, while Manchester City, Manchester United and Spurs (all 28 games) were given £24.4m each.",
      "Burnley were shown on the fewest occasions and received £9.3m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Everton’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £132.2m, more than the three clubs immediately above them – Wolves (£130m in 14th), Fulham (£128.6m in 13th) and Bournemouth (£131.5m) – as the Toffees were picked for far more live TV games. Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",
      "Spurs in 5th (£164.6m) were paid more overall than Villa in 4th (£162.4m), while 8th-placed Manchester United (£156.2m) took home more than 7th-placed Newcastle (£154.7m).",
      "Based on this, Arsenal stand to again earn the most of any club in facility fees this season, with Ipswich faring the worst.",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",
      "Rashford has been heavily linked with a potential move to Barcelona over the past couple of years.",
      "Ahead of this season’s winter transfer window, Rashford announced his intention to leave Man Utd and it was widely reported that Barcelona were his preferred destination.",
      "A move to the Spanish giants did not go through as his poor form for Man Utd and huge salary proved huge stumbling blocks.",
      "Instead, Rashford joined Aston Villa on loan with an option to buy for around £40m and his form has picked up in recent months. He has four goals and six assists in his 17 appearances for Unai Emery’s side.",
      "READ: Where next for Marcus Rashford? Villa or ‘dream’ scenario threatened by lack of cash?",
      "Rashford’s improved form is likely to attract interest from further afield and a recent report claimed he remains keen on a move to Barcelona, with the forward willing to take a significant pay cut and a ‘strategic step’ to force through a move to the Spanish giants.",
      "Romano has provided an update on Rashford situation and in a boost for the England international, Barcelona are in favour of a move.",
      "The transfer expert claims two factors boost Rashford’s chances of joining Barcelona as he is “under consideration” ahead of this summer’s transfer window.",
      "“Internally at Barcelona, they still believe that Marcus Rashford could be an option for the summer transfer window,” Romano said on his  YouTube channel.",
      "“They believe at Barcelona that Rashford might be available on the market. They believe at Barcelona that Rashford could be a good solution because he can play as a No 9 and play on the wing, so he can help in several positions.",
      "“He’s a player appreciated by those at Barcelona. They already wanted Rashford in January, it didn’t happen because Ansu Fati didn’t leave and so in terms of FFP it was not possible to balance the deal.",
      "“But Marcus Rashford remains in the list of Barcelona and so if Rashford is not staying at Aston Villa we will see what happens. He’s one of the options under consideration at Barcelona.",
      "“Then it will depend on FFP, on deal conditions, on more clubs being keen on the player and on what he decides to do.",
      "“We will see on Rashford’s side, but on club side one of the names being mentioned internally at Barcelona is for sure Marcus Rashford.”",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Rashford has taken a ‘strategic step’ to push through his dream move to Barcelona this summer and Man Utd aren’t likely to be happy with the resulting talks.",
      "Marcus Rashford’s brother and agent, Dwaine Maynard, has been ‘spotted’ with Manchester City chiefs as a ‘conspicuous figure’ to watch his brother play football.",
      "According to reports, Aston Villa are ‘increasingly convinced’ that they will miss out on Manchester United outcast Marcus Rashford this summer.",
      "Manchester United and Aston Villa are reportedly ‘in talks’ over Marcus Rashford returning to his parent club ‘earlier than expected’.",
      "David Ornstein has revealed it’s ‘highly likely’ that Marcus Rashford won’t be able to feature for Aston Villa again this season, so he’s going to focus on another side."

      "“You can be good in your club, in your league, but when you go to the Premier League, it’s different,” Gallas said.",
      "“Nobody can deny that Gyokeres hasn’t been one of the hottest strikers in Europe for two seasons now, but he’s been doing it in Portugal. The argument would be that he has scored goals in the Champions League, but there are still doubts about his pedigree in the Premier League.",
      "“Isak, at Newcastle, he was not good at the beginning. He was a good player, but he didn’t have that performance level that he has right now. You need to know if you can give your players time to adapt.",
      "“But sometimes you can’t wait, you need a striker who can score right away. That would be my concern about Gyokeres. I would go for Isak, because he is already proven in the Premier League. He’s already posing problems and already knows how to deal with the opponents.”",

It’s one thing getting your chance and blowing it (Antony of 2024 I’m looking at you), but Mount hasn’t really had a shot at all. By all accounts that is through no shortage of hard work on his part.",

The jury is still out for me in terms of what exactly he does, but it’s great to see him thrive now with the platform to show it.

This is where a fair number of teams reside, if you draw them in Europe its an ‘ah that’s’ nice sort of fixture rather than the excitement of drawing one of the above. I reckon this is where Arsenal sit, they have more money than their counterparts in other leagues but a decent Scandinavian outfit will fancy beating them every so often.",

      "Manchester United are plotting an incredible move for Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma, whose ‘continuity is in doubt’ at the Parcs des Princes.",
      "United are scouring the market for alternatives to Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir after a difficult season for the stoppers at Old Trafford.",
      "A number of high-profile errors from Onana, most notably in the Europa League first leg against Lyon, led to Amorim drop the Cameroon international from the starting XI, with his understudy failing to convince between the sticks either.",
      "Transfer expert Romano told GIVEMESPORT this week that Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a potential option after an outstanding season for Torino.",
      "‘Goalkeeper is not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",
      "It was later claimed that United’s interest sent Torino owner, Urbana Cairo, into a state of ‘panic’ as he pushes the goalkeeper to sign a new deal, either to remain beyond the summer or increase his release clause, which currently stands at just €20m (£17m).",

      "But a report from Spanish outlet Nacional suggests United are setting their sights far higher – just about as high as they can get in fact – as Red Devils bosses reportedly see PSG star Gianluigi Donnarumma as ‘a market opportunity and would be willing to present an offer close to €60m (£51m) to ensure his signing’.",
      "Donnarumma was the scourge of Arsenal in the Champions League, pulling off a number of magnificent saves across the two legs to set up a final meeting with Inter Milan at the end of this month.",
      "A move away seems unlikely, particularly to United, but the report claims his ‘continuity is in doubt’ as his contract expires in 2026.",
      "Asked about his future after his standout performance this week, Donnarumma said: “I’m under contract for one more year… it’s up to the club. If PSG want me to stay, I’m gonna stay.",
      "“We just have to sign the new contract. But it’s up to the club.”",
      "United are thought to be near the front of the queue to pounce on the 26-year-old if a new contract isn’t forthcoming.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘From Paris, for now, they remain silent about a possible exit, but the growing interest of the ‘red devils’ and other European clubs could accelerate events. If PSG fails to renew its star goalkeeper, the next summer market could be decisive for its future. Donnarumma, with an already consolidated career and room for growth, is facing a possible new challenge away from Ligue 1.’",
      "A former Premier League referee claims Paris Saint-Germain star Gianluigi Donnarumma deserves a “ban” for his “disgraceful” actions vs Arsenal.",
      "PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma is a very brave man, reportedly deciding he is ‘open’ to joining AC Milan’s arch-rivals Inter.",
      "And then there were two. Liverpool’s treble hopes are over after an energy-and-spirit-sapping Champions League defeat to PSG."

      "Neville insists the glory of winning the Europa League has been diminished, with United in particular far more focused on Champions League qualification than the trophy itself, with the financial implications massive for securing a place in Europe’s showcase competition next term.",
      "“I do actually agree a little bit with Arsene Wenger,” Neville said. “Every game we watch at the minute we just talk about the money at stakes. No one is talking about winning the Europa League to win a trophy.",
      "“UEFA Cup and Cup Winners’ Cup used to be big trophies that club could win. Now, the first thing you hear is ‘yeah you get the Champions League, it’s a £60m game’. The FA Cup has become devalued, really great competitions have become devalued.”",
      "And Keane is adamant that teams who have lost as many games as United and Spurs this season shouldn’t be competing against Europe’s best.",
      "He said: “I agree with that. I think it’s spot on. To have five or six teams.. It’s called a Champions League.",

      "Ruben Amorim gushed over “perfect” Mason Mount after Manchester United secured a spot in the Europa League final, but also reserved praise for an unsung hero at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils had a 3-0 lead going into the second leg but it was a tense atmosphere for much of the second leg after Mikel Jauregizar’s first-half strike gave Athletic Club hope of a comeback.",
      "But Amorim rang the changes in the second half and in the end United stormed to a 7-1 aggregate win over the Spanish side, with Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund both getting on the scoresheet, while Mason Mount scored a brilliant brace.",
      "Mount has endured a nightmare since his £55m move to United from Chelsea in the summer of 2023, making just 42 appearances for the club, and doubled his goals tally on Thursday with two outstanding strikes.",
      "The first saw him curl the ball into the far corner after making space for himself in the box with an excellent first touch before he drilled the ball from 40 yards out over the goalkeeper in no-man’s land.",
      "Amorim was delighted for Mount, who he believes is the “perfect” player for the inverted winger role in his 3-4-3 system, but was also impressed by the cameo of Kobbie Mainoo, who’s also not had the best of seasons.",

      "“When you see that kind of guy like Mason working hard every day, eating well, having ice baths, when you have this kind of player you just want to help him. He is perfect for this position as he can be a midfielder, but also runs like a winger so I’m really happy for him.",
      "“When you have a full squad you can think about the game. Sometimes we’re surviving with people in different positions, but with more options you can change the game and push forwards and these things can help you win games.”",
      "Amad Diallo was also hugely influential having only recently returned from injury, and came off the bench to set up Hojlund’s goal with some wonderful play on the wing.",
      "And Hojlund hailed his teammate for the assist, as well as Mount as another “extremely talented” player.",
      "“Lovely. It was very nice to score a scrappy goal. I am very glad Amad played the ball. What a player. Great player to have back in the team. Them two players are extremely talented, so we are very glad to have them both back [Amad and Mount].”",
      "According to reports, Ruben Amorim has performed an ‘incredible U-turn’ on one Manchester United star who could ‘see out his career’ at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United should be celebrating reaching a Europa League final, but Ruben Amorim was ‘forced’ to wear a plaster ‘just months’ after getting angry.",
      "Ruben Amorim has responded to Arsene Wenger after the Arsenal legend called for a rule change which would impact Manchester United.",
      "Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney has found it “strange” to watch Ruben Amorim’s side play a different formation to the Under-21 side.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the youngest Manchester United starting XI in Premier League history to prepare for a crucial European game. How mid-2000s of him.",

      "The 20-year-old has struggled through much of this campaign as he’s struggled to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s system, which sees him play a more central role in a 3-4-3 formation.",
      "He’s been heavily linked with an exit as a result and United are thought to be ready to listen to offers of £65m for the Argentina international, with Chelsea among those most interested in signing him.",
      "Ahead of kick-off at Old Trafford, Scholes outlined his “fear” if United do sanction his departure from the club.",
      "“He’s perfect in a regular 4-3-3. He will be a real threat,” Scholes said. “He needs to tidy up his decision-making and finishing, sometimes his final ball is a bit rash but he’s a young player so that’s to be expected.",
      "“I fear we will see him for £50-60m for PSR reasons. It’s been rumoured, hasn’t it? I fear he will end up scoring 25 to 30 goals for somebody else, that’s how good I think this lad can be.",
      "“Shoehorning him into this system might be tricky, I’m struggling to find a position for him in Ruben Amorim’s system.",
      "“I don’t want them to sell him, I hate the thought of that, but I think they could do. I wouldn’t like it. He frustrates me but he’s often the biggest threat for Manchester United.”",

      "“The problem is Ruben Amorim’s system suits No. 10s but he’s better on the wings running at people, he’s probably United’s best player at that.",
      "“I hope he stays. He’s too good to let go. I would never want the club to sell him. But the system is an issue because it doesn’t suit some of the players.”",
      "And Scholes’ frustration with Garnacho was evident at half-time as the club legend analysed a moment during the first 45 minutes when he was put through on goal but his attempted chipped finish drifted wide of the post.",
      "Scholes said: “I have never seen Garnacho score a goal like this, he is not the player with that kind of guile. With the pace he has got, he should just go around the keeper. We said before the game he gets in brilliant positions, he is great at running through but a lot of the time he makes the wrong decision.”",

      "It’s an inexact science but a glance down the highest-rated Premier League players according to the WhoScored algorithms sees exactly zero new signings feature until No. 33, when we arrive at Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson.",
      "In truth, his teammate Nikola Milenkovic is probably the correct answer to any question about the best signings of the Premier League season – he topped our own top 10 in March – with a nod to Bournemouth, who will likely quadruple their money on Dean Huijsen this summer.",
      "But you could not make a case for any signing by a club with Premier League title ambitions – or even those without reasonable ambitions but with the heritage to still belong to the Big Six – to even make a revised, season-ending top 10.",
      "Manchester United made three of the most expensive signings of last summer, with Chelsea adding Pedro Neto to the most laughable of all Chelsea signings, while Dominic Solanke would only truly justify his monstrous Spurs transfer fee if he scored the winner in the Europa League final.",
      "Was there a single signing made last summer – outside of Nottingham – who has made a season-defining difference to their club this season? Liverpool spent almost nothing to win the title, Arsenal spent more to fail once again (though Mikel Arteta has his own theories about that), Brighton spent a metric f***-tonne of money to stand still, and Ipswich made an inspired striker signing but went down anyway.",
      "There could still be trophy-claiming moments for summer arrivals at Crystal Palace, United, Tottenham and Chelsea, but in terms of the Premier League, there has been an embarrassing lack of impact by new signings.",
      "When Jorgen Strand Larsen is the new arrival who has scored the most Premier League goals, excuse us for feeling a little underwhelmed.",
      "The good news is that this summer can only reap greater rewards, with almost every major Premier League club competing for strikers and Viktor Gyokeres, Victor Osimhen and Benjamin Sesko among those likely to arrive. After the phoney war of this frankly dull season, surely battle is about to commence.",
      "Mo Salah should not have another absolutely free run at every individual award. As wonderful as he is, every other ambitious Premier League club – barring perhaps Manchester City – should be signing somebody who wants to knock him off his f***ing perch. And that includes Liverpool.",
      "A summer without a major tournament can feel like a long one, but it does at least offer the potential for transfers not squeezed by football or born of desperation. Two years ago Arsenal signed Declan Rice and nearly won the title, while Chelsea and Liverpool engaged in a Moises Caicedo battle which left the Blues as only short-term winners. Compared to the underwhelming machinations of last summer, 2023 provided halcyon days.",
      "While it’s true that transfers are not the answer to every question and Arne Slot has proved that continuity and coaching can still be the twin towers of a title victory, there are such obvious gaps in such obvious places, that there will surely be money spent.",
      "Brighton will definitely not retain their biggest spenders crown and Nottingham Forest really should not be pulling off the very best deals."

      "Another common occurrence is Alejandro Garnacho missing simple one-on-ones. His dink wide only added to the unease, and the sense grew that Bilbao might just nick a second and make this properly nervy.",
      "But it didn’t happen.",
      "Mason Mount’s sublime equaliser killed the tie and Bilbao completely gave up. Casemiro added another – a header, as in the first leg – just to rub it in and make sure United’s unbeaten record in Europe lives on.",

      "Amorim’s subs did the damage. Mount bagged a brace. Amad Diallo set up Hojlund. Kobbie Mainoo squeezed in two take-ons in just 11 minutes. Lovely job.",
      "And so, we get the final we didn’t know we needed: two broken Premier League giants, 15th vs 16th, 35 combined defeats, not a single one of them on 40 points. And yet, they’ll meet in Bilbao with a place in next season’s Champions League and millions on the line.",
      "It’s ridiculous. But it’s not undeserved. In this competition, they’ve looked the part. That’s all that counts.",
      "The loser, though, is going to feel it like a tonne of bricks. For United, it’s about funding a rebuild that would be near-impossible without Champions League football and that windfall.",
      "For Spurs, it could decide Postecoglou’s job – even if they win it, he’s not safe; if they don’t, he’s done. They might be better equipped to absorb the blow, but don’t mistake that for a lack of hunger. This is a club still chasing its first trophy since 2008, in case you weren’t aware.",
      "United have fared far better on the silverware front in that time, even when you take out the five years under Sir Alex Ferguson. Win in Bilbao, and they’ll have won a trophy in each of the last three seasons. Somehow. Despite being a complete and utter shambles on and off the pitch.",
      "Honestly, we didn’t expect it to pan out this way, but we are absolutely here for it and genuinely excited for a football match where two teams try their absolute hardest to lose.",

      "Including four Manchester United players, transfer expert David Ornstein has named 22 players ‘available’ in the summer transfer window.",
      "It promises to be a busy summer, with Arsenal, United, Chelsea, and Liverpool all targeting a striker.",
      "Several strikers are being linked with moves to the Premier League, including RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko and Lille’s Jonathan David, while Wolves’ Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town’s Liam Delap are expected to join another English club.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s side has a lot of work to do this summer and wants to sign both Delap and Cunha.",
      "However, they will need to sell players in order to buy, and Ornstein has stated that they have three players they could sell. Christian Eriksen will also be available on a free transfer following the expiry of his contract.",
      "In addition to Eriksen, Ornstein mentions that on-loan stars Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are ‘available’.",
      "There is also a possibility that winger Alejandro Garnacho could leave. Ornstein noted, ‘Maybe Garnacho’ as one of the 22 players ‘available’ this summer, ‘off the top of his head’ when answering a question on The Athletic.",
      "Garnacho was linked with Chelsea and Napoli in January but stayed at Old Trafford, despite the latter selling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to PSG.",
      "The names of Rashford – on loan at Aston Villa – and Sancho – at Chelsea – appearing should surprise no one.",
      "The United players named by Ornstein are not the biggest names on his list of 22 players expected to be available at the end of the 2024/25 season.",
      "Let’s run through them, shall we?",
      "Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting), Benjamin Sesko (Leipzig) and Jonathan David (Lille)\nThree big-name strikers expected to be on the move this summer. David is entering free agency, Sesko has a gentleman’s agreement to leave Leipzig and Gyokeres will spread his wings elsewhere after two incredibly productive years in Lisbon.",
      "David’s future is massively unclear, but I do know he won’t be playing for Lille next season.",
      "One of Sesko or Gyokeres will likely end up at Arsenal, we suspect. Whoever doesn’t might end up at Chelsea.",
      "",
      "Liam Delap (Ipswich) and Matheus Cunha (Wolves)\nCunha’s future appears to lie at Old Trafford, but there are too many clubs interested in Delap to predict where he’ll end up.",
      "",
      "Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nEighteen Premier League goals this season is an outrageous return for a Brentford player and they have bloody two of them! Yoane Wissa is not being linked with an exit, but Mbeumo is headed for the door. Club captain Christian Norgaard said this week: “I think Bryan is likely to go. I don’t know about Wissa yet. Everyone hopes that he might stay. Either way, I’m happy for the season and am happy for both of them. They deserve it so much.”",
      "Arsenal and Newcastle and Man United are being strongly linked with the Cameroonian.",
      "",
      "Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nWho will take a chance on Darwin, then? A Liverpool exit seems inevitable.",
      "",
      "Kevin De Bruyne (Man City)\nAsked about De Bruyne to Liverpool, Ornstein replied to another reader: ‘As far as we understand, Hugo, Liverpool are not signing De Bruyne. He is good friends with members of their squad, notably Virgil van Dijk, and I’m sure those guys would love to play alongside him, but any notion of the Premier League champions moving for him are thought to be wide of the mark.’",
      "City legend KDB is out of contract this summer.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo, Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez (Bournemouth)\nBournemouth should rake in the big bucks this summer, with three of their star players wanted by Premier League rivals. Huijsen’s exit is all but confirmed, but to who, Chris Kamara? Kerkez is destined for Liverpool, it seems. Ornstein adds that Semenyo will ‘potentially’ leave. Ooh, the uncertainty.",
      "",
      "Cristian Romero (Spurs)\n‘Probably’ available, Ornstein says. He also only gave surnames. I’m pretty confident he was referring to the Spurs Romero. Atletico Madrid are keen.",

      "Roy Keane has come up with a new reason why Manchester United are an “absolute disgrace” and took an unnecessary swipe at Harry Maguire, who “CROSSED THE BALL!”",
      "Manchester United are enduring a dismal domestic season and sit 15th in the Premier League having won just ten of their 35 games this term, with legendary captain Keane one of their harshest critics.",
      "The European League could be their saving grace though as victory over Athletic Club in the semi-final followed by a win over either Tottenham or Bodo/Glimt would mean a trophy for Ruben Amorim in his his first season in charge and crucial entry into the Champions League next term.",
      "Playing in Europe’s showcase competition will make United more alluring to potential new recruits ahead of what looks to be a significant summer rebuild, and grant the club with more money to make those changes.",
      "But Keane isn’t impressed with United simply being happy about being in the competition next term, having played for the club when they were competing to win it.",
      "Keane said on the Stick to Football podcast: “Everyone’s saying if United are in it, how big United are, that United are going to be in the Champions League. You’re talking like they’re a small club, they’ve got no chance of winning it.",
      "“The way it’s panned out now, it’ll be huge for the club, and the format might be that they’ll win one or two games because of the seeding, but in terms of winning it, United are going ‘we have to be in it’, they’re not talking about winning it! ‘",
      "“‘We just have to be in it for financial reasons, what a place to be.”",
      "United have a very good chance of reaching the Europa League final after claiming a 3-0 away win in the first leg, but Keane claims they’re an “absolute disgrace” for giving up on the Premier League to focus on Europe.",
      "“(I’m just fed up at) how bad they are,” Keane added. “They’re getting on my nerves, they keep talking about a big game next week, they’re not even trying.",
      "“A couple of weeks ago at Newcastle they said ‘we couldn’t focus because we’ve got Lyon coming up’ so they keep writing these matches off.",
      "“I understand it’s a big game, so you just dismiss these league matches? They’re a disgrace, an absolute disgrace.”",
      "The panel went on to discuss Inter Milan defender’s Denzel Dumfries’ outstanding displays against Barcelona in their two-legged semi-final tie, with Gary Neville insisting he would like to see United sign the Dutchman.",
      "Jill Scott then couldn’t resist riling Keane further by joking that Amorim should play Maguire at right wing-back after the defender assisted Casemiro’s opener in Spain last week.",
      "“Oh relax Jill, will you,” Keane fired back. “I know you’re joking. Harry Maguire last week. Harry Maguire crossed the ball and everyone’s going ‘what amazing feet’.",
      "“HE CROSSED THE BALL! Skill? He did a little shimmy, crossed it! It’s not bad for £80m is it, someone who can cross the ball! Oh my god! You’re all living in cuckoo land.”",
      "Roy Keane and Gary Neville agree with Arsene Wenger’s call for a UEFA rules change which would cost both Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "Man Utd defender Harry Maguire is one of four Red Devils stars ‘immune’ to their ‘fire sale’ in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal risk a ‘disaster’ if they sack Mikel Arteta, while two ‘worries’ for Manchester United remain after their ‘brilliance’ vs Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Manchester United legend Gary Pallister has suggested that Ruben Amorim should consider dropping a Europa League hero as he may not be the out-and-out best player in any position he’s ...",
      "Liverpool have one of their ‘biggest ever summer transfer budgets’, and an XI of signings made by champions dominated by Manchester United to break into.",
      "Roy Keane piled in on Jamie Vardy earlier this week, criticising the Leicester forward’s relegation apology days before announcing his departure."

      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa, so where will he play his football next season?",
      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – as it stands, they are bound for the Conference League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal\nWe have read that Rashford is not interested in a move to a London club so this feels like a non-starter, but would he really turn down a move to the perennial runners-up – where he would be an upgrade on 24/25 Gabriel Martinelli – if they were his only Champions League option?",
      "",
      "5) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – are said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",
      "For our money, only Real Madrid have a greater transfer lure.",
      "",
      "6) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "7) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but should they sneak back into the Champions League – it will be tight – they could become an option once again.",
      "",
      "8) Borussia Dortmund\nThey pushed and they pushed hard in January, hoping to recreate the Jadon Sancho magic. But right now they are in the Aston Villa position of being rather more likely to land in the Conference League than Champions League.",
      "",

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed FC Barcelona’s current “internal” stance on signing Marcus Rashford as two factors boost the Manchester United outcast.",

      "The forward managed four goals and six assists for Unai Emery’s side before a hamstring injury put paid to his season, and although Villa have a £40m option to make Rashford’s move permanent, reports suggest the 27-year-old only has eyes for Barcelona.",
      "He was linked with a move to the Catalan giants in January, but they were put off by his £325,000 per week wages, which Villa are currently paying 75 per cent of.",

Barça is his favorite project and he will do everything possible to dress in Blaugrana.",
      "And now according to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, in another ‘strategic step’ to ensure a move to the Catalan Club, ‘Rashford has decided to entrust his affairs to a high-profile, highly experienced agent with strong ties to FC Barcelona: Pini Zahavi,’",

      "United want to secure Rashford’s permanent exit to get £40m of pure profit for their summer rebuild and to ensure all of his mammoth wage is off their bill.",
      "Amorim insisted last month that he was pleased to see Rashford and fellow loanee Antony performing well in their time away from Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim said: “All the players on loan will return, and then the club will decide what to do at the end of the season.",

      "However, with Liverpool running away with the Premier League, a Champions league last-four exit to PSG, an early exit in the FA Cup and a semi-final defeat to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup, the reality is a fifth trophyless season under Arteta.",
      "Is Arsenal's season a failure? No. Can it be classed as a success? No. Is it a disappointment? That answer is a definite yes.",
      "The Gunners have fallen well below the standards they have set themselves over the last couple of seasons. There are reasons for that drop-off, a Premier League-high 27 injuries for one, but they have managed to keep themselves respectable in the league, where other teams have not. A run to the last four of the Champions League is also not to be sniffed at.",
      "There will be no excuse from Arsenal behind the scenes. It's not been good enough this season and Arteta will know it, the players will know it, and of course the fans will know it too, but it is also a sign of how far the club have come under Arteta. One difficult season shouldn't detract from how far he has dragged Arsenal.",
      "Arguments will be made around Tottenham or Man Utd winning a trophy, despite their poor league performances. There's no doubt that short-term success will be enjoyed, and so it should be, but long-term, would those supporters want their clubs to be in Arsenal's position? They would, and that is what Ange Postecoglou and Ruben Amorim are striving for long term at their respective clubs - to compete for the biggest honours in the game.",
      "When you ignore the noise and take a step back, Arsenal's season has not been a disaster. Winning the biggest prizes doesn't come easy. It's time for Arsenal to dust themselves down, improve this summer, and go again as they look to stay on the upward trajectory they have found themselves on in recent years.Oliver Yew",
      "The 2024/25 season will go down as one of the worst under Pep Guardiola. Barely a sniff of a title defence, making it out of the Champions League phase on goal difference and exiting the Carabao Cup in the fourth round.",
      "Their saving grace is reaching the FA Cup final, facing Crystal Palace on May 17. But even Guardiola admitted that winning the competition would not make up for their league campaign, saying: \"The FA Cup keeps us safe. The Premier League dictates how good your season has been, and it has not been good, but it could be worse.\"",
      "Man City also faced a battle to finish in the top five and guarantee a Champions League place. However, on a run of seven unbeaten games and with Arsenal's dip in form, there is the possibility they could finish second.",
      "Man City have dropped 16 points from winning positions – most in any season under Guardiola (previously 13 in 2020/21 and 2022/23). They last dropped more points from winning positions in a Premier League season in 2008/09 (20).",
      "But Man City are arguably victims of their own success. Years of sustained, multiple trophy wins - including four successive Premier League titles - means one possible trophy and securing Champions League football is nothing to celebrate.",
      "Perhaps perspective is needed, though. While Guardiola's side have certainly underperformed compared to previous years, given their two months of turmoil between October and December when they won just one game in all competitions in the absence of Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, to potentially come away with something tangible marks a good recovery - even if Guardiola may disagree.Charlotte Marsh",
      "This one is pretty straightforward. Newcastle's season went down as a success the moment the final whistle blew at the end of their Carabao Cup final win over Liverpool in March.",
      "The 2-1 victory at Wembley ended a 70-year wait for silverware. It sparked jubilant celebrations among players and fans and also served as a turning point in the side's Premier League season.",
      "Newcastle lost four out of seven games leading into the Carabao Cup final, but have won five out of seven since, only losing once and putting themselves in an excellent position to clinch a Champions League finish in addition to a first trophy since 1969. There may be more celebrations to come.Nick Wright",
      "Enzo Maresca says winning the Conference League would show Chelsea are \"back\" after several turbulent seasons. A European trophy would mark the high point of the head coach's career, but it will take more than winning UEFA’s third-tier competition to make their season a success.",
      "Chelsea’s budget dwarfs that of every other side in the Conference League. Lifting the trophy against Real Betis in Wroclaw later this month represents the bare minimum.",
      "The real test of whether their campaign has been a positive one depends on qualifying for the Champions League. Chelsea have won the competition twice in the last 13 years. They have invested over £1bn on players since 2022. They simply have to return to competing with Europe's elite.",
      "Maresca looked set to achieve just that as the season approached its midway point, even feeling the need to dampen talk of a title challenge.",
      "But 2025 has been troublesome. Chelsea now require positive results against Champions League rivals Newcastle and Nottingham Forest if they want to finish in the top five. Maresca has also alienated significant sections of the fanbase with his occasionally sterile brand of football, as well as several misguided public comments.",
      "To the Italian's credit, he has steadied the ship in recent weeks and will surely lead Chelsea to their first trophy since that night in Porto four years ago.",
      "But their season is still on a knife edge. Pair silverware with a top-five finish and Maresca will have achieved par for the course. But missing out on the Champions League once again - especially from such a position of strength in mid-season - would represent failure for Maresca, his team and Chelsea's ambitious owners.Joe Shread",
      "Nottingham Forest were level with Arsenal at the start of February, six points clear of fourth. When they beat Manchester United at the beginning of April, that gap to fourth had increased to eight points and Champions League qualification appeared theirs.",

      "Forest fans know that their overriding emotion should be gratitude given that they finished one spot above the relegation zone last season - the worst of the rest. But what a chance this still is for the club to transform their prospects in the medium term.",
      "Any European football would have been a welcome surprise in August. Forest have been to Wembley and enjoyed many magical moments at the City Ground. But with hopes raised, fans crave the perfect ending now - and that means Champions League.",

      "Beating Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain in their return to Europe's elite competition for the first time in 42 years will live long in the memory of their supporters, as well as the spirited comeback that almost was against Luis Enrique's side, who have since booked their place in the final.",

      "However, there is a real chance that Villa will walk away from this memorable season with nothing to show for it.",
      "The debate hinges on what you want from football. Is success completely defined by silverware or can it be measured on pure enjoyment and delight?",
      "To suggest it hasn't been a resounding success would be a narrow-minded approach.",
      "With more games than ever - and a new intensity to deal with - Villa have not only balanced Champions League and domestic football, they have thrived.",
      "Two defeats to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup semi-final will linger in the driven mind of Unai Emery but the priorities were always clear. League form first with one eye on being competitive in midweek.",
      "Elsewhere, Morgan Rogers has continued his meteoric rise at the highest level, world-class talents Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford have raised the standards and, even if they are forced to settle for the Europa League, Villa can hold their heads high.",
      "No manager has won the trophy more than Emery. Champions League football might not be at Villa Park next season, but he will be. It could be a blessing in disguise to end that 29-year wait for silverware.Patrick Rowe",
      "Only two managers, Sir Matt Busby and Sir Alex Ferguson, can truly claim to have been successful at Manchester United, but achievement at Old Trafford is measured differently to most clubs because of the standards set by those two legendary figures.",
      "This is apparent when you consider United, at their lowest ebb for 30 years, have reached five major finals in the last five seasons. If they beat Spurs in the Europa League final on May 21, it will be their third piece of major silverware in that time.",
      "No one could seriously argue the case for United being in the conversation about the best teams in England over the past five years which, after all, is the ultimate aim at Old Trafford.",
      "But Liverpool have that same record in finals over that period. Man City and Chelsea are the only sides to reach more (6). Arsenal, the second-best team in England for the best part of three years, haven't made one, losing their last four semi-finals.",
      "Ruben Amorim is right to say the season cannot be saved, whatever happens in Bilbao, because, as seen under Erik ten Hag, silverware doesn't always translate into league success, the measure United will always live and die by.",
      "Beating Spurs in the final on May 21, however, would at least give United something to show for their season - and Champions League qualification, which, for some clubs, will be the only prize they take home.",
      "Only Liverpool, really - and perhaps City, if they lift the FA Cup - could argue to have had a better season than whichever team is victorious in Bilbao. Football, after all, is about winning trophies, not top-five finishes.Zinny Boswell",
      "It has been 17 years since Tottenham last won a trophy. You have to go back 41 years since they last won a European title.",
      "The thirst for silverware at Spurs has never been greater.",
      "Watching Newcastle's joyous scenes in March at Wembley and then the open-top bus parade around the city after their Carabao Cup final win - which ended an even longer trophy drought than Spurs' - only heightened the north London club's desire for silverware success.",
      "You do not get such scenes for Champions League qualification. There is no honours board showing top-four finishes, but there is one for trophies.",
      "Spurs fans are always mocked for the club's lack of recent silverware and a dusty trophy cabinet, but this month's final in Bilbao is the chance to change that narrative.",
      "Glory in Spain would make up for a disastrous Premier League campaign, which has seen them lose an alarming 19 games.",
      "It is clear that the domestic campaign has been abysmal, but there is no chance those Spurs fans in Bilbao would suddenly temper any potential celebrations because they embarrassingly lost at home to relegated Leicester and Ipswich earlier this season.",
      "That would all be forgotten because a trophy means everything right now, and a European one would be even more special.",
      "But with Spurs all-in on the Europa League, it is a dangerous high-wire act for boss Ange Postecoglou.",
      "He will either be a hero for delivering on his promise of \"always winning things in his second season\" and in the process, possibly save his job.",

      "England will have six clubs in next year's competition, having earned an extra spot through their co-efficient score, and with one of Manchester United and Spurs also guaranteed to qualify by winning the Europa League.",

This 'get out jail free' card on offer from UEFA in the form of Champions League qualification through winning the Europa League might not be in the best long-term interests of these two underachieving football clubs.",
      "Think about it. Are Spurs and Manchester United truly capable of managing a Premier League campaign alongside playing in the Champions League next season?",
      "Even Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has issued such a warning, saying: \"We are not ready to play Premier League competitively and be in the Champions League.\"",

      "Off the pitch, winning in Bilbao would be met by huge sighs of relief in both boardrooms, but trying to negotiate a Premier League season with the added load of Champions League football is going to make life very tricky again for either club.",
      "In amongst the allure and excitement of Bilbao and what might transpire in the final, it's easy to forget Spurs' home defeats to Ipswich and Leicester, the misery of watching this Man Utd team play football at Old Trafford, the boos, the bashing from pundits, the social media meltdowns and general embarrassment of what both clubs have produced this season.",
      "United have set a record low points tally for a Premier League season in being able to only reach a maximum of 48 points - their previous lowest was 58. Spurs have lost 19 Premier League games - the most after 34 league games in the club's history.",
      "Between these two, they have lost 35 Premier League games.",

      "After a season in the doldrums, finishing 10th in the Premier League, Antonio Conte revitalised the club and, without the added stresses of European football, roared them to a Premier League title.",
      "He is on the cusp of repeating the trick with Napoli this season, taking a team that finished 10th and therefore without European football to a Serie A title with a rampaging end-of-season run, whilst chief rivals Inter Milan have been ultimately distracted by their path to the Champions League final.",
      "Inter have shown how going deep in a European campaign can hurt domestic form and it happens regularly on these shores too.",
      "West Ham finished seventh in 2021/22 and won the Conference League. The next season, they finished 14th.",
      "Newcastle finished fourth in 2022/23 and enjoyed a Champions League campaign but then dropped to seventh.",
      "Brighton finished sixth, went on a Europa League adventure and then dropped to 11th as it all unravelled for Roberto De Zerbi.",
      "Since 2004, 25 of 35 teams who qualify for Europe that didn't the season before all won fewer points in the next season as the bright lights of those exciting midweek nights made it difficult to keep concentrated on domestic matters.",
      "Although Spurs and Manchester United don't officially fall into that category, it gives a relevant overview of how a European campaign can make it very hard to remain consistent in the Premier League.",
      "Look at Aston Villa.",
      "They fully embraced the Champions League challenge and produced some memorable nights - beating Bayern Munich at Villa Park - that ultimately led to a quarter-final place, before giving Paris Saint-Germain a serious fright in that last-eight tie, where they were only eliminated by one goal.",
      "But this did come at a cost to their league form, where their results after a Champions League night became affected.",
      "In 11 matches after a European night, Villa won just four of their 11 Premier League games. That's in stark contrast to their form of late, where the rest between games has increased. Since the completion of the league phase of the Champions League, Villa have only lost once in the Premier League from 12 games.",
      "Losing in Bilbao will hurt either team - but that short-term pain might be in the best interests of the club for some long-term gain.",

      "Much of the work had been done in Bilbao, United securing that seemingly unassailable three-goal lead. With the Williams brothers - Nico and Inaki - both unavailable for this return match in Manchester, the feeling was that Athletic lacked the requisite firepower.",
      "But this is United. While they found plenty of space in behind from the outset, they were wasteful. Patrick Dorgu and Alejandro Garnacho were the chief culprits and the Basque side punished them when Mikel Jaureguizar curled in from long range to pull one back.",
      "Harry Maguire lost possession too easily, while Andre Onana got hands to the shot but could not keep it out. It encouraged the vocal away fans to believe that an improbable comeback was on and Garnacho missing a one-on-one did nothing to dispel the notion.",

      "Lots being on the line, added to two teams who know how to mix it, means this should be a full-blooded affair. They've already played one another twice this season and there's been 15 cards shown in total, so there is spice potential.",
      "Enzo Fernandez's price stands out on picking up a booking based on his likely match-up with Bruno Guimaraes in central areas. It's Brazil vs Argentina in there and Bruno is a foul-drawing master, having been responsible for getting 34 players booked since the start of last season - a huge figure.",
      "Fernandez's cards data away from home recently is very appealing too - he's been carded in six of his last nine away games.",
      "Nottingham Forest are ridiculously short in the betting here at 1/3 with Sky Bet, even against a team like Leicester, when you factor in what is on the line and the expectation on the home side to win the game. It's something they've not coped with at home, losing to both Everton and Brentford in front of a very nervy crowd.",
      "So at the prices, Forest have to be taken on here, but I want to chase a bigger price in Jamie Vardy to score and be carded at 18/1 with Sky Bet.",
      "Vardy will be relishing this occasion. He needs just one goal to reach 200 for Leicester and you can see him doing it at the City Ground, with perhaps a prepared shirt underneath celebrating the milestone.",

Judging by his words, it will be another rest and rotate job for this one in what could be a very low-key game up against another team with a huge fixture on the horizon.",
      "Oliver Glasner seems a little more convinced about keeping the rhythm of his team together in the build-up to that Wembley final and it's easy to see why the market favours them here at 29/20 with Sky Bet.",
      "The one constant this season in a bang average West Ham side has been Jarrod Bowen's attacking output.",
      "He will have been disappointed not to have kicked on in terms of improving last year's numbers but a per-90 average of 0.59 goal involvements is still something to be proud of playing for a team who could finish 17th in the Premier League. Bowen has four goal involvements in his last three games and is 11/8 with Sky Bet to grab another.",
      "Arsenal have scored 17 goals fewer and recorded 20.7 expected goals fewer than Liverpool in the Premier League this season. That has held them back and has proven costly across all their major trophy hunts this season. Just look at that first 10 minutes at Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "They were sensational in every department, apart from the most important one - putting the ball in the net.",
      "One player that may start doing that more next season is Declan Rice, who remains very attractive in the goalscorer markets based on his new position playing in the No 8 role. In his 54 starts in that position, he's managed to score 12 goals. Those numbers make the 20/1 first goalscorer price with Sky Bet look a little wild.",

      "Man Utd beat Athletic Club 7-1 on aggregate in their Europa League semi-final to book their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21; Mason Mount scored twice, becoming the first United substitute to do so in a European knockout game since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003",
      "Friday 9 May 2025 11:43, UK",
      "Mason Mount says it was worth the wait to finally ignite his Manchester United career after his two goals off the bench against Athletic Club secured their place in the Europa League final.",
      "Mount's United career has been blighted by injury since he signed from Chelsea in 2023 for an initial £55m and has threatened to fade away completely, but this performance, on what was undoubtedly his best night for the club, may well be the turning point.",
      "United were 1-0 down and struggling at Old Trafford - although 3-1 up on aggregate - when Mount came on with Amad Diallo and Kobbie Mainoo after an hour to change the game, booking their place in the final against Tottenham on May 21 in Bilbao with a 7-1 win over the two legs.",
      "Mount's equaliser, a sharp turn and finish in the box, kickstarted a late flurry of goals, four coming in less than 20 minutes, as Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund scored before the midfielder's second, an effort from near the halfway line with his weaker foot.",
      "\"I knew something good was going to come. I carried on going, working hard in training every day and trying to stay positive, and when I had the opportunity like this, it paid off.\"",
      "\"It was too long,\" he added, referring to his wait for a feeling like this on a big night.",
      "Mount, who had never scored at Old Trafford for United, became the first substitute at the club to score twice in a European knockout match since David Beckham against Real Madrid in 2003.",
      "\"The crowd has been unbelievable,\" he said. \"They've stuck with us. For me personally, my first goals here at Old Trafford, so a special night, one I've been waiting for a long time.",
      "\"To go back to Bilbao, a special moment for us, and we want to finish strong now.\"",
      "\"Moments like these are worth the wait,\" Mount later wrote on social media with an image of him celebrating his goal in front of the Old Trafford crowd. \"Back to Bilbao, Reds!\"",
      "Mount's moment was enjoyed by the whole Man Utd squad, none more so than his head coach Ruben Amorim, who has always been a big advocate of his since arriving mid-season from Sporting, despite his injury setbacks.",
      "Asked about his smile when Mount scored, Amorim said in his post-match press conference: \"Not just me, if you look at the bench, that is the best feeling as a coach.",
      "\"When you look at the other guys on the bench, they are so happy for Mason Mount because everybody in that dressing room sees Mason Mount doing everything he can to be available.",
      "\"He's a really good player and you can see both goals are really good goals. So I think not just Mason Mount, not just me, but also the team-mates, they were so happy for him.\"",
      "\"When you see that kind of guy, working hard every day. When you have this type of player, you just want to help them.",
      "\"He is perfect for that [No 10] position because he can be a midfielder, he can run like a winger, he can play with his back to the goal.\"",
      "Tottenham await Man Utd in the Europa League final, which takes place at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao, Spain on Wednesday May 21; kick-off 8pm."

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim claims his team could be the worst Premier League side to lift a European trophy; United face Athletic Club in the second leg of the Europa League semi-final on Thursday and hold a 3-0 lead",
      "Thursday 8 May 2025 21:02, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has claimed his side could be the \"worst Premier League side to win a European trophy\" if they go on to lift the Europa League.",
      "United head into the second leg of their semi-final tie against Athletic Club with a 3-0 lead as they look to book their place in the final in Bilbao on May 21.",
      "Speaking in his press conference ahead of Thursday's second leg, Amorim was asked to reflect on his comments from January, where he claimed his team could be the worst in the history of United, given they could reach a European final to potentially salvage a disappointing campaign.",
      "He said: \"For me, in that moment and you look at Premier League, we are the worst team since I arrived in terms of results. That is my idea. In the end of the season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title.",
      "\"So we will not change anything. We know that this season was disappointing.",
      "\"Nothing is going to change, in that moment, I have to think a bit more but I felt that. I still feel that this season was the worst in the last 50 years.\"",
      "United forward Alejandro Garnacho, who was seated next to him in the press conference, was then asked for his opinion on the comments made by his manager and how it impacts the dressing room.",
      "He said: \"We know we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. We follow the rules and tomorrow we will face the game like it is 0-0.",
      "\"If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we can face the next season with a better mentality.\"",
      "Amorim also went on to speak about the fitness of his squad for the fixture, where he ruled out defender Matthijs de Ligt after he was forced off during the 4-3 defeat to Brentford.",
      "\"It is not a big issue,\" Amorim continued. \"He cannot play then we will check day by day. The rest, Ayden [Heaven] doesn't recover. Toby [Collyer] is not available.",
      "\"That is it.\"",
      "They join long-term absentees Lisandro Martinez, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee on the sidelines.",
      "Garancho says he is \"happy\" at the club amid interest from Napoli and Chelsea.",
      "\"As a footballer, you will hear rumours about the future,\" he said. \"I am contracted until 2028, and I am happy here.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Daily Mail report this week claimed Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes could be the target for a big-money offer from Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal this summer.",
      "The Portugal international's representatives reportedly held talks with Al Hilal on Monday after initial contact between the two camps last year before Fernandes signed his new Old Trafford deal until the summer of 2027, which has an option of a 12-month extension.",
      "Man Utd boss Amorim revealed in March he had told the 30-year-old he was \"not going anywhere\" following links to Real Madrid, with Amorim striking a similar tone amid talk of a summer move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"I think it is easy to understand (his importance) - not just because of the numbers but the way he plays, the importance that he has during his five years here,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he's the captain, so he's really important.",
      "\"It's normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others.",
      "\"But we want to keep the best players and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn't change. We want Bruno here.\""
