      "Sir Alex Ferguson was spotted in the stands at Cardiff's League One season opener against Peterborough on Saturday as he attended the game to support his son Darren, who manages Posh.",
      "Cardiff won the game 2-1 thanks in part to Ruben Colwill's stunning free kick, before Ronan Kpakio completed the turnaround victory after Bradley Ihionvien had put the away side ahead from the penalty spot in the first half.",
      "Manchester United's legendary manager Sir Alex was a minor sub-plot to the game as he was picked out by the cameras in the stands, sitting alongside Peterborough's director of football Barry Fry, who came through the youth system at Old Trafford without playing a senior game.",
      "Commentator Daniel Mann was also keen to point out that Sir Alex and Fry both had a connection to United as he said: \"I'm sure we're all excited to see Sir Alex here.",
      "\"Another fellow former Manchester United man there in Barry Fry, who had four years there as a young player.\"",
      "Sir Alex retired from management in 2013 after bowing out with his 13th Premier League title and went on to become an ambassador for the club, regularly being spotted at their matches at Old Trafford.",
      "The Scot was reportedly being paid £2m a year by United as part of his role, but that has since been removed amid United's sweeping cost-cutting scheme under Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Fry, meanwhile, came through the United youth system back in 1960 but never played for the Red Devils.",
      "He has had an association with Peterborough since 1996 after starting off as manager of the club, staying in that role for nine years, before moving upstairs as director of football - a role he has held ever since.",
      "Fry, along with chairman Darragh McAnthony has been responsible for hiring Sir Alex's son Darren four times.",
      "Ferguson Jr first took over the club in 2007 for two years before returning in 2011 for four years. He then took up the job at Doncaster Rovers, where he spent another four years before going back to Peterborough yet again in 2019.",
      "He would resign in 2022 following a poor season before being persuaded to take up a fourth stint the following year after the sacking of Grant McCann.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The Red Devils will have to start thinking about a long-term successor for Fernandes and Spanish outlet Sport have claimed United are about to test the waters over Lopez.",
      "Lopez is one of the brightest talents to have come out of Barcelona's famed La Masia academy in recent years and he has gone on to play 88 times for his boyhood club after his breakthrough in the 2023-24 season.",
      "The 22-year-old impressed with seven goals and eight assists in all competitions last season but will hungry for even more game time after making just 12 starts in La Liga, and another 16 off the bench.",
      "Sport claim United are ready to double Lopez's salary at Old Trafford. He currently earns around £64,000-a-week at Barcelona.",
      "Barcelona are open to selling Lopez but feel the player will be reluctant to leave the club having previously rejected teams in the Premier League.",
      "It's claimed United spoke with Barca officials about the possibility of snapping up Lopez while the Spanish club were in negotiations to sign Marcus Rashford on loan.",
      "United wanted Lopez to be included in the deal but didn't want to hold up Rashford's exit because they were eager to get his wages off their books for PSR reasons, the report goes on.",
      "Rashford is one of five players United have been attempting to offload, knowing that they must secure more outgoings if they want to bring more players in amid their ongoing financial difficulties.",

      "Benjamin Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, claims the 22-year-old wants a \"special project with a special coach\" as he targets a potential move to the Premier League. This news comes as Newcastle United table a huge £65.5million bid for the RB Leipzig striker, amidst the ongoing Alexander Isak transfer drama.",
      "Manchester United are also in the race to sign the towering centre-forward, with Ruben Amorim keen to get a No.9 in the door to front his attacking line. United are progressing with a deal to sign the Slovenian international after picking him as their preferred target over Ollie Watkins, but Newcastle could put a stop to this with their bid.",
      "Sesko has not commented on the prospect of a switch to the Premier League previously, meaning he has not given any clues or indications. Given this, it could all come down to who can provide the striker with the most attractive overall package, and that doesn't simply mean financially.",
      "Basanovic discussed the possibility of Sesko making a move to England earlier this summer, stating that the striker will be looking for a range of things before deciding where to play. The agent, who met former United football director John Murtough back in 2022 to talk about a potential move to Old Trafford, said: \"It's not correct to speak about the names of clubs that are interested in Sesko, but maybe it is right to clarify a few things.",
      "\"Let me tell you: Sesko is not competing with anyone. It's him vs him every day. We have a clear plan for the future and media speculation doesn't affect us. His numbers at his age are comparable to some strikers with already great careers.",
      "\"That confirms my words. He will move from RB Leipzig only when we recognise a special club. A special project with a special coach.\"",
      "United are currently working on 'Project 150', an ambitious scheme launched last year with the target of clinching the Premier League crown again by 2028 for their 150th anniversary.",
      "Speaking about the initiative in June, United chief executive Omar Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",
      "However, Eddie Howe is keen to make an impression on Sesko it seems, as Newcastle's project focuses on making the club a permanent fixture in the top five of the league table.",
      "It remains to be seen where Sesko will decide to go - if he moves at all - but the transfer battle is looking likely to heat up between the north east and north west giants of the Premier League.",

      "RB Leipzig are reportedly interested in Rasmus Hojlund as a potential replacement for Benjamin Sesko, but the Manchester United striker does not want to join them. Sesko has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League this summer.",
      "Both United and Newcastle are interested in the 22-year-old, with the Magpies lodging an opening bid of just under £70million. United, meanwhile, are braced for protracted negotiations with Leipzig over Sesko.",
      "There had been suggestions that United could win the race for Sesko by offering Hojlund to Leipzig as part of a swap deal. However, talkSPORT are reporting that Hojlund has 'made it clear he does not want to go there'.",
      "The news comes after United boss Ruben Amorim admitted he cannot give any guarantees about Hojlund's future. Speaking after Hojlund scored in United's 4-1 win over Bournemouth in pre-season, Amorim said: \"I'm really happy with Rasmus, but I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market.",
      "\"The important thing is that the strikers who are here are working really well, they are improving, they are helping the team and that's the most important thing. The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals.",
      "\"He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. Again, I don't know what is going to happen until the market is closed. We suffered a a lot because of the lack of goals last season. But I think not just the goals, but the way Rasmus connects the play.",
      "\"Every time we have to kick the ball, we are kicking the ball when we are more pressed. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in the support is helping us to play a lot better and we are playing better because he's playing better.",
      "\"I'm really happy with the players that we had last season. They are improving. We look like a different team today. Let's continue with that. I'm really happy with Bryan [Mbeumo], Matheus [Cunha], even Diego [Leon].",
      "\"You can see it. He's a smart guy. He's a guy that came from Paraguay to come to the Premier League. He's really powerful, so I'm really happy with the three guys.\"",
      "Hojlund, though, appears keen to fight for his place at United and has insisted the signing of a new striker will \"sharpen\" him. \"I think the most important thing for me is just to keep working hard and stay focused and then obviously we'll see what happens,\" he said.",
      "\"I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes.\"",

      "Newcastle recently tabled a formal bid of around £70million for the powerful striker. He has been one of the most exciting young strikers in world football for the best part of a year and has previously been linked with Arsenal.",
      "One person who ranks him highly is Simons, who has been the ex-RB Salzburg's forward's team-mate for many years. The Dutchman, who is being tracked by Chelsea, has even said the striker is a better player than himself.",
      "Earlier this year, during a Q&A session, Simons was asked to rank other young players globally. After favouring Mainoo over Warren Zaire-Emery, he was then asked to compare the young United midfielder with Sesko - he immediately chose the young striker.",
      "Simons was then asked to pick between himself and the centre-forward. Without hesitating, he said Sesko again.",
      "The United and Newcastle target returned the compliment when he expressed his admiration for the Dutchman, following the midfielder's permanent switch to Leipzig in January. After Simons netted twice against Werder Bremen, Sesko said: \"I love to play with him. He makes things fun. I'm really happy for his two goals because now he is going to have even more confidence.\"",
      "Interestingly, Simons also looks set for a Premier League move, but to one of United's biggest rivals. He was dropped from RB Leipzig's squad for a pre-season friendly against Atalanta as a result of the fierce transfer speculation.",

      "The German outfit are believed to be seeking £60million to release him. Chelsea have already splashed considerable cash, having acquired Joao Pedro, Liam Delap, and numerous others.",
      "Meanwhile, Newcastle have submitted a formal bid for Sesko. The Magpies, who face the prospect of losing Alexander Isak this summer, have tabled £65.5m, with add-ons believed to be worth approximately £4.3m.",
      "The Magpies have already witnessed numerous prime targets reject their approaches this summer for alternative destinations. Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford recently spurned their interest so he could rejoin Manchester City.",
      "He joins the growing list of players, including Pedro, Delap, and Hugo Ekitike, who have turned down the club. Newcastle are hoping to beat United to Sesko's signature, which will see Eddie Howe land an impressive insurance policy should Alexander Isak end up departing.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has left Manchester United icon Rio Ferdinand utterly amazed with his skills during a pre-season training camp session, impressing alongside teammates Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo. The United captain joined the squad on their trip to the United States for the Premier League Summer Series, where they've already registered wins over West Ham and Bournemouth.",
      "The Red Devils are now gearing up to face David Moyes' Everton on Sunday evening to conclude their American tour. Ruben Amorim's men have put in some impressive performances in pre-season, with Fernandes playing a pivotal role in their performances.",
      "He's also stood out in training sessions, catching the eye of Ferdinand, who shared a behind-the-scenes look into the team's preparations for the upcoming season. Ferdinand took to YouTube to offer fans unfiltered access to the training session, where he was particularly taken aback by Fernandes' skills.",
      "During a 'rondo' exercise, which demands swift passing and quick footwork from the players, Ferdinand couldn't help but praise the Portuguese midfielder. The former defender said: \"I'm just here now watching training.",
      "\"This is my favourite part of training that I used to love, this is called the box, the rondo. This is all I used to look forward to every day. I'm just watching, there's some quality on show.",
      "\"Bruno's putting on a bit of a clinic at the moment, he's doing some crazy stuff. Him and Casemiro are having a little laugh there, you can see they are, they seem like the best two at the moment for me, Casemiro and Bruno.\"",
      "The video clip shows Fernandes and Casemiro effortlessly exchanging passes in a rondo drill, with their skillful touches highlighted in slow motion. Ferdinand went on to praise young talent Kobbie Mainoo as well, adding: \"Actually, Kobbie. Kobbie's good as well.\"",
      "United fans will be eager for Fernandes to continue his stellar performances at Old Trafford, especially with the latest surprising transfer news from the Saudi Pro League. Despite turning down Al-Hilal earlier this year, stating his ambition to compete at the \"highest possible level\", Al-Nassr are now rumoured to be eyeing a move for the 30-year-old during this transfer window.",
      "Al-Nassr, led by Fernandes' international teammate and ex-United star Cristiano Ronaldo, could be looking to bolster their squad following the appointment of head coach Jorge Jesus.",
      "Jesus, who was handed Fernandes his Sporting CP debut in 2017, might be keen to add the midfielder to his roster of Portuguese talents, which already includes Ronaldo, Joao Felix, and Otavia.",
      "Fernandes has previously expressed contentment at United, dismissing any notion of a departure. However, the enticing financial gain on offer from the Middle East has swayed some of football's top players.",
      "Discussing his career prospects in June, the midfielder said: \"Manchester United said they didn't want to sell me.",

Marcus Rashford's season-long loan move to Barcelona cleared £12m off their annual wage bill, with the La Liga club covering his entire salary.",

      "Manchester United are continuing to push to land £70m-rated RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko - despite competition from Newcastle.",
      "United made their first approach for the Slovenian star last week, through intermediaries, who opened up dialogue over a potential deal. Those talks have progressed and will be stepped up this week, once United have returned home from their three-game tour of the US.",
      "Newcastle are also pushing for Sesko, with United prepared for a lengthy battle to land the sought after 22-year-old. On Saturday it emerged that Newcastle have made a bid of just under £70m for Sesko, having rejected Liverpool's £110m offer for Alexander Isak.",
      "Against that backdrop, Manchester United are braced for protracted negotiations with Bundesliga club Leipzig, who are determined to stand firm on their £70m valuation.",
      "Although United are looking to offload several players before the summer transfer window closes, they have scope to sign a striker without selling.",
      "Marcus Rashford's season-long loan move to Barcelona cleared £12m off their annual wage bill, with the La Liga club covering his entire salary.",
      "United also raised £20.7m from sell-on clauses including Anthony Elanga’s switch to Newcastle, moves for Alvaro Fernandez and Maxi Oyedele, and the £5m paid by Chelsea to pull out of their deal to sign Jadon Sancho.",
      "In addition, United's failure to qualify for Europe this season – for only the second time in 35 years - means they are not bound by UEFA'S limit of spending no more than 70 per cent of annual income on transfers and wages.",
      "Despite that, United are still bound by financial restrictions imposed by Profit and Sustainability [PSR] rules, which they intend to stick within.",
      "But United's willingness to pay inflated transfer fees in recent seasons has left the club with significant amortisation costs that are still being felt.",
      "That means sales will have to be made before the end of the financial year on June 30 next year, to ensure United comply with financial regulations.",
      "The structure of the deals for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, who cost a combined £133.5m, with payments spread over instalments, has given United greater freedom to spend, as have wider cost-cutting at the club in terms of redundancies and reduced outlay across every level of the business.",

      "Barcelona have promised fans that they will soon see Marcus Rashford in his prime. The Manchester United forward completed a loan move to Catalonia earlier this summer.",
      "The Spanish giants have a £30m option to sign him permanently come the end of the season. Rashford has since had a slow start to life with his new club.",
      "He was substituted on and then off on his debut against Japanese side Vissel Kobe. And while that would usually be embarrassing for footballers, Barcelona boss Hansi Flick explained it was simply for fitness reasons.",
      "\"We're being very careful with Marcus because he just came from an injury and he hasn't started training completely with the ball,\" Flick confirmed, before adding: \"He’s [Rashford] a week behind the others. He hasn’t been training as much with the ball, and we want to look after him.”",
      "Rashford then made his second Barcelona appearance against FC Seoul, where he was reunited with former United star Jesse Lingard. And Barcelona have now offered an exciting update on the forward, by claiming he will be at top form sooner rather than later.",
      "Writing on Twitter, the Spanish giants said: “We’ll see prime Rashford soon.” Rashford has a couple more chances to impress in pre-season against Daegu and Como ahead of their first La Liga game of the season against Mallorca.",
      "Giving his verdict on his move, Rashford claimed that Flick can help him rediscover his best form. He said: “I feel very good, it was a good performance, and it was truly wonderful to play in front of the Barcelona fans, and it was beneficial for physical fitness.",
      "“I’m looking forward to the upcoming matches. We won today, but it’s important to adapt to the team, get into the playing style and deliver good football.",
      "How many goals will Marcus Rashford score this season? Share your predictions in the comments below",
      "“I believe Hansi Flick can make me play good football. I will play where the team needs me and try to score goals and create them from those positions.",
      "“I’ll listen to any information I hear from Flick and try to apply it to matches to help the team. My favourite position? I prefer the left side, but I can play in different positions, one of my strengths is being able to play various roles.”",
      "Rashford spent the second half of last season with Premier League outfit Aston Villa, scoring four goals in 17 appearances. Villa did have the chance to sign the forward permanently but decided not to activate that option.",

      "Matheus Cunha believes a midfielder Manchester United have been urged to sign can win the Ballon d'Or. Rio Ferdinand has advised United to abandon their pursuit of Benjamin Sekso and instead go all out for Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "The Red Devils have already bolstered their attack this summer with the acquisitions of Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford. With Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee eager to make their mark at Old Trafford after challenging starts, Ferdinand reckons manager Ruben Amorim is well-stocked with forwards and should turn his attention to beefing up his midfield.",
      "Should United heed Ferdinand's advice and hunt for a midfielder, he has one name in mind -21-year-old sensation Baleba, who has been turning heads at Brighton since his transfer from Lille in 2023.",
      "Baleba himself has lofty ambitions, fuelled by encouragement from Ballon d'Or winner Rodri and others, including Cunha. He revealed his aspirations to The Sun in May, saying: \"Declan Rice, Matheus Cunha, Joelinton, they've all told me I've got it in me. I want to win the Ballon d'Or like Rodri.\"",
      "On his admiration for Rodri, he said: \"I watched him [Rodri] during the Euros and before his injury I played against him and time I got the ball, he was right in front of me. It was my first game against Manchester City, and it was very difficult.",
      "\"He made it so hard to dribble or pass. That showed his class. His success has opened the door for midfielders like us to believe we can win the Ballon d'Or someday.\"",
      "Ferdinand revealed why he rates Baleba so highly on his YouTube channel, saying: \"If I don't get a striker, I'd go midfield. There's only one name I'm thinking about, I've got to be honest, who I think fits the bill for what we need.",
      "\"An Amorim-type player as well. Physically great, can drive with the ball, can take it in all areas, very good tactically, great energy, great legs, Premier League experience, centre midfield. Baleba.",
      "\"That's who I go and get. That's my man. That's the one I go and get. I go and break the bank. So if I got the money for the four players that are surplus to requirements now, would I get a number nine or would I get Baleba?",
      "\"Would I get a number nine I'm not sure about, who's a bit young, inexperienced, or would I get Baleba with Premier League experience and know what he can do here? I'm going Baleba, sorry.",
      "\"I'm going to go with Baleba. I think he'll have a huge impact on this squad, on this team. You free up a few people in that midfield area as well to have a little less responsibility defensively because I think he's all-action. He can do it all.\"",
      "The Red Devils have switched their focus to Sesko after determining he represented a more achievable target than Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins. Newcastle are also pursuing the Slovenian forward, with mixed reports emerging regarding the 22-year-old's preferred destination.",
      "Initially, it was believed that the Red Devils were Sesko's favoured choice. However, reports from his home country now indicate that he is more inclined towards a move to Newcastle, who have turned down a £110m offer from Liverpool for Alexander Isak.",

      "Talks are already underway between United and the Bundesliga club, albeit they are at an early stage. Ruben Amorim’s side are facing competition for his services though, with Newcastle also eyeing Sesko as a potential replacement for Alexander Isak.",
      "As it stands, the Swedish forward looks unlikely to leave St James’ Park after Newcastle rejected Liverpool’s opening bid. And that would hint that they no longer need Sesko.",
      "But reports from the frontman’s homeland of Slovenia suggest otherwise. According to Delo, Sesko has already chosen to join Newcastle instead of Manchester United this summer.",
      "But should he choose Newcastle it would be another fresh blow to United and their hopes of signing a striker having already seen former target Viktor Gyokeres move to Arsenal. Sesko, 22, scored 21 goals for Leipzig last season.",
      "United star Patrick Dorgu has already given his verdict on the Red Devils’ pursuit of a striker but claimed he still has faith in misfiring teammate Rasmus Hojlund. He said: “He's doing really well. He looks sharp, he looks fit and I'm very happy for Rasmus to get his goal.",
      "“It was a difficult season for Rasmus. Not only for him, but for everyone, so I think this season is really important for him and for the team to get back to where we have to be in the league.",
      "“We need a striker to deliver on the pitch, so that's why he was happy. We talk in training, we try to understand each other on the pitch, for me to know where he is in the box and what movements he likes. He needs confidence, everyone needs confidence and a goal always helps with that.”",
      "Elsewhere, Ruben Amorim has also taken a hard-line stance on any United signings, claiming that they must want to become a Red Devil. He said: “They have to want to come here. I think what we can do to the fans is that we want players who have proved [themselves] already.",
      "“Sometimes you have a player with a lot of potential, you have to be aware of that, but all the players that are coming, we need to know the player. We need to talk to the player, we have to explain the project.",
      "“And then one really important thing is that they want to come here. That is the key point. If during the market we can find someone that can help the team and have all that boxes with them, we are going to do it. If not, we cannot do it because it's an important time in our club.”",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim will have his eye on signing two more players, even if they secure a deal for Benjamin Sesko. The Red Devils are pursuing the RB Leipzig forward, who is also wanted by Newcastle United, and are said to be the frontrunners for his signature.",
      "Amorim has already been busy in the transfer window, wrapping up a deal for £62.5million Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Matheus Cunha, before forking out a further £71m on Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo. However, with United's form on the floor since he took over from the sacked Erik ten Hag, Amorim is still looking to bolster his squad.",
      "Sesko, 22, could cost United as much as £70m, which would take their spending past the £200m mark. Nevertheless, recent reports indicate Amorim wants to add more depth to his squad.",
      "According to the Sun, if the Red Devils do secure Sesko's signature, Amorim will still want to add two more players to his squad. One of those will be a back-up goalkeeper to Andre Onana.",
      "It's understood Antwerp's shot-stopper, Senne Lammens, is in their sights at this current moment. However, Onana's future as No. 1 was also thrown into doubt when United were linked with a surprise move for Paris Saint-Germain No. 1 Gianluigi Donnarumma.",
      "Onana, 29, was signed from Inter Milan by Ten Hag in the summer of 2023 for £47m. While there have been some positive moments, the Cameroonian has been largely inconsistent.",
      "Meanwhile, second-choice goalkeeper Altay Bayindir has mainly featured in the League Cup and the FA Cup. Despite being handed the No. 1 shirt when he signed from Fenerbahce for £4.3m in the same summer, the Turkish international has only made four Premier League appearances.",
      "However, it is clear that a move for Sesko has taken priority over everything else. Fabrizio Romano recently claimed United will send a \"formal bid\" to Leipzig, if or when the player indicates he wants to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Newcastle have still been linked with him and recently rejected a £110m bid from Liverpool for Alexander Isak. But in and amongst the rumours, current United forward Rasmus Hojlund pledged to remain a red and compete for his place.",
      "The Dane recently said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that's for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me.",
      "\"I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.",
      "“I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game.\"",

      "As per Portuguese outlet A Bola, Al-Nassr are interested in a move for Fernandes. Manager Jorge Jesus is leading the club’s interest having worked with the midfielder at former club Sporting Lisbon.",
      "It is reported that early talks have taken place, with Al-Nassr keen to know if Fernandes would be open to a move.

      "Arsenal, Aston Villa, Man Utd, Leeds United and Crystal Palace have all increased prices by £5. At the other end of the spectrum, Brentford and Wolves have the cheapest shirts, priced at £45. The average price of a Premier league kids shirt has reached £56.25",
      ".Inflation-busting price rises are fuelling a black market in fake shirts. They are sold openly via social media, including one site called DHGate.",
      "Newcastle Utd fan James Smith, 37, of Consett, Co Durham, was at St James Park with children Freddie, 10, and Elsie, eight, this weekend. He said: \"I don't know many people who are willing to pay £70 or £80 for a shirt when you can get a fake one for £15.",
      "\"I think most fans would be prepared to pay £50 for a shirt and maybe £35 for a junior kit. Many people get the retro shirts these days but even more are going to DHGate. They are selling them for £15 and there is still a margin for profit for them.",
      "\"The only way you get a genuine one these days is as a gift for Christmas or birthdays. They are just too much for ordinary fans, especially if you have kids. People also buy the away or third choice kit as they don't change as often.\"",
      "Claire Nicholl, a university education manager, has just bought the new Newcastle United kit for her son Jack, 17. Both are loyal season ticket holders but Claire said: \"You pick them up and think 'I am not paying that'. If you get a name of a player on the back then it is even more.",
      "\"But we have done that before and it is no good when the players are sold. We are true Newcastle supporters and season ticket holders. It would be different if the money for the shirts was going to the club to improve the stadium, or to sign players. But it is not.\"",
      "Brentford’s new kit has a one year-cycle, after previously running a two-year cycle, the only club in the Premier league to do so. This year, the club’s home kit celebrates 100 years of red and white, and the club’s partnership with front of shirt sponsor, Hollywoodbets, will end after 2025/26, in line with the Premier League’s voluntary ban on front-of-shirt gambling sponsors.",
      "It is understood the club intends to return to a two-year cycle, to keep their kits affordable and sustainable, subject to partnership agreements. Stadia Agency, a sports digital PR company, has spent months researching the black market in football shirts for Casino Kings, betting partners of Wigan Athletic and Hartlepool Utd. They found the average discount is 82.7 per cent on this season's adult shirt, or £62 off, and 76.1 per cent or £43 on the kids' version.",
      "Several clubs, including Man City Newcastle, now sell the version of the shirt worn by players on the pitch; it costs £120 for the Toon top. It costs another £38 for the shorts, and £20 for the socks in the official Newcastle Utd club shop. The Magpies' green away shirt with the Premier League badge added is £95; it is £111 with a player's name on the back; the women's team replica shirt is £85. One seller told would-be buyers on DHGate: \"Only £14. Don't pay Spurs £85!\"",
      "Fake Manchester United shirts were being offered online for 15 US dollars, the equivalent of £11.63. One fan posted a Red Devils shirt with the name on the back, selling for £140. He told his followers: \"And you wonder why people go to other sites.\"",
      "Newcastle is donating £5 from every adult shirt sold via official channels before the end of August to the Newcastle United Foundation, to boost grassroots and social impact initiatives across the North East.

      "Manchester United are currently in the middle of their pre-season tour of America - but that doesn’t mean there’s nothing going on at Old Trafford. The Red Devils are hard at work trying to add more new faces to Ruben Amorim’s squad ahead of the new season.",
      "United have already rubber-stamped three summer arrivals: Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have both completed moves from both Wolves and Brentford respectively, while young defender Diego Leon has also completed a move to Manchester.",
      "But United are not finished there with more incomings and player sales expected before the transfer deadline.",
      "A striker is also on their shopping list, with RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko emerging as the club's priority transfer target. Talks regarding his arrival are ongoing.",
      "Elsewhere, outgoings are also on the agenda. Marcus Rashford has already completed a move away from the club after joining Barcelona. Take a look at all of the latest transfer rumours:",
      "Man United defender Patrick Dorgu claims he still has plenty of faith in Rasmus Hojlund despite the club chasing Benjamin Sesko. “He's doing really well,” said Dorgu. “He looks sharp, he looks fit and I'm very happy for Rasmus to get his goal.",
      "“It was a difficult season for Rasmus. Not only for him, but for everyone, so I think this season is really important for him and for the team to get back to where we have to be in the league.",
      "“We need a striker to deliver on the pitch, so that's why he was happy. We talk in training, we try to understand each other on the pitch, for me to know where he is in the box and what movements he likes. He needs confidence, everyone needs confidence and a goal always helps with that.”",
      "Juventus chief Damien Comolli has suggested that his side are still interested in Jadon Sancho - but will only make a move should one of their current widemen leave. He said: “I think the club is very attractive; many agents and players are calling me. After all, we are Juventus, and we want to get back to winning ways.",
      "“Securing Conceição’s permanence was a clear and strong decision because he can play on both fronts. We have two of the best wingers in the world, and Nico is a great player. If someone were to leave, we will consider him [Sancho].\"",
      "Sancho was in line for a move to Chelsea this summer after spending last season on loan but the Blues decided to pay a £5m penalty fee to back out of the agreement.",
      "The Italian has entered the final year of his contract at the Parc des Princes, with the French side having signed Lucas Chevalier from Lille as a potential replacement. But Donnarumma could yet stay.",
      "A further year with PSG has not been ruled out and the Italian is in no rush to make a decision on his future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "A notice at the store reveals that due to 'licensing restrictions,' the club cannot print the names of iconic number 7s Eric Cantona, David Beckham or Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "This situation is not recent and has been the case for several years, according to the source.",
      "It's reportedly the same scenario at Real Madrid, who are also prohibited from printing the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, another icon at the Bernabéu, they added.",
      "Several supporters expressed surprise at the rule.",
      "\"That's really odd,\" one United fan commented on X. \"Modern football just gets weirder,\" another remarked.",
      "A third queried: \"What if I call my son Beckham and he wants his own name on his shirt?\".",
      "While a fourth questioned: \"How can you copyright a name lol I'm pretty sure there's more people with those names.\"",
      "United kick off their league campaign on August 17 when they take on Arsenal at Old Trafford. Before that, they round off their tour of America against Everton, before facing Fiorentina next weekend.",

      "After United ended last season in 15th place, their lowest-ever Premier League finish, Amorim sent his players away for the summer with strict fitness programmes to follow. All of United’s players were given detailed fitness programmes to follow during their holidays and it became clear to sports science staff when they reported back for pre-season that the squad had followed the instructions.",
      "On the first few days back for pre-season training, United’s players undertook a series of running drills, with the times they posted confirming their adherence to what was asked of them during the summer break. United’s players have looked sharp in pre-season and the feeling is the fitness work undertaken during the close season helped them to hit the ground running in the build-up to the new campaign",
      "In Chicago, United’s base for their three game US tour, the players have been doing a lot of gym work and disguised fitness drills, in which they will shoot at goal then sprint for 60 yards to build up their stamina, then shoot in another goal and repeat the drill. The purpose of the drill is to build up the fitness levels of the players through the sprints, while disguising the motive within shooting practice, so there is some ball work involved to break the tedium of just running.",
      "On tour, United’s players have breakfast from 7.30am and must be on the team coach by 9.15am to go to training. After half a hour in the gym, training sessions begin at 10.30am.",
      "Unlike on previous tours, there have been no double sessions, with the intensity of the single sessions considered sufficient for the players, who are rewarded with the afternoons off from around 1pm.",
      "While Amorim has enforced discipline and standards in terms of timekeeping and curfews on tour, his approach has not been as draconian as his predecessor Erik ten Hag, who also took a hardline stance on punctuality and dress code in terms of wearing the right kit on certain days.",
      "Amorim, while expecting high standards of conduct, is said to have fostered more of a bond with his players, who have responded positively to his demands, unlike Ten Hag, whose aloof and detached approach ultimately served to alienate them.",

    "source": "mirror",
    "body": [
      "Sir Alex Ferguson's private chat about losing Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid speaks volumes about the fate Newcastle United face should Alexander Isak depart. Following his £60million move to the Magpies from Real Sociedad in 2023, the Swedish striker has wasted no time whatsoever in becoming a legend on Tyneside.",
      "The 25-year-old has managed 62 goals and 11 assists in 109 outings and was instrumental to the club's fifth-place finish last season as well as their Carabao Cup trophy, scoring the decisive goal in Newcastle's 2-1 win over Premier League champions Liverpool in the final.",
      "But he's put his Newcastle legacy in serious jeopardy by confirming that he wishes to explore his options away from St. James' Park this summer. And should Isak be allowed to leave his current club ahead of the new season, former Magpies boss Pardew has noted how Eddie Howe will be up against it in trying to find a replacement.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, Pardew said: \"These are the tests you get as a Premier League manager, whether you're at the top of the league, in the middle or at the bottom. You're going to get tests and Eddie's getting tested here by one of his main players.\"",
      "Pardew also recalled how Ferguson was once in a similar predicament when Ronaldo parted ways with the Red Devils in the summer of 2009, leaving the legendary Manchester United manager aware that he would be unable to find a like-for-like replacement for one of football's greatest-ever players, who was at the time just hitting his prime.",
      "He added: \"I remember Alex Ferguson talking about Ronaldo. It was a game just before he was about to leave. I said, ‘How are you going to replace him?’ He said, ‘Well, I'm not going to be able to replace him. There's no one who can do the numbers, right?’",
      "\"And Isak would be exactly the same. He's not going to get anyone who can do those numbers that Isak can do. So, you're going to have to spread it around and buy two players. That's what Fergie did.",
      "\"I think he said, ‘I'm going to buy two or three to try and replicate what he does within the team unit.' And that's what Eddie is going to have to do.\"",
      "Ferguson's assumptions of being unable to find an outright replacement for Ronaldo were quickly proven right. While the now 83-year-old will have had high hopes for Michael Owen, Gabriel Obertan and Mame Diouf, they fell well short of the pace, precision and sheer skill that Ronaldo brought to the starting XI.",
      "For context, Diouf lasted just three years with the Red Devils, making just nine appearances for the first team before he was sold on to Hanover 96, while Obertan played 27 times before he was sold on to Newcastle in 2011. Owen, meanwhile, scored 17 goals in 52 appearances before joining Stoke City in 2012.",
      "Newcastle have endured a lacklustre summer transfer window thus far, with Anthony Elanga's £55m transfer from Nottingham Forest coming as the side's marquee signing. It's not for a lack of trying, however, with the Magpies linked with the likes of James Trafford, Bryan Mbeumo and Hugo Ekitike, only for them to join Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool respectively.",
      "Braced for the potential departure of Isak in the coming weeks, the Magpies are currently monitoring the situation of RB Leipzig striker, Benjamin Sesko, who has impressed in the Bundesliga at the age of just 22. However, they face stiff competition from the Red Devils in their pursuit, given Ruben Amorim is still on the hunt for a proven No. 9 to lead his attacking line, and are hindered by reports that Sesko favours a move to the north west instead of the north east.",
      "The good news for Newcastle fans is that there aren't actually many teams who can afford a mega-money swoop for Isak this summer, given that the Magpies firmly value the star at a staggering £150m. On Friday it was reported that Newcastle had also swiftly rebuffed Liverpool's first official offer totalling £120m for the talisman, after months of speculation on whether they would make an audacious approach considering they've already spent a guaranteed £100m on Florian Wirtz.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "And the former Manchester United goalkeeper is confident he has all the knowledge to succeed because of his apprenticeship under the man he says is Britain’s best young boss.",
      "Grant, whose Terriers host Leyton Orient in their League One opener this afternoon, spent three years as an assistant to Kieran McKenna at Ipswich Town.",
      "Having helped navigate the Tractor Boys from the third tier to the promised land, Grant believes that education can only stand him in good stead – even if he is determined to be his own man.",
      "“The way he has been able to build, shape and mould Ipswich and for me having a bird’s eye view in terms of how he went about doing that was hugely influential on me,” Grant says. “I’d like to think some of his work ethic, his process and attention to detail has really rubbed off.",
      "“The real eye-opener for me heading from my playing career, where I was already dipping my toe in at Manchester United with the youth team and in the office with the manager, was once you actually step into the world of Kieran McKenna you quickly realise the dedication, the sacrifices needed to work at that level.",
      "“Perhaps my coaches can tell you better but in terms of the work ethic, demands and sacrifices needed at Huddersfield Town right now is quite significant.”",
      "Grant says he will feel a sense of pride when arriving at the Accu Stadium but come 3pm that will have washed away.",
      "“I’ve really enjoyed it so far, it’s really busy and my phone doesn’t stop,\" he says. \"It tends to be people just pestering me for players, agents and other clubs, and it’s not been easy finding time for anything else. But if I’m honest that’s what I love, throwing myself into every single part of the job.",
      "Grant also saw the methods of Jose Mourinho up close while at Old Trafford. The now Fenerbahce boss recently hit out at coaches who refuse to deviate from their game plan when situations demand flexibility.",
      "And that view chimes with Grant as he tries to develop a team capable of winning games in different ways.",
      "“I believe you need to look at every game and the challenges the opposition are going to put on you, and not be too biased by whether you’ve just won or lost at the weekend,” he says. “Having a squad that’s deep enough to offer different solutions and characteristics is really important.",
      "“It would be the perfect scenario for me if we can win a game and then I make four or five changes and win the next one as well.”",
      "He has no shortage of depth having been backed heavily in the transfer market. Eleven new faces, including goalscorer Alfie May and new captain Ryan Ledson, have come in so far with a loan move for Chelsea youngster Leo Castledine also being lined up.",
      "That sees them installed as second favourites to win the title, behind only Luton, and Grant is happy to embrace high expectations.",
      "“This club has what is required to do it,” he says. “We’ve got to work hard for it, we’re not owed anything, but we’re comfortable with the fact that we’re a good team and we want to be a good team.",
      "“If people want to give us that moniker then wonderful but we certainly have to earn it.” Words that sound awfully like McKenna.",

      "\"To hope is a strong word,\" Amorim replied when asked if he hoped to have a new striker and a new 'keeper. \"We are always looking to improve the team. And we have some characteristics that we would like to have. But again, it depends on the market. It depends on the sales. We'll see.",
      "\"But I'm really happy. And I think even when you talk about Andre, you can see the goalkeepers. Even Tom (Heaton) is leaner, he's a different goalkeeper. Altay (Bayindir) did really well and Onana is going to be better like the other guys that are getting better this year.\"",

      "After finishing the 2023/24 Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference, Manchester United should have prioritised attacking signings in last summer's transfer window.",
      "Instead, four of their five new recruits were defensive-minded players, recruiting Noussair Mazraoui, Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Their only attack-minded addition was Netherlands international Joshua Zirkzee, who arrived from Italian outfit Bologna for £35.7million.",
      "United supporters who conducted research into Zirkzee and his style of play prior to him finalising his move to Old Trafford quickly discovered he was a different type of forward to Rasmus Hojlund, learning he is a player that likes to drop into pockets of space, collect possession and link the play.",
      "Zirkzee, ahead of the start of the season, admitted himself he is not a natural No.9, and that quickly became evident as he settled into life in M16.",
      "\"I occasionally drop down to midfield,\" Zirkzee said. \"I don't do that for myself but to help the team.",
      "\"I am what I call a false striker. Not a No 9, not a No 10. I am a 9.5. That's my game.",
      "\"Maybe I'm a little different than others. But being different is good, right?\"",
      "United recruited Zirkzee with the idea of him providing competition and support for Hojlund, who had joined the club from Atalanta 11 months earlier. The Dane had enjoyed a respectable first season in England, scoring 16 goals across all competitions.",
      "Optimistic he would build on that tally, it was expected he would remain United's chief goal-getter with support being provided from Zirkzee. However, they scored just 17 goals between them last season, with Hojlund scoring ten and Zirkzee seven.",
      "Hojlund regressed last term and the prospect of him leaving Old Trafford before the end of this summer's transfer window has not been ruled out, despite him making it crystal clear he wants to stay and fight for his place.",
      "\"My plan is very clear,\" Hojlund said after scoring in United's 4-1 win over Bournemouth in Chicago in midweek. \"That is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp so I welcome everything that comes.\"",
      "Hojlund could soon have competition for a starting berth from RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. United have made him their top striker target with four weeks of the window remaining and are fighting it out with Newcastle United to secure his signature.",
      "Sesko, 22, is a natural No.9, meaning he will be able to provide the direct competition Hojlund was in need of last summer. Zirkzee's performances improved after he transitioned to one of the two No.10 berths in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Zirkzee admitted he was not a natural No.9, meaning it was unfair to gauge his performances when deployed at the tip of the attack. He was much more influential as a No.10.",
      "Sesko has scored almost 100 goals in his senior career at club level, meaning he possesses the qualities United need in a striker. He could be exactly what United and Hojlund have been waiting for.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",
      "As well as in-depth analysis and opinion on your club, we turn the spotlight on every team battling for top-flight glory - or simply survival in the toughest league in the world!",
      "Also full fixtures guide so you don't miss a game in what is set to be a thrilling season.",

      "Whisper it quietly but Manchester United have looked quite good in their opening two games of their pre-season tour of the United States.",
      "After a forgettable 0-0 draw against Leeds United in Stockholm a fortnight ago, the Reds have made significant strides since arriving in the US.",
      "As a result, United will be hoping to clinch the Premier League Summer Series trophy with a maximum points haul when they face Everton at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Sunday night.",
      "United made it two wins out of two with a comfortable 4-1 win over Bournemouth in midweek, getting the job done via goals from Rasmus Hojlund, Patrick Dorgu, Amad and substitute Ethan Williams.",
      "United played with a sense of purpose, producing a really encouraging performance. Although pre-season caveats have to be accounted for, their performance was energetic, vibrant and really encouraging.",
      "The tempo they set allowed them to move the ball with speed and a sense of conviction. One of the biggest criticisms they have faced in recent years has been for how uninspiring they have been to watch.",
      "Clearly adapting and becoming more and more familiar with Ruben Amorim's system, United's improved collective performances have raised the levels of several individuals. Patrick Dorgu, who arrived from Lecce in February, was particularly impressive against the Cherries, contributing a goal and an assist.",
      "With just two pre-season friendlies remaining, Amorim's team selections for the clashes with Everton and Fiorentina could provide a firm indication of the starting XI he has in mind for the season opener against Arsenal.",
      "United have signed Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo so far this summer and are still hoping to bring in a goalkeeper, a midfielder and a striker, meaning Amorim's dream starting XI is still a few signings short of coming to fruition.",
      "Nevertheless, looking at the landscape of the squad as it is now, a crop of positions should be occupied by players the Portuguese chief already has available to him. Some positions have greater strength in depth than others, but that does not necessarily mean there isn't an obvious candidate to occupy top spot in the pecking order.",
      "Leny Yoro has been excellent in United's opening two games in the US, playing an excellent range of passes and demonstrating his hunger and ability to get on the ball and drive United up the pitch.",
      "The youngster is a shoo-in for the right-sided centre-back berth and will be one of the very first names on the teamsheet this season.",
      "In the wing-back department, Amad and Dorgu were both on target against Bournemouth. The latter has been superb in the opening two games of the tour and was involved in both of United's first half goals against the Cherries.",
      "Amorim wants his wing-backs to operate as wingers and occupy attacking positions. Dorgu did exactly that against Bournemouth and West Ham, pushing high up the pitch.",
      "Amad started as the right-sided No.10 against Bournemouth, but his starting position could change depending on what Amorim considers as Mbeumo's best position. The Cameroonian could feature for the first time this weekend.",
      "Bruno Fernandes was not on the scoresheet against Bournemouth, but his performance was just as influential. He regularly got on the ball in the centre of midfield and combined with Mason Mount and Amad in the No.10 berths.",
      "The Portuguese international is United's best player by some distance and will be a shoo-in for however long he remains at Old Trafford, meaning he could afford to have a dire pre-season and still make the team for the first competitive game of the season. His influence and importance is unrivalled.",
      "Fernandes linked up brilliantly with Cunha against West Ham and they will be hoping to develop a fruitful bond this season. The Brazilian has arrived from Wolves for £62.5million and has quickly demonstrated the sort of qualities he will bring to Old Trafford.",
      "His running power, technical ability and creativity levels inside the final third make him a guaranteed starter. He is also a natural fit for the left-sided No.10 spot.",
      "Mbeumo is yet to appear in pre-season so far, but the chances are he will join the list of undroppables once he's up to speed. The rest of the spots in the XI, however, are firmly up for grabs.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Saturday, August 2.",
      "News filters through overnight that Newcastle United have won the race to sign RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko. It comes after United made the Slovenian their main focus and advanced in talks after discovering a pursuit of Ollie Watkins was unlikely to be fruitful.",
      "Those of you who decided to stay up overnight may well be feeling tired, but shall be delighted with what you witnessed in Chicago. United continued their unbeaten start to pre-season with an exceptional 4-1 victory against AFC Bournemouth.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring before Patrick Dorgu, Amad and youngster Ethan Williams added gloss to the scoreline. The only blotch on the performance was an own goal from Matthijs de Ligt, but it would do little to dampen the enthusiasm for that display.",
      "Take a look at all the United news, views and rumours in our dedicated blog below",
      "Manchester United have been handed a verdict about the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",

      "Fabrizio Romano says United are waiting for a 'good opportunity' but time is ticking in the window.",
      "According to Sport in Spain, Manchester United have made approaches for Barcelona star Fermin Lopez.",
      "It is thought United are willing to offer up to €70m (£61.1m) for him, and the player has been made aware of the interest.",
      "Lopez is seen as a player who would fit into United’s system under Ruben Amorim, and the report claims they spoke to Barcelona about him in the negotiations over Marcus Rashford.",
      "Man United, Tottenham and Newcastle are all keeping tabs on Randal Kolo Muani's situation at PSG.",
      "Le Parisien have claimed that the striker's move to Juventus has stalled and the chance of a switch to the Premier League. United have been linked with him for some time.",

      "After previously rejecting a new contract at Valencia, Man United target Javi Guerra is now close to agreeing new terms.",

      "\"Now that PSG have bought a new goalkeeper, he's telling Paris that he would prefer to stay at the club, and he will consider staying and leaving the club under freedom of contract in a year's time. That's the guidance I have.",
      "\"PSG are understandably unhappy about that. Information I have is that they have told Donnarumma they will not let him run down his deal and leave on a free transfer in the same style he did with Milan.",
      "\"They see what Donnarumma is doing as trying to reduce his transfer fee and trying to organise conditions under which he can leave, where most of the money spent on his transfer, i.e. the total package of the new club, goes towards his salary and signing-on fee rather than the transfer fee.",

      "Those problems have been identified and seem to have been partly addressed with the signings of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Wolves' Matheus Cunha. And yet a truly top squad needs a reliable goal-scoring No.9, and that's why they are chasing a deal for RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The 22-year-old has the attributes that Rasmus Hojlund has lacked to succeed in the Premier League. Sesko's pace, strength in the air and composure could make him one of Europe's finest strikers.",
      "Attention should then turn towards a new midfielder with physical presence after Ruben Amorim's side were badly overrun in that department, for much of last season. Joao Palhinha would have fitted in well at Old Trafford, but the former Fulham player now looks set to join Tottenham Hotspur instead.",

Both clubs are currently battling to sign Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig as they prioritise a new striker ahead if the upcoming Premier League campaign.",
      "Despite those fresh links, Wehrle has reiterated Stuttgart's stance on a departure for Woltemade this summer. He told Münchner Merkur/Tz: \"I stand by what I said five weeks ago: We want to go into the next season with Nick - and if something extraordinary happens, we are ready to sit down at the table.

      "Despite Rasmus Hojlund making his transfer stance clear earlier this week, outlining his intentions to \"stay and fight\" for his spot in the side, the Dane is still heavily rumoured to be heading for an exit from Old Trafford.",

      "Now, the Reds are heavily linked with 22-year-old superstar Benjamin Sesko, along with Newcastle. United remain in talks with RB Leipzig over a move, but a recent report from Slovenian newspaper Delo claims Sesko has decided to join the Magpies, with Eddie Howe's proposal seemingly topping that of United’s.",
      "With less than a month to go until transfer deadline day - September 1 - United may need to reconsider their striker philosophy. Instead of looking outward, Amorim could look within his squad, where a series of youngsters are awaiting their chance to prove themselves.",
      "One of those is Chido Obi-Martin, a 17-year-old who has been compared to Alexander Isak, one of the hottest strikers in world football at the moment.",
      "The Danish striker joined United from Arsenal’s academy following a series of incredible performances. Obi-Martin scored 10 goals in one match against Liverpool U16 and bagged a further seven against Norwich City at U18 level. He also smashed Arsenal’s U18 goals record.",
      "United’s head of academy, Nick Cox, and their academy recruitment chief, Luke Fedorenko, spearheaded the move.",
      "He played 160 minutes under Amorim last season and scored two goals in United’s 3–1 victory over Hong Kong in their opening pre-season friendly.",
      "“Arsenal were really keen to keep him,” Kaynak said. “They pulled out all the stops and were confident of doing so after keeping other young talents like Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly in recent years.",
      "“However, they do feel they offered all they were willing to offer. With that in mind, there’s a feeling of acceptance at the decision Chido has decided to take.”",
      "When talking about what kind of player Obi-Martin is, Kaynak compared him to Premier League powerhouse Isak. He said: “It’s a bit hard to say as he’s still so young, but one thing he seems to be very good at is scoring goals.",
      "“He’s quite a bit taller than most others around his age group right now and looks stylistically a bit similar to Alexander Isak with his languid running and technical ability.",
      "“There’s clearly a high-potential player in there. He’s someone who can score lots of goals and that’s not easy to find. The big test for him will be seeing how he steps up through the age groups. If he manages that though, United have a real player on their hands.”",
      "If Amorim is to give Chido a chance this season, don’t expect him to suddenly reach Isak’s level, he’s still only 17. But there certainly looks to be a top-quality player within the United striker.",
      "United’s attempt to sign two class strikers in Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, setting them back £108.5m, hasn’t worked as of yet. Both players scored seven goals combined in the Premier League last season.",
      "With Sesko reportedly turning down a move to Old Trafford, Amorim may just need to give Obi-Martin a chance.",

      "Manchester United transfer target Benjamin Sesko's agent, Elvis Basanovic, has already outlined the key criteria he and his client will look for when making a decision on his future.",
      "United are currently locked in a transfer tug-of-war with Premier League counterparts Newcastle United in an effort to try and sign the RB Leipzig striker.",
      "Sesko has not addressed the possibility of a move to the Premier League in the past, meaning he has not dropped any hints or suggestions.",
      "With that in mind, it could all boil down to who can offer the striker, 22, the best overall package, and that doesn't just mean financially.",
      "Basanovic, who met former United football director John Murtough back in 2022 to hold talks about the prospect of Sesko moving to Old Trafford, outlined earlier this summer what Sesko will look for when choosing his next club, including \"a special project with a special coach\".",
      "\"It's not correct to speak about the names of clubs that are interested in Sesko but maybe it is right to clarify a few things,\" Basanovic said. \"Let me tell you: Sesko is not competing with anyone. It's him vs him every day.",
      "\"We have a clear plan for the future and media speculation doesn't affect us. His numbers at his age are comparable to some strikers with already great careers.",
      "\"That confirms my words. He will move from RB Leipzig only when we recognise a special club. A special project with a special coach.\"",
      "United are currently working on 'Project 150', an ambition launched last year with the aim of winning the Premier League title again by 2028 for their 150th anniversary.",
      "On the project, United chief executive Omar Berrada, speaking in June, said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "\"We've just finished 15th and it seems an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?\"",

      "Hours later, Sesko was not named in the squad for his current club's latest pre-season friendly match and now his manager Schafer has told media in Germany the absence was transfer related.",

      "It's clear that Manchester United want a new striker this summer, but exactly which player they sign remains to be seen. All the signs, though, indicate RB Leipzig star, Benjamin Sesko, is the player identified by United to strengthen the forward line before the September 1 deadline.",
      "United are advancing on a deal for Sesko, who would provide competition for Joshua Zirkzee and Rasmus Hojlund if no outgoings are completed. Newcastle are also in the running to sign Sesko, with a battle now set to take place for the Slovenia international's signature.",
      "If United were to sign Sesko, then it would be with the expectation that the striker would start in a central role in Ruben Amorim's system. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are also expected to be nailed-on starters for United going forward - and so could form a new attacking trio for the season ahead.",
      "If Sesko was to sign, it could be that one of United's other existing names also plays an important role in the striker being a success at Old Trafford. And that's as an alternative option for those two No.10s.",
      "Mason Mount may well be the perfect player to perform in the system and help Sesko. The playmaker arrived in a £60million deal from Chelsea in 2023, but has struggled to maintain with injuries ever since moving to Old Trafford.",
      "What could help Mount going forward is playing in his favoured No.10 position, when game-time allows, which would in turn also help Sesko. The Slovenia international, 22, would need regular service from across the side, including whoever plays in their attacking midfield roles - and would also need other players help make room for him to run in behind opposition defences.",
      "Could Mount be that player? The England international has shown a few glimpses of why United paid Chelsea £60millon to bring him to the club, notably in last season's win over Lyon in the Europa League.",
      "United will now be hoping that form can continue for an extended period of time in the Premier League. If that happens, and Sesko does sign for United, it could be the start of an important partnership going forward - if the former Chelsea man can get past Mbeumo and Cunha in the pecking order next season.",

      "\"The reason is not just his goals. He scored a lot last season, but generally he's chipped in with, you know, kind of 8, 9, 10 around that mark, season after season in the Premier League, which is not easy by that. It sounds easy. It's not.",
      "\"And chipping in from a wider position where he can cut in, he can drive, he can work on transition, he reads it well defensively on transition as well.",
      "Dyche also waxed lyrical over the signing of Matheus Cunha, with the Wolves man an aggressive character both on and off the pitch.",
      "\"Cunha, I like the fact... But, you know, people talk about his attitude and good, bad and indifferent,\" he added. \"But you need a bit of that edge. You know, if you're a centre-forward, particularly, you need that edge.",

      "With just over four weeks of the summer transfer window remaining, Manchester United are hoping Benjamin Sesko might be the answer to their striker search.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap to Chelsea in June, United have been linked with a plethora of strikers in recent weeks amid their desperate need for a new No.9.",
      "For the second season running, United finished last term's Premier League campaign with a negative goal difference, meaning they have been left with no choice but to prioritise attacking signings this summer.",
      "United have already drafted in Matheus Cunha from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford, who are options to fill the two No.10 positions, but they are still on the hunt for an out-and-out centre-forward to come in and spearhead their attack.",
      "Also on the radar of Newcastle United, Sesko boasts a respectable record for Leipzig, scoring 39 goals in 87 matches for the German club. He joined them from sister club Red Bull Salzburg in the summer of 2023.",
      "United recruitment director Christopher Vivell was at Leipzig when they signed Sesko and was responsible for their recruitment at the time, meaning he knows everything there is to know about the Slovenia international.",
      "\"Benjamin Sesko is among the game's top young talents and has enormous potential to become a top player,\" Vivell previously told the Bundesliga website. \"He has all the qualities to do that.",
      "\"He's extremely quick, has a great jump on him and is strong in the air. Benjamin is a real goalscorer, who despite his 1.95m (6'4\") is mobile and technically strong.",
      "\"His abilities make him a special player with a special profile.\"",
      "Vivell's view of Sesko is almost identical to former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's. The German, who left Anfield just over a year ago, was installed as Red Bull's head of global soccer in January, meaning he is working across the Red Bull-owned clubs.",
      "Klopp said of Sesko earlier this year: \"I've actually known him for a while, I knew him already when he was at Salzburg. I think we played a friendly game here when he was very, very young.",
      "\"I was really impressed, I thought, 'Where do they get all these players? Ridiculous.' I have no plans with him, just to make that clear. Don't get it wrong, I will not show up in training and tell them what to do.",
      "\"Our plan, and I don't have to ask Marco Rose [former RB Leipzig boss] what his plan is with him, I know it… he wants to help him score as many goals as possible.",

      "Manchester United and Newcastle have both led the race for Sesko's signature, after Arsenal opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres instead. Ruben Amorim's side are firmly focused on bringing in a new No.9, with Rasmus Hojlund mooted to depart despite publicly stating his desire to stay and fight for his place.",

      "\"However, it is questionable whether RB Leipzig would be willing to let the 25 y/o striker leave as well, if they sell both Xavi Simons and Benjamin Sesko.\"",
      "Despite scope for a sizable financial boost - with Sesko and Simons tipped to bring in over £100million combined - Leipzig are wary of a summer exodus that could leave them without key attacking options.",

      "Described as a striker with \"enormous potential\" by United recruitment director Christopher Vivell, who previously worked at Leipzig, Sesko has been attracting attention for several years. United first expressed interest in him in the summer of 2022.",
      "Despite only turning 22 at the end of May, Sesko has already established himself as Slovenia's chief striker. He has 16 goals in 41 caps for his country and started each of their four matches at the 2024 European Championship.",

Both the United academy graduates are in new pastures after leaving Old Trafford - with the former leaving for Barcelona on loan this summer.",
      "Lingard, 32, now plies his trade in South Korea with FC Seoul and, on Thursday, the La Liga champions ran-out 7-3 winners against them. Rashford was introduced at half-time, while his former United teammate played 81 minutes before he was replaced as Lamine Yamal made headlines with a brace.",
      "The two ex-United stars were seen sharing time together after the full-time whistle and laughing together as they caught up. Lingard then posted a carousel of pictures on to his Instagram, including some with Rashford, Hansi Flick and Yamal with a fingers crossed emoji and a red heart emoji as the caption.",

      "The Daily Mail report that Newcastle are turning to Watkins and Brentford star Yoane Wissa amid United's pursuit of Sesko. The Magpies have been interested in the Slovenian, but United's interest in the player looks to have seen Newcastle turn to other targets.",
      "It comes amid Alexander Isak's unsettled situation at St James' Park. Liverpool submitted an opening bid in excess of £100million for the Swede, which has been rejected.",
      "\"It would represent another blow for the North East club who have already missed out on several big targets this summer. United, meanwhile, will be looking at an impressive window if they can snap-up Sesko, a new midfielder and a goalkeeper before it shuts on September 1. All of that will depend on sales, though.\"",

      "Manchester United could be set for a dream final month of the summer transfer window.",
      "United badly needed to fix their goal-scoring issues after netting an abysmal 44 goals in the Premier League last term. Chances were regularly squandered by United's attacking players, who all lacked the composure needed to convert goal-scoring opportunities.",
      "Those problems have been identified and seem to have been partly addressed with the signings of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Wolves' Matheus Cunha. And yet a truly top squad needs a reliable goal-scoring No.9, and that's why they are chasing a deal for RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The 22-year-old has the attributes that Rasmus Hojlund has lacked to succeed in the Premier League. Sesko's pace, strength in the air and composure could make him one of Europe's finest strikers.",
      "Attention should then turn towards a new midfielder with physical presence after Ruben Amorim's side were badly overrun in that department, for much of last season. Joao Palhinha would have fitted in well at Old Trafford, but the former Fulham player now looks set to join Tottenham Hotspur instead.",
      "Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton is one of the brightest English midfielders around at the moment and he may be a better option. Wharton is a Premier League regular for the Eagles and played a huge role in their shock FA Cup win.",
      "The 21-year-old is also a full England international who has been to a major tournament with the Three Lions. Ineos appears to be targeting young stars at Old Trafford, and so he fits the bill perfectly.",
      "A new goalkeeper would then be looked at in an ideal world. Paris Saint-Germain shot-stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma has been linked in recent days and would represent a significant upgrade on Andre Onana.",
      "The Italian No.1 is in the prime of his career and, although his ball-playing ability may not be as accomplished as Onana's, his shot-stopping skills are markedly better.",
      "Sales will be needed to pull off much of United's remaining potential deals before the summer window closes on September 1. The club's so called \"bomb squad\" has narrowed to four players after Marcus Rashford's departure to Barcelona on loan.",
      "But Alejandro Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia remain stuck at Carrington with all their futures still unresolved. United will be hoping to sell all four - or hope to at least get a transfer fee for Garnacho - even if it means loaning out the other three players.",
      "The Argentine's homegrown status as an academy graduate would mean that any sale represents \"pure profit\" and provides a significant PSR (Profit and Sustainability Rules) boost for United. It will be much-needed as the club look towards a brighter and much-improved 2025/2026 campaign under Amorim.",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Juventus – £102.54m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",
      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £122.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Atletico Madrid – £133.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "6) Manchester United – £134.8m\nThe Red Devils were near the top of this list having signed Matheus Cunha for £62.5m and Diego Leon for £3.3m early doors but fell off it having taken a laughable amount of time to secure the £65m signing of Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "",
      "5) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "3) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £210.6m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "The Uruguayan has endured a frustrating time at Anfield, scoring 25 goals in 95 Premier League appearances.",
      "Nunez cost the Reds an initial £64m when he joined from Benfica in June 2022, with potential add-ons and bonuses taking the fee to £84m. That would have been a club-record fee for Liverpool if they hadn’t just spent £100m on Florian Wirtz.",

      "20) Lois Openda – RB Leipzig to Aston Villa\nVilla are shopping around for strikers, which does hint at an exit for Ollie Watkins. Journalist Sacha Tavolieri says they are an ‘option’ for Leipzig No.9 Openda, who has scored 33 goals in 67 Bundesliga appearances.",
      "",
      "19) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Liverpool\nFootball Insider’s Mick Brown is hearing things again, folks. Guehi to Liverpool could accelerate following Luis Diaz’s transfer to Bayern, apparently.

      "",
      "17) Samu Aghehowa – Porto to Aston Villa\nThe Spain international has also been linked with Newcastle but it’s Villa being mentioned as a potential destination for Aghehowa. One problem: Porto are using the Viktor Gyokeres fee as a benchmark and they want £55million. Which is more a less one whole Ollie Watkins.",
      "",
      "16) Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nDonnarumma has been in a contract dispute with PSG but we’re starting to think there might be more to this than his representatives using United’s name and the oldest trick in agent’s book. PSG are signing Lucas Chevalier from Lille and appear more likely to sell Donnarumma now than allow him to leave for nothing next year. United certainly need a goalkeeper, but they also need a striker and neither can be paid for with brass buttons. Still, one to watch…",
      "",
      "15) Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Aston Villa \nUnited are said to have spoken to Chelsea and Villa in an effort to lump Garnacho in as part of a deal to sign a striker. Chelsea’s valuations of Garnacho and Nicolas Jackson are miles apart, but there could be some common ground with Villa. For the purposes of PSR, they would need to be separate transactions, but Villa are in a stronger position than United given they know Garnacho has got to go somewhere before the deadline, whereas they would be quite content to keep Watkins. Regardless, there is a deal to be done here.",

      "14) Dominic Calvert-Lewin – Everton to Aston Villa\nCalvert-Lewin left Everton at the end of last season and Villa reportedly see the ex-England striker as a cheap way to bolster their attacking options. Newcastle and AC Milan are thinking along similar lines but Villa currently appear to be favourites.",
      "",
      "13) 🔽 Ollie Watkins – Aston Villa to Manchester United\nThis one picked up again after reports that United are to choose between Watkins and Benjamin Sesko. Of course, we’d expect Villa might want a say in that. And, if asked, they’d say they want £60million. United, apparently, reckon they can get Villa down to around £45million. But they thought they could haggle with Brentford and ended up paying more for Bryan Mbeumo. Watkins might find himself as United’s preferred option just because they could offer Garnacho to Villa.",
      "",
      "12) James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest \nForest are said to have had a bid rejected for the England Under-21 star, whose minutes at City are threatened by Rayan Cherki’s arrival. McAtee has interest from Eintracht Frankfurt and Borussia Dortmund, while Palace are keen too. But Forest aren’t far off with their £25million bid.

As always, it seems United are fighting themselves, with some lobbying for Watkins, while head of recruitment Christopher Vivell is pushing for the player he’s credited with signing for RB Leipzig six years ago. Has anyone asked Ruben Amorim? Either way, players are “scared” to join Newcastle and not a team that just finished 15th in the Premier League. United’s boost is Newcastle’s blow. Until it isn’t.

However, and quite reasonably, we’ll add, Brentford are intent on keeping the forward having already lost their manager, captain and best player this summer. If Newcastle really want Wissa, they’ll have to pay over £40m for a player who was reportedly told last summer that he could leave for £26m at the end of 2024/25, prompting him to go on strike. With Brentford due back in London from their pre-season camp, we can expect some clarity here soon. The Bees have shown they are no pushover but Wissa isn’t f***ing around either.",

      "8) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made on Friday and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east.

The reason, we suspect, is Juve stalling for time. They do need to sell, but they also know there is no other market for Sancho, If they sit tight, United will grow more desperate, as might the player, and better terms will almost certainly become available. Indeed, United’s price has come down again to between £15million and £17million (so, £16million?) and Sancho’s agent was in Turin last week in a vain attempt to speed things along.",
      "",
      "6) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nViktor Gyokeres is signed, sealed and delivered and the feeling during that saga was that Eze would be the Gunners’ next target. The England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal now need to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Cue Andrea Berta haggling for weeks over the number of instalments. And the Gunners need to sell first.",

      "“The reality is we had the first bid from Liverpool yesterday. I believe that was turned down, from this point onwards let’s see what happens.",
      "“I have no idea to try to predict that. In terms of trying to upset players, from my perspective, we can only talk about us, we try to do things the right way, signing players is always complex, we just try to do what we think is right.",
      "“I can’t talk about other clubs, that is not for me to say.”",
      "In the article detailing Liverpool’s failed bid for Isak, The Athletic revealed that Newcastle’s latest new contract offer included a release clause next summer.",
      "David Ornstein revealed: ‘Newcastle have tried to tie Isak to an improved contract, which would have included a release clause next summer, and encouraged him to stay in the north east through senior team-mates.

      "The Premier League kicks off in two weeks. Some clubs are ready; others are miles off it. We’re ranking all 20 by how catastrophically screwed they are – from the ones cruising to the one contemplating its very existence.",
      "",
      "20) Liverpool\nNot f**ked in the slightest. The reigning champions have strengthened beyond belief in the summer transfer window, smashing their transfer record for 22-year-old attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz, replacing Trent Alexander-Arnold with Jeremie Frimpong, improving at left-back by signing Milos Kerkez, adding one of the Bundesliga’s best players in Hugo Ekitike, and likely signing Alexander Isak from Newcastle United.",
      "Even without Isak, Liverpool are ridiculously strong. Adding him would just take the p*ss quite frankly.",
      "Their ambitious summer transfer window has been enabled by the club’s shrewd transfer business in recent seasons. Before the 2025 summer window opened, they were tenth in the five-year Premier League net spend table. They’re currently seventh and buying Isak wouldn’t take them into the top four unless Arsenal sell Bukayo Saka for £200million before then.",
      "Arne Slot won the title after signing one player for 2024/25; Federico Chiesa started four times across all competitions and will leave after just one year at Anfield. You can’t blame the club’s hierarchy for not backing the manager heavily last summer, and having gathered the strongest evidence possible, they know they have an elite title-winning head coach and spending big on players he wants makes absolute sense. The Reds have played it to perfection.",
      "Manchester United should be taking notes after giving Erik ten Hag hundreds of millions in his first transfer window, and going all in on players for Ruben Amorim’s system, knowing that if it goes tits up, they’ll likely appoint a manager who doesn’t want half of the playing squad…again.",
      "TL;DR: Liverpool won the league comfortably and have strengthened like no champion has before. They are title favourites and signed all of their pre-planned transfer targets weeks before the Premier League season kicks off.",
      "MORE: Liverpool keep or sell: Eight Reds sold as Nunez, Elliott help fund record Isak transfer",
      "",
      "19) Chelsea\nThese guys are set…for the next five years. They can and should relax a bit, but we all know they won’t. They must fuel their transfer addiction. Chelsea have always been erratic and ambitious in the transfer window, but things have been cranked up a notch in the Clearlake era.",
      "Joao Pedro and Liam Delap are excellent striker additions, Jamie Gittens is a questionable one for £50m, but we’re not writing him off, Andrey Santos is Like A New Signing, and Estevao is a genuine wonderkid. We like this Chelsea squad and their title credentials.",
      "",
      "18) Arsenal\nNow that a striker is through the door, it has to be said that Arsenal are only an elite left-winger away from having the perfect squad. And that signing is more desirable than required, with Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard and Noni Madueke capable options on that side for now.",
      "Signing Viktor Gyokeres was the big one for the Gunners, with Martin Zubimendi’s addition in midfield also significant. It’s always been about the need for an out-and-out centre-forward, though. The big Swede made his debut against Spurs in Hong Kong on Thursday, but could not prevent a 1-0 defeat that we are not looking into too much, even if Mikel Arteta’s side were toothless in attack and many of the same issues from last season were on display. Not looking into it, though.",
      "All in all, the club’s transfer activity has been uncharacteristically ruthless, but still well planned out and meticulous. They took their time weighing up their options before picking Gyokeres over Benjamin Sesko, for instance.",
      "If this isn’t Arsenal’s year, then it’s never happening under Arteta, whether it’s in the Premier League or Champions League. Although Arsenal are where they are because of the Spaniard, it does feel like do or die for him. After so much money spent and five years of his #process, this club needs something tangible to show for their improvement, and it might take a proven winner in the dugout for that to happen.",
      "",
      "17) Manchester City\nPep Guardiola got the majority of his transfer business done early this summer due to the club’s involvement in the Club World Cup. Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rayan Cherki were all through the door in time to play in the United States, and Norwegian wonderkid Sverre Nypan and goalkeeper James Trafford have since signed.",
      "They are all set for another season under Guardiola and you wouldn’t put it past them steamrolling to the title, even if the two clubs who finished above them last term have improved.",
      "Rodri is back, but Kevin De Bruyne is gone, so it’s not easy to predict how City’s year will pan out.",
      "One potential issue is the lack of a right-back signing. Matheus Nunes can’t be the long-term option in that position. Then again, Guardiola is probably planning to make natural centre-back Abdukodir Khusanov the best right-back in the league, and there’s nothing anyone will be able to do about it.",
      "",
      "16) Brighton and Hove Albion\nFor me, Clive, Brighton had to get a new centre-back in early doors, and they did just that with Diego Coppola, who was among Europe’s top aerial duel winners last season.",
      "For good measure, they added Olivier Boscagli from PSV on a free transfer. He could end up being the bargain of the summer. Let’s not look past Maxim De Kuyper as well. He’s why Pervis Estupinan left without a fuss.",
      "They might have lost Joao Pedro, but £30m wonderkid Charalampos Kostoulas and Stefanos Tzimas have joined. Brighton won’t just be fine, they’ll be looking at the clubs above them who are stumbling through this transfer window, thinking there’s an opportunity.",
      "",
      "15) Manchester United\nSo, United look pretty decent. Their pre-season performances have been promising, and Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are two excellent additions.",
      "This is a huge summer for the club, with Ruben Amorim’s players needing to adapt to his 3-4-2-1 system after over half a season of being unable to do so. This break – and reset – was needed.",
      "The Red Devils could obviously add more players to up the expectations even more, but we think the only position they *need* to improve is centre-forward.",
      "",
      "14) Sunderland\nWe’re big fans of the business conducted by newly-promoted Sunderland. Granit Xhaka, in particular, is a ridiculously good signing. He’s a Champions League midfielder, for crying out loud.",
      "The Black Cats have been ambitious, but so were Burnley, Ipswich and Luton Town over the last two seasons. It’s going to be tough, but this team is becoming well-equipped to survive.",
      "",
      "13) Nottingham Forest\nAfter signing a striker, replacing Anthony Elanga was Forest’s top priority, and they’ve done so excellently with the addition of Switzerland international Dan Ndoye.",
      "For Forest, keeping their best players was the most important thing, though bulking up the squad is necessary after Nuno Espirito Santo’s men ran out of steam in their Champions League pursuit last term. They successfully scared off Spurs and extended Morgan Gibbs-White’s contract, and haven’t been forced to deal with any serious interest in Murillo, Callum Hudson-Odoi or Elliot Anderson.",
      "Last season exceeded every Forest fan’s expectations, but we’re predicting another fun year, especially with a European campaign to look forward to. The City Ground under the lights on Thursday nights will be special.",
      "",
      "12) Tottenham Hotspur\nMohammed Kudus improves an area of the pitch Spurs needed to improve, and some of their depth issues were addressed in January, so the Europa League holders don’t need to do too much.",
      "Another midfielder is needed, and there are reports of Joao Palhinha coming in. He’d add something different to an energetic midfield, but after missing out on Gibbs-White, we wouldn’t be surprised to see Thomas Frank go for Harvey Elliott, or someone similar.",
      "And on Frank, that’s a top appointment. Getting the managerial situation sorted quickly was vitally important and Daniel Levy did exactly that.",
      "",
      "11) Leeds United\nQuestion marks over Daniel Farke’s future were squashed before Leeds’ transfer business started, and their business has been impressive for the most part. Anton Stach is the standout signing, while Lucas Perri and Jaka Bijol are savvy additions for a newly-promoted side.",
      "It will be a long season for the Elland Road faithful, but there are ten clubs, six of which they’d fancy pulling into a relegation battle, who are in a worse position going into it.",
      "",
      "10) Burnley\nBurnley haven’t necessarily found themselves in a position where they are, per se, f**ked, but they’re hardly filling us with confidence. Kyle Walker is past it but remains a solid addition; we rate the Marcus Edwards deal, and think Sam Johnstone would be a good replacement for James Trafford.",
      "Whatever happens between now and the start of the season, just know that Scott Parker isn’t making it to Christmas. We don’t make the rules.",
      "",
      "9) Fulham\nMarco Silva’s only summer signing so far is back-up goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte. Not ideal, that. But maybe the Portuguese head coach is happy with his squad. Keeping Rodrigo Muniz seems to be Fulham’s top priority right now, but there’s a definite need for a new wide forward. Raheem Sterling has been mooted and we think it’s a great fit for the player and club; he wouldn’t even need to move house.",
      "This club needs a deep cup run or European push, and they’re going to need to get moving if either is to become a realistic objective.",
      "",
      "8) West Ham\nGraham Potter surely hoped for more of a rebuild at West Ham this summer. So far he’s lost Kudus, been forced to sign Jean-Clair Todibo permanently, added Kyle Walker-Peters on a free, and signed young wing-back El Hadji Malick Diouf for £19m.",
      "This is a team lacking top quality and athleticism in forward areas. There’s only so much Jarrod Bowen can do.",
      "One big positive is that Lucas Paqueta no longer has a potential ban hanging over his head, having been cleared of spot-fixing charges. Hopefully for the Irons, this will relieve pressure, tension and be a huge weight off the Brazilian’s shoulders, and they’ll enjoy watching him back to his best. There is talk of him leaving for as little as £25m, though, which might be off the table following the result of his case with the FA.",
      "",
      "7) Crystal Palace\nThe Eagles’ pre-season preparation has been heavily impacted by the ongoing uncertainty surrounding their first-ever European campaign. It’s contributed to the club only making two signings – back-up goalkeeper Walter Benitez for nothing and left-back Borna Sosa for £2m.",
      "Oliver Glasner knows there has to be more transfer activity: “Even though all the players are still here, we haven’t made the most of the transfer window so far. I was promised that we would be more active and bring in the new players earlier this year. As of now, I have 17 outfield players. I hope we don’t lose any more. If that happens and we get four new ones on deadline day like last year, another false start is possible.”",
      "Openly discussing a broken promise with the board is an ominous sign. Of course, the board’s focus is elsewhere, but Glasner’s concentration is fully on getting his team prepared for the season, and that preparation isn’t going to plan. Yes, he’s still got Jean-Philippe Mateta, Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi – but for how long? Palace have reportedly turned down £30m from Atlanta United for Mateta, Arsenal are expected to sign Eze, and Guehi is a Liverpool target in the last year of his contract.",
      "Another key figure in their final 12 months is Glasner. The club are in discussions, but it’s hard to envision the Austrian head coach agreeing terms if those promises aren’t fulfilled. Palace going down isn’t realistic, but they are threatening to start 2025/26 very slowly. With a Thursday-Sunday schedule to contend with, they might not get up and running fast enough to make this upcoming campaign half as memorable as the last one.",
      "",
      "6) Bournemouth\nThis is not based entirely on losing 4-1 to Manchester United in pre-season, though we couldn’t be blamed if it was.",
      "We don’t think they’re in relegation trouble, but Bournemouth’s defence has been ripped apart, and they’ve only signed a left-back to replace Milos Kerkez. Dean Huijsen still hasn’t been replaced and Illia Zabarnyi is a top Paris Saint-Germain target. For months, we’ve been saying that the Cherries need a right-back with Adam Smith past his best and Julian Araujo struggling, but now that’s the least of their worries.",
      "Andoni Iraola has, at least, secured the signing of a new goalkeeper after being unable to make Kepa Arrizabalaga’s loan permanent. Djordje Petrovic is an excellent signing and arguably better than Chelsea’s first-choice goalkeeper, Robert Sanchez.",
      "Bournemouth are relaxed. Having made £90m alone from Huijsen and Kerkez, they’re under no pressure to sell Zabarnyi, but the Ukrainian wants to join PSG. He hasn’t stayed at home or gone to train at his old club to force the move, though. Fair play.",
      "The fact of the matter is, they aren’t close to signing a centre-back after failing to sign Lille’s Bafode Diakite, and they need two of them. It’s also been suggested that they want to sign a striker on loan with Enes Unal injured until November.",
      "There’s still plenty to do, but Bournemouth have extended Antoine Semenyo’s contract and are expected to keep hold of him, Evanilson and Justin Kluivert.",
      "",
      "5) Wolves\nThere is a serious threat of relegation looming at Molineux, and the fact that fans are furious over Nelson Semedo’s departure says a lot about the state the club is in. No offence, Nelson.",
      "There’s a concerning lack of quality throughout Vitor Pereira’s squad, and the man who carried Wolves through most of last season, Matheus Cunha, is long gone. Replaced by Fluminense’s Jhon Arias, Wolves should have plenty of money left over, having made over £60m from the Brazilian’s sale.",
      "Jorgen Strand Larsen joining permanently is a boost, and Arias could be as exciting and influential as Cunha, but this is another transfer window that the Midlands club are failing to take advantage of.",
      "It’s easier said than done to just replace Cunha with someone as good. Unfortunately, that’s not realistic, unless head coach Pereira can bring the absolute most out of someone unexpectedly. We just can’t see it, and the lack of invention in midfield, attack and full-back spells trouble. Oh, and they need a goalkeeper.",
      "Also, we can’t explain why, but Pereira stinks of an acrimonious November exit. We look forward to it.",
      "",
      "4) Everton\nDavid Moyes expected more from Everton’s summer transfer window, and he’s not a happy bunny. He’s being left short all over the pitch, with his side struggling in pre-season, drawing against Accrington Stanley and losing to Blackburn Rovers and Bournemouth.",
      "“The truth is we’re not getting them over the line at the moment – that’s a fact,” a frustrated Moyes said to reporters in the United States. “We’re not getting a lot of the deals done which we’re hoping to do, so we’re continually reassessing and moving on, while maybe things are not coming to fruition… We’re desperate to get things moving on because we know time’s running out.”",
      "Everton enjoyed themselves (for once) in the second half of last season and had reason for optimism in 2025/26, especially as they’re moving into a new stadium. With two weeks to go until they open their season with a trip to Leeds United, Moyes needs a winger, midfielder, right-back and centre-back. Not much, then.",
      "",
      "3) Aston Villa\nOne of the clubs most restricted by the Premier League’s Profit and Sustainability rules, Villa have been worryingly inactive in the summer transfer window.",
      "The addition of Yasin Ozcan is their only signing for a fee, and only Fulham (£437k) and Crystal Palace (£2m) have spent less. There have been some striker rumours involving Samu Aghehowa and Lois Openda, but most of the club’s transfer stories are about sales, not signings.",
      "One sale could be Ollie Watkins, and there’s also a possibility that Morgan Rogers leaves, while Leon Bailey, Jacob Ramsey and Emiliano Martinez have been linked with exits.",
      "The position the Villans are in is very surprising. This time last year, they were looking forward to a Champions League campaign after unsettling the status quo with a fourth-place finish in the Premier League. Now, they are worried about being dismantled while their rivals strengthen at pace and they remain shackled.",
      "The need for attacking reinforcements was underlined by the loan signings of Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford and the permanent arrival of Donyell Malen from Borussia Dortmund in January. Asensio and Rashford were only on loan and contributed to 29.3% of Villa’s goals scored between February and the end of the season. They also had seven assists. Malen should have a bigger role next season after being cast aside following Rashford’s arrival, being left out of Unai Emery’s squad for the Champions League knockout rounds.",
      "Losing over a quarter of your goals must be addressed, and Villa’s lack of signings emphasises the need for a big sale. Rogers would be a gut-wrenching departure, but you have to break eggs to make an omelette. Getting clarity on players like Rogers, Watkins and Martinez is imperative, and it’s clear that Emery needs reinforcements all over the pitch.",
      "The one positive is that Boubacar Kamara has signed a new five-year contract. Positive Villa fans will tell you that’s more significant than any signing they make this summer.",
      "",
      "2) Brentford\nKeith Andrews’ Brentford are firmly in ‘We fear for them’ territory. The loss of Thomas Frank is gargantuan, and replacing him with a rookie head coach is extremely risky. Then you have the exits of club captain Christian Norgaard and star player Bryan Mbeumo, which was inevitable but still stings, and the Yoane Wissa debacle.",
      "Wissa reportedly feels betrayed by the club, who promised him a £26m transfer this summer if he stayed for 2024/25. He did, yet he’s not been allowed to join Newcastle following Mbeumo’s move to Manchester United.",
      "Too many key figures have departed for Brentford fans to be anything but sceptical of their survival chances this season. Relegation has not been a threat since their promotion in 2021, but with no Frank, Norgaard, Mbeumo and Wissa, it’s looking rather bleak.",
      "",
      "1) Newcastle United\nShambolic doesn’t begin to cover whatever is going on at Newcastle this summer. It’s baffling, disgraceful, and everything in between. Some things are out of their hands, but there’s no decisiveness in their transfer pursuits, which has seen several targets slip through their grasp like a lubed-up mini egg.",
      "The Magpies have botched pursuits of Joao Pedro, James Trafford, Hugo Ekitike, Liam Delap and could miss out on Benjamin Sesko because he’s “scared” he’ll be blocked from a future move. Losing out on the RB Leipzig striker to Manchester United will be the final straw for some fans.",
      "After winning the Carabao Cup and qualifying for the Champions League, this was supposed to be a monumental summer for the club. Instead, it’s been a monumental disaster. And we haven’t even got into the Alexander Isak ordeal yet…",
      "There’s not much they can do, but the black and white wounds are already well-salted. The biggest question is: why now, Alex? The timing is baffling and the spotlight is on a club in disarray.",
      "Villa might be in a bit of bother, but we fear for Eddie Howe and his players in their first Premier League game of the season away to Emery’s side.",

      "Manchester United legends Romelu Lukaku and Cristiano Ronaldo account for a quarter of the 20 most expensive striker signings in football history.",
      "",
      "1) Kylian Mbappe – £165.7m/€180m (Monaco to Paris Saint-Germain, July 2018)\nHow weird is it that PSG signed their all-time record goalscorer on loan seven years ago? How funny is it that he became basically more powerful than anyone else at the club, as well as the actual French president? How brilliant is it that they won the Champions League as soon as he left to be phenomenal for Real Madrid, having flirted with the Spaniards for ages?",
      "",
      "2) Harry Kane – £100m/€115.8m (Tottenham to Bayern Munich, August 2023)\nDaniel Levy did his level best to make things awkward but Bayern were determined enough to make the England captain their most expensive player ever that they put up with the nonsense and showed up with the cash. It could even be as much as £120m if add-ons are activated, which they surely will be with Kane let loose on the Bundesliga and finally ending his trophy drought.",
      "",
      "3) Cristiano Ronaldo – £99.2m/€112m (Real Madrid to Juventus, July 2018)\nEntirely bored of being knocked out of the Champions League by Ronaldo, Juventus decided that if you can’t beat them then he must join you. And while the Portuguese added a couple of new league titles to his collection, he never could guide The Old Lady further than a European quarter-final.",
      "",
      "4) Romelu Lukaku – £97.5m/€115m (Inter to Chelsea, August 2021)\nFar from the teenaged Lukaku who rocked up at Stamford Bridge in 2011, the Belgian was far more experienced, well-rounded and refined, albeit just as apparently incompatible with Chelsea as ever as his business remained unfinished.",
      "",
      "5) Cristiano Ronaldo – £80m/€94m (Man Utd to Real Madrid, June 2009)\nPerhaps one of the greatest signings ever, considering Real somehow ultimately made a profit on their record goalscorer after nine phenomenally efficient years and 15 trophies.",
      "",
      "6) Randal Kolo Muani – £76.4m/€90m (Eintracht Frankfurt to PSG, September 2023)\nThe France striker went on strike in the final days of the transfer window to force through a move to his hometown club. Eintracht eventually relented on deadline day, despite their struggles to source a replacement, but PSG had to pay a premium for the 24-year-old. The Parisians stumped up £64.2million up front with a further £12.2million due in potential add-ons, which will go untriggered as he is firmly out of the picture.",
      "",
      "7) Gonzalo Higuain – £75.6m/€90m (Napoli to Juventus, July 2016)\nWhen Real exercised their buy-back clause on Alvaro Morata in summer 2016, Juventus hatched a foolproof plan to simply glance at the list of Serie A top scorers for the previous season and sign them. Bringing in Higuain came with the added bonus of weakening runners-up Napoli but he ultimately didn’t change an awful lot despite a solid personal record.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku – £75m/€84.7m (Everton to Man Utd, July 2017)\nAs a belated reward for retiring Sir Alex Ferguson with a perfect hat-trick, Lukaku was given another shot at the big time after impressing for Everton. Forty-two goals in 96 games was a decent return but neither party looks back on those two years fondly.",
      "",
      "9) Romelu Lukaku – £74m/€80m (Man Utd to Inter, August 2019)\nThe most expensive footballer ever in cumulative fees has an awkwardly mutually unsatisfactory career path behind him, but the move to Inter went so well – 64 goals in 95 games and a Serie A title – that Lukaku has parlayed it into one of the great Italian top-flight careers.",
      "",
      "10) Victor Osimhen – £72m/€80m (Lille to Napoli, July 2020)\nNapoli chairman Aurelio de Laurentiis officially confirmed an “investment of €70m euros plus another €10m bonuses” in the financial death grip of the coronavirus crisis, but one can safely assume 76 goals in 133 games and a Capocannoniere and league double have triggered add-ons Napoli were only too happy to pay until they decided they’d had enough.",
      "",
      "11) Hugo Ekitike – £69m/€79.5m (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool, July 2025)\nThere could yet be another £10m added to this deal, which is an awful lot of money for a player who moved for less than £27m in the summer of 2024. That leap in value came after a 22-goal season for the German club.",
      "",
      "12) Luis Suarez – £64.9m/€82.3m (Liverpool to Barcelona, July 2014)\nAfter sinking his teeth into Premier League defences with one of the great individual seasons for Liverpool in 2013/14, Suarez took a World Cup chunk out of Giorgio Chiellini just to test how much Barcelona wanted him. Still plenty, it turned out, and the Uruguayan repaid that faith with 13 trophies and a ranking of third in their all-time top scorers list.",
      "",
      "13) Victor Osimhen – £64.8m/€75m (Napoli to Galatasaray, July 2025)\nA decent haul of 37 goals and eight assists in 41 games on loan inspired Galatasaray to a league and cup double while convincing them Osimhen was entirely worth absolutely obliterating a Turkish transfer record which had previously stood at around €20m.",
      "",
      "14) Jhon Duran – £64.5m/€77m (Aston Villa to Al-Nassr, January 2025)\nOne explosive half-season not quite earning an assured starting place with Aston Villa was enough for Duran to up sticks and take the Saudi cash for a while. It feels like he’ll be back in Europe sooner rather than later after sitting under the Ronaldo tree.",
      "",
      "15) Darwin Nunez – £64m/€75m (Benfica to Liverpool, June 2022)\nLiverpool would presumably quite like Nunez to activate the clauses which would take the worth of his deal up to £85m, but might actually prefer the far likelier scenario of someone taking him off them.",
      "",
      "16) Rasmus Hojlund – £64m/€73.9m (Atalanta to Man Utd, August 2023)\nThe fee could rise another £8m with add-ons but two years in it looks as though Man Utd speculating to accumulate has backfired. The 22-year-old’s confidence looks shot after scoring 26 goals in 95 games. He’s definitely going to Real Madrid on loan, though.",
      "",
      "17) Dusan Vlahovic – £62.8m/€75m (Fiorentina to Juventus, January 2022)\nOnce again spotting an Arsenal-linked striker excelling elsewhere in the league, Juventus put a whole load of money down on Vlahovic to be their Ronaldo replacement. That they have spent most of the time since trying to sell him suggests how well that has gone.",
      "",
      "18) Alexander Isak – £58m/€70m (Real Sociedad to Newcastle, August 2022)\nNewcastle spent all of their first post-takeover summer transfer window trying to find an appropriate striker for their preordained journey to the top. They waited patiently first to identify Isak and then allow him time to bed in. Their reward is to possess one of the best strikers in the world.",
      "",
      "19) Alvaro Morata – £58m/€65.5m (Real Madrid to Chelsea, July 2017)\nThere are far worse Premier League scoring records out there than 16 goals in 47 games, but Morata never seemed suited to the Our Game cut and thrust.",
      "",
      "20) Zlatan Ibrahimovic – £57m/€66m (Inter to Barcelona, July 2009)\nFor a big old slab of money and a part-exchange which saw Samuel Eto’o head the other way, Pep Guardiola decided to give himself a headache for the entire 2009/10 season. Ibrahimovic scored 22 goals and won five trophies across 46 Barcelona games but no-one involved in the convoluted deal will consider it worth the hassle. To make matters worse, Eto’o won the Treble with Inter.",

      "Newcastle have made a bid worth roughly £70m for RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko while Manchester United are also keen; Slovenia international has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 2 August 2025 14:19, UK",
      "Newcastle, Manchester United and Arsenal have all shown an interest in signing Benjamin Sesko this summer - but what makes the RB Leipzig striker so appealing?",
      "Arsenal's interest is over after they opted to sign Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP but Newcastle have bid £70m and Manchester United are also considering a move.",
      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities would the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt forms a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, and to Manchester United as they look to add more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "A move to the Premier League would come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Newcastle and Manchester United.",

      "Benjamin Sesko is a target for both Newcastle and Manchester United this summer; Newcastle have made a formal bid for the RB Leipzig forward, which matches the Bundesliga club's valuation; Man Utd remain in the mix with Leipzig keen on Rasmus Hojlund on loan",
      "Saturday 2 August 2025 18:08, UK",
      "Newcastle have made a formal bid to RB Leipzig for striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Newcastle have presented their vision to the Slovenian striker and want the deal to happen.",
      "Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has reportedly told his team-mates that he will be leaving.",
      "Sesko is considering his options with Manchester United also at the table. The player is open to both projects.",
      "The bid comes with Newcastle braced for a second offer from Liverpool for Alexander Isak.",
      "Marcel Schafer, RB Leipzig's managing director for sport, confirmed clubs have made approaches for Sesko on Saturday.",
      "\"We won't go into detail on that but when I say that several clubs have shown strong interest and have made approaches, it's obvious what has happened,\" he said.",
      "Newcastle are also interested in Yoane Wissa, who was not part of Brentford's squad for their friendly against QPR on Saturday as he pushes for a move.",
      "Sesko remains a top target for Manchester United. It was thought the club would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker.",
      "While the priority is to offload players, it is understood they can buy before selling provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood RB Leipzig are interested in Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan.",
      "Newcastle head coach Eddie Howe confirmed the club rejected a bid from Liverpool for Isak, but is unsure on what will happen next.",
      "Isak is due back in Newcastle on Saturday following his personal training camp in Spain.",
      "The Newcastle striker has been training at Real Sociedad's training headquarters on his own, after refusing to travel with Newcastle on their pre-season tour of Asia.",
      "Isak reported a thigh injury and travelled to San Sebastián to recover with his own staff.",
      "Eddie Howe said on Saturday morning in South Korea that he found out Isak had travelled to Spain via the media.",
      "\"From my situation I am very much removed from what was happening back home,\" Howe said in a press conference ahead of facing Tottenham on Sunday in South Korea.",
      "\"I was made aware of a bid yesterday and that bid was turned down all before I even heard about it. People back in England are dealing with the situation.",
      "\"I really don't know what happens next. From our perspective, we still support Alex in every way, and my wish is that we see him in a Newcastle shirt again.",
      "\"It is difficult because you don't know what is going to happen. There can be all sorts of talk and hypothetical situations but then you are dealing with reality.",
      "\"The reality is we had the first bid from Liverpool yesterday. I believe that was turned down, from this point onwards let's see what happens.",
      "\"I have no idea to try to predict that. In terms of trying to upset players, from my perspective, we can only talk about us, we try to do things the right way, signing players is always complex, we just try to do what we think is right. I can't talk about other clubs, that is not for me to say.\"",
      "Howe has added Newcastle are only \"looking for the best\" in terms of transfer targets amid a challenging window for the club.",
      "Not only have the Magpies been hit with Isak's desire to leave, but they have also missed out on a number of transfer targets to rivals, including Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, Hugo Ekitike and James Trafford.",
      "Newcastle have also hit a roadblock in their pursuit of Wissa after having a £25m bid knocked back.",
      "With Callum Wilson departing earlier this summer, it leaves just Will Osula as their only recognised first-team striker on their pre-season tour of Asia.",
      "\"We're looking for the best players that we can get,\" said Howe. \"Whatever our target position is, we're looking for the best so I see all situations open and available to us.",
      "\"I feel that's the only way that we're going to get to where we want to go, which is to maximise, and it's quality over quantity. It always has been. That's always been the way that we try to work and the way that we try to recruit, and I think we've done it pretty well to this point.",
      "\"It's been a challenging summer, because we've missed out on various targets for loads of different reasons, but we're still very competitive, and we're still in there trying to bring very good players to the club - and that won't change til the window shuts.\"",

      "\"Of course, scoring first in the beginning of the games can change the confidence of the team. We changed some positions and you feel that they know what to do in different positions.",
      "\"It was a good test. We controlled quite well the runs of Evanilson and Semenyo one against one. Luke Shaw was also really strong. So it was a good day.",
      "\"It was just a pre-season game but the feeling with the same players, even being a pre-season game, if you look at the same players now playing, it looks like a different team and that is a good sign.\"",
      "Amorim also indicated that United's improvement has come from a better culture as the club looks to offload Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia, having sent Marcus Rashford on loan to Barcelona.",
      "Amorim said: \"More than the results is the way they are playing. They are playing better also because they are connecting better with each other, not just on the pitch, but off the pitch.",
      "\"They are stronger. They are faster in this moment. Of course, it's pre-season, but you can see the intensity is completely different. I can see that the data from the minutes are completely different.",
      "\"We are improving, but again, it's a pre-season game. The pressure is going to be so much different during the season, but it's important for them to understand that the same players can play a different game.\"",
      "Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring for Man Utd amid the club's move for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amorim believes United have improved because of the improvement in Hojlund's performances.",
      "\"People focus on the goals and we suffer a lot because of the lack of goals,\" said Amorim. \"I think not just the goals, but the way he connects the play every time we have to kick the ball [long]. The ability for him to hold the defender and to connect in support is helping us a lot to play better and we are playing better because he's playing better.",
      "\"I'm really happy with Rasmus. I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market. The important thing is that the strikers that are here are working really well, are improving, are helping the team and that is the most important thing.\"",
      "Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola was also full of praise for United.",

      "This is pre-season and there are dangers in reading too much into it - particularly given that new signings Cunha and Mbeumo did not feature. But perhaps that is also a good sign. The same players looked a lot better. Light at the end of a long tunnel for Amorim.",

      "Newcastle United are also interested in the player, but it is thought, as it stands, Manchester United is Sesko's preferred destination.",
      "The interest in Sesko is being driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell - he is widely credited for scouting Sesko for Red Bull Salzburg when he was 16.",
      "United's interest in Sesko is long-standing, having kept an eye on his development for a number of years.",
      "While the focus is clearly on player sales, United have done due diligence on a number of strikers in this window.",
      "Talks have been held with Aston Villa over Ollie Watkins, while there was also a tentative interest in Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson.",

      "Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig since joining from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities would he bring to Old Trafford? And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "By targeting Sesko, Manchester United are continuing a theme of trying to add pace to their attack this summer having already signed Bryan Mbeumo, who recorded a top speed of 36.63 km/h last term, making him the fourth-fastest player in the Premier League.",

      "Manchester United defender Luke Shaw has suggested there are no longer any \"stragglers\" in the squad as a result of Ruben Amorim's tough approach.",
      "The new season provides fresh opportunity for United to avenge what Amorim himself labelled a disaster season as United recorded a record low Premier League finish of 15th, while also suffering defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final in May.",
      "Defeat in the final meant United finished the season empty-handed and now prepare for just their second season without European football in 35 years.",
      "Despite the 1-0 defeat in Bilbao, Shaw was quick to defend manager Amorim after the game, explaining that the Portuguese is the right man to lead the club forward. Asked to further explain his comments during United's training camp in Chicago, Shaw doubled down on his stance.",
      "\"I think his mentality, his demands [show he's the right man],\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He's extremely tough on the group. He leaves no stone unturned and I think there are no stragglers in this group anymore. I think everyone has to put the team first. He's made that very clear.",
      "\"I think he's picking players on how he feels will be best for the team and that's his choice. As players, we're fully behind him and fully behind on his ideas and what he wants to implement in this team. We feel like a real team, especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Since I've been back, the group is so together and I think that's something that we need to keep to make us more of a family and everyone all together and we're all driving in the same direction.\"",
      "While there were some lows for Shaw both personally and United as a team, Shaw believes the spirit in pre-season should spur them on to lofty ambitions like winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I can't be any worse than it was last season,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"I was so low last season, so I think anything but that. I feel good and I think especially this pre-season.",
      "\"Obviously, I didn't have a pre-season last season either, so I think it's really benefiting me to be able to just be fit and train with the team and get minutes.",
      "\"I'm enjoying that. Aims-wise, I think the aim has to be winning the Premier League.",
      "\"I know people will be questioning me for saying that after last season, but it has to be that. It's not just me who thinks that. I'm sure the whole team, if you ask them, they all have the same aims.",
      "\"Even the manager, I'm sure he probably wouldn't say it in the press, but we all have to have the same beliefs and ambitions. Like I said, that real family feeling together, and we all strive for the same thing.\"",
      "Since Amorim's arrival at Old Trafford, he has overseen a period of change to the squad with some understood to be allowed to leave this summer.",
      "Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof left the club upon the expiry of their contracts at the end of June, while Jonny Evans announced his retirement, taking up a role in United's academy.",
      "Marcus Rashford, who was also training away from the main squad after returning from a six-month loan spell at Aston Villa this summer, has secured a loan move to Barcelona, which includes an option to buy for the LaLiga side.",
      "After Rashford's departure, United continue to work on exits for Sancho, Antony and Malacia - as well as Garnacho.",
      "Manchester United are focusing on sales, but work continues behind the scenes around the potential recruitment of a striker.",
      "United have been in the market for a striker regardless of Rasmus Hojlund's future amid interest in him from Italy.",
      "Work has been done to explore potential deals for Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Nicolas Jackson is another player the club have looked at, but Chelsea's valuation of the striker is understood to be considered far too high.",
      "United have approached Villa about Watkins, who they have a long-standing interest in.",
      "However, Villa do not want to sell and he is thought to carry a value of around £60m.",
      "The interest in Sesko is understood to be driven by recruitment director Christopher Vivell, who signed the striker as a 16-year-old for Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "Gary Neville has backed Ruben Amorim's overhaul of the Man Utd squad, including the summer signings of Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim is identifying players he does not want in the squad and moving them out. That's a positive,\" Neville told Sky News.",
      "\"The second thing is I do like are the signing of [Mathues] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo. They've got Premier League experience.",
      "\"They look more like Manchester United's style of players, with a bit more pace and power, and that physicality to get from box to box.",
      "\"The other thing I like about those two is they've not proved themselves at the highest level in the game so they should be really desperate to prove themselves on a huge stage, which is Old Trafford.",
      "\"That hunger hasn't always been there in the last 10 years with players that have come to the club.",
      "\"The two signings are good signings yet there's a couple more needed. I think they need a goalkeeper. They need to sign a forward.",
      "\"They have to have a better season than last year. It can't get any worse really.\"",

      "Match report as Ruben Amorim's team recorded their first win of pre-season at the Summer Series in the US; Man Utd raced into a two-goal lead courtesy of a Bruno Fernandes double; Jarrod Bowen pulled one back for sloppy West Ham",
      "Sunday 27 July 2025 11:44, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes scored twice as Manchester United grabbed their first win of pre-season with a 2-1 victory over West Ham in the Summer Series.",
      "The game was played at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey - where, in just under a year, the World Cup final will be held - and the two underachievers from last season played out a friendly with a competitive feel.",
      "Man Utd starting XI: Bayindir, Yoro, De Ligt, Heaven, Amad, Mainoo, Ugarte, Dorgu, Fernandes, Cunha, Hojlund.\n\n\nMan Utd XI after 65 minutes: Bayindir, Shaw, Fredericson, Maguire, Leon, Dalot, Fletcher, Casemiro, Collyer, Mount, Obi",
      "United put in a first-half performance that Ruben Amorim described as \"completely different from last season\", when speaking to MUTV.",
      "His side hit the post through Rasmus Hojlund inside two minutes but didn't have to wait long for the opener from the penalty spot after Alphonse Areola fumbled a cross and then fouled Ayden Heaven inside the area. That allowed Fernandes to slot home from 12 yards.",
      "West Ham really struggled to play through the Manchester United press with Patrick Dorgu and Hojlund doing some excellent work out of possession, although Hojlund's finishing again let him down on 18 minutes when dragging a shot wide.",
      "West Ham starting XI: Areola; Wan-Bissaka, Todibo, Kilman, Aguerd; Diouf, Guido Rodriguez, Ward-Prowse, Soucek, Bowen, Fullkrug",
      "It was left to Fernandes again to find the quality to make a difference as he doubled the lead just after the break. Again, it was a high press from United that did the damage - this time Kobbie Mainoo taking advantage of a slack Areola pass which allowed Fernandes the opportunity to curl one home from 20 yards in typically assured fashion.",
      "Amorim waited until 65 minutes to completely change his starting XI with the likes of Luke Shaw, Harry Maguire and Mason Mount given time to impress off the bench. New signing Bryan Mbeumo was expected to make his first appearance for the club, but although the 25-year-old arrived at the MetLife Stadium with the rest of the United team he wasn't deemed fit enough to make the squad.",
      "Those changes did disrupt United's flow, and the Hammers hit back when Jarrod Bowen rifled home a majestic finish from the angle - but it ended up being just a consolation.",
      "\"I felt good. Training has been very good. We have been doing very well. It's good to win the game, even it being a friendly and to go into the season in a positive way.",
      "\"Overall the game was good. We was good on the ball. In some moments we could have kept possession for longer as the manager was asking - we rushed a bit in the final third when trying to score our goals. We will work on that.\"",
      "On Cunha: \"The Brazilians are very loud, very happy. He's a very funny guy and has settled very quickly with everyone. That's good as we need to him to connect with every player and get the best out of him.\"",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "On Bruno Fernandes during his press conference: \"Now he has more players, I feel, to help him to lead the group and that is a good thing. He is our leader and really important, not just on the field, but off the field. He leads by example. He works really hard, is always available and, sometimes, he plays with pain. Sometimes, the problem is he gets frustrated and loses a little bit of focus of his job. Sometimes, he wants to help his teammates so much, it is not the best thing to do.",
      "\"Last year, I felt sometimes I pushed him back to have more possession in the build-up and we miss Bruno near the box. With different characteristics from Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus Cunha, and I really like Kobbie Mainoo's game, he will have more help this season.",
      "\"Bruno runs a lot, maybe in the sprints he is a different player but he runs a lot. He has a lot of endurance and he is smart. It's not about that. Physicality with Bruno is not a concern, playing him deep or as an attacking midfielder.\"",
      "On whether he's made a decision on his team for opening PL fixture vs Arsenal: \"It was a strong team and we need to prepare all the players, and we don't have a lot of weeks or a lot of games to prepare all the team.",
      "\"That can change, you saw in the second half, there are players who can play in the first game. It's not a decision I made already.\"",
