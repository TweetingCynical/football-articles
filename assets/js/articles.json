      "Manchester United's summer recruits were on full display in their victory against Brighton. Ruben Amorim's side have now won three Premier League matches in a row.",
      "United seem to have turned a new leaf after a dismal start to the season and buoyed by goals from new signings they conquered Brighton 4-2 last time out. Senne Lammens looked composed in goal as Matheus Cunha opened the scoring and Bryan Mbeumo added a second-half double.",
      "Winger Mbeumo arrived at Old Trafford for an initial £65million after bagging 20 top-flight goals for Brentford last year and he looks a shrewd signing. However, Amorim is set to be without the Cameroonian for a minimum of two matches.",
      "Mbeumo is increasingly proving a pivotal part of Amorim's attack as he operates to the right of a central striker adjacent to fellow newcomer Cunha.",
      "He has already bagged four league goals and is looking even more prolific as he settles in Manchester, but soon he will leave the club behind to represent his country at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Cameroon have qualified for the international tournament that takes place from late December in Morocco. Mbeumo's national side begin their group stage campaign on December 24.",
      "With this stage lasting until December 31, Mbeumo will miss at least United's clashes with Newcastle and Wolves. Should Cameroon advance further, with the final taking place on January 18, he could be absent for at least three more matches, including the Manchester derby on January 17.",
      "It has been almost a year since head coach Amorim took over at Old Trafford and when he arrived, it became apparent that some of his forward options were not suited to his system.",
      "Marcus Rashford had been underperforming for Erik ten Hag and as the Dutch manager was relieved of his duties, Amorim did not see the English forward fit for his starting XI.",
      "In January, he was shipped out on loan to Aston Villa and is now starring for Barcelona, with any bridges back to Manchester essentially burned. Antony was another who was almost instantly axed by Amorim.",
      "The Brazilian cost a whopping £86m when he was bought from Ajax for Ten Hag and Amorim did not like what he saw when he arrived last November. He was also loaned out to Real Betis and left on a permanent deal this summer.",
      "Against Brighton, it was a brilliant free-kick from former United striker Danny Welbeck that started off a short-lived resurgence and made it 3-1 in the second half. A Charalampos Kostoulas goal in added time made it 3-2 before Mbeumo settled the nerves with a clinching finish.",
      "The Englishman was a United youth prospect and played consistently after rising through the ranks before he was sold to Arsenal in 2014. His former team-mate Rio Ferdinand believes that currently, he is the second-best Three Lions striker behind captain Harry Kane.",
      "\"He's second to Harry Kane. No, seriously. No experience can do different types of things on the pitch for you,\" said Ferdinand on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel.",
      "\"He can run behind if need be. Like we saw even at Old Trafford at the weekend, he can run behind. He can come short and link play as well as anybody outside of Harry Kane. Like he's an all-round footballer.\"",

      "Paul Scholes has doubled down on his belief that Jadon Sancho possesses the skill and ability to flourish as a top-tier Premier League talent - despite enduring one of the most embarrassing moments of his career during Aston Villa's clash with Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "The Manchester United winger, who spent the previous campaign on loan at Chelsea, joined Villa on a temporary deal during the summer transfer window. His time at Villa Park has been difficult so far, with the player yet to find the net or provide an assist across five outings.",
      "Following encouraging signs in the Europa League encounter against Go Ahead Eagles last Thursday, hopes were high that Sancho could build momentum when Villa took on Manchester City at the weekend.",
      "Despite starting the match on the substitutes' bench, Sancho failed to make any meaningful contribution once introduced into the action. After replacing the injured Emiliano Buendia during the first half, Sancho found himself withdrawn before the final whistle.",
      "The winger managed just 45 minutes on the pitch before being hauled off by manager Unai Emery. Sancho entered the fray in place of Buendia during the 29th minute before making way for Evann Guessand in the 74th minute.",
      "The England international has faced widespread mockery for being substituted as a substitute, although former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood and Scholes have come to his defence.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, Sherwood said: \"I like the boy. I think he's got – I don't know him as a person – but I think he's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "Offering his assessment during Sherwood's evaluation of Sancho, Scholes responded: \"Loads of ability.\"",
      "Sherwood went on to say: \"He needs to do it on a regular basis. You know, on a consistent basis, and if he does that, I mean, he's good enough to play, you know, [at an] enormous amount of clubs.\"",
      "In his post-match briefing, Villa boss Unai Emery addressed the 'embarrassing' substitution of Sancho and the decision to bring Guessand on in his place.",
      "\"Yes, sure he's (Sancho) not happy but I did it before with Morgan Rogers, with Emiliano Buendia, with Leon Bailey, and he played 60 minutes on Thursday,\" Emery stated.",
      "\"Today when he (Buendia) was injured, my plan was maybe in case he (Sancho) was going to play 30 minutes, but I decided to play more and he played 45 minutes.",
      "\"But my plan was when he was swapped with Emiliano Buendia, the idea was maybe not playing all the minutes until the last moment. And I told him as well, he can feel it, it's embarrassing.",
      "\"Before Morgan, Emiliano Buendia and Leon Bailey, they felt the same when I subbed them, but it was not a punishment. And now it's not a punishment.",
      "\"He played 45 minutes, I am so happy because his impact was good, his electricity, his skill, but then to play more than now he's not ready fit to play 90 minutes, 45 minutes is not easy enough for him and I am happy and of course, progressively he's coming better and better.\"",

      "Manchester United may be forced to wait in line over their ambitious plans for a new £2billion stadium. Old Trafford chiefs could find themselves behind AC Milan and Inter Milan as the Italian duo look to get their own new stadium plans off the ground.",
      "The clubs share a crucial partner as they all attempt to regenerate historic grounds in world football. Foster + Partners are the firm behind designing Sir Jim Ratcliffe's 100,000 capacity hopes, with a timeline for completion of 2030 touted.",
      "But the global studio for sustainable architecture, urbanism, engineering and design is now getting work underway designing the new San Siro, per Mail Online. Fosters have been given the all-clear to build a new 71,500-seater San Siro with the current stadium to be knocked down.",
      "That could leave their hands full, and there are hopes that development could be complete by 2031, in time for the European Championship the following year. The report suggests that Fosters were in discussions with Birmingham City but felt their priorities were too focused elsewhere.",
      "United told their Fan Forum meeting earlier this month that they continue to work with Fosters, but with a caveat. \"The club relayed it is working collaboratively with Foster+ Partners as the master planner for the wider regeneration project and that no official appointment has been made for the engineering and construction contract for the new stadium build project,\" read the minutes.",
      "The Red Devils remain hopeful of securing a deal to purchase land surrounding Old Trafford for the project and told the latest fans’ forum meeting that ‘constructive discussions’ have taken place with Freightliner over acquiring it. The extra land behind Old Trafford is said to be critical to Lord Foster’s tent design.",
      "A United spokesperson said: \"Early design work has been intentionally paused until we have greater clarity on land assembly and fan requirements. As with other aspects of the project, we encourage fans to treat speculative media reports with caution.",
      "\"We remain excited by the vision set out by Foster + Partners for a new stadium at the heart of a wider regeneration of the Old Trafford area.",
      "\"We always said this was a conceptual design, with more detailed architectural work to follow. While we remain keen to advance as quickly as possible, the timetable is subject to progress on land assembly and financing, which depends on key stakeholders working together.\"",
      "United have previously admitted that they can't deliver their ambitious vision for Old Trafford alone, and have been working closely with the government and Trafford Council. Both the club and the city region have a goal to bring significant fixtures to the stadium from the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2035.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has taken it upon himself to mentor Matheus Cunha in a bid to help Brazilian become an Old Trafford hero.",
      "Cunha, who joined the Reds in a whopping £62.5million deal from Wolves over the summer, had a rocky start with the club. In fact, he didn't manage to score or assist in his first eight appearances and even missed a match due to a hamstring injury before the first international break.",
      "However, the 26-year-old star finally broke his goalless streak and netted his first for United in their 4-2 win against Brighton on Saturday. Cunha's first goal was a beauty, curling the ball from the edge of the box into the bottom corner, leaving goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen helpless.",
      "According to The Sun, Fernandes has played a crucial role in helping Cunha cope with the pressures of being a United player. Their shared Portuguese language has reportedly fostered a strong mentorship between the two.",
      "It's said that Fernandes and Cunha have been spending hours in extra training sessions, honing their skills on free-kicks and set pieces - and their close bond is beginning to show results on the pitch.",
      "Insiders at The Sun suggest that Fernandes' guidance has been instrumental in boosting Cunha's emotional control and confidence, particularly during the Brazilian's frustrating injury spell.",
      "Despite Cunha failing to find the net or provide an assist during the thrilling 2-1 triumph at Liverpool last Sunday, his performance caught the eye and hinted at his potential to become a genuine game-changer for United under new boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The forward did manage to get his name on the scoresheet against Brighton, with Amorim singing the praises of the former Wolves and Atletico Madrid ace - who bagged 17 goals in 36 outings last campaign - following the match.",
      "\"He was struggling. He can hide that, but I understand he's struggling,\" Amorim told the BBC. \"But he shows confidence in every moment of the game. I really love the way he defends. I know I'm a little bit basic on that, but it's not a surprise the way he responded at Anfield.",
      "\"It's not a surprise the way he played with the ball, but without the ball, he's improving. That is going to be massive for our team. He needs to score goals; he suffered when he didn't score, but he is a top player because he decides games, and I'm really pleased with him.\"",
      "Cunha and United return to action when the Red Devils make the trip to Nottingham Forest on Saturday. They have the opportunity to climb as high as second in the standings with a fourth consecutive Premier League victory at the City Ground.",

      "Arsenal should have signed Bryan Mbeumo 'years ago' according to former Gunners star Theo Walcott. Manchester United are reaping the benefits of that failure.",
      "Mbeumo made a big-money move from Brentford to United over the summer, with the Red Devils footing up £71million for his services. The Gabon international has quickly looked to repay some of that fee with impressive early form at Old Trafford.",
      "The 26-year-old has bagged five goals in his first 10 appearances for United, coming off the back of a season where he struck 20 Premier League goals for Brentford. And Walcott reckons Ruben Amorim has signed a sure thing.",
      "Mbeumo has earned plenty of experience in the top-flight after joining Brentford as a 19-year-old in the Championship in 2019. The forward cost a club record fee of £5.8m, meaning the Bees earned a tidy profit having seen Mbeumo improve over the years.",
      "Ex-Everton and Southampton winger Walcott reckons another of his former clubs, Arsenal, should have had the foresight to do a deal sooner. The former England ace believes United have made a good move by signing Premier League talent amid competition from Newcastle and Tottenham.",
      "\"You have Cunha coming back and defending as well and Mbeumo who I think is outstanding,\" said Walcott on It’s Called Soccer, \"You look at players away from the Premier League who come into the Premier League, they take time. These guys [like Mbeumo] were built for Premier League football.",
      "\"I think Mbeumo has been incredible and he’s a player Arsenal should have bought many years ago.\"",
      "Walcott believes Mbeumo could just be the tip of the iceberg, however, and that his team-mates are starting to find their way under Amorim. The 36-year-old claims that Amorim's system is finally starting to be understood by his squad.",
      "\"The team are understanding the way to play in his system now. When you have three at the back, you always have to have one of the centre-backs coming out into the midfield to be a third midfielder.",
      "\"Luke Shaw is that man doing that because he’s the one out of all the players that you trust to be able to cover as well. They need that if Bruno [Fernandes] and Cunha are going to work in the same team because I wasn’t so sure if they could really operate in the same team. It felt like two players that want to be in the same positions.",

      "Manchester United chiefs are reportedly determined not to splash the cash in the January transfer window. United are planning for the mid-season window after three successive wins and are convinced major recruitment isn’t needed for Ruben Amorim to continue their upward trajectory.",
      "Things are beginning to click for summer signings Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but there have been suggestions that United need to invest further in the next transfer window. While £200million was spent on attacking reinforcements in the summer, United missed out on midfield additions.",
      "Amorim has fielded Casemiro alongside Bruno Fernandes in central midfield in the past three games and the Portuguese manager wants new recruits. United reportedly have six names on a shortlist in midfield, including Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox are said to be targeting a top-six finish in the Premier League this season. That would see United return to some form of European football, having missed out this season by finishing 15th and losing the Europa League final in 2024/25.",
      "United are reportedly keen to keep things how they are in January, which means that Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee may be prevented from leaving. That is partly due to Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui’s potential involvement in the Africa Cup of Nations in the New Year.",
      "United owners Ineos are reportedly quietly satisfied with the progress currently being made by Amorim and his coaching staff following another poor start to the season. With no European football, United have more time to prepare for each Premier League game and are now showing some consistency ahead of their game against Nottingham Forest this weekend.",
      "“I think they are more confident,” Amorim said after the Brighton win. “I think the best game that we did this season was against Arsenal, was the first one. But then, when you are a little bit more confident, when you have a different spirit, sometimes you have a little bit [of] luck in certain moments of the game that help you to win games.",

Berbatov, who joined United from Spurs for £30.75m in 2008, was taken to a restaurant by a team-mate after training, Once there, he was accosted by a group of men - believed to be henchmen of gangster Georgi Iliev - and held captive for several hours as they looked to force him to move to a rival.",
      "Berbatov, who starred in the Premier League, also appearing for Fulham, told the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast: \"I was playing for CSKA Sofia and I was really starting to show my qualities. And normally, when you show your quality as a player, teams will come for you, submit offers, ask, you know, how long do you have as a contract, how much do you cost to buy, and stuff like this.",

      "\"He said, 'we will figure that out. Don't worry about it.' And the guys were sitting there and I’m just like this, you know, intimidated, of course. So maybe two, three hours sitting there, and in the end, the guy let me call my dad.",
      "\"And I'm like calling my dad, 'I'm here. I don’t know where I am. You know, the people around me, big guys.' You know, I was talking really fast, and he’s like, 'calm down, breathe. Like, just calm down and just breathe.'",
      "\"And I'm like, 'what the f**k? They're going to kidnap me here and I don't want to go, I want to go home.' And he’s like, 'OK, OK. Let me see what I can do. I'll call the guy.' So eventually someone calls someone, and the big bosses of the two teams figure out a way of me not moving, just staying where I was.",
      "\"And in that situation, 18 years old, seeing and knowing how things were done back then in Bulgaria, I was thinking to myself, 'this is it for me. Maybe they’re going to beat me, or I don't know, you know'.",

      "\"The boss said, 'Well, you're not playing. It's very difficult for me to say. It pains me to say it, but you're not playing today'. And I'm like, in my mind, 'All right, I'm on the bench. Am I on the bench?'",
      "\"'No, no, you're not playing. You're not in the squad'. And in a moment like this, even if you're strong, even if you're a man, you can be paralysed like I was.",
      "\"I was just sitting there and I wanted to move. I wanted to say something, but I couldn't, because even if I say something, you know how it is, the team, it's already decided.",
      "\"The kits are on the places, so nothing can change. And then the boss just say, 'I'll leave it to you,', and he left. And then, obviously, from that sadness and disappointment come the anger, you know, that I became angry.",
      "\"Thinking that I don't deserve this because I scored the goals. And I was feeling confident, and we became champions as well. And then from that anger, you want to do action, you wanted to say something, to fight someone. And in my case, I just wanted to leave.",
      "\"I just felt worthless. I changed my mind and I stayed. But I watched the game in the dressing room. So it was one of the most difficult points of my career. But after a while, the boss just apologised. And when I asked him to do the foreword for my book, he wrote it inside it. It was a mistake.\"",

      "After a stint at Aston Villa last season, Rashford was keen to leave Old Trafford and, finally, got his wish when he secured a switch to the Camp Nou. Since joining Barcelona, Rashford has netted five goals and provided seven assists, including one in their recent 2-1 defeat to Real Madrid in El Clasico, while his performances for the La Liga giants have drawn comments from Saha.",
      "\"I've always been a fan of Marcus Rashford; his quality is amazing. I was even jealous of his talent, and he's a nice guy,\" Saha told BetVictor.",
      "\"However, I don't like the narrative where a player leaves a club like Man Utd, and performs better elsewhere, and then blames United for previous struggles. As a professional, you need to find solutions, regardless of whether the manager likes you.",

      "Former Manchester United No.1 Andre Onana appeared to aim a subtle dig at his Old Trafford colleagues when reflecting on his start at Trabzonspor. The Cameroon international moved on loan to Turkey after falling out of favour with United and has enjoyed four straight wins with his new club.",
      "Trabzonspor sit second in the Super Lig with 23 points, picking up 13 of those in Onana's six outings between the sticks. While the move is only a loan at first, the ex-Inter Milan man could end up completing a permanent move in 2026.",
      "Certainly, Senne Lammens has impressed so far as he makes his case to remain United's first choice for the present and future. Onana, meanwhile, appears far happier with his current team-mates.",
      "Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola has praised Onana for his play with ball at feet on multiple occasions. Responding to that praise, the keeper pointed to the value his colleagues play in allowing him to take the approach he does.",
      "\"As I always say, most of the time, it’s my teammates who give me the options when I’m building up the game,\" he said, per Sporx (via Sport Witness). \"If they help me, the work looks much better.”",
      "The comments could be read as an implication that he didn't receive the same kind of help at United. While Onana came in for criticism for some high-profile errors unrelated to playing out from the back, United's defensive struggles were well documented.",
      "In Onana's two seasons between the sticks, the Red Devils conceded 58 and 54 goals respectively. They had only conceded more than 50 goals in two other seasons in the Premier League era, though one of those instances came in the 2021/22 campaign with some of the same defenders who are at the club now.",
      "Reflecting more widely on his approach, Onana said: “If I have to create a play, I analyse it first. Are the opponents pressing, are they pressing with their wingers, are they pressing with their strikers, or are their centre-backs coming forward?",
      "“These are the things I need to see when I have the ball. I watch how the opponents are moving and then I look at the options and make my decision. Of course, it’s always great to hear a comment like that from Pep Guardiola. He’s one of the best managers in the history of football.\"",
      "With just seven goals conceded in 10 games, Onana's Trabzonspor side boast one of the better defensive records in Turkey. His parent club have conceded 14 goals in their nine league games - three in three with Lammens in goal and 11 in six with Altay Bayindir between the sticks.",

      "Brendan Rodgers picked a fight he could never win. Just like Sir Alex Ferguson did more than two decades ago.",
      "Because those who take on Irish businessman Dermot Desmond, tend to finish on the losing side. Just like Rodgers has now, having left Celtic with his managerial reputation in ruins.",
      "But no-one should be surprised how Desmond, the most powerful figure at Celtic, decided to unleash a brutal character assassination on Rodgers. Because Desmond doesn't suffer fools. Back in the Noughties, Desmond was a significant shareholder at Manchester United when he found himself embroiled in what became an infamous row between Fergie and fellow Irishman businessman John Magnier.",
      "The protracted and public dispute was over the ownership of stallion 'Rock Of Gibraltar'. Fergie had been given a half share of the horse, which went on to become a champion one.",
      "Fergie believed his share was worth more than what Magnier, and his Coolmore bloodstock empire, were willing to give him. The dispute, which started in 2003 when Fergie was managing United, resulted in Magnier putting pressure on the club, by questioning some of their past transfer dealings and agents involved in them.",
      "These included Fergie's son, Jason Ferguson. Ferguson launched legal proceedings, while United supporters protested against Magnier, and threatened to disrupt the Cheltenham Festival.",
      "But the dispute was resolved once Desmond agreed to act as peacemaker. Which resulted in Fergie getting a settlement much lower than what he had asked for. With help from Desmond, Magnier had won.",
      "Desmond gets what he wants, in the end. A fact Rodgers is now coming to realise.",
      "Desmond operates in the margins, with stealth. He is someone who believes business should be done with discretion. He makes all the big calls - and doesn't feel the need to have to explain them.",
      "But he has taken the unusual step of making an exception for Rodgers. Accusing the former Liverpool manager of speaking words which \"have contributed to a toxic atmosphere around the club, fuelling \"hostility towards members of the executive team and the board.\"",
      "In short, whatever Rodgers has done, it has persuaded Desmond to go nuclear on him. It's difficult to see where Rodgers goes from here.",
      "He might even feel like taking legal action himself, just like Fergie did all those years ago. But then again, he might want to think long and hard about that.",

      "No sooner had Jadon Sancho been taken off the pitch during the Man City match than a flurry of comments flooded social media, suggesting the winger should feel embarrassed or that his career had reached a new nadir. Sadly, these extreme reactions were to be expected.",
      "Many outsiders were also prematurely anticipating a failed loan spell for Marcus Rashford months before it even kicked off. A dream transfer to Barcelona was next for forward, whose resurgence in form - thanks to his stint at Villa - can only enhance England's prospects of winning the World Cup next year.",
      "At present, Sancho is not at the same fitness level as Rashford was when he signed with Villa back in February, but this is a season-long loan. The 25-year-old still has ample time to demonstrate his worth.",
      "A quick scroll of social media indicates that Sancho has more than just Emery to impress. However, it's crucial he maintains a laser-like focus, like Rashford, concentrating on the task at hand and disregarding external pressures.",
      "Sancho had a chat with Rashford last season, with the former Villa loanee expressing his delight at finding himself again at a club willing to offer the platform he needed.",
      "Sancho's situation mirrors this closely, and he will be scrutinised intensely during his tenure at Villa - a fact not uncommon for any Manchester United player or one who has previously commanded a hefty transfer fee. Frankly, it's part and parcel of the job.",
      "Some things, however, need perspective - Sancho’s performance against City is one of them.",
      "Sancho was called into action in the 29th minute, replacing Emi Buendia who had suffered a foot injury shortly after setting up Matty Cash's goal.",
      "Operating from the left flank in his fifth loan appearance for Villa, Sancho nearly got on the scoresheet in the second half. A well-timed run onto Boubacar Kamara's lofted pass saw him leave Matheus Nunes trailing in his wake, before forcing a save from Gianluigi Donnarumma. The Italian shot-stopper was again called into action to deny the rebound.",
      "Just four minutes after almost doubling Villa's lead, Sancho made way for Evann Guessand, whose work rate off the ball was required at that stage of the match.",
      "Despite Sancho being brought on earlier than expected due to Buendia's injury, Unai Emery, like all top managers, prioritised the team's needs and made the necessary changes to secure victory.",
      "Guessand came on, along with Ross Barkley who replaced John McGinn. Both substitutes performed admirably, easing pressure on the defence and fulfilling their roles - much like Sancho did during his 45-minute stint.",
      "Naturally, no player wants to be subbed off after coming on as a substitute, but Emery's intention was always to give Sancho some game time. It just so happened that his introduction came sooner than planned.",
      "In fact, there have been nine other occasions when Emery has 'subbed the sub', with Morgan Rogers, Leon Bailey, Moussa Diaby, and Buendia among them. Did anyone really bat an eyelid when those substitutions were made?",
      "Villa beat Man City at home for a third successive season. Sancho played his part, is looking sharper and fitter, yet the narrative was predictably polarising - yearning for an instant reaction before Emery had even shaken Guardiola's hand or spoken at the press conference.",
      "Asked about the substitution, Emery said: \"It was not easy, firstly, after Sancho played 60 minutes against Go Ahead. He is getting fit, but not enough.",
      "\"I planned as well with him to play him in the second half, but after the injury to Buendia, I decided to get him on the field as best as possible to get minutes and fitness, using his skills and qualities.",
      "\"His impact was good, but I knew before that it was my plan was to sub him, and I did it before with Morgan Rogers and Emi Buendia.",
      "\"It was not a punishment, it was a plan - he played 45 minutes. The other sub players were ready. Malen, Maatsen and Barkley were all very good.\"",

      "\"It’s almost as if whenever he steps on the pitch in a United shirt, he’s showing people the reason the club have signed him.",
      "\"In today’s market, £62.5 million for him is a brilliant deal and he's already one of United’s key players. He draws fouls, he’s got quick feet, and he’s obviously a goal threat.",
      "\"The one thing I was concerned about before he joined United was his work rate and pressing, but he’s started to show he can do that as well. He’s been an excellent signing so far.\"",

      "Manchester United are on the march under Ruben Amorim. A sentence people never expected to read. One which has remained unwritten since Amorim took charge almost 12 months ago.",
      "Until now. Three wins on the spin have given United confidence and momentum. But one of them in particular, could well define the team's entire season.",
      "Not to mention Amorim's future. The impact of United's recent triumph at Liverpool on Amorim and his squad, will be immeasurable.",
      "It has given Amorim the belief there is genuine method to his managerial madness. Not to mention make his players believe in both him and themselves.",
      "That they can take on and beat the best. And no-one has personified United's resurgence more than Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "The likes of Bruno Fernandes, Casemiro, Amad Diallo and Matthijs de Ligt have all been outstanding. But Cunha and Mbeumo have added genuine sparkle and a new dimension to United's attacking play.",
      "The duo are undoubtedly talented footballers. But what makes them stand out the most is their willingness to embrace the challenge of playing for a club like United. This hasn't been the case with certain individuals in recent times.",
      "And, heck, said challenge has even proved too much for some of the managers that have come and gone from Old Trafford.",
      "But Cunha and Mbeumo have relished the pressure, instead of being daunted by it. The pair want the ball. They want to express themselves. They are not afraid to try different things.",
      "United were a swashbuckling team under the great Sir Alex Ferguson. A side which never knew when it was beaten, or gave up hope of winning.",
      "And the attitude Mbeumo and Cunha bring to this current United side is reminiscent of those heady days in the 1990s and 2000s. Rome wasn't built in a day. And neither is a title winning football team.",
      "But United appear to be on the right track at last, because Amorim has two fearless footballers who are given his side a genuine identity.",

      "Bruno Fernandes showed his leadership skills as the first Manchester United player to speak out following Erik ten Hag's dismissal. The Dutchman was given his marching orders from Old Trafford exactly a year ago on Tuesday.",
      "Ten Hag's sacking marked a gloomy period for many associated with the club for various reasons. It suggested United may have made a mistake in retaining the manager despite his FA Cup victory over Manchester City just months before, with the team languishing in 14th place in the Premier League at the time of his departure.",
      "Many fans had hoped for success after the excitement of that Wembley win. Instead, the same dreary atmosphere persisted around the team, who fell back into their old habits of struggling for consistent results.",
      "However, Fernandes, who was appointed United captain by Ten Hag in July 2023, was the first to step forward. The Portugal midfielder displayed pure class as he bade farewell to the outgoing manager.",
      "\"Thanks for everything boss! I appreciate the trust and the moments we share (sic) together,\" he wrote on Instagram, accompanied by the raised hands emoji. \"I wish you all the best in the future.",
      "\"Even knowing the last period hasn't been great from all of us I hope you fans can keep with you the good things the manager has done for our club!\"",
      "Despite the inevitable focus on the negatives of a departing manager, United experienced some highs under Ten Hag. He was just one victory away from securing a cup double in his first season, bagging the League Cup and narrowly missing out in the 2023 FA Cup final to City.",
      "It's also worth mentioning United finished third in the league during Ten Hag's inaugural campaign. However, a dramatic fall to eighth place the following season played a significant role in his dismissal.",
      "Fernandes would have developed a unique bond with the man who gave him the captain's armband at Old Trafford. And the 31-year-old had reason to be hopeful with the appointment of fellow Sporting CP graduate Ruben Amorim as his successor.",
      "As fans commemorate the anniversary of Ten Hag's departure, things are finally looking up for the current boss. A 4-2 triumph over Brighton on Saturday marked United's third consecutive win since Amorim took the reins.",
      "Fernandes and his team-mates have climbed to sixth in the league and haven't suffered a home defeat since their season-opener. Their next challenge is Nottingham Forest on Saturday as United aim to break into the top four.",

      "Rio Ferdinand claims Ruben Amorim is playing \"Russian Roulette with his job\" as he refuses to change at Manchester United - which is now yielding results after a period of turmoil.",
      "The Portuguese boss has been under the spotlight for much of the year he's been in his post, presiding over their worst ever Premier League campaign last term. A consistent talking point has been Amorim's 3-4-3 system, which he's refused to veer from despite the number of defeats.",
      "The ex-Sporting Lisbon boss has defended his system when its been cited as the key issue during United's poor run, even suggesting United should sack him if they want to see a different way of playing.",
      "His refusal to veer from his philosophy has paid off in more recent weeks. After beating Sunderland prior to the international break the team returned and stunned Liverpool at Anfield. That was the first time they'd won successive Premier League games under Amorim and they've since made it three on the bounce.",
      "Ferdinand admits there is something to admire about Amorim's loyalty to his beliefs, but equally accepts it could have gone horribly wrong that he not begun getting results.",
      "He said on the latest episode of Rio Ferdinand Presents: \"I admire it to a certain extent, but, like I said, I think he is playing Russian Roulette with his job. I don't think he's changed drastically, he's just tweaked. That's what a lot of fans were asking for. Just tweak what you've got. Maybe don't be so much on the front foot, maybe be a bit more conservative at times when we haven't got the ball.",
      "\"You can't press, press, press for 90 minutes, unless you're an absolute beast of a team. PSG do it. This manager couldn't do that with this squad.",
      "\"That's just sometimes how the cookie crumbles. We might look back in six months and, say Man United finish in the Champions League or something like that, he'll probably sit there confidently and go, 'Well, if I did change, I probably would be out of a job because I have been doing things that are alien to me'.\"",
      "United's upturn in form has seen them win four of their last five and push them up to sixth in the table - level on points with Manchester City. They've leapfrogged Liverpool amid their poor run of results with Amorim's side now part of the European conversation.",

      "It's been a year to the day since Erik ten Hag was sacked by Manchester United. The decision, made two months into the season, was seen as harsh but necessary, with the Dutchman being shown the door shortly after lifting the FA Cup.",
      "Ruben Amorim, then at Sporting CP, was quickly identified by Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos as the ideal replacement for Ten Hag, and they didn't hesitate to fork out £8.3million to trigger his release clause. But the 12 months since haven’t exactly gone according to plan for the Portuguese manager.",
      "Having inherited a squad of players not of his choosing, who struggled to adapt to his preferred 3-4-2-1 formation, Amorim's Red Devils ended up in a dismal 15th place in the Premier League last season - the club's worst-ever finish. To add insult to injury, they were also beaten in the Europa League final by Tottenham, missing out on a Champions League spot.",
      "The start of the current 2025/26 season had been equally difficult, until recently when United managed back-to-back wins for the first time under Amorim, beating Sunderland and Liverpool, followed by a 4-2 victory over Brighton last Saturday.",
      "Now sitting in sixth place, things might finally be falling into place for the Old Trafford side. A significant part of this turnaround has been Amorim's ruthless approach to his squad, showing the door to those who don't fit his tactical ideas or simply lack the right attitude.",
      "Two such players are Marcus Rashford, on loan at Barcelona since the summer, and Antony, who signed for Real Betis after a successful loan spell there last season. Interestingly, former manager Ten Hag reportedly believed the pair had let him down throughout his tenure.",
      "According to the Daily Star, Ten Hag felt that Rashford, Antony and Casemiro had all underperformed significantly during his tenure, contributing to his eventual downfall.",
      "Rashford in particular managed to net only once in the league last season under Ten Hag and consistently underperformed at the start of the campaign. The prolonged slump in form of a previously prolific striker left Ten Hag without a reliable goal-scorer, the player having netted 17 times (30 across all competitions) during Ten Hag's inaugural season.",
      "Antony was specifically brought in by Ten Hag for a hefty £86m, with hopes that he would replicate his Ajax performances under the same manager. However, he fell far short of justifying such a price tag, tarnishing Ten Hag's transfer record.",
      "Casemiro also saw a dip in form after an impressive first season at Old Trafford, with his fitness levels dropping and several costly errors not helping Ten Hag's cause.",
      "Amorim seemed to share Ten Hag's sentiments, having frozen out Rashford less than two months into his tenure and loaning both him and Antony out in January. Of the trio, only Casemiro remains in the picture.",
      "Despite being in the twilight of his career at 33, Casemiro remains a dedicated professional, making significant contributions to United's campaign last season. The Brazilian midfielder was instrumental in the latter stages of the Europa League, scoring vital goals.",
      "The Brazilian midfielder also played the majority of minutes in United’s last three Premier League matches, which all ended in wins, scoring and assisting against Brighton. Unlike the aforementioned duo, the five-time Champions League winner still has the chance to play a key role in United’s potential resurgence under Amorim.",

      "Manchester United youngster Shea Lacey has trained this week, despite suffering a knock last weekend.",
      "Lacey was a notable absentee from the Under-21 squad to face Rochdale on Tuesday night.",
      "The 18-year-old received treatment for a shoulder injury during the U21s' win against Tottenham last Saturday. He was replaced in the 65th minute and was spotted holding ice to the area while on the bench.",
      "However, Lacey is understood to be fine after the knock and has trained normally this week. The Liverpool-born lad is seen as a high-potential talent and United did not risk him to face Rochdale as a precaution.",
      "Lacey is pushing to make a first-team debut this season. The youngster has long been considered one of the best talents in the academy and has starred for the U21s during this campaign.",
      "Earlier this month, Lacey was drafted into England senior training by Thomas Tuchel to supplement the session. He was named in England's Under-20 squad for the October international break and was given the opportunity to train with the Three Lions' first-team at St. George's Park.",
      "\"He is in the same sort of area as Chido because of time lost. Different to Chido, Chido is fast progression. Because of time lost with Shea, he still has lots to come tactically, physically and mentally.",
      "\"Everybody can see - you have to be blind not to see - the talent he's got. He's got lots to do in his game and he knows. We're still managing him physically because if he can stay on the pitch and can train every day, I think everyone thinks he could be a top, top player.\"",
      "United consider Lacey as a first-team prospect and they were protective of his minutes last season, wanting to ensure that the youngster did not suffer further small injury problems.",
      "Lacey has generated immense interest in the last few years because followers of the academy are excited about his potential.",
      "There have been comparisons made between Lacey and Phil Foden and, just like the Manchester City star, Lacey's long-term future could be as an attacking midfielder.",
      "The youngster was born in Merseyside and comes from a family of Liverpool fans, but he's a United supporter and grew up idolising multi-Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi.",

      "Obi didn't show any emotion as he glared at the home fans at the Crown Oil Arena. The youngster was all business because scoring academy goals is second nature to him. They are as often as hot dinners.",
      "There was a minute's silence held before the game after the passing of Rhys Bennett's father. The players wore black armbands as a mark of respect and Bennett watched from the terraces with his family.",
      "Bennett has been granted compassionate leave and United are offering pastoral care to the youngster.",
      "The U21s began their National League Cup campaign against Tamworth in August. That game was abandoned after a Sekou Kone head injury, and Travis Binnion's side lost against Brackley in September.",
      "United needed to bounce back in the competition against Rochdale, who had made wholesale changes to their team due to their focus on securing promotion back to the Football League.",
      "Obi was asked for a photograph by a young fan when he stepped off the coach. The 17-year-old made seven appearances in the Premier League last season but has exclusively played in academy fixtures this term.",
      "United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup second round by Grimsby Town and there is no European football, so there are fewer first-team opportunities for academy prospects.",
      "Obi must be patient and keep scoring goals for the U21s to earn the first-team involvement. He will force his way into the squad again by the end of the season if he continues to score at a rate of knots.",
      "And although Obi opened the scoring within 10 minutes against Rochdale, it was Thwaites who was the standout performer, catching the eye in midfield with his dynamic range of passing.",
      "Thwaites has a name fitting of a player from a bygone era. His technical ability on the ball would probably make him seem like an alien if he were teleported to the 1940s, though.",
      "The Bolton-born lad only seems to have one setting: to pass the ball forward. He sprayed it around the pitch and slipped through Bendito Mantato down the right wing just before the interval.",
      "Thwaites is a dead-ball specialist, which may help him progress to the first-team, as set-pieces have suddenly become fashionable again in the Premier League in the last 18 months.",
      "United were value for their one-goal advantage by half-time. Rochdale had not threatened goalkeeper William Murdock between the sticks and Binnion would have been delighted with the performance.",
      "Obi is a goal machine at academy level and his finishing prowess is impressive, but he needs to improve his out-of-possession work, his pressing and link-up play with his teammates.",
      "Godwill Kukonki started for the U21s for the first time this season. Kukonki has been involved with first-team training sessions and acquitted himself well on the left side of central defence.",
      "Diego Leon scored his first goal for United last weekend and he is gradually finding his feet after his summer move from Paraguay. Leon delivered another competent display before being replaced on the hour mark.",
      "The U21s won 1-0 against Rochdale when they visited the Crown Oil Arena last year, and they went one better this time around thanks to a late goal from James Scanlon during injury time.",

      "Manchester United's preparations for the weekend game against Nottingham Forest are already underway.",
      "United made it three wins on the spin on Saturday as they beat Brighton and Hove Albion 4-2 at Old Trafford. The players who were unused substitutes against the Seagulls or played limited minutes at the weekend took part in Sunday's training session, as did a number of academy players who were called up to boost the numbers.",
      "The club have released a short video of the training session and MEN Sport picked out three key points from the workout.",
      "Before Brighton, Amorim confirmed that Mason Mount was a doubt for the fixture, which instantly caused concern given his track record with injuries.",
      "He managed to be fit enough for a place on the bench but was not risked against the Seagulls. He took part in Sunday's training session and looked to be moving freely as he aims to regain his place in the team on Saturday.",
      "As the current back-up goalkeeper, Altay Bayindir was involved in the session along with Tom Heaton. The Turkish goalkeeper took part in a small-sided game with the outfield players.",
      "While United have looked to be more direct with Senne Lammens in goal, being able to play out from the back is still a big part of modern-day football, and Bayindir is clearly keen to get the practice in with his feet.",
      "Harry Maguire was not spotted participating in the session having missed the win over Brighton through injury.",
      "Amorim said before that game that he hoped to have Maguire back this week, but there was no sign of him in the footage released by the club. It may be that he was just not picked up by the cameras, but Amorim will hope he's available for the weekend.",

      "Manchester United winger Marcus Rashford is enjoying a career revival at Barcelona.",
      "When he left Aston Villa at the end of last season, Rashford's career was at a crossroads. Yes, his performances at the West Midlands club were improving, but he was still some way off his best, leading to questions over which Rashford we would see the following season.",
      "To Barcelona's credit, they took a gamble despite the warning signs. Now, it seems that gamble is paying off.",
      "Last week saw Rashford grab a brace and an assist in the 6-1 thrashing of Olympiacos. He followed that up with an assist in El Clasico and while Barcelona lost to Real Madrid, it was another milestone on Rashford's journey back to top form. Rashford now has five goals and seven assists for the Catalan club in 13 appearances.",
      "Plenty of United supporters will see Rashford's numbers and wonder whether there is a scenario whereby he returns to Old Trafford. Unfortunately for them, it feels like that is impossible and his recent comments confirm just that.",
      "Speaking before the clash with Real Madrid, Rashford told ESPN: \"It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.\"",
      "Rashford is benefitting from a change of scenery, culture and team. It is not a case that the 27-year-old has suddenly been relieved of all pressure, because United and Barca are comparable on that front.",
      "But in England he was under the spotlight daily and, in a struggling side, he was expected to be the main man. Eyes aren't always on Rashford to be the key man in Barcelona.",
      "United and Rashford will always be linked but that chapter is now closed.",

      "The Manchester United boss made two changes on Saturday to the team that performed so well at Anfield a week earlier. One was enforced as the injured Harry Maguire was replaced by Leny Yoro, while Amorim opted to bring Benjamin Sesko in as the focal point of the attack having moved back to a striker-less system at Liverpool.",
      "The changes did little to halt United's momentum, and the challenge now is to keep the ball rolling and make it four wins in a row against Nottingham Forest this weekend.",
      "Amorim will likely continue with Sesko as the spearhead of the attack, and although the head coach said last week that he hoped to have Maguire back against Forest, it would be unwise to throw him straight back into the XI after a short spell on the sidelines.",
      "Everything points to an unchanged team, but Amorim should consider making at least one alteration.",
      "Diogo Dalot has started all of United's previous four games since returning from injury, seeing out the full 90 minutes in all bar one of those outings.",
      "While Amorim's 3-4-3 system relies on wing-backs who can provide an attacking threat, the United boss knows he can't afford to leave his backline exposed, and so he tends to choose a more attack-minded option on one side with the balance of a more defensive option on the opposite flank.",
      "Dalot has been his go-to defensive option in recent weeks, and while the team have been playing well, Dalot has struggled.",
      "The Portugal international doesn't provide enough quality in the final third when presented with a chance to get forward, and he's also struggled defensively at times. United's winning run has meant his performances have gone somewhat under the radar, and a change is needed before he costs United.",
      "A right-back by trade, it must be acknowledged that Dalot has often been playing out of position on the left, a position Noussair Mazraoui filled in at on multiple occasions last season.",
      "The former Bayern Munich defender has suffered a couple of knocks this term that have limited his playing time, but he has made the last two matchday squads without being introduced from the bench.",
      "He was one of United's most consistent performers in his first season at the club, and while he is unlikely to unpick defences with attacking guile, he will provide the defensive solidity United need, allowing Amad to provide the threat on the opposite side.",

Senne Lammens demonstrated his skills between the posts, while Matheus Cunha kicked off the scoring and Bryan Mbeumo netted a brace in the second half.",
      "Mbeumo, who joined United from Brentford for an initial fee of £65million after scoring 20 goals in the top flight last season, has proven to be a savvy acquisition. However, Amorim will soon have to make do without the Cameroonian forward for at least two matches.",
      "Mbeumo has quickly become a key component of Amorim's attacking strategy, playing to the right of a central striker alongside fellow newcomer Cunha.",
      "With four league goals already under his belt, Mbeumo is showing increasing prowess as he settles into life in Manchester. However, he will soon depart for international duty, representing Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Cameroon have secured their place in the tournament, which kicks off in late December in Morocco. Mbeumo and his national team will begin their group stage campaign on 24 December.",
      "This stage will last until 31 December, meaning Mbeumo could miss at least United's matches against Newcastle and Wolves. If Cameroon progress further, with the final on 18 January, he could be absent for at least three more games, including the Manchester derby on 17 January.",
      "Almost a year has passed since head coach Amorim took the reins at Old Trafford, and it quickly became clear that some of his forward options were not compatible with his system.",

The Manchester United forward, who spent last season at Chelsea, signed for Villa on loan in the summer.",
      "He has endured a difficult start to life at Villa Park, having failed to score or assist in five appearances. After showing glimpses in the Europa League against Go Ahead Eagles last Thursday, there was a hope that Sancho could kick on when Villa faced Manchester City in the Premier League on the weekend.",
      "Even if Sancho had to settle for a place on the bench, he didn't make much of an impact when he came on. Indeed, after coming off as a first-half substitute when Emiliano Buendia limped off, Sancho was taken off before the full-time whistle. In fact, he lasted just 45 minutes before being hooked.",
      "Sancho came on for Buendia in the 29th minute before going off in the 74th minute for Evann Guessand. The England international has since been ridiculed for getting subbed as the substitute, though ex-Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood and Scholes have defended him.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, Sherwood said: \"I like the boy. I think he's got – I don't know him as a person – but I think he's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "Delivering his verdict during Sherwood's assessment of Sancho, Scholes responded: \"Loads of ability.\"",
      "Sherwood then continued: \"He needs to do it on a regular basis. You know, on a consistent basis, and if he does that, I mean, he’s good enough to play, you know, [at an] enormous amount of clubs.\"",

      "\"Before Morgan, Emiliano Buendia and Leon Bailey, they felt the same when I subbed them, but it was not a punishment. And now it's not a punishment.",
      "\"He played 45 minutes, I am so happy because his impact was good, his electricity, his skill, but then to play more than now he's not ready fit to play 90 minutes, 45 minutes is not easy enough for him and I am happy and of course, progressively he's coming better and better.\"",

      "Wayne Rooney's 15-year-old son Kai has shared an update on his recovery from injury after a heartbreaking Manchester United setback earlier this year.",
      "The eldest son of the United legend hopes to emulate his father's incredible career, but he suffered an injury setback, stating: 'Life couldn't get any worse.'",
      "The youngster clearly has his father's passion for the game and has impressed for United's youth sides this season. He caughgt the eye during the Super Cup NI in Northern Ireland earlier this summer, a tournament in which his father also shone as a youngster at Everton.",
      "Kai was in the midst of a meteoric rise, having been called up to United's Under-19s side, where he competed against professionals four-years older than him.",
      "Prior to that call-up, he'd scored an incredible goal for the Under-18s, a left-footed volley that nestled in the top corner, reminiscent of some of his father's brilliant strikes.",
      "Earlier this year, Kai shared an image on social media of his right foot in a boot, but has now updated fans on his recovery.",
      "Taking to Instagram, he shared two photos enjoying some down time in Dubai, with his foot no longer in a protective boot. The youngster captioned the pictures: \"Recovering\" followed by an emjoi shrowded in smoke.",
      "It's still unclear the exact nature of his injury, though the images suggest a return to action may not be too far away.",
      "The youngster tends to operate in a central attacking role, like his father Wayne, but can also play on either side of the attack.",
      "When asked about his son's football, in an interview with BBC Sport, Rooney said: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist. So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing.",
      "\"I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",
      "Rooney also praised the coaching staff at United, stating: \"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand off approach. I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it - that's the main thing for me.\"",
      "Rooney's eldest son has been a part of the United academy since he was 11-years-old after joining the youth set up in 2020.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly ready to stop some players from leaving the club during the January transfer window.",
      "One of the new signings that United made in the summer was Bryan Mbeumo, who has since scored five goals after his move from Brentford. However, it won't be too long before United won't have the forward at their disposal.",
      "Mbeumo is expected to be named in the Cameroon squad for the Africa Cup of Nations, which will take place across December and January. If selected, the 26-year-old will not be available for United during Cameroon's involvement in the tournament and could miss several club fixtures.",
      "Because of this, The Sun is reporting that United have decided against letting some players leave the club in January. Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo are two players who have been linked with moves away from United during the winter window.",
      "As reported over the weekend, Zirkzee is set to request a transfer away from United in the upcoming window, with West Ham United leading the race to provide the Dutch international an exit route from his Old Trafford woes. The 24-year-old managed to net just seven goals in 49 appearances across all competitions last season.",
      "This season, he has featured only four times, with his most recent league goal for United dating back to December, 10 months ago. While Mainoo has also been linked with a midseason move away from the Reds.",
      "But the report The Sun claims that in the event that either player does express a desire to leave Old Trafford, United will not allow them to leave the club in the New Year.",
      "Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui could also link up with their countries to compete at the Africa Cup of Nations, meaning they would also be unavailable for United for several weeks.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The relief around Old Trafford was obvious when Matheus Cunha opened the scoring for Manchester United against Brighton.",
      "Not only had the Reds made their dominance count but Cunha had broken his duck. The Brazilian did well to open his body up and slot the ball out of the reach of Bart Verbruggen.",
      "Cunha continued to play an important role for United in the victory and deservedly mopped up the plaudits, even if his teammate Bryan Mbeumo stole the back pages. It was only after the match though that Cunha proved why he was the perfect signing for United.",
      "\"It is hard to say something now,\" a smiling Cunha admitted. \"I have worked so hard for this.",
      "\"This is the club and this performance needs to be common and normal. I feel so good to be part of this.",
      "\"My first goal here at Old Trafford, I dreamed a lot of this but of course the win is much more important. I joked with Bryan [Mbeumo] and [Benjamin] Sesko, I told them I need to have this feeling [scoring], I felt so anxious to be a part of this and when I scored they said 'look, you can enjoy it now'.",
      "\"All the day the support for my teammates, I feel so good to be part of this.\"",
      "Every player is happy after scoring, particularly their first for a new club, but it's clear just how delighted Cunha was after the Brighton win, admitting he had dreamt of that moment.",
      "Ruben Amorim needs players with character, and in Cunha he certainly has that. Every player who pulls on a United shirt should recognise just how privileged they are to play for one of the biggest clubs in the world, and it's clearly not something Cunha takes for granted.",
      "Let's not forget, Cunha could have moved elsewhere. Plenty of big clubs wanted him, but for him, it was always United.",
      "Despite their recent struggles, United remain one of the biggest clubs in the world, and Cunha knows it.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho showed his true colours after being substituted during Chelsea's 2-1 defeat to Sunderland at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The former Manchester United winger was visibly frustrated when Enzo Maresca replaced him with Estevao in the 58th minute. After scoring the opening goal inside four minutes, Garnacho believed he had more to offer before Chelsea went on to lose 2-1.",
      "Maresca's decision sparked backlash from Chelsea fans on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).",
      "One said: \"Garnacho was probably the only attacker having a decent game … so of course he’s the first one Maresca subs off. No wonder he was shaking his head,\" while another posted: \"Maresca taking out the attacker who was most likely to score today in Garnacho was not the move.\"",
      "A third continued: \"Maresca makes terrible substitutions. Why take off Garnacho so early?\"",
      "Garnacho celebrated his goal by sitting on the advertising hoarding, joined by team-mate Pedro Neto. The moment served as a reminder for United fans - a similar celebration took place during their win over West Ham in February 2024 when Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund struck the same pose.",
      "At the time, the trio were seen as the future of United. But Garnacho later completed the £40million move to Stamford Bridge while Hojlund is also expected to leave Old Trafford, having shown positive signs following a loan move to Napoli.",
      "Before his switch to west London, Garnacho found himself in United's so-called 'bomb squad' - sidelined during pre-season as Ruben Amorim eyed an overhaul that included moving him on alongside several teammates.",
      "As for Chelsea, their run of four straight wins in all competitions came to a dramatic halt as Sunderland's Chemsdine Talbi struck a stoppage-time winner at Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I think in general we were not good enough,\" said Maresca afterwards. \"When you are not good enough in the Premier League we know that the consequences can be bad.",
      "\"I have said many times, when you are not able to win it is important you do not lose.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo admits \"it hasn't been easy\" for Manchester United's new-look attack in the early stages of the season but insists the connection between himself, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko is starting to develop.",
      "Mbeumo scored twice on Saturday as United made it three wins in a row. United took a 2-0 lead into half-time and looked home and hosed when Mbeumo made it 3-0 after the break. However, a nervy finish was in store after Danny Welbeck's free kick and Charalampos Kostoulas' header in added time.",
      "Mbeumo stepped up to seal the victory late in the game, meaning he now has five goals since his move to United. Cunha's strike was just his first for the club and Mbeumo admitted it was a relief for the Brazilian to get off the mark. \"Yeah, of course the pressure is off his shoulders today with the goal, he was waiting for it and we were waiting for it as well,\" he explained.",
      "\"We are very happy for him. We are growing the link-ups between each other [himself, Sesko and Cunha].",
      "\"It hasn’t been easy obviously because we all came this year and we tried to make the connections in training. It hasn’t been easy coming into this environment, a big club, the expectations are not easy to handle but with the teammates, everyone is helping me, helping the team, helping the new players and I think that was very important.\"",
      "When asked whether he could match the 20 goals he scored in the last campaign, Mbeumo said: \"I always try to aim big in everything that I do. I try not to set limits on myself and on what I can reach. I am just going to work on that as much as possible.",
      "United's win moved them up to fourth and Mbeumo is optimistic for the future. \"Everyone wants to fight for as high as possible,\" he said.",

      "Carlos Baleba joked that he was 'coming to Old Trafford' on social media prior to Manchester United's 4-2 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "While the post was deleted, the impact of it perhaps lingered as the Cameroonian's hour at Old Trafford played out. At 21, there is plenty of room for improvement but that possible United transfer will need to be put on hold for now.",
      "Baleba was the player United fans had their eye on in the opposition ranks but he struggled. Bryan Mbeumo gave him a torrid time and when the midfielder unleashed a wayward shot in the second half, Fabian Hurzeler knew it was time to make a change.",
      "With Baleba not being the £100m man that Brighton hoped he would be at Old Trafford, his exit allowed another player to catch the eye in the form of Yankuba Minteh. When the 21-year-old left Newcastle in 2024, eyebrows were raised considering he had only been at St James' Park for a year.",
      "During that 12 months he was loaned to Feyenoord so Newcastle supporters did not get to see his potential. Eddie Howe may have been kicking himself had he watched Minteh's display at Old Trafford.",
      "He showed what he could do early in the first half as he turned the normally unflappable Leny Yoro inside out, before just running out of room. However, he continued to be positive and direct, proving to be the main source of all that was good about Brighton's play.",
      "In the second half, he switched to the right-hand side but was no less effective, providing a stern test for Ayden Heaven. When he broke down the middle, Patrick Dorgu was in trouble and was very fortunate to see the winger take a slightly heavy touch.",
      "Minteh and Danny Welbeck were arguably the two Brighton players who did not deserve to be on the losing side at Old Trafford.",
      "Would Minteh fit into the United system? Potentially. He is young and you could see him playing a similar role to Amad or Mbeumo.",
      "Should United pay £100m for him? Almost certainly not, especially as that position is well stocked at present and it may not take that much to sign Minteh anyway. But the winger showed Baleba the level you need to be at to earn that United move.",
      "Yes, one is a forward and the other a defensive midfielder, but Minteh played with the freedom that his teammate did not.",
      "Instead of being overawed by the occasion, Minteh relished it, and United would not go wrong looking at him in the future.",

      "The wing-back seemed to be clipped by Maxim De Cuyper, but referee Anthony Taylor was quick to wave away any claims for a spot-kick. A statement from the Premier League Match Centre account on X read: \"The referee’s call of no penalty to Manchester United was checked and confirmed by VAR – with it deemed that De Cuyper played the ball.\"",
      "In the aftermath of the game, both Gallagher and Bothroyd debated a host of controversial refereeing decisions, including Amad's incident. However, they were unable to reach an agreement.",
      "Bothroyd said: “This is a definite penalty for me. Amad Diallo is running into the box. There is the slightest touch.",
      "“The defender, he puts his leg out, so obviously he has made contact. He touched the ball slightly, but that contact, has stopped Amad getting to the ball.",
      "“So whether he has touched the ball or not, and it’s a miniscule that he has touched that, because the ball is basically travelling in the same direction, he has stopped Amad getting to that. That’s why I would say that is a penalty.",
      "“It’s the same as [Viktor] Gyokeres, again the smallest touch. These touches are not enough to say, ‘Oh he has touched the ball. It can’t be a penalty,’ because players can still get back to the ball. That’s why I would say the Amad one is a penalty.”",
      "Gallagher, who spent over 15 years refereeing at the top level, disagreed with Bothroyd and pointed to previous incidents as to why the decision was made.",
      "He said: “It’s interesting we have seen Gyokeres with Pope, we saw Saka with Kevin and we’ve seen this one, they’ve been consistent - if they get a touch on the ball, they are not going to give a penalty, they’ve done it for week six, week eight and week nine.\"",
      "Bothroyd then replied: “But they did not do it for week five when Sanchez touched the ball and Mbeumo goes through. So they’ve changed the rule after week five is basically what you are saying.",
      "Gallagher then said: “I didn’t say that at all. I said since the Gyokeres one where they came out and said, ‘He’s got a touch on the ball.’ In this situation, they have been consistent, as you’ve asked for, and they haven’t given any of them.”",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",

      "A pundit has explained why Manchester United should avoid signing Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton, with it argued that the Red Devils “don’t need” him.",
      "Wharton has emerged as one of the best young midfielders in the Premier League and it’s been suggested that he is a possible signing for Man Utd next year.",
      "In the summer, the Red Devils were focused on overhauling their attack as they signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they also landed Senne Lammens to be their new No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "Man Utd’s next transfer priority will be to sign a new centre-midfielder as they require an upgrade on Casemiro and it’s been suggested that Wharton could cost as little as £60m next year, though Palace will likely demand nearer to £100m.",
      "Wharton has immense natural ability and could play for any team in the world, though ex-Man Utd player Paul Parker reckons his former club “doesn’t need” him because he’s injury-prone.",
      "“Adam Wharton looks good. Everything he does, I like him,” Parker told MyBettingSites.",
      "READ: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",
      "“Playing for a progressive side at the moment. A lot of injuries. Always has something, but it doesn’t seem to bother a lot of clubs who keep on paying money.",
      "“At the moment, United don’t need a player like him who cannot play two-three games without picking up a knock.",
      "“Adam Wharton has done great. Came from Blackburn, hit the ground running. Why didn’t anyone else get him? You’ve got to pat Crystal Palace on the back for that, for the money they spent and how he’s performed.",
      "“Big clubs would rather spend even more money on players whose shirts they can sell. I’m sure Adam Wharton would have loved to come to Man Utd.”",
      "Parker has also explained why he thinks Crystal Palace will refuse to sell Wharton in January.",
      "“But if you’re Crystal Palace, you don’t sell,” Parker added.",
      "“Unless it’s really, really stupid money and the fans can relate to it. They’ll look at the profit margin and go wow.",
      "“The way they are, Crystal Palace, at the moment, they could fill that berth and no one would notice because no one has noticed that they’ve lost two of their best players in the last three seasons, in Eze and Olise.”",
      "England international Elliot Anderson has been mentioned as an alternative, with Parker arguing that Man Utd have a greater chance of signing him than Wharton in January.",
      "“Eliott Anderson has done well at Nottingham and he’s now being pushed as a starter for England but that’s because you don’t have Jude Bellingham to talk about,” Parker claimed.",
      "“So everyone would talk about Anderson because now he’s an England international and his name is popping up. Man Utd need a player with discipline and good legs in that midfield.",
      "“Nottingham Forest are in that position now. With Nuno gone and how things have changed, anything can happen in January.”",

      "READ: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",

      "While Harry Maguire’s revival has been built on moments, Casemiro has plugged away to make a mockery of the criticism from Liverpool-leaning pundits and Man Utd’s actual owner…",
      "When it was written that Manchester United’s refusal to buy a midfielder in the summer offered a chance to one of their current engine room operatives to step up, we were right. We just picked the wrong one.",
      "And when it was said that Ruben Amorim’s players, in their bid to make United credible again, have the template to follow in one of their renaissance men, we were also right. Again, though, we may have fingered the wrong fella.",
      "Amorim believes that shining example is coming not from Harry Maguire, but a star similarly maligned. “The other guys need to look at Casemiro,” said the boss after the Brazilian presented more evidence to suggest that he is once again one of United’s most important players.",
      "Look at the difference between United pre and post Casemiro’s withdrawal against Brighton. With the veteran midfielder, Amorim’s men were in control against a side more used to winning at Old Trafford than United of late. At 3-0 up with three-quarters of the game gone, Amorim thought it wise to give the Brazil star a break for the last 20-plus minutes.",
      "It is not often Amorim has been in such a privileged position so we can forgive him for fumbling this particular decision. Because removing Casemiro might have allowed the 33-year-old a breather, but it also breathed new life into Brighton, who had significantly less trouble playing around and through a midfield of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "It is not necessarily their fault. We are learning that Fernandes can play deeper as long as he has Casemiro to hold his hand. Mainoo has only partnered Casemiro for a half or longer once in the last 11 months since United beat Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "Regardless, the contrast with and without Casemiro was stark enough to recognise the importance of the Brazilian. But if you prefer to trust numbers over your eyes, here you go…",

      "Man United without Casemiro on the pitch: 16 goals conceded",
      "Impact. pic.twitter.com/byjTwd7WbU",
      "As comebacks go, Casemiro’s is certainly up there with Harry Maguire’s. In the context of Jamie Carragher’s criticism, it might rival Jesus Christ’s.",
      "“There was a saying I always remember as a footballer, ‘leave the football before the football leaves you’. The football has left him at this top level he needs to call it a day at this level of football and move”.",
      "Carragher went in two-footed on Casemiro 18 months ago, back in May 2024 after a calamitous display at centre-back, but the pundit was certainly no lone voice, even if his tone prompted more than the odd wince.",
      "No question, Casemiro’s second season at Old Trafford was poor. He told Ed Woodward that he would ‘fix’ United when he signed from Real Madrid and his first year suggested he was serious. What happened, though, in the summer of 2023, perhaps one day we’ll find out, because Casemiro returned for season two hungover or haunted from his lay-off. Possibly both.",
      "By any measure or metric, his form plummeted and the serial winner, as one of the Premier League’s highest-paid players, became one of the poster boys for United’s decade-long decline.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe even namechecked Casemiro in March – not for the first time – when discussing players recruited in the past who were ‘overpaid’ and ‘not good enough’ for Manchester United.",
      "Being bunched with Antony, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana must have been a humbling experience for Casemiro, a five-time Champions League winner. Indeed, his performances suggest he took it personally. Unlike some targets for criticism at Old Trafford in recent years, and others who were on the fringes in the early days of Amorim’s reign, Casemiro focused his energy on proving his doubters wrong and himself worthy of his wage.",
      "As Amorim got his feet under the table and assessed which characters he could trust, Casemiro’s role became more prominent. He played a major role in taking United to Bilbao for the Europa League final, but while fattening himself up for the summer market, in Ratcliffe’s eyes at least, he also became one of his manager’s most-trusted lieutenants. When those in the United boardroom would have piggy-backed him to anywhere they might find a club who would take his salary off their books, Amorim was reluctant to lose an ally.",
      "It benefits Casemiro that United have a shamefully light schedule this season. Even so, Amorim is at pains to rest him when he thinks he can get away with it.",
      "MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n🔴 Amorim ecstatic to be proved wrong by one player after incredible Manchester United first\n⚪ Ferdinand slams Carragher over ‘disrespect’ of Man Utd star \n⚫ Gary Neville reveals next ‘big job’ for Ruben Amorim after his ‘best week’ at Man Utd",
      "Casemiro has started all but two of the games for which he has been available – the two missed: a derby humping and Grimsby-gate – and is now one of the first names on Amorim’s team-sheet, a fact all the more remarkable in the wake of the manager’s admission on Saturday.",
      "“In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby Collyer,” who is currently struggling for starts at West Brom. “But he fought and he worked, and now he’s back in the national team. He’s so important for us.”",
      "No doubt it helps that Amorim has now got Casemiro surrounded by team-mates willing to run and carry out the manager’s game plan. The front three, especially Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha, can be trusted to fill the holes at the top of United’s midfield, and the centre-backs appear to be learning how and when to step in around Casemiro and Fernandes to make a trio when required.",
      "Such a framework, woefully absent for much of Casemiro’s career at Old Trafford, facilitates the kind of performance that saw Casemiro outshine Carlos Baleba, the £100million man the Red Devils were supposedly so keen on. It is said that they now have ‘serious doubts’ about him, but the hunt for a midfielder will become considerably more urgent next summer when Casemiro’s contract is up.",
      "Of course, United would only trigger the option they have to extend Casemiro’s massive contract for another year over Ratcliffe’s cold, dead body. Should he go free, then he might follow Carragher’s advice to ‘go to the MLS or Saudi’, taking ‘the football’ and a restored reputation with him.",
      "Arsenal are ‘boring’. And complete hypocrites, too. They should wear both those insults like badges of honour while Mikel Arteta fondles his set-pieces.",

      "Manchester United are not back *yet*, but they are on track as they are making the right steps regarding their next marquee signing…",
      "It has been a pretty great couple of weeks for Man Utd, with the first back-to-back Premier League wins under Ruben Amorim becoming three straight victories over the weekend.",
      "Credit should go to Amorim as he has made slight tweaks to his approach to make his system more effective and this has borne fruit against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Amorim is far from out of the woods, but for the first time in his tenure, it feels like the Red Devils are on an upward curve and can mount a sustained push for Champions League qualification this term.",
      "This is largely down to Man Utd bucking a long-term trend by having a very successful transfer window with a near-perfect hit rate.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Sunderland, Nuno, Arsenal, Wolves, Brentford, Liverpool and more",
      "Summer signings Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have forced a U-turn on the transfer debate as winners Man Utd actually had a better window than losers Liverpool.",
      "All four players have settled nicely in recent weeks and have made a great impact on their winning run, while Man Utd also did a good job at offloading unwanted talents on their terms.",
      "Still, Man Utd’s summer transfer window was not perfect as they failed to sign a quality No.6.",
      "The Red Devils did try to sign one as they pursued an audacious deal for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, though they opted against signing an alternative after being priced out of a £100m-plus transfer.",
      "Without Baleba or another No.6, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro have started together in most of Man Utd’s games and although the Brazilian’s revival has been outstanding, Amorim’s side remain far too easy to play through even in the games they have won.",
      "So if Man Utd are to truly be back under Amorim, an upgrade on Casemiro needs to be their next marquee signing, and this looks increasingly likely to be the case.",
      "But this does not mean necessarily mean Baleba.",
      "A report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Man Utd have ‘serious doubts’ about a ‘record’ deal for Baleba as he is ‘not yet worth breaking the bank for’.",
      "And these concerns are justified as Baleba is far from the final product and there are issues surrounding his mentality; his performances have clearly been impacted by transfer speculation this season.",
      "The report claims Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are ’emerging as names of interest’ and these two would be cheaper than Baleba, while also potentially being better fits for the No.6 role at Old Trafford.",
      "And a contract ‘decision’ is another positive sign for Man Utd, with Football Insider claiming they ‘are not planning to trigger the extension option’ in Casemiro’s deal to extend his deal to 2027 on the same terms.",
      "Although Casemiro’s performances this season have been stronger than in 2024/25, he remains a weak link in Man Utd’s side and his reported £375,000-a-week contract cannot be justified at this stage of his career.",
      "Casemiro could stay at Man Utd by accepting a sizable pay cut, but this feels pretty unlikely with Saudi Pro League sides ‘tracking’ the veteran midfielder. Signing Wharton or Anderson to replace him will be a necessary upgrade in a key department to take the club to the next level under Amorim.",
      "Who could have foreseen Casemiro outshining Carlos Beleba while reasserting himself as one of Man Utd’s most important players? Not Carragher or Ratcliffe…",
      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba has quickly deleted a cheeky social media post that added fuel to speculation linking him with a move to Manchester United.",

      "Having looked destined for the sack after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford a month ago, three Premier League wins on the bounce has given Amorim some breathing space at Old Trafford with United now fifth in the table.",
      "And with praise being readily afforded to summer signing Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens in recent weeks, Ferdinand hailed Casemiro for his rejuvenation this term.",
      "“Casemiro’s game is not about chasing high up the pitch constantly,” the former United defender said on Rio Ferdinand Presents.",
      "“He built a stellar career on the back of being the glue, the person that knitted the back line and the midfield together and just plug the gaps. He wasn’t asked to run all over the place or be a creator. He was asked to get it and give it to the people that can create.",
      "“He might have scored the odd goal here and there when he went a bit loose, but he was the one who was mopping up and doing all the dirty work and being able to stay in an area and marshal that area.",
      "“Recently, this is what we’ve seen. He’s looked something like the old Casemiro.”",
      "Casemiro impressed in his first season for United after making his £70m move from Real Madrid, but two poor seasons followed for the Brazilian, who has been heavily linked with the Old Trafford exit throughout that inauspicious spell.",

      "“Leave the football, before the football leaves you,” he said. “The football has left him at this top level. He has to call it a day at this level of football and move.”",
      "But of the 16 goals United have conceded this season, just three of them have come with Casemiro on the pitch, and Ferdinand has used this evidence of his revival to aim a jab at Carragher.",
      "“It takes me back to what was said by Jamie Carragher about, ‘leave the football’,” Ferdinand continued.",
      "“I said at the time, I thought it was highly disrespectful when you’re talking about a five-time Champions League winner who’s going through a change in approach to football, going through a time where he looked out of sorts.",
      "“Players lose confidence, they lose form, sometimes players’ legs go, but I think the call was too early and I thought it was highly disrespectful for someone who’s achieved so much in the game.",
      "“Sometimes you’ve got to look beyond just trying to find an individual. We’re very fond of finding a scapegoat. Sometimes you got to look at the way a team is playing and work out is that impacting a player negatively or is it actually the player who’s gone?",
      "“I think by looking at the way that the system’s changed a little bit and been tweaked, you’re seeing the benefits for someone like Casemiro.",
      "“Amorim spoke glowingly about him, about his character, his resilience. You don’t win five Champions Leagues without those two aspects in your makeup.",
      "“Now he’s the reference point for any player that’s going through a hard time at this football club.”",

      "Vinicius Junior muttered “I’m leaving the team” having failed to hide his frustration at being substituted in El Clasico and reports on Monday suggest he is ‘seriously considering’ an exit owing the lack of ‘respect’ afforded to him by manager Xabi Alonso. But where could he go? There’s just one option.",
      "Vinicius has helped Madrid win 14 trophies since his arrival in 2018, including three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues, playing a starring role in many of those triumphs. But the 2024 Ballon d’Or runner-up’s frustrations – which have been bubbling under the surface for weeks at the Bernabeu – came to the surface as he stormed off the pitch on Sunday.",
      "After starting on the bench for Madrid’s previous league clash with Getafe, Vinicius was recalled to Alonso’s XI as goals from Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham sealed Madrid a 2-1 win over their bitter rivals, but was withdrawn in the 72nd minute by Alonso and made it abundantly clear what he thought of his manager’s decision.",
      "“Me? Me? Mister, mister! Me?” Vinicius was heard shouting at Alonso as his No.7 appeared on the fourth official’s board.",
      "The 25-year-old has played the full 90 minutes in just three of Madrid’s 12 games in all competitions this season and before making his way straight down the tunnel, he’s alleged to have muttered: “Always me! I’m Leaving the team! I’m leaving, I’d better go!”",
      "And according to AS, ‘the option of leaving’ is now ‘being seriously considered’ by Vinicius, who believes Alonso ‘doesn’t like him’ and that his ‘status isn’t respected’ by the Spaniard, with the growing rift between the pair a ‘massive problem’ for the club.",
      "Alonso looked to pacify the situation after the game, saying: “I’m taking away many positive things from Vini’s game and I don’t want to lose focus on what’s important.",
      "“He contributed a lot. It’s an important victory, a deserved one. Regaining the feeling of a competitive team in big games is important. All coaches know there are different personalities.",
      "“Now we’ll enjoy it, and when the time comes we’ll talk about these things in the changing room, of course.”",
      "The report adds that the Madrid hierarchy are prepared to back any decision Alonso makes with regard to Vinicius’ future having been far from impressed by the winger’s reaction to being subbed.",
      "And with it suggested last month that Vinicius may seek a January exit having been benched for Madrid’s Champions League opener, we can only assume his resolve to seek pastures new has gathered strength after this latest perceived snub.",
      "But the question Vinicius and his representatives must now be asking is which clubs in world football could offer the £150m likely required to sign him, at least match his £350,000-per-week wages and be comfortable with the reality of him having to be the man at their club for fear of him throwing a hissy fit if that’s not the case. And there’s nowhere to go for him but Saudi Arabia.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain used to be a landing spot for the star misfits of other European giants, but they’ve become a serious football team of late.",
      "Liverpool made several Galactico signings in the summer, but to their cost so far this season, and we can’t see Arne Slot welcoming such a character into his dressing room.",
      "MORE REAL MADRID COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Raphinha hits out at Barcelona team-mate Yamal for giving Real Madrid ‘extra motivation’ in El Clasico\n👉 Jude Bellingham aims savage three-word dig at Lamine Yamal after El Clasico bust-up\n👉 The ridiculous records of Kylian Mbappe, including his 23 career hat-tricks",
      "If anyone could get a handle on Vinicius, it might just be Pep Guardiola, but Manchester City haven’t typically chased players of such repute, other than Erling Haaland, who joined for the relatively meagre prices they’re used to paying for their recruits.",
      "Arsenal may still be after a left-wing upgrade, but much as we would enjoy his clash with Arteta, theirs is a boat that doesn’t need rocking.",
      "Manchester United aren’t in a position to attract a player of Vinicius’ quality even if they wanted to, and we can’t imagine they do at a point where Ruben Amorim looks finally to have his squad pulling together as one.",
      "There’s very little chance of Chelsea paying that much for a player who is on the brink of being too old for them anyway at 25, and even less chance of Vinicius joining a club where the chances of the most major trophies look slim in the short-term.",
      "And given there is no European club other than PSG outside the Premier League with the wherewithal to pay Real Madrid and Vinicius what’s required to sign him, even assuming they had the desire, if we were his advisors, and weren’t the money-grabbing so-and-sos we suspect they are, we would urge him to mend bridges which are currently singed at a club from which he has no better, or even remotely comparable, place to go, before he burns them beyond repair.",
      "According to reports, Vinicius Junior ‘could leave’ Real Madrid after clashing with head coach Xabi Alonso as their “relationship is broken’.",
      "Real Madrid are reportedly willing to sacrifice any player, except Kylian Mbappe, to land Juventus forward Kenan Yildiz. So, Vinicius Jr to Man Utd then?",

      "According to reports, Manchester City have finally ‘convinced’ a Real Madrid star to leave and join Pep Guardiola’s side in a ‘radical’ U-turn.",
      "Real Madrid are ready to let Vinicius Junior leave the club on a free transfer amid interest from Arsenal and Liverpool, according to reports.",

      "But for the first time since he joined, Manchester United scored four times in a Premier League game without Fernandes being credited with either a goal or an assist.",

      "The time has come to stop viewing Sunderland through the prism of a newly promoted team. It underlines their immediately acclimatised brilliance to compare their results and performances to those who have come up from the Championship in recent years, but also does them a massive disservice and puts a natural ceiling on what they can achieve.",
      "This is, for all intents and purposes, a ready-made and proven Premier League side. They have remarkable depth – only four clubs have used more players so far – and can win games in a variety of ways.",
      "If they don’t catch you from a corner or a counter, Granit Xhaka will find an alternative route through or Wilson Isidor will exploit the space in behind.",
      "Regis Le Bris is fully subscribed to the power of long throws and set-pieces, but Sunderland have also scored more goals in open play than Arsenal and Newcastle, with just Arsenal, Brighton, Chelsea, Liverpool and Spurs boasting more different scorers. They have won matches with 54% and 32% possession.",
      "No club has gained more points from losing positions than a Sunderland side which has dropped none when winning. Sure, they have already passed the tallies of the last two teams to come up and finish bottom, but the Black Cats also have more points than Leicester did at this stage in 2015/16.",
      "They probably won’t win their seventh English top-flight title this season, but that qualifier being necessary for Sunderland about four years after they were in the midst of a losing run against Charlton, Rotherham and Sheffield Wednesday in League One, when Le Bris was managing a French club’s B team and waiting for his first post at a senior level, is astonishing.",
      "",
      "It would have been a phenomenal weekend had they not even played, with Liverpool and Manchester City both falling to obstacles of a similar size and difficulty to facing Crystal Palace at home.",
      "Mikel Arteta told his players he “valued more this victory than any other victory this season because we knew the difficulty of it”. Palace are an obdurate opponent but at the end of an eight-day stretch in which they also faced Fulham away and Atletico Madrid at home, it was a substantial test of their mental strength and credentials.",
      "Arsenal did not concede a single goal in those games. Their majesty is built not on set-piece mastery but unmatched defensive excellence. They have kept five consecutive clean sheets and faced at least 13 fewer shots than any other team.",
      "Had Arsenal automatically conceded every shot on target they had allowed this season they would still be in the top half of the table with 13 points, while occupying a seeded Champions League knockout phase place. David Raya is more libero than goalkeeper at this point.",
      "Only four clubs in the entire history of the Premier League have conceded fewer than three goals after nine games – and that Chelsea 2005/06 side is not actually among them. A ludicrous record is in genuine jeopardy.",
      "",
      "Perhaps Arsenal won’t replace Mikel Arteta with Nicolas Jover, and Aston Villa might not promote Austin MacPhee to Unai Emery’s seat in the dugout. But the appointment of Keith Andrews as Brentford manager ahead of the season of the long throws seems like remarkable prescience.",
      "That is not to denigrate an entirely deserved win over the champions. As with Arsenal, the Brentford set-piece approach only works when underpinned by energy, bravery and clarity. It is designed to complement their quality rather than define it.",

      "As Andy Robertson said, “you can’t come to Brentford away and just expect to play them off the park because they’re always going to be ready to fight”. But they can absolutely play too. You might say they are as adept at floating like a butterfly as they are stinging like the Bees if you were so inclined.",

Besides, this Arsenal side do also play some very easy on the eye football.",

Sure, Liverpool seem to have messed it up and City are hardly flying (although if they are in touching distance come Christmas then watch out), but Arsenal were and are the least bad (realistic) option from a United perspective.\nJack (Very quickly falling in love with Mbeumo) Manchester",

      "Defeating two of your bogey teams in the same week is certainly good cause for getting excited. Dispelling the hoodoo of not winning at Anfield for 10 years then getting a win against a team that we’d lost 6 of the last 7 to has rightly given United fans and hopefully the team a nice lift. However, as a fairly staunch Amorim advocate I think we need to hold off on the ‘we told you so’ rhetoric to those who wanted him sacked.",
      "Firstly, it not like they didn’t have good reason. The team have been awful at times and Amorim is certainly accountable for a portion of that. Given the last year’s worth of evidence thinking a change of manager is needed wasn’t an unreasonable position to take. Also, United still haven’t won a game in the way the manager ideally wants so it’s difficult to point at these results and say ‘look how well it’s working’.",
      "Against Liverpool we had significantly less possession. Against Brighton 70% of the shots were on target. Across both games we ended up scoring 6 goals from an xG of about 2.6. There was definitely an element of making the most of the chances we created and setting up to counter the opponent, both of which won’t work every time.",
      "Having said that the underlying attacking numbers for this season are really positive. 1st for shots on target, 2nd for total shots attempted, and 3rd for shots in the box. 14 non penalty goals from a non penalty xG of 14.3 shows we’re performing as expected and this is backed up by a shot conversion rate of 45% and goal conversion of 11% both of which are fairly average and thus hopefully sustainable.",
      "The defending numbers still show plenty of room for improvement. Being 15th for goals conceded and 16th for xG conceded looks worrying but this is somewhat distorted by having played both City and Liverpool away from home (accounting for about 40% of that xGc total). Sitting 7th for total shots conceded is probably a more reliable indicator for our defensive performance so far which is probably about where we’ll end up.",
      "Whilst the team have looked better in the last few weeks the style of play hasn’t changed significantly all season. Amorim may have decided to be a little more pragmatic and more training times seem to be helping but a lot of the improvement in attack has come from buying significantly better attackers. There still isn’t a settled effective system for winning games and the only win achieved whilst dominating possession was against Burnley which ended up too close for comfort anyway.",
      "I’m cautiously optimistic for the rest of this season and looking ahead to the next. Stats, performance, and confidence are all trending upwards, albeit slowly. Yet don’t be despondent if we look awful again in the next game, that’s what it will be like for a while yet, patchy and inconsistent. With a few more points some good will in the bank it will be interesting to see over the next set of games if Amorim returns to his high possession model or sticks with a more opponent specific approach.\nDave, Manchester (4 more wins by Christmas and I’m happy)",

      "My point is simply this: that’s not the rule right? Just because you touch the ball, you do not have carte blanche to kick a player? In the Amad case, sure maybe the defender touched the ball but he didn’t change the path and Amad is now past him with a shot on goal, if not being taken out completely.

      "United may have only finished three points worse off than their title-winning season in 2000/01, but it dropped them to a previously unthinkable third place. Third! Never before in the Premier League era had United suffered such indignity, and to do it the season after Ferguson had rowed back on his first retirement decision as well.",
      "Not only that, but United managed to make a pig’s ear of everything that season, going potless for the first time in four campaigns. They went out of the League Cup early to Arsenal, didn’t get past the fourth round of the FA Cup and even the saving grace of a run to the Champions League semi-finals ended in the painful ‘what if?’ of away-goals defeat to Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "United’s league season fell apart in an autumn run of five defeats in seven games, three of them in a row against Arsenal, Chelsea and West Ham. They only lost three more games after that, but the damage was done.",
      "One of those three defeats was the crowning turd in the bowl, though, as Arsenal sealed the title with a 1-0 win at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Antonio Conte took the Premier League by storm in 2016/17, marching to the title in his maiden season in charge while making a back-three fashionable again. The Blues earned 93 points, seven clear of Tottenham and 15 more than any team that posed a theoretical threat of actually winning the thing.",
      "The novelty of the back-three soon wore off the following season, though, with Chelsea’s opponents having sussed them out, all the while Conte’s players themselves seemed bored by it all as his squad suffered from the desperately short attention span that is customary at Stamford Bridge. Conte spent much of the season in a funk after not getting his way in the transfer market, which is out of character, isn’t it?",
      "At least the FA Cup sprinkled some glitter on a turd of a season, while Chelsea could also console themselves that it was way less bad than their previous title defence. Chelsea’s run of first, tenth, first, fifth between 2014/15 and 2017/18 really should be studied in great detail and punishing length.",

It was a success built by Dalglish, funded by Jack Walker’s millions, with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton’s goals doing most of the heavy lifting. Rovers led from the front, relinquishing top spot for only a couple of games from the start of November, even if they did their best to hand the title to United during the run-in.",
      "But they could not sustain it. Rovers, reeling from the resignation of Dalglish as manager, finished a distant seventh the following season while winning just one of their Champions League fixtures in a European campaign that is best remembered for David Batty and Graeme Le Saux coming to blows in Moscow. Kicked off the season by losing the Charity Shield to Everton in a game we just had to look up, it having been completely erased from memory, and were also bundled out of the FA Cup in the third round.",

      "Jurgen Klopp’s Reds finally ended their 30-year title drought in stunning fashion, overcoming a pandemic and 103-day period between their 29th and 30th matches to gather a club-record 99 points, sealing their 19th championship with seven games to spare – beating the previous best by two matches.",
      "While there are mischief-makers who like to pretend this season comes with an asterisk, we should all really be grateful that the absurd armies of Premier League football fans who see conspiracy and subterfuge everywhere have so little to go at in that interrupted season. Liverpool had it nailed down long before the pandemic shut the country down.",
      "Not the biggest thing about the pandemic, sure, but imagine the nonsense we’d all have had to put up with had it happened during one of the daft title races where Liverpool narrowly missed out to City.",
      "But they couldn’t maintain their stunning form after ending that title drought. The Reds were breaking all the wrong records the following season, with a 1-0 loss to Fulham being their sixth consecutive home defeat – their worst run ever. But Klopp’s beleaguered side rediscovered some grit, if not necessarily their best form, to win eight of their last 10 matches and sneak a Champions League place while all around them floundered.",
      "Mitigation abounded in the form of injuries to key players and the perhaps inevitable release and relief of finally scratching that 30-year itch. Getting close to that 99-point tally again was always asking a lot, but 70 shouldn’t have been unreasonable.",

      "Seems harsh to put this so high and close to the genuinely catastrophic attempts at defending a Premier League title.",
      "But we’re also in victims-of-own-success territory here, and while it may seem harsh to judge City differently it’s also unavoidable. Guardiola’s consistency means he is alongside Fergie as the only Premier League manager who doesn’t get the mitigation that everyone else gets; that defending a Premier League title is really bloody hard.",
      "If you go around making that really difficult task look as straightforward as those two did, then it’s going to be so much more jarring when it does all go to sh*t for a season.",
      "Even now, only a year on, it’s easy to forget just how vast and unshakeable the aura around Pep’s City was. The absolute certainty everyone felt that no matter how awkward a position they might get into during the first half of the season, they would simply steamroller everyone in the second half.",
      "That’s what an unprecedented four straight English league titles does to everyone else. Especially when it’s Arsenal who have been noisily coming second in the last couple of them and insisting it is literally impossible to do any more.",
      "Yet slowly at first and then very fast indeed, it became apparent during the autumn of 2024 that City were not going to save themselves this time.",
      "In a two-month spell from October 30 to December 29, City played 13 games across three competitions and somehow won only one of them.",
      "And it all began after a run of five straight wins, that came to an abrupt end with a 2-1 Carabao defeat at Spurs (genuinely, what is it with City and f*cking Spurs? It makes no sense). A Premier League defeat at Bournemouth was followed by a Champions League humbling at the hands of Ruben Amorim on his Sporting farewell tour, before another 2-1 defeat at Brighton and then a 4-0 thrashing at the hands of, yes, f*cking Spurs (How? Why?).",
      "Perhaps the lowest point of the run came in the Champions League when failing to see out a home game against Feyenoord despite leading 3-0 with barely a quarter of an hour remaining.",
      "But it’s title defences we’re really interested in, so while the wider context of the overall run that scuppered them in three competitions is fun, we should try and stay focused. That league run at its worst point was one win, two draws and six defeats in nine games that took City from top of the table and two points clear of Liverpool to seventh and trailing by 12.",
      "Recovering to limp home third because everyone else was sh*te doesn’t really make it okay.",
      "",
      "United recovered from losing the 2011/12 title race to AGUERRRROOOOO to bounce back and secure their 20th championship in Ferguson’s final season in charge at Old Trafford. The signing of Robin van Persie was the catalyst, with the former Arsenal striker scoring 26 Premier League goals as United eased home by 11 points in a far cry from the final-day goal-difference antics of the previous season.",
      "Then Ferguson left, urging United supporters to ‘back your new manager’. A few months later, a plane was flying over Old Trafford proclaiming ‘Wrong One – Moyes out’. By the time Moyes was finally, inevitably sacked in April, with four games remaining, United were already guaranteed to record their lowest points tally in the Premier League era, with home games a particular problem.",
      "Under Moyes, United were beaten six times at Old Trafford, losing in the FA Cup to Swansea, while Sunderland dumped them out of the League Cup. It led to United missing out on Champions league football for the first time since 1995 as they finished a lowly seventh and 25 points worse off.",
      "The absence of Ferguson/presence of Moyes is quite understandably cited as the main reason, but United absolutely butchered the transfer window as they discovered for the first but not last time that Ferguson really had been making their life unbelievably easy by winning what he did with what he had.",
      "Ed Woodward’s failure to bring the desired and requested Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos and Cesc Fabregas certainly didn’t help matters. Although he did, in his first season in big boy pants, manage to overpay for Marouane Fellaini in the final hours of the summer window.",
      "And then Moyes railed against the fixture schedule after the champions were made to play Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in their first five matches: ‘I find it hard to believe that’s the way the balls came out of the bag, that’s for sure,’ he tinfoiled, having apparently confused the fixture computer for the FA Cup third-round draw.",
      "",
      "Jose Mourinho first disproved the theory that you should never go back by winning a third Premier League title in the second season of his second reign at Stamford Bridge. New arrivals Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas immediately flourished, with Eden Hazard providing the inspiration in a 2014/15 season which saw him crowned PFA Player of the Year.",
      "Mourinho then set about reproving the theory by setting the ultimate benchmark for his now infamous Third-Season Destroy And Exits. The tone for a pathetic title defence was set on the opening weekend, when Mourinho took aim at Chelsea’s medical staff for doing their jobs. The fall-out hung over Stamford Bridge long after Mourinho was fired in mid-December, at which point the Blues had lost nine of their 16 league matches to leave them languishing a point above the relegation zone.",
      "Guus Hiddink, as he tends to, steadied the ship and a top-half finish following the club’s worst start to a season in 37 years became a creditable achievement for Roman Abramovich’s favourite firefighter. But a 37-point drop-off from one season to the next is really very bad indeed no matter how you slice it.",
      "Obviously, they then won the league the following season because the Premier League was, although we didn’t yet know it, undergoing a few years of utter and glorious weirdness before Pep Guardiola would come along and tame it thoroughly.",
      "The mounting evidence that such chaos appears to be returning to the Barclays is something we should all welcome.",
      "",
      "Claudio Ranieri’s Foxes stunned everyone by going from great escapees under Nigel Pearson in 2014/15 to 5000-1 Premier League kings the following year. In the end, it was a procession, with a 10-point margin of victory. The greatest story ever told in English football? Probably.",
      "The Foxes, understandably, suffered quite the hangover from Jamie Vardy’s party and a summer basking in their stunning achievement. N’Golo Kante’s exit hardly helped. They reached the Champions League quarter-finals, but by that time, Ranieri had paid for a miserable title defence with his job. The Italian was axed after just five wins in 25 league games, with his champions one point above the drop zone.",
      "Craig Shakespeare inspired some improvement and Leicester won seven of their last 13 to finish in 12th.",
      "",
      "To our immense relief, this one sneaks in on a bit of a technicality. It might not be a Premier League title defence, but it was a title defence in the Premier League era and we’re cheerfully loopholing off into the sunset with our fingers in our ears. We can’t hear you.",
      "One of the reasons we want this in is just purely and simply that it means one less Actually Kind Of Okay Defence at the other end of this list. The main one, though, is that it was a really bad defence.",
      "Howard Wilkinson’s Whites, inspired by the February arrival of Eric Cantona, broke Manchester United’s hearts down the final stretch of the last Division One season by unseating the Red Devils, who had led from the front through most of the season. Some Leeds fans will argue that their four-point triumph was a bigger miracle than Leicester’s, with Wilko taking United from 10th in Division Two to English champions within three years.",
      "Leeds’ slide as champions was certainly even more dramatic than Leicester’s. During the Premier League’s inaugural season, Wilko’s champs failed to win a game away from Elland Road. They finished 17th in a 22-team division, only two points above relegated Crystal Palace and 31 down on their title-winning effort the year before football was invented. The European Cup offered little respite. They survived the first round after Stuttgart fielded one foreign player too many, only to be beaten home and away by Rangers in the next.",
      "Arsenal are ‘boring’. And complete hypocrites, too. They should wear both those insults like badges of honour while Mikel Arteta fondles his set-pieces.",

      "The Red Devils started off the season in similar fashion to an inconsistent 2024/25 campaign, which saw them finish 15th in Ruben Amorim’s first term at the club.",
      "However, Amorim – who has been under lots of pressure – seems like he could be turning it around at Old Trafford with Man Utd winning three matches in a row.",
      "Victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have the Red Devils looking up with Amorim’s side now sixth in the Premier League after nine games.",
      "And now Man Utd are turning their attention towards the next couple of transfer windows as they look to provide Amorim with further reinforcements after spending over £200m on five new players in the summer.",

      "READ: Liverpool in ‘transition season’ as VVD ‘declines into Lovren’; Man Utd ‘hope cannot be allowed to fester’",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “For Pavlovic, guys, I can guarantee to you that there is nothing, absolutely nothing ongoing. Pavlovic is a crucial player for Bayern, he’s more than happy at Bayern.",
      "“Bayern – and when I say Bayern it’s the board of directors, but also the most important people at Bayern like Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Uli Hoeness and all the others – they all see Pavlovic as one of the crucial faces of the project for present and future.",
      "“So there is nothing between Pavlovic and Manchester United. I don’t know where this news is coming from but Bayern will NOT sell Pavlovic. So forget about it.”",
      "Man Utd are looking to sign at least one midfielder in the next couple of transfer windows and Stuttgart’s Angelo Stiller has been confirmed as a target by Romano.",
      "Romano said last week: “I’m always receiving many questions on Angelo Stiller. There was a report from Bild in the last few days on Man Utd tracking the player. Man Utd have always been following this player. Stiller is really appreciated internally at Man Utd.",
      "“Last summer, we had some stories on Man Utd going on a mission to Germany, negotiating to sign Stiller as a surprise for the final weeks. No, Man Utd never started any negotiations for Stiller in August last summer. That was never a possibility, it was always impossible.",
      "“Stiller was always going to stay at Stuttgart in the summer transfer window, especially in August. There was no chance to change the story in the final days of the window.",
      "“But Stiller remains a player monitored by Man Utd. They are following him. They are closely monitoring his progress.”",
      "Antoine Semenyo is one of the most in-form players in the Premier League this season and the Daily Telegraph has now revealed that Bournemouth ‘rejected £50m offers’ from Man Utd and Tottenham over the summer.",
      "The report adds: ‘It made it easy for them to reject the overtures of United and Tottenham, with Semenyo buying into the idea and agreeing a new contract – with a pay rise – and, crucially, a release clause that his agent is able to tell other clubs about but which is not being made public.",
      "‘Semenyo has been in outstanding form with only Erling Haaland outscoring him. If he carries on like this, the 25-year-old Ghana international will not only be sold for far more than was offered but will also earn twice as much money as was proposed last summer by United and Spurs.’",

      "",

      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a five-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. It will very much do, and importantly provides a significant buffer for Le Bris and his team as they continue a tough little run of games.",
      "",
      "It is still very early days and still too early to tell which way a promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy, which they will if that abysmal home form (three wins from 18 Premier League games in the last 11 months, and just one from four very winnable ones this season) can’t be sorted out. Certainly a few others going to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "",
      "At various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. Currently four points outside a largely daft top six, and that won’t do, no matter what the mitigation.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland sees awkward questions resurfacing, though, ahead of what feels a particularly significant trip to Spurs at the weekend.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "In truth, we can’t quite understand why he’s only mid-table here. Feels like he should be out there with Arteta. It would only make sense for him to be here if a big job were currently available, and not even Forest is available for the next six weeks or so.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But it’s now been four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "Still feels like it could go either way, for club and manager, but that’s still significant progress on where they were a month ago when it felt far more certain. And not in a good way.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying. Beating three of last season’s top five in your first eight games and still being only 10th in the table feels a little bit silly.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that. Consecutive defeats without scoring against Man City and Spurs not so much.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially with even a currently not entirely convincing City perhaps remaining the only halfway plausible contenders should Arsenal suffer any kind of a wobble.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Liverpool added to Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park.",
      "",
      "Forget everything we ever wrote about Ruben Amorim being doomed; he has just engineered a 2-1 win at Anfield and it’s now three wins in a row after a rollicking good fun 4-2 win over Brighton.",
      "With Forest and Spurs up next there is real scope for this to become a decent little run. That lad off the internet might even be able to get his hair cut in a couple of weeks. Amorim, meanwhile, knows ‘a couple of weeks’ is no longer the amount of time he possibly has left in the job. Everybody’s happy.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "This season is already a perfect reminder of just how much more fun the Premier League is when the promoted teams are capable of competing as all three are this season. We’re approaching a quarter of the way through this season, and the three promoted teams already have over three-quarters of the total points last year’s trio managed.",
      "",
      "The mini-crisis has reached full-blown levels, and the uncomfortable truth is that Slot has reacted poorly. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after this chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Have got to pull out of this tailspin soon, or something truly extraordinary really could happen here to a man who sauntered so impressively to the Premier League title in his very first season. And there is nothing obviously helpful on the immediate horizon with Crystal Palace, Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Man City to come before an interlull Slot genuinely yet ludicrously might not survive.",
      "",
      "Fulham have hit a serious rough patch just as Silva was starting to be talked about for other jobs. Might be coincidence, might not, but the timing wasn’t great. A last-gasp defeat at Newcastle means it’s now four straight defeats, which is only keeping the Cottagers clear of the bottom three because those three teams are all currently just unspeakably awful.",
      "Still feels very much to us like Fulham and Silva are both better with each other than without, and would advise against anything hasty. Does need some points from somewhere soon, though. The good news? Wolves next.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eases the stress significantly.",
      "",
      "Won his first game in charge against Porto in the Europa, and Forest played rather well too. But it’s the Premier League where Dyche will and must be judged, with getting out of relegation trouble the most obvious of primary targets. And losing as they did against Bournemouth ahead of an upcoming run that includes a resurgent Manchester United, Liverpool and a six-pointer against Leeds means it’s already quite possible to imagine the calm and thoughtful Mr Marinakis being forced into another calm and thoughtful decision about a manager he’s just appointed.",
      "",
      "As a rule of thumb, you really don’t ever want to be this prominent in the Sack Race this early in the season in what is already your second job of that season. It really has been an extraordinary few months for a manager who has already this season watched his Forest side tear Brentford apart, then watched his Forest side be torn apart by West Ham, and then watched his West Ham side torn apart by Brentford.",
      "Though Nuno would be way down any list of people to blame for the Hammers’ incompetence, we do already start to wonder whether he’s the answer to any of those problems. He absolutely could be sacked twice by Christmas, with defeat at Leeds leaving West Ham already four points adrift of safety.",
      "",
      "It is the history of the Wolves. They absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season, an opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City and further defeats to Bournemouth, Everton, Newcastle United, Leeds and now, really damagingly, Sunderland after a pair of encouraging draws.",
      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "Looked set to get the full benefit of good ol’ Dr Tottenham before having to settle for a point that really should have been three; they were much the better side in a low-quality caper.",
      "Sent off in the 1-1 draw with Brighton for ‘irresponsible behaviour in the technical area’. Which we just love. Was he running with scissors? Did he return to a lit firework? Purchase alcohol for some youths?",

      "By Danyal Khan and Rob Dorsett",
      "Tuesday 28 October 2025 14:51, UK",
      "Manchester United bosses are quietly satisfied with their progress after securing three straight wins for the first time in 18 months - but know there is still much to do before the men's team can compete regularly at the top of the table.",
      "The team's recent run of impressive results has not been met with overt celebrations in the executive offices at the Carrington training ground. Rather, it has reassured the club hierarchy that the tough decisions taken are starting to have an impact on the pitch and strengthened their resolve to continue with the long-term plan.",
      "Ruben Amorim has targeted a place in Europe for next season, and certainly chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox would be satisfied with a top-six finish. As Amorim continues to develop his squad, no one at the club is getting too high when the team are on a positive run, or too low when results are disappointing.",
      "Crucially, while there is abundant noise outside Old Trafford calling for some heavy investment in the squad in January, among the executives there is a determination to stick to the plan. United are not expected to spend big in the New Year.",
      "A new defensive midfield player is the priority to strengthen the squad, after last summer's focus on attacking areas. But because a No 6 is likely to mean a significant level of investment - with Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba all under consideration - it is much more likely to be addressed in the summer, as part of a broader review of the squad and the overall wage bill.",
      "The strategy was successful in the summer in terms of reducing a bloated and expensive squad, moving on many of the big-earning players who weren't part of Amorim's plans. But there is also an awareness that the futures of a number of Manchester United's highest-profile players are still up in the air.",
      "However determined Marcus Rashford is to pursue his career away from Manchester, he still has two-and-a-half years remaining on his United contract. Harry Maguire and Casemiro are both out of contract in the summer, and so any decision to let either move on would free up a significant chunk in the squad salary budget. Rasmus Hojlund's substantive move to Napoli is only guaranteed should Antonio Conte's side make the Champions League.",
      "All of those considerations will impact what incoming transfer business United can do, but there is a determination to avoid some of the recruitment mistakes of the past, which saw too many big names on big salaries sitting in the big Old Trafford stands.",
      "The summer focus on strengthening the attack seems to be paying dividends. Manchester United's xG has actually been lower over the last three matches compared to the first six games of the season - but the statistics make it clear United are being much more clinical in front of goal, with a very impressive 20 per cent of their shots producing goals this month, compared to just 7.4 per cent previously.",
      "The style of play has been tweaked, too, with United going more direct. Over the last three matches, they've averaged less than 44 per cent possession compared with over 53 per cent for the rest of the season. And with Senne Lammens between the posts, he has kicked long for almost 85 per cent of the time, compared to 43 per cent and 56 per cent under Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, respectively.",
      "United had no plans to change goalkeeper in the summer, despite their long-term interest in Lammens. But Onana's dip in form, and Jadon Sancho's wages being removed from the overall bill, meant a deal could be done for the 23-year-old.",
      "The stats suggest he has made a difference on the pitch. A 78.6 per cent save rate is more than 11 per cent better than Onana's, and more than 25 per cent ahead of Bayindir.",
      "It is also significant that the focus on Amorim's chosen formation of three central defenders has waned.",
      "But there have been signs in the last few games that the Portuguese coach has adopted a more flexible approach to his team structure. Even though Manchester United line up with three at the back, that sometimes becomes a four when they are defending, with one or both of the wing-backs dropping deeper.",
      "An increasingly positive mood is becoming obvious to those inside Carrington. After the defeat to Brentford last month, it would have been characteristic of the recent United past for stories to start leaking out about certain players being unhappy, or others losing faith in the head coach. There were no such stories this time, which suggests there is greater unity in the squad than has been seen for a while, and a widespread buy-in to the coaching methods.",
      "United's bosses know they are still in the early stages of their revolution. And they expect some rocky roads ahead as they search for stability and, ultimately, silverware.",
      "But, for the time being at least, all is quiet at Carrington, as the club's power brokers feel things are moving in the right direction.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Analysing some of the biggest talking points from the latest round of Premier League matches, including a new wave of set-piece creativity, Man City's lack of identity and Man Utd's recent momentum after three wins on the spin",
      "Monday 27 October 2025 14:28, UK",
      "Before Super Sunday, Everton were the only team yet to concede from a set-piece in the Premier League. Given the prolificacy of set-piece goals this season that fact is impressive. What followed in a 3-0 defeat to Thomas Frank's Tottenham, though, was Micky van de Ven tucking away twice from corners.",
      "It would seem no team is immune to the set-piece phenomenon sweeping through the league.",
      "This is not a radically new idea. And it's a matter of personal preference as to whether this development is having a positive or negative effect on entertainment value. Fashion isn't always about aesthetics. Sometimes it's about practicality. If the best wearing pair of jeans only look good on the hanger, then really they serve no purpose at all.",
      "Nineteen per cent of all English top-flight goals this season have come via corners (45/241), the highest proportion ever in a Premier League campaign. Arsenal are the masters of this art. Gabriel is so effective, in fact, Jamie Carragher has called him the \"most influential player in the league\" right now.",
      "It's true that Mikel Arteta has got his team delivering machine-like efficiency. Arsenal have scored 11 goals via set-pieces this season, two more than any other side (Chelsea are second on nine). 69 per cent of goals scored in 2025/26, in fact, have come via set-pieces (11/16). Arteta's squad has been assembled with physicality and power purposefully to operate in such a way. But they are not the only ones.",
      "Brentford have made the long throw their party piece, scoring eight times via that method since the season began. Michael Kayode catapults the ball into the mixer and asks a team-mate to make first contact. That bit is fundamental. And then it's about who reacts quickest. At the weekend it was Dango Ouattara to spark a 3-2 victory over reigning champions Liverpool. Every side are susceptible to this type of threat if it's choreographed well enough.",
      "If only Tony Pulis' Stoke side were alive and kicking to relish in this era.",
      "Romanticists might call this evolution boring, but it's actually initiating a levelling out of the league. Bournemouth, who have used set-piece threat to good effect five times this season, are second in the table. Spurs, boasting the same success rate from dead-ball situations, are third.",
      "Frank has long been an advocate of the benefits of set-piece ability because it offers realistic marginal gains. It's a product of dedicated training ground practice. When pass-heavy football was all the rage it was less transferable because far fewer players, often costing huge sums, have the specialist talent to play that way. They were ring-fenced for the top clubs.",
      "The formula is equally true of both ends of the table. Those teams who concede from set-pieces most regularly - Nottingham Forest and West Ham, both 10 - are 18th and 19th respectively. There is little point in resisting or ignoring the shift. \"If you're not doing it, you look like a bit of a dinosaur as a coach,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Super Sunday.",
      "This new, or perhaps just elevated, manuscript is here to stay. And if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.",
      "When Manchester City were the Premier League's most potent emerging force in the early 2010s, before Pep Guardiola, managers at the very top of the game criticised City's lack of clear identity. Carlo Ancelotti, when at Chelsea, once said City had \"skill and ability\" but were \"not a team\".",
      "Not once has that ever been said of a side under Guardiola's charge - not in any part of Europe. Not at Barcelona, not at Bayern Munich and never previously at Manchester City - until now. The scars from last year's well-documented meltdown are having a lasting effect on Pep's newly-shaped squad. And it's unclear exactly what they stand for.",
      "City's most recent defeat to Aston Villa - their third of the season - was indicative of a side caught between the style change that has glorified set-pieces over pretty passing patterns. Pep has publicly professed to want to embrace what he calls \"modern football\" but a lot of the ideas go against the fibres of what made him so famously successful at every club he's managed. He was the ultimate philosophy coach.",
      "Gary Neville has been critical of this recent erosion. \"Man City aren't even good to watch any more,\" he said on this week's podcast. \"They look like they can be beat in any game of football. The play is like a hybrid between direct, old Pep in terms of passing, a bit scruffy - I'm not quite sure what it is.\"",
      "This period of flux is evidently difficult to control for a perfectionist manager. Guardiola is not going to be enlisting the long throw any time soon. City are actually the only Premier League side yet to score from a set-piece this season, which gives an indication of just how seriously, or not, Pep has welcomed these new rules of engagement.",
      "Their latest downfall was engineered by a brilliantly worked Matty Cash strike, and it came from a corner.",
      "It was City's first loss since August, and just the second time they've failed to score all season, but their repeated predictability has meant falling short far more times than is necessary to seriously challenge for the Premier League crown.",
      "Guardiola blamed \"the last action\", needing \"to shoot better or to cross better,\" but really it was a lack of ideas that cost. And if City aren't strangulating teams in possession like they once were - keeping the ball in such a methodical way that opposition sides got fed up of chasing - then what exactly are they doing?",
      "Being more direct with fast wingers is ok if you have got the physicality to cope when play breaks down and City without the lesser-seen Rodri, arguably, do not. They won just 42 per cent of ground duels at Villa Park. Not for the first time, Unai Emery got his tactical setup spot on.",
      "Back to the drawing board for Pep, then. City need a new plan B.",
      "In case you didn't hear over the weekend, and you would have to live under a rock not to, Manchester United have won three consecutive Premier League games in the same season for the first time since February 2024. Ruben Amorim is nothing if not persistent, and his will has finally been rewarded.",
      "As he himself noted in the press room at Old Trafford after making a comfortable win over Brighton look difficult, though, a sense of \"suffering\" seems to surround Man Utd before any positive outcome is reached.",
      "Only they can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. How can a performance so assured coincide with one so fraught with nervousness? Perhaps we will never know. This seems to be Amorim's brand and for now it's working.",
      "What is clear and admirable about this version of Man Utd, which is all the more tangible when you watch from the terraces of Old Trafford, is how devoted the players are to the manager's cause. \"The players really like Amorim,\" Neville said over the weekend. \"He's authentic and honest. The players want to do well for him.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes in a sacrificial midfield role, Amad at wing-back, and Luke Shaw's willingness to slot into a back three are all evidence of the buy-in. The stars of this latest triumph, however, were undoubtedly Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - recruited to fit a style that is starting to show promise.",
      "While Pep's might be lost in the post, Amorim has got the modern football memo. This is not a side who are going to dazzle with intricate build-up, but can clearly sustain threat with fast, direct play that puts Cunha and Mbeumo at the heart of each attacking phase.",
      "Cunha's opener was also evidence of his maverick quality, which is helpful too. Since the start of last season no player has scored more times from outside the box than him (seven).",
      "\"We feel like we can solve anything,\" Amorim said with a smile on Saturday, later revealing he enjoyed the performance against Brighton better than beating Liverpool the week prior. \"It was more complete,\" he added. Some semblance of coherence is certainly building but Amorim was right to caveat his excitement with realism. He cannot afford to get complacent.",
      "Trips to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in consecutive weeks will stress-test just how much progress has really been made."

United's recent record against Brighton is woeful and it's a fixture that always throws up drama. This latest instalment trended similarly.",
      "Just when United draw you in, Old Trafford bouncing with unbridled glee at being 2-0 up, they drop you like a sack of bricks. It was easy to be charmed by the first-half performance but the second proved this United side are far from flawless. How can they make things look so easy and so hard all at the same time? It's an art.",
      "Until Bryan Mbeumo slammed home a fourth in stoppage time there was a sense of foreboding seeping into the terraces. You could tangibly feel the atmosphere shift. Of the four big chances the hosts created, three were missed. And yet they still scored four times.",
      "That's what Ruben Amorim means when he emphasised in his press conference that this year's squad contains players who \"fit the style\". He's talking about the quality of Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo. A new brand of Manchester United matchwinner.",
      "Without them, this is still an average side very much trying to find its way.Laura Hunter",
      "\"Even when we don't play well, we're able to score two goals and create more chances than only the two we scored from open play.\"",
      "Arne Slot has, in essence, described the problem with Liverpool. At one end they are dangerous and at the other they are vulnerable. Even then it can be argued their attack is misfiring. He is yet to solve why this side is so imbalanced from back to front.",
      "There is no control from his midfield where, at Brentford, Dominic Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones, two No 8s, were sat behind Florian Wirtz. They are without the nous to receive the ball from the defence and play forward. Alexis Mac Allister is the answer to that.",
      "Then there are more trivial issues like Milos Kerkez, who is so woefully out of form and yet still trying to do everything too quickly rather than building some confidence by simply keeping it simple.",
      "Conor Bradley had one of his better evenings at right-back although is still clearly weighed down by being the heir to Trent Alexander-Arnold's throne. The reality is that he is just not as good.",
      "Not even playing alongside Virgil van Dijk can help Ibrahim Konate this season. The disappointment of missing out on signing Marc Guehi gets worse by the week.",

      "The scoreline will paint a close game: but it wasn't.",
      "The usual problems emerged for West Ham at Leeds, whose inability to defend crosses and corners struck again to give them a huge uphill task.",
      "It's not a question of: when will West Ham learn? It's when will West Ham give themselves a chance?",
      "When will Nuno Espirito Santo give himself a chance too, after two incorrect line-ups against Leeds and Brentford saw him experiment with inverted full-backs playing on the wrong side and no centre forwards?",
      "After the disastrous first 15 minutes which saw them go 2-0 down, they were lucky this is a fairly misfiring Leeds side as it could have been worse before half-time.",
      "West Ham didn't deserve to get back in this game. Leeds ran nearly seven more kilometres than them, creating chance after chance right through the heart of the team.",
      "Given West Ham have been in this division for over a decade, that's unacceptable.",
      "There are holes in defence, holes in midfield and with Nuno reluctantly using Callum Wilson as their only recognised, fit striker, there's a hole in attack too.",

      "Marc Guiu was one of three teenage goal-scorers against 10-man Ajax in the Champions League on Wednesday and had his chance to impress in his first Premier League start for Chelsea - up against the team he'd briefly been on loan at earlier this season.",
      "But on this evidence, Liam Delap's pending return from injury cannot come soon enough. The England man could be involved in midweek Carabao Cup action - and Chelsea are in real need of a central threat on this stage.",
      "Injured Cole Palmer's creativity is another big miss for a Chelsea team that struggled to carve a way through Sunderland's well-organised defence. That was illustrated by the Expected Goals figures, which showed Chelsea at 0.97 to Sunderland's 1.16 - despite the hosts having 69 per cent possession.",
      "But Guiu was bullied by Dan Ballard, unable to find an angle to receive a pass from his team-mates and then unable to retain possession when he did get it. After 76 minutes he was withdrawn having had just 10 touches.",
      "Joao Pedro later went up top, with sub Estevao going to No 10 but still Chelsea struggled to produce meaningful moments. It was an afternoon to wonder why there was such eagerness to offload Nicolas Jackson in the summer.",

      "He wasn't alone. The Black Cats battled their way through the Championship play-offs and were expected to struggle in the top flight like most promoted sides have in recent times.",
      "But Regis Le Bris has combined a big summer splurge with well-organised tactics to defy the doubters. Sunderland's 17 points from their first nine Premier League games is the best return from a promoted club at this stage since Hull City in 2008/09.",
      "The majority of their points have come at the Stadium of Light, where their raucous home support matches the energy, physicality and intensity of the team. But on the road at Chelsea they showed quality in defence to shut out their hosts and then set-piece and counter-attack threat to hurt them at the other end.",
      "The win moved them up to second in the Premier League. The stuff of dreams for their supporters, who sang 'We're going to win the league' in west London. They face Arsenal in a couple of weeks' time...",
      "More importantly, Sunderland are just nine points off hitting a tally none of the relegated sides could reach last season. And it's only October. No-one is underestimating them now.Peter Smith",

      "He comes alive at the big moments. The moments that matter. He defines what this Newcastle team are all about: fight and heart sprinkled with an abundance of quality.",
      "Against Fulham after the equaliser that left the game at 1-1, it was Bruno who grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck and shook off any feelings of fatigue from the Champions League in midweek to get his team the points. He broke up play, launched counter attacks and completely shifted the momentum of the game with his tenacity. And when his team needed someone bursting into the box to slam home a rebound, he made that run and got his reward with the winning goal.",
      "Big players don't just turn up in big games, they decide them. Bruno is doing that, repeatedly.Lewis Jones",
      "Fulham have a couple of problems. The surge of the newly-promoted clubs showing no fear and huge worries concerning their own final-third output which is lacking in freshness and quality.",
      "Despite showing promise in various phases in the defeat at Newcastle, Fulham were blunt in the key moments. To rack up 47 final third entries and 25 touches in the opposition box at St James' Park is a really healthy number but they simply didn't do enough with their territory.",
      "It's now four defeats on the spin and if the goals don't flow soon, pressure is going to mount. That will test the mental resilience of a squad whose recent seasons have delivered stability, rather than battling survival. This is a season that could easily evolve into a tension-ridden relegation fight rather than a comfortable mid-table campaign.Lewis Jones",
      "Carlos Baleba's form is a concern for Brighton. He has been substituted in all nine of his starts this season, departing just before the hour mark in the Seagulls' chaotic defeat to Manchester United. It has been worse. Three times he has been hooked at the break.",
      "After an improving showing against Newcastle, this was a return to the error-strewn efforts prior to that. Baleba switches off out of possession and looks far too loose in it. He was strongly linked with a move in the summer and does not seem to have settled.",
      "\"It is for the experienced players to get around him, ground him, have a couple of honest conversations because he is going to be a world-class midfield player.\" Still only 21 years old, that is most likely true given the potential that Baleba had shown previously.",
      "But this is an alarming dip in form from him now and the demands of the Premier League wait for no man. Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler is trying to play his star midfielder back into form but he cannot wait indefinitely. It is on Baleba to do more.Adam Bate",

      "Manchester United capitalised on recent momentum by beating Brighton at Old Trafford as Matheus Cunha scored his first club goal in a frantic and somewhat controversial 4-2 win.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side seem to be one of contrasting fortunes as a torrid start to this season has made way for a particularly productive recent period, with three wins on the spin propelling them, temporarily at least, into the top four.",
      "Man Utd had lost six of their last seven league games against Brighton and rode their luck at times in the first half, needing some wasteful finishing from Danny Welbeck to pave the way for two goals in 10 minutes, scored by Cunha and Casemiro. The opener was sumptuous, the second via a harsh deflection much more fortunate.",
      "Bruno Fernandes should have made it three before Bryan Mbeumo did, driving a devilishly clever strike through Lewis Dunk's legs, despite an obvious foul by Luke Shaw on Georginio Rutter in the phase before. And that was not the only decision under scrutiny on the night.",
      "Man Utd have led by 2+ goals at half time in three consecutive Premier League games at Old Trafford for the first time since November 2008.",
      "Neither referee Anthony Taylor nor VAR awarded Amad a penalty when he was upended by Maxim De Cuyper in the first half, because the defender supposedly \"played the ball\", while Patrick Dorgu only received a yellow for a last-ditch foul on Yankuba Minteh - albeit the forward had probably lost control of possession when the whistle finally went.",
      "The drama did not stop there. Welbeck latterly made his presence felt when guiding a belting free-kick beyond Senne Lammens to rid him of a second consecutive clean sheet, before Charalampos Kostoulas arrived from the bench to force what looked to be a needlessly tense end.",
      "Mbeumo had other ideas, though, finding the net in the 96th minute with an emphatic finish to round off a frenzied finale, with Gary Neville praising Amorim for his \"best and most important week in the job\".",
      "\"The narrative coming into this game was that Manchester United couldn't take a step back after what happened at Anfield last week and the win today was absolutely crucial.",
      "\"I think it has been Ruben Amorim's best and most important week in the job. It gives him a bit of time.",
      "\"I am not saying he's off the hook but Manchester United are up there towards the top of the league and it certainly takes a lot of pressure off him.\"",
      "Only Manchester United can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. This was definitely a banana skin moment. United's recent record against Brighton is woeful and it's a fixture that always throws up drama. This latest instalment trended similarly.",
      "Just when United draw you in, Old Trafford bouncing with unbridled glee at being 2-0 up, they drop you like a sack of bricks. It was easy to be charmed by the first-half performance but the second proved this fragile side are far from flawless. How can they make things look so easy and so hard all at the same time? It's an art.",
      "Until Bryan Mbeumo slammed home a fourth in stoppage time there was a sense of foreboding seeping into the terraces. You could tangibly feel the atmosphere shift. Of the four big chances the hosts created, three were missed. And yet they still scored four times.",
      "That's what Ruben Amorim means when he emphasised in his press conference that this year's squad contains players who \"fit the style\". He's talking about the quality of Cunha and Mbeumo. A new brand of Manchester United matchwinner.",
      "Without them, this is still an average side very much trying to find its way.",

      "\"The performance was important. We played different games in different moments. It would not be Manchester United without suffering a bit.",
      "\"The best game we did [this season] was against Arsenal, but when you have a different spirit, we are a bit more free playing the game. We have a different confidence.",
      "\"I never had that feeling of embarrassment of not winning games, I felt [Sir] Jim [Ratcliffe] always believed, but to face the fans was difficult in that moment. It's so hard in football, everything can change in one minute.",
      "\"We are improving in the bad moments, and [learning to] respond in a different way. You can feel it with the team. Let's enjoy, but that urgency of this can change must be there.",
      "\"The team play so much better compared to last season. We have players more suited to this type of style. I like more today than last week [beating Liverpool], it was more complete.\"",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler:",
      "\"It's easy to summarise. Too many easy mistakes. We gave the balls away too easy, like this you can't win the game. We had control and good actions, always created a danger, but in the end it's easy mistakes. [The goals are] like four presents.",
      "\"United pressed well but we have to do the small margins right. We weren't on the highest level and then we make mistakes. When we were in a structure we didn't give away many chances, but it was just the mistakes. We decided the game ended in a negative way. The execution was not good enough.\"",
      "Speaking about the difference in threat of Manchester United from last year to now, Hurzeler said: \"Much more intense, compact, and defending forward. Even more individual quality - money was well invested.\"",
      "Commenting on the officiating performance, he added: \"I will never make the referee responsible for our losses. We have to make it better. We can't lose the ball that easily.\""

      "Following a third consecutive victory, Gary Neville believes Manchester United have the pieces in place for a top-six finish. Ruben Amorim has come through his month of reckoning but there are still question marks over Benjamin Sesko after Brighton win...",
      "Saturday 25 October 2025 22:19, UK",
      "Gary Neville has declared this to be Ruben Amorim's best week in the job after Manchester United made it three wins in a row in the Premier League with a 4-2 victory over Brighton on Saturday and believes the template is there for a top-six finish.",
      "Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club and Bryan Mbeumo added two goals to his total in the second half as United built on their win over Liverpool at Anfield.",
      "\"I think where we've all been with it, I wouldn't have been surprised if we talked about him losing his job. I was thinking he was under massive pressure after going into the international break in October. I felt as though that change could be imminent.",
      "\"But the victory at Anfield shows you how things can turn around and then obviously this was so important today.",
      "\"He's not out of the woods yet and it's certainly not time to get carried away but I think Manchester United are now where they thought they probably would be.",
      "\"They'll slip down a couple of places after the rest of the teams play and they'll end up in sixth or seventh but that's where I think everyone thought they would be.",
      "\"So, look, this has been a very important week for the manager and for the club and you can see the celebration at the end there was more than just a little bit of relief that, yeah, we needed this badly.",
      "\"A few weeks ago I was a little bit worried that the players didn't believe in Ruben Amorim's system, that maybe there was an element of them not winning matches and starting to question it, listening to the noise that all of us, including myself, had added to that.",
      "\"However, one thing that's been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people in and around the club is that the players really like him as a person and that does count for a lot.",
      "\"Because I think there's no doubt he's not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him. They want to play for him, they're desperate to win and you've seen that coming together a little bit in the last week.",
      "\"I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected, that has given them such a big lift.",
      "\"We'll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after. There's still a big job to do in this month but I felt as though it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week at Liverpool, it could have gone a different way.",
      "\"It feels very different, it feels like the momentum's with them a little bit and the spirit's good.\"",
      "Neville pointed to Mbeumo and Cunha's encouraging form when asked what he still wants to see to be convinced by United.",
      "\"I suppose consistency. It's been a team and a club that you can't really rely on for so long.",
      "\"The idea of winning two or three matches doesn't take that away. You can't build that trust back in an instant. That's still not there but I think that there's something happening there.",
      "\"With Mbeumo and Cunha the risk was removed from those signings in the sense that they've been in the Premier League before and they've got that hunger to deliver at a different level.",
      "\"There was a lot of things about those signings that you felt more comfortable with and when I look at United now and Mbeumo looks like he belongs, he looks hungry, he looks like he wants to score goals.",
      "\"It wasn't quite happening for him and Cunha in the first maybe four or five matches when they were getting into the positions they always wanted the ball but they weren't maybe taking their chances.",
      "\"But Manchester United have got something to build on. Those two will win a lot of football matches for this club.",
      "\"If you can keep that back five compact and among them there's some decent defenders, half-decent defenders, that back five can just stay solid and the midfield in front, let them two up front go and do what they do.",
      "\"I think it could be sort of a recipe for Manchester United to have a decent season to get into the top six.\"",
      "The third member of United's attacking triumvirate has not made such a big impression just yet. Benjamin Sesko came back into the team after being benched for the win at Liverpool but did not get among the goals.",
      "\"There are question marks over Sesko,\" said Neville. \"He obviously was a bigger risk of a signing and a lot more of an unknown. He doesn't quite look like he's settled in yet.",
      "\"It's more than the goals. It's the inclusion within the actual combinations that you see from the others. You see Bruno Fernandes and [Mason] Mount, who wasn't playing today, but you see those two linking very successfully with Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "\"You don't quite see Sesko being part of that mix yet. He's not got up to speed in the pace of it, of how quickly they're playing with each other. He needs to get his game up to speed.",
      "\"That'll only come through time and obviously he's still quite young. But he just does need to get there because it's a big signing still, he's £80m. If they can become a front three, then obviously that'll be huge.. At the moment it feels to me like a two with another guy stood up there occupying space.",
      "\"That's the big job over the next couple of weeks.\"",

      "Saturday 25 October 2025 17:38, UK",
      "Brighton face Manchester United on Saturday with six wins from the last seven Premier League meetings between the sides. Two of them were masterminded by Fabian Hurzeler last season. The youngest head coach in the country is going for a third.",
      "The trip to Old Trafford, scene of a 3-1 victory in January, is another chance for the 32-year-old to show his potential to be one of the game's next elite coaches and comes with Brighton unbeaten in five games following last weekend's win over Newcastle.",
      "\"Don't prove it only once, we have to prove it twice, maybe a third time, that we are able to compete with the best teams in the league.",
      "\"And this will be the challenge against Manchester United as well because they are one of the best teams in the league. They have unbelievable individual quality. Of course, they had a big win against Liverpool, so we expect them with a lot of confidence, with a lot of belief. But we will go there to compete at the highest level.",
      "\"We will go there to win this game.\"",
      "They will aim to do it by applying the lessons of their last visit.",
      "\"First of all, it's always a big challenge to go there because it's just a special atmosphere,\" says Hurzeler. \"The second thing is that you have to go there and play with a lot of belief and a lot of courage, especially in possession. You can't go there and only defend.",
      "\"What I learned from last season is that you have to be at the highest level in all the small match-ups. That's the main thing against United, especially with the individual quality they have. They can decide a game with one action, in one moment.\"",
      "Brighton's win there in January, secured by goals from Yankuba Minteh, Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter, prompted Ruben Amorim to describe his side as \"maybe the worst in Manchester United's history\". Are they a different proposition now?",
      "\"Every time teams bring more individual quality into their team, it gets more and more difficult to beat them,\" says Hurzeler. \"They play a similar formation to last season but they seem to be more stable. They seem to get more and more into their rhythm.",
      "\"For sure, the more the teams spend, the better they will be and the higher the challenge is, but we never hide, we are never afraid. We have a lot of respect for every team and every player but we go there with the biggest self-belief that we can beat every team.\"",
      "Hurzeler knows what to expect tactically. Manchester United have started every game under Amorim with a back three. The Brighton boss is something of an expert on the system having used it at his former club St Pauli, even if he terms it differently.",
      "\"I played a lot with a back five at my previous club, so I know that you can defend the whole width of the pitch,\" says Hurzeler. \"It's easier to do that so I think that's one advantage.",
      "\"You need to be very good between the lines. You need to have centre-backs who defend forward, otherwise it's easy for the opponent to turn in front of the defence.",
      "\"One of the challenges when you play against a back five is that you always face a very compact team, with very short distances between each player. When you face a four, you have a little bit more distance between the opposition players.",
      "\"The challenge is to find the gaps, to be patient, to not force it, because if you force it with the first action, then for sure they are going to transition.",
      "\"So, you have to be patient, you have to switch the play, you have to create overloads on the wings to make them move, then find the gap where you can play through or run through.\"",
      "There are parallels between Hurzeler and Amorim as up-and-coming coaches who earned their moves to the Premier League having built their reputations on the continent. But they have approached their respective tasks very differently.",
      "While Amorim has rigidly stuck to his favoured system at Manchester United, Hurzeler has embraced change at Brighton, using a back four in all but one of his Premier League games in charge despite having used a three consistently at St Pauli.",
      "\"I think the most important thing is to understand the profiles of the players,\" he says. \"So, what is the natural system for the club? What is the natural system for the players? In which position and on which base can the players show the highest potential?\"",
      "Hurzeler points out that his system is fluid and interchangeable.",
      "\"I always stick to my principles, but principles don't mean you always have to play a back four or always a back five,\" he explains. \"In the game you have thousands of different situations and patterns, so you always have to be able to react.",
      "\"We really try to train decision-making from the players, and in my experience this decision-making is better when you stick to your principles. You need to adapt or adjust without losing your style of play and that's what we try to do consistently.\"",
      "One of Hurzeler's principles is to press opponents aggressively.",
      "Brighton have forced more high turnovers than any other Premier League side this season. Opta's advanced metrics show they hold one of the highest defensive lines in the Premier League.",
      "How might he adapt, then, to Manchester United going direct? Their goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, has sent 83 out of 90 passes long in their last two Premier League games. Arne Slot highlighted the issues they caused by bypassing Liverpool's press.",
      "\"United played a lot of long balls in the last two or three games, they were quite efficient on that,\" says Hurzeler. \"They are really keen on winning the second ball. It's a very effective way of being successful. They proved it can be very powerful.",
      "\"The main thing you need to understand is that it starts with the press, how you attack the goalkeeper, which centre-back you want to attack. And then make sure that you're ready for the long ball.",
      "\"When the long ball is played, there are two things that are very important: that you try to win the second ball, and that, if you don't win the second ball, you have good positioning for the third ball.",
      "\"Make sure that, with your last line, you always cover the inner line, so when they try to flick the ball, especially with [Benjamin] Sesko, you can defend against the deep runs from [Matheus] Cunha, from [Bryan] Mbuemo, from [Mason] Mount.",
      "\"They are very good at these things, so it's a job for the whole team, not only of the defensive players. The main thing is to keep the compactness, make sure you have close distances, that you close the gaps, and that you're really intense for the second ball.\"",
      "One player who can help them is Carlos Baleba.",
      "The 21-year-old made an indifferent start to the season following strong interest from Manchester United in the summer but he looked back to his best in the win over Newcastle after Hurzeler urged him to \"take responsibility\" for his situation.",
      "\"I saw a Carlos Baleba who stepped up,\" says Hurzeler. \"These were good actions and good behaviours he showed, but he has to make habits out of those good behaviours. That's the next step in his development, to bring consistency to his performance.\"",
      "Hurzeler wants him to \"overcome the noise\" around his future at Old Trafford on Saturday. He has been firm with Baleba and continues to push the midfielder, even if it risks upsetting him.",
      "\"For me, it's always important that I'm very transparent with the players,\" he says. \"I have a very good relationship with Carlos. We speak regularly, we are in touch. I always share my thoughts about his development and my thoughts about his performance.",
      "\"It's important to be very clear about what you expect from players on the pitch, off the pitch. And it's important to build relationships where you can criticise or give personal feedback they might not be happy about, but they understand the intention behind it.",
      "\"Carlos won't get better if he only gets compliments and claps from outside. I think he will get better if he has a safe environment, but also honest feedback where he knows what he needs to improve. That's where we try to support him and make him better.\"",
      "Baleba is of course just one of many young players to have excelled at Brighton, a club with an exciting trajectory and a head coach whose appetite for improvement is abundantly clear.",
      "\"I always say that learning has no finish line, so you will never be finished with progressing,\" Hurzeler says. \"That is what we try to live as a club, and what I try to live as an individual.",
      "\"We see the progress, but the main thing is to keep going, to keep trying to improve things, because the other teams, they won't rest. You always have to be ready to adapt and develop.\"",
      "It is a mantra that is serving Hurzeler and Brighton well.",
