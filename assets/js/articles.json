      "Piers Morgan has slammed the \"ridiculous\" decision that saw Cristiano Ronaldo sent off during Portugal's match against the Republic of Ireland. Ronaldo was shown a red card on the hour mark as Portugal lost 2-0 in Dublin in the World Cup qualifier.",
      "The Al Nassr star was sent off for an elbow on Ireland defender Dara O'Shea, with the scoreline 2-0 in favour of the home side at the Aviva Stadium at the time of the red card. VAR checked the decision, and Ronaldo was given his marching orders, with the former Manchester United icon now in danger of missing the start of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "Morgan, who recently published an in-depth interview with Ronaldo, has weighed in on the 40-year-old's red card against Ireland. The outspoken journalist and presenter issued a clear verdict on what he thought of the decision, with a post on X which read: \"Ridiculous that Ronaldo was sent off for resisting someone pulling his shirt back.\"",
      "Morgan then shared a clip of Lionel Messi involved in an altercation with an opposition player. He said: \"When Messi did exactly the same recently, nothing was done.\"",
      "Ireland manager Heimir Hallgrimsson was also asked about Ronaldo's red card, including what the former United forward said to him after the forward was sent off. \"He [Ronaldo] complimented me for putting pressure on the referee,\" Hallgrimsson said.",
      "\"But listen, it had nothing to do with me, it was his action on the pitch that cost him a red card. It had nothing to do with me, unless I got into his head.”",
      "Ronaldo's red card means there is a chance that the forward could miss the start of next summer's World Cup in the United States.",
      "Portugal only have one more World Cup group stage qualifier left to play, and a ban of more than one match would see Ronaldo be suspended for the start of next summer's tournament across the Atlantic.",
      "The result of Portugal's next match against Armenia will determine if Ronaldo misses the start of the World Cup. If Portugal beat Armenia, they would progress automatically to next summer's tournament, but a draw or defeat could see Roberto Martinez's side forced to take part in a two-legged play-off to qualify for the competition.",
      "The length of Ronaldo's ban is yet to be confirmed, with a red card typically leading to a three-match suspension.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Wolves star Joao Gomes is the subject of interest from Manchester United as the Red Devils prepare to battle Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City in the next summer transfer window. The Premier League giants are all reportedly interested in signing a new midfielder.",
      "After a summer which saw them sign a brand new forward line for Ruben Amorim, United's attention is firmly prioritised on improving the centre of their midfield. The Red Devils spent big to bring in Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They made enquiries with Brighton and Atletico Madrid over deals for Carlos Baleba and Conor Gallagher in the summer, but neither came to fruition. Already, United have been credited with interest in Adam Wharton of Crystal Palace and England and Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson.",
      "According to Mail Online, United are also monitoring Wolves ace Gomes, who signed a five-year deal with the relegation-threatened side in April. United may need to be flexible, with their Premier League rivals having more money at their disposal.",
      "United are trying to drive down their wage bill, which could also prove problematic with stiff competition.",
      "The Red Devils would prefer to sign a midfielder before the World Cup. That is to avoid prices soaring off the back of a good tournament for their targets.",
      "A figure like Anderson, who has broken into Thomas Tuchel's England lineup, could earn a spot to impress in the World Cup. That could see his price increase dramatically with more eyes on his performances.",
      "United are not set to move too early, however. Ruben Amorim will rely on Manchester United's academy stars to help provide cover come the turn of the year.",
      "United plan to utilise the full extent of their depth as the Africa Cup of Nations gets underway in December. The club will look to their academy before the transfer market to offset absences.",
      "\"Of course, we are going to have a problem there [with AFCON],\" Amorim said. \"But we already knew.",
      "\"Then you can prepare that in the summer, but then you have a lot of players in the summer who are not going to play because it's one game per week. So the management of that situation is going to be hard.",

      "Manchester United's head coach Ruben Amorim has reportedly made a significant alteration to the club's training routine during his time at Old Trafford. The Portuguese took over the reins at Old Trafford in November last year, following the departure of Erik ten Hag.",
      "This season, United are without European football and were knocked out from the Carabao Cup in the second round by Grimsby Town, meaning their campaign has largely been centred on a one-match-per-week schedule in the Premier League. That will change when the top flight returns after the international break, when United will have to contend with a busy schedule over December and the festive period.",
      "Regardless, it seems that Amorim has already made a major impact on United's preparations for matches over his first 12 months in charge. According to a report in The Sun, Amorim has made some key changes at Carrington since his arrival last year.",
      "The report suggests that Amorim has made training sessions 'less intense' as matchday approaches. This adjustment was reportedly made in response to some players struggling with the high-intensity training under Ten Hag's regime.",
      "United have had a relatively small injury list this season, with Lisandro Martinez - who suffered a knee injury back in February - being the only long-term casualty. On 24th November, United will return to Premier League action after the international break, hosting Everton at Old Trafford.",
      "After the draw against Spurs, Amorim said: \"We have a lot of problems. We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable. I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that. We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",

      "The Hertha star is even said to have a release clause of around £10million in the summer, per Mail Online. Bayern Munich hope to keep Eichhorn's talents in Germany, but will have their work cut out.",
      "In addition to competition from the Premier League, European giants Real Madrid, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are all reported to have scouted the prospect.",
      "The defensive midfielder signed his first professional contract earlier this year and became the youngest debutant in Bundesliga 2 against Karlsruher, aged 16 years and 14 days. Eichhorn is already impressing.",

The 17-year-old continued his stunning form after signing for United, having netted 12 goals in 10 outings for the under-18s. He also fired in six goals in 16 appearances for the under-21s.",
      "Obi's form was good enough for the forward to be given first-team recognition, having made eight appearances for the senior side over the past 12 months. Unfortunately for the youngster, those opportunities have been few and far between recently, with his most recent appearance coming on the final day of last season against Fulham.",
      "But with United’s frontline having been hampered by injuries over recent weeks, Benjamin Sesko the latest to have been hit with an issue, Obi has been handed a first-team reprieve.",
      "As per The Sun, the teenager has been offered a place to train alongside the first-team squad. And while that is a normal measure during the international break, Obi was particularly happy to be back in the fold.",
      "The striker could potentially play more of a role for the first-team over the coming weeks given Sesko’s injury. Asked about Ruben Amorim last season, Obi said: \"He’s just told me to be humble and keep working hard every day.",
      "“And hopefully, I get more opportunities soon. My Dad and my Mum always told me to be a good person and listen to my coaches because they want me to get better, so it’s good.\"",

      "He put in an unselfish performance as a false nine in the impressive 2-1 win at Liverpool the previous week, a role he also played in last weekend's draw with Tottenham.",
      "Mbeumo, who bagged his fifth goal of the season in that match, has been more consistent in front of goal but Cunha's impact cannot be overlooked, as evidenced by him regaining his place in the starting XI ahead of Mason Mount.",
      "There were several interested parties for both players, but Cunha's early summer move and Mbeumo's decision to wait for United shows that the pair only had eyes for Old Trafford.",
      "Arsenal were one of the clubs linked with Cunha throughout 2025, but Mikel Arteta and his team sought attacking reinforcements elsewhere.",

      "Manchester United are downsizing their office in London as part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s relentless cost-cutting efforts. INEOS boss Ratcliffe has been desperately trying to save money since taking over control of United in February 2024 and that trend continues to this day.",
      "Ratcliffe has been open in his belief that United must drastically reduce expenditure and has made around 450 staff redundancies since taking over. The petrochemicals billionaire has also taken away staff benefits and increased ticket prices at Old Trafford.",
      "United announced record financial revenue of £666.5million, record commercial revenue of £333.3m and record matchday revenue of £160.3m in September. But the cost-cutting measures are continuing, with United’s staff based in London being moved from their current office in Kensington to a smaller site in Covent Garden.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that United have cut short their 10-year lease in Kensington after just two years on the premises. There is understood to be a significant rent reduction involved, although the club have stressed that money-saving isn’t the primary reason for the move, with the new location considered to be more advantageous for a variety of reasons.",
      "United refused to comment on the move, which feels symbolic. United moved into their grand 23,000 square foot Kensington base, complete with a roof terrace and two bars, in 2023. It was considered state-of-the-art then, featuring an LED tunnel which was supposed to make staff feel like they were at Old Trafford.",
      "But the arrival of Ratcliffe in February 2024 changed everything, with the 73-year-old hiring consultants to conduct an audit and identify areas where savings could be made. Hundreds of redundancies have followed and Ratcliffe has been unapologetic for his decisions.",
      "Speaking on The Business podcast last month, Ratcliffe said: “The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated. I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no-one’s ever given me a free lunch.”",
      "“Manchester United has become mediocre,” Ratcliffe added in a separate interview last season which summed up his approach. “It is supposed to be one of the best football clubs in the world. We have to make some difficult and unpopular decisions. If you shy away from the difficult decisions, then nothing much is going to change.",
      "“I know we get criticism in the press, but we do need to challenge the cost of running this club because what I want to be free for us to do is buy really good footballers, not spend so much of the money on infrastructure. We can't run a business at a loss, which is where United have been in the last couple of years.”",

      "On the bright side, while Mbeumo's winter schedule will be disrupted by international duties, he will have the entire summer off after Cameroon failed to qualify for the 2026 World Cup. The nation faced DR Congo in a play-off match on Thursday, where Lille's Chancel Mbemba scored the only goal of the game to break Cameroonian hearts.",
      "DR Congo are set to face Nigeria in the final of the African play-offs, marking the end of Cameroon's hopes for qualification. Despite holding the record for the most World Cup appearances in Africa, having qualified eight times, Cameroon will not be part of the expanded 48-team tournament next year.",
      "United fans may see a silver lining in Mbeumo's disappointment as he exited the pitch post-match. With an increasingly packed annual fixture list and the African Cup of Nations looming, a summer rest ahead of his second season at Old Trafford could be beneficial.",
      "He'll be rejuvenated and ready to hit the ground running when the 2026/27 season kicks off.",
      "United have experienced a revival in recent weeks following a disappointing end to their previous campaign, which saw them finish 15th and lose the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "This term, with no European football to compete in, their full attention is on the Premier League and securing a return to the Champions League. Mbeumo has been instrumental in their recent run of form, contributing to four wins and two draws in their last seven matches.",
      "After the international break, United are set to host Everton at Old Trafford before travelling to Crystal Palace at the end of the month. Amorim will be hoping his star player can quickly move past the World Cup disappointment, with the focus firmly on climbing the league table in the coming weeks.",
      "It comes as Cristiano Ronaldo suffered heartbreak of his own on Thursday evening, seeing red during Portugal's clash with Ireland at the Aviva Stadium. The 40-year-old was initially only handed a yellow when he elbowed Dara O'Shea off the ball in the centre of the Irish area.",
      "However, after a review from VAR, referee Glynn Nyberg attended the pitch-side monitor for a second look at the incident - upgrading his card to a straight red in the aftermath. Portugal also lost the match 2-0 thanks to a Troy Parrott brace.",
      "It means that Ronaldo will miss his nation's final World Cup qualifier against Armenia, who currently sit bottom of Group F. He may also see himself suspended for Portugal's first match of the 2026 World Cup, depending on the punishment he receives for the sending-off and if Portugal qualify.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "That saw Sesko ruled out of Slovenia’s most recent camp. Heading into the break, boss Kek sent a message to United that he had yet to receive any information about his issue - while he also demanded ‘respect’. However, he has now clarified the situation and claimed that Red Devils chiefs quickly got in touch to establish the facts.",
      "He said: “Completely expected from the English media. But I emphasise once again: the moment communication was established between us and the Manchester United medical team, the problem was solved in five minutes.",
      "“I thank the club for their cooperation. Our medical team checked their documentation. The matter was quickly resolved.",
      "“I wish Benjamin a successful rehabilitation and a speedy return to the field, because everyone who knows him knows that he feels best there.”",
      "Kek’s most recent comments come after his outburst earlier this week. He said: “With all due respect to a great club like Manchester United, we have officially not received anything yet; no papers, no documents.",
      "“We would certainly like to get them. We want our medical team to also take a look at it. Our doctor is an expert in this field. We don’t have just anyone in this position.",

      "He added: “The national team is something very special and I expect maximum respect from everyone.",
      "“Slovenia deserves that, even if on the other side there is a powerhouse like England, and something as extraordinary as the Premier League. After all it has been quite some time since England defeated Slovenia and that in itself says something about us.”",

      "Ruben Amorim left one of his former players stunned after a shocking change of heart. The Manchester United boss has already experienced his fair share of clashes at Old Trafford, with high-profile disputes involving the likes of Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "For the 40-year-old, falling out with wingers seems almost habitual. Brazilian prospect Arthur Gomes was left shocked after Amorim appeared to guarantee him a starting role - only to retract that promise weeks later while they were still at Sporting.",
      "Amorim had brought Gomes to Sporting in 2022, impressed by his brilliant displays for Primeira Liga side Estoril. At the end of the 2022/23 season, Amorim personally phoned Gomes to assure him he was \"counting on him\" for the upcoming campaign.",
      "However, when Gomes returned from holiday just a fortnight later, the situation had completely changed. \"I received a call from the club director, who informed me that Ruben Amorim had changed his mind and was going to change the team's tactics,\" Gomes recounted on ESPN's Futebol no Mundo podcast.",
      "\"He told me that I was a player who needed to play and he didn't see me making a spot in the first team or on the bench. At the time I was shocked. Two weeks earlier he had said one thing and now I'm not going to be used much?\"",
      "Frustrated and confused, Gomes rang Amorim, only to hear the manager confirm the same news from the club director. \"I said that I wasn't going to try to change his mind,\" Gomes explained. \"I thanked him for the time I spent with him and I was going to see what I could do [in terms of leaving].\"",
      "A month later, Gomes was sold to Cruzeiro. Now 27, he plays for Dynamo Moscow, determined to show he can excel at a leading European team.",
      "Gomes' story sheds light on Amorim's style of managing players. Initially, the Portuguese coach \"showered\" him with praise, boosting his confidence and work ethic. Yet his tactical reversal felt like such a betrayal that it left Gomes no choice but to move on.",
      "\"My debut [for Estoril] was against Sporting. Ruben Amorim said he wanted me there [at Sporting]. He stated that, since my first game in Portugal, he had never taken his eyes off me,\" he remembered.",
      "\"When I arrived, on the first day, Ruben called me into his office and said: 'I'm going to push you every day, demand a lot from you, you're my bet'. He showered me with praise and gave me a lot of confidence.\"",
      "One of the standout moments of Gomes' spell at Sporting was his Champions League debut, where he came off the bench to score a remarkable goal against Tottenham. \"I was ecstatic, very happy to just be on the bench in the Champions League,\" he said.",
      "\"Amorim called me, I went, and almost nobody noticed I was going to enter because of the euphoria in the stadium. Not even my wife, who was in the stands,\" he recalled. Regarding the goal itself, he added: \"It was incredible.\"",

      "Eric Cantona has taken a fresh swipe at Sir Jim Ratcliffe, claiming the Manchester United chief \"didn't seem interested\" at the Frenchman's offer to help rebuild the club and that the current regime have \"destroyed\" Sir Alex Ferguson's legacy.",
      "Cantona revealed earlier this year that he had previously offered to aid Ratcliffe in his bid to turn United around. Said offer was not taken up by the Ineos chief, though, who completed his purchase of a minority stake in the club back in 2024.",
      "The former striker attacked Ratcliffe previously over redundancies at Old Trafford and even accused the club of “selling its soul”. And Cantona has now shed more light on why he offered to aid Ratcliffe and the Glazers and the former's response.",
      "“I have many other passions and projects, but I thought that for two or three years I could maybe put those to the side and try to give something to this club, which has given everything to me,” Cantona said at a show on his one-man tour, per The Telegraph.",
      "“But he didn’t seem interested. I did what I had to do, so I don’t feel guilty anymore. I tried my best. Sir Alex Ferguson created a style of beautiful attacking football, which the new owners should have used. Instead, they destroyed it.”",
      "Ferguson had established United as the dominant domestic force before standing down from his role as manager in 2015. He then transitioned into an ambassadorial role with the club before it emerged Ratcliffe and Co were moving to terminate the Scot's multi-million pound agreement.",
      "Cantona pulled no punches with his take on such a move when he spoke back in the Spring as well as questioning behind Ratcliffe's plans to build a new 100,000 seater stadium.",
      "“I remember a dressing room with players and Sir Alex Ferguson,” he said. “All these people you don’t know helped us to feel at home and be in a family. It’s very important to respect these people like you respect your manager and team-mates.",
      "“Since Ratcliffe arrived, it’s the complete opposite. He doesn’t want Sir Alex Ferguson as an ambassador any more. He is more than a legend and I think we have to find this soul again. This team of directors, they try to destroy everything. They don’t respect anybody. They even want to change the stadium.",
      "“The stadium is iconic. For me, Arsenal lost their soul when they left Highbury and I’m sure a lot of fans miss Highbury. It’s like when you go in a house and feel a special energy. Can you imagine Liverpool playing in another stadium than Anfield? It’s impossible. I don’t think United can play in another stadium than Old Trafford.",
      "“But I think maybe we are dreamers and they are more like an economy and a strategy. I hate this kind of thing. I hate this kind of decision.”",

      "It has taken two decades and more than 200 appearances for Cristiano Ronaldo to earn a red card in a senior Portugal game, but it's not the first dismissal of his career. Ronaldo was shown a straight red in Portugal's World Cup qualifying defeat against Ireland, and could miss the first game of next summer's tournament as a result, but he has also been sent off 12 times during his club career.",
      "The most recent of those club red cards came in April 2024, when his Al-Nassr side lost to Al-Hilal in the Saudi Super Cup. He also picked up a solitary red for Juventus in the 2018/19 Champions League and six for Real Madrid - four in La Liga, one in the Spanish Super Cup and one in the Copa del Rey.",
      "Before all that, though, Ronaldo was dismissed four times while at Manchester United. All four came during his first spell with the club, and one in particular prompted a fierce warning from then-manager Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Ronaldo's first career dismissal came at the tail end of the 2003/04 season when he picked up a late second booking in a victory over Aston Villa. He was also booked twice in a Manchester Derby victory in 2008, and earned two straight red cards in between those two.",
      "The first came for a stamp aimed at former United striker Andy Cole when the England international was playing for neighbours City, with United failing in their appeal against his suspension. Ferguson was less forgiving in 2007, when Portsmouth were the opponents.",
      "With seven minutes left on the clock at Fratton Park and the scores level, Pompey midfielder Sulley Muntari saw his own afternoon end early after a second booking. United looked primed to take full advantage, only for Ronaldo to headbutt Richard Hughes - yes, the man who would go on to become Liverpool sporting director - just two minutes later.",
      "There was no appeal from Ferguson this time. \"He has got to realise he is better than these other players and not to rise to their bait. He has got to rise above it,\" the United boss said.",
      "\"It was a trivial moment. One of the highlights of my career, but an insignificant encounter for Cristiano Ronaldo,\" Hughes would later tell Played Up Pompey Three. \"I’m not someone who scored loads of goals, so I have to remember other landmarks. Should I ever meet people who don’t necessarily remember me playing Premier League football, I can always tell them that one of the game’s greats headbutted me.",
      "\"Sir Alex Ferguson afterwards said Ronaldo shouldn’t get involved with inferior players. He was absolutely right, I am an inferior player. Did I take offence? Well, 99 per cent of the footballing world is inferior to Cristiano Ronaldo, so I had absolutely no problem with that!\"",
      "Ronaldo, for his part, seemed to take those comments to heart for the remainder of the campaign. He scored what was then a career high of 31 league goals, helping United win the league and Champions League.",
      "Against Ireland, though, Ferguson's advice appeared far from his thoughts. However, his current international boss, Roberto Martinez, offered some words of defence for the 40-year-old.",
      "“I think it's difficult for a player like Cristiano, who is in the area throughout the game and has to deal with defenders who are always making contact, always grabbing…\" Martinez said. \"There's no violence; Cristiano tries to clear the ball. He was unlucky. I think the angle of the images suggests worse than what happened. It's his first red card for the national team, which is still incredible.”",

      "Mbeumo was on the pitch from the start for Cameroon as they faced off against DR Congo in Morocco. The match remained deadlocked until the 91st minute.",
      "That's when Chancel Mbemba slipped in at the back post to send the ball past United loanee Andre Onana, triggering jubilant celebrations from the DR Congo side and leaving the Cameroon players devastated at full-time.",
      "This result means that DR Congo will now go head-to-head with Nigeria in the final, with the victors securing a spot in this summer's World Cup.",
      "After Cameroon's loss, Mbeumo couldn't conceal his disappointment. Footage circulating on social media shows the United striker clearly upset as he walks down the tunnel alone, pausing only briefly to exchange a quick handshake with a member of the coaching staff.",
      "Mbeumo is now set to return to United and begin preparations for the Premier League showdown against Everton following the international break. The 26-year-old has been a standout performer for United this season, bagging the Premier League player of the month award for October.",
      "In his last four Premier League matches, he has found the back of the net four times, including scoring the first goal against Tottenham in the 2-2 draw before the international break.",
      "While they failed to book a place in the World Cup, United could be without Mbeumo, along with teammate Amad, for up to six Premier League matches due to their participation in the Africa Cup of Nations, which kicks off next month. The tournament, running from 21 December to 18 January, will also see United lose Mbeumo and Amad, who is set to represent Ivory Coast.",

Roque has returned to Brazil after his move to Barca didn’t work out, but is now attracting attention from Premier League big-hitters, including Manchester United.",
      "The 20-year-old striker joined Barca in the summer of 2023 from Athletico Paranaense before moving that winter and making his debut in January 2024. But he struggled to make an impression under manager Xavi Hernandez and his fortunes didn’t turn under successor Hansi Flick, as he spent the 2024/25 season on loan with Real Betis.",
      "In February, he took the decision to return to Brazil with Palmeiras, who paid a Brazilian record fee of £22million, and has re-found his form, contributing 16 goals and three assists in 30 league appearances to earn a recall to the national team. But he may not stay in his home country for long, with reports suggesting that United, Chelsea and Tottenham are monitoring his situation.",
      "Earlier this month, his agent said he was bracing himself for offers around €50m (£44m) in the January transfer window. And it seems that, while he is enjoying his time at Palmeiras, Roque has ambitions to return to Europe.",
      "Speaking about his move to Barcelona while on international duty, he said: “It wasn’t about money, no. I have between 10 and 15 years left in my career, God willing. It’s not the time to think about that. But of course, when I left, I had a career plan for myself. Every athlete dreams of playing for a club like Barcelona, one of the best clubs in the world. It’s a dream.”",
      "He added: “It’s also a dream to return to Europe, to adapt. God willing, I’ll continue doing my job at Palmeiras, because that’s my goal today, and in the future I’ll return to Europe.”",
      "Speaking earlier this month, Roque’s agent, Andre Cury, said: “Today we're receiving a barrage of calls from European clubs, mainly Premier League and Italian clubs. They're calling to ask about the price and terms, but we're in the middle of the season.",
      "“We already had an offer from the Arab world of 35 million euros, which wasn't of interest, and now we're going to get a proposal in the region of 50 million euros from the Premier League.”",
      "He added: “The plan was to come back here, get strong again, and also study the market. If a good offer comes along for everyone and they understand that he has to leave, he's open to listening, but he's very happy at Palmeiras.”",
      "Manchester United spent £200m on players in the summer, with three of their four additions coming in attack where Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arrived. They are understood to be prioritising a central midfielder as their next addition.",

      "It's been a turbulent start to the season but Manchester United are finally showing signs of stability under Ruben Amorim. Consecutive 2-2 draws with Tottenham and Nottingham Forest before the international break don't look great on paper but they extended United's unbeaten run to five games - their longest streak since Amorim took charge.",
      "With five wins and three draws from their opening 11 matches, the Red Devils sit seventh in the Premier League, within sight of the top four. However, for all the signs of progress, plenty of issues remain.",
      "Chief among them is the form of their £74million summer signing Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian striker has shown flashes of promise but has managed just two goals in 12 appearances so far.",
      "If United are to sustain this mini revival, they'll need greater consistency in front of goal - and Sesko's fortunes could prove pivotal, not just for the club, but for Amorim too.",
      "The Portuguese manager's position feels relatively secure for the moment, but it remains precarious and another downturn in results could quickly put his job back on the line. With that in mind, here at the latest Manchester United-related headlines.",
      "Premier League icon Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has claimed that Amorim hasn't improved a single aspect of Manchester United since taking charge at Old Trafford. Despite the club's recent upturn in form, the former Chelsea striker insists he remains unconvinced by the 40-year-old manager.",
      "\"Yes, they have been in a final in Europe but lost against a poor side - Tottenham were a poor side last year. He has got a lot of work to do, a lot of work. I don't think they are creative enough, not like they used to be.\"",
      "Despite Hasselbaink's criticism, United's owners are said to be pleased with Amorim's recent progress and remain increasingly confident that he can turn the club's fortunes around.",
      "Whatever happens, Amorim has vowed not to change his approach. \"During my career as a manager, most of the time I was winning,\" he told MUTV recently.",
      "\"When you are winning, you can say that you have convictions and you are loyal to your ideas, but you learn when you lose, when you are under pressure and I learned that when I’m under pressure, I’m stronger on my ideas and I keep with my ideas.",
      "\"Of course, it's really important to feel the support of everyone in the club, especially the fans that help you, to give you that confidence to continue on your path, but that was the biggest learning point: when I'm under pressure, I can stick with my plan.\"",
      "Tensions around Benjamin Sesko have been rising after the Slovenian national team were reportedly left in the dark over the striker's fitness. Sesko picked up a knock against Tottenham and was later assessed by United's medical staff, who deemed him unfit for international duty.",
      "The decision angered Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek, who accused United of showing a lack of respect by preventing his medical team from conducting their own assessment.",
      "According to reports, Kek even threatened to spark a 'diplomatic incident' before United eventually provided medical evidence to support their ruling.",
      "In response the Slovenian FA released the following statement : \"The medical team of the Slovenian national football team received the complete medical documentation from Manchester United regarding Benjamin Sesko's health condition following his injury on Saturday, including the current clinical picture and the examinations performed.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the injury currently does not allow for the training process. In the coming days, additional examinations and the start of treatment are planned at the club, so Benjamin will unfortunately not be able to participate in this national team action. We wish Benjamin a speedy recovery and a return to the football field as soon as possible.\"",
      "His withdrawal from international duty means Sesko will go a full calendar year without scoring for Slovenia. The 22-year-old - widely regarded as the brightest talent in Slovenian football - has netted 16 goals in 45 appearances for his country, with his last coming in November 2024.",

      "Roy Keane has claimed that Marcus Rashford should now be in the England starting XI instead of Anthony Gordon, stressing rival players \"wouldn’t want to face him\".",
      "Rashford fell out of favour when it came to the Three Lions over the past couple of years, with the Newcastle star usurping him in the pecking order. But following a bright start to life to his loan spell with Spanish giants Barcelona, the forward has found himself back in the England fold under Thomas Tuchel. Rashford started in his nation's penultimate World Cup qualifier against Serbia at Wembley and impressed on the left-flank.",
      "Former United star Keane believes Rashford's form is good enough to see him retain his spot over Newcastle forward Gordon. Speaking on ITV Football, Keane said: \"If you’re comparing the two of them, Rashford and Gordon at their very best, I’m going for Rashford.",
      "\"He (Rashford) can still frustrate you, of course, but he’s a threat and when he’s on top form he is a handful. You wouldn’t want to face him.\"",
      "Speaking at half-time at Wembley, Keane added: \"He’s been busy [against Serbia], he’s been lively, he’s made a couple of runs but he’s probably a little disappointed with his end product because he’s in great form and doing really well at Barcelona.",
      "\"His movement off the ball… He looks confident. Nice link up play on the left-hand side [with Nico O’Reilly]. He’s been a threat. But at the end of it, you want a bit more.\"",
      "Rashford's display for England was one in a series of eye-catching performances for the forward across what has been an impressive season. The 28-year-old has six goals and nine assists in all competitions so far for Barcelona.",
      "He will certainly be aiming to carry that form onto the international stage for England. Rashford's last goal for the Three Lions came back in September in a 5-0 win against Serbia.",
      "Speaking about his side's latest outing, boss Thomas Tuchel said: \"Yes, I liked it. It was difficult – sometimes a bit too open, sometimes we had to defend with everything we had, sometimes we needed a bit of luck to force them to shoot wide.",
      "\"It is good if everything is not as easy - so we had to wait very long until the decisive goal. Then to make it safe. That is good for us - the effort was good. First half I was very happy with the first half. In the second half we didn't get the pressing always right.",
      "\"The game got a little too open because they escaped in a deep build-up against us and had fast attacks that we could completely control in the first half.",
      "\"Compliments to the back four. They had to work hard and be focused all the time. Serbia has individual qualities and is also a physical team. They came with a new energy, so well done.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has delivered the ideal riposte to his Argentina snub and any worries about his conduct. The 21-year-old last featured for his nation in November 2024, with his closing six months or so at Manchester United proving equally challenging.",
      "After being dropped by Ruben Amorim against Manchester City in December, Garnacho battled for consistent starts in the first team. He was left out of the squad for their season finale against Aston Villa - four days after losing to Tottenham in the Europa League final - having been informed by Amorim he was permitted to leave.",
      "His West London arrival was greeted with limited enthusiasm and some apprehension given his past behavioural issues. Former Argentina star Oscar Ruggeri has claimed that explains his absence from the national setup for over 12 months in a scathing assessment of Garnacho.",
      "He told ESPN: \"He's no better than anyone else, you're a football player, enjoy it, but you shouldn't be so full of yourself. It's pointless because you miss out on so much.",
      "\"Someone has to bring him down to earth. They're not calling him up to the national team. If he comes back down to earth like he was, they'll call him up again because he's phenomenal on the pitch.\"",
      "It seemingly hasn't been a problem at Chelsea, however, Garnacho, impressing at Cobham with his 'attitude and intensity' during training sessions, according to a report from Give Me Sport.",
      "The young talent has also been putting in extra hours to enhance his game in the final third, which was evident in Chelsea's last two matches where he scored a goal and provided two assists.",
      "In the Champions League against Qarabag, Garnacho equalised just eight minutes after coming on, with a clever left-footed finish. Three days later, he provided two assists in Chelsea's comfortable 3-0 victory over Wolves in the Premier League.",
      "He delivered an excellent cross for Malo Gusto to score the opening goal, before outpacing Santiago Bueno and setting up Pedro Neto with a perfectly weighted cross.",
      "Despite his impressive performances, it seems that Garnacho's impact came too late to be considered by Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni for their upcoming matches, despite club teammate Enzo Fernandez and Real Madrid's Franco Mastantuono being side-lined due to injuries.",
      "However, if Garnacho continues to perform at this level, it's highly likely that he'll be back in contention for a spot at the World Cup.",

      "Napoli are stepping up their search for a new midfielder amid links with Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo. The Italian side are reportedly one of a number of clubs interested in Mainoo following a frustrating season.",
      "After previously playing a consistent role in the first team under Erik ten Hag, Mainoo has not had the same opportunities this term under Ruben Amorim. The young midfielder has made just seven Premier League appearances this term, with all of them coming as a substitute.",
      "A deart of game time - combined with having just 18 months left on his contract - have led to suggestions that he could soon leave Old Trafford. Scott McTominay has reportedly been one of those attempting to convince Napoli to make a move, with the Italian club’s need for a midfielder having worsened over recent days.",
      "Current star Frank Zambo Anguissa looks set to be restricted to the sidelines for the foreseeable future, which has seen Napoli step up their search. A statement read: “Frank Anguissa, who sustained an injury while on international duty, underwent medical tests on Thursday at Pineta Grande Hospital which revealed a high-grade lesion to the biceps femoris in his left thigh. The Napoli midfielder has already begun his rehabilitation programme.”",
      "According to Italian outlet Sport Mediaset, Mainoo is one of two options currently on the table. It is suggested that Udinese star Atta is also among those under consideration, albeit he could command a €20m (£17.6m) price tag.",
      "Napoli’s fresh links to Mainoo come amid suggestions from former United star Dimitar Berbatov that Amorim’s treatment of the midfielder is ‘cruel’. Speaking to the Daily Mail, the Bulgarian said: \"It's a very tough situation, especially for a young player.",
      "“And it shows you how football can be a really cruel game at times because Kobbie Mainoo was playing, he reached the England national team, he was going up, up, and up. All of a sudden he is not being picked.",
      "\"Now the question is, does he stay positive, patient, and wait for his moment again? Or he needs to move to a different place to play regularly to get his confidence back and come back to United and start playing more regularly?",
      "\"I'd like to see him play because the talent is there to see, that decision-making, that calmness and arrogance which you need with the ball at your feet is there, even at his age. I like that. But at the moment, the manager doesn't see something he can use from the first minute of the game.\"",

      "Roy Keane's body language said it all when Anthony Martial's name cropped up during a recent episode of The Overlap. The former Manchester United captain slumped back in his chair and gazed at the ceiling at the mere mention of the ex-Red Devils striker.",
      "The United legend was alongside Gary Neville, Ian Wright, Jill Scott, Paul Scholes and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Thursday's instalment of the podcast, with the panel dissecting all things Old Trafford. As the show neared its end, Neville fired quick questions at Solskjaer about his managerial stint between 2018 and 2021.",
      "The Irishman dramatically flung himself backwards into his seat as Neville spoke, grinning whilst staring blankly at the studio roof. Following a brief giggle from the group, Solskjaer responded: \"So talented. On his day he was unplayable.\"",
      "When Neville directly asked Keane about his feelings towards Martial, the 54-year-old pulled a face before delivering his verdict: \"That's not a good thing what Ole just said. 'On his day,' that means you don't get many of them.\"",
      "Hopes were sky-high for Martial when he pitched up at Old Trafford in 2015 following a £36 million switch from Monaco. But destiny had different ideas for the striker.",
      "Keane was also especially scathing about the 29-year-old's failure to regularly hit the target in a United shirt, launching a withering attack on Martial after a 1-0 defeat to Newcastle United in December 2023.",
      "\"He's touching balls off and gives the ball away cheaply. You may as well go down the leagues. Man United have been trying to get rid of him a few years ago.",

      "Amorim had not won back-to-back Premier League games since his arrival, but the United boss enjoyed an outstanding October, winning three games on the bounce against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Here are how the players have rated so far this season:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "The bar was low to impress between the sticks, but Lammens has made a huge impact since his strong debut against Sunderland. The Belgium international has made a supremely confident start to life at Old Trafford, and the \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" chants tell you how he has performed. 7",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "It was only a matter of time before Bayindir lost his first-choice status. He made a mistake against Arsenal on the opening day of the campaign and another error against Burnley at Old Trafford. Made some good saves against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium, but still conceded three. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Has started every Premier League game on the left side of the back three. Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby, but he bounced back against Chelsea in the following week and hasn't really put a foot wrong since then. His passing has been a huge asset from the back. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Maguire started on the bench for the first four games of the campaign. Technically recorded an assist against Chelsea and scored the matchwinner at Anfield. Maguire has produced some memorable moments during his United career, but he will look back on that goal with particular fondness. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "De Ligt has markedly improved this season. He is showing the kind of form that saw him earn a reputation as one of Europe's best defensive prospects, and he is delivering consistent performances each week. He is still the only United player to have played every minute in the Premier League. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Yoro has started seven league games this season. He has been substituted off in five of those matches, with Amorim reshuffling his defensive line in the closing stages of contests. Looked to have scored for United at Craven Cottage in August, but it was marked down as an own-goal. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "It's been a mixed bag for Dalot this season. Has recently been asked to play at left-wing back, and he didn't look comfortable in that role - he is better on the right - against Sunderland and Nottingham Forest. Was dropped to face Tottenham last weekend. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Dorgu looked sharp in pre-season and started the campaign full of confidence, but he has delivered some unconvincing performances and his end product around the box must improve. Dorgu did not start once during United's excellent run of three wins on the bounce throughout October. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Has played just over 200 minutes across five appearances this season due to injuries. Mazraoui performed well against Spurs last weekend and it felt harsh to remove him before the hour mark. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven",
      "Heaven started against Grimsby in August when Blundell Park felt like hell. The youngster has made just two substitute appearances in the league, but he provided an assist in the 4-2 win against Brighton. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Has become hugely important this season. United have conceded five goals when Casemiro has been on the pitch and 15 when he has been off it. Also contributed goals against Chelsea, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, so he's been one of the standout performers. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fernandes' performance against Tottenham encapsulated his season so far - he was poor but played the corner into the box for the equaliser. Has scored two goals and recorded three assists in total, but missed penalties against Fulham and Brentford. Could easily go up another level. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Looked bright without scoring when starting the first three matches of the campaign. Scored brilliantly to open the scoring against Sunderland and was industrious against Liverpool. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Was far too weak when allowing Wilson Odobert to breeze past him for Tottenham's first goal last Saturday. Ugarte was off the pace against Grimsby and has struggled when introduced from the bench. 3",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Mainoo has not really made a negative or positive contribution due to his lack of involvement. Was absent against Spurs due to a knock, and hopefully that injury is nothing serious. 5",
      "Amad",
      "His relationship with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed as the season has developed. He assisted Mbeumo against Liverpool and Tottenham, and scored a stunning goal against Forest to salvage a point. Has delivered strong performances from right wing-back. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo is the current favourite to win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award. The Cameroon international was unstoppable before the international break and he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for October. Six goals in 12 appearances for United. 8",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Has made a big impact since his arrival and scored his first goal for the club against Brighton, but Cunha would have liked to have more goals and assists to his name. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Sesko started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford. Built on that by scoring against Sunderland, but has failed to fire since that game in early October. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Can't mark Zirkzee higher or lower than a five - he hasn't started once. 5",

      "Manchester United supporters tend not to listen to outside pundits speaking about their club.",
      "Hearing what Gary Neville, Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and the likes say about the Reds often holds more weight than those who have not experienced the environment of Old Trafford for themselves. However, if you happened to be on social media this week, you may have come across former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's assessment of United.",
      "This assessment from Hasselbaink was truly baffling considering that it can be easily disproven. Comparing the first 11 games of this season to last, shows a marked improvement under Amorim.",
      "United may have conceded more goals but they are seven better off than this time last season in the Premier League and three points up too. The Reds were four points off the top four after 11 games in 2024/25, now they are just one.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "And that is just looking at the figures in black and white. Watching United this season, you can see they are a much better unit too.",
      "There is some real quality at the top of the pitch this campaign and you can see that Amorim's hard work on the training ground is starting to come good. This assessment that United have not improved under Amorim, compared to Erik ten Hag, focuses too much on how last season ended.",
      "United's Premier League campaign was sacrificed to aim for Europa League glory. Barring a poor performance against Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, this tactic would have worked a treat.",
      "So, if we have managed to prove the theory that United have not got better under Amorim is incorrect, we now must look at why they have managed to improve. For that, you don't need to go too far beyond the four undroppables that the Reds have on their books.",
      "Luke Shaw, Matthijs de Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo are the only players at Old Trafford who have started every single Premier League game heading into the November international break. What United have lacked in recent years is a solid core to their squad that provides consistency and quality.",
      "You look at the middle of the park now, there is a quartet of players there who Amorim clearly trusts and relies upon. It is perhaps no surprise to see Fernandes makes the cut but full credit must be given to Shaw, De Ligt and Mbeumo for stepping up to the plate.",
      "Does this mean that United are the finished article ahead of a top-four push? Of course not.",
      "In an ideal world, you would be wanting Benjamin Sesko to be an undroppable at this stage but there are still question marks surrounding his ability. Having said that, it is early days for the 22-year-old in the Premier League so patience will be needed.",
      "Senne Lammens has started well to life in Manchester but it will be intriguing to see if he can keep up the levels throughout the course of the season and become Amorim's next undroppable. But, all the early signs are pointing in the right direction there.",
      "For United now, the next five matches are incredibly important. Everton and West Ham at home, as well as Wolverhampton Wanderers away, are games they should be winning comfortably if they are to qualify for the Champions League next season.",
      "The trip to Crystal Palace and the in-form Bournemouth heading to Old Trafford provide difficult opposition. But, should they negotiate those hurdles, there is no reason why the Reds can't be in an even stronger position heading into the festive period.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Roy Keane has insisted that Marcus Rashford deserves to start for England ahead of Anthony Gordon, emphasising that opposition players \"wouldn't want to face him\".",
      "Rashford had slipped down the Three Lions pecking order over recent years, with the Newcastle United winger overtaking him in the selection hierarchy.",
      "However, following an impressive beginning to his loan spell at Spanish heavyweights Barcelona from Manchester United, the attacker has worked his way back into the England squad under Thomas Tuchel. It comes amid United being faced with a decision over his future this summer if Barca choose not to take up their option to buy him for around £28m.",

      "Wayne Rooney has revealed how his eldest son, Kai, has switched positions to adapt to the modern game.",
      "The 16-year-old has been part of the Manchester United academy since 2020, where he has excelled across various age groups as a striker. However, the Reds legend recently disclosed that Kai has transitioned to the right wing, underlining the challenge the modern game presents regarding players' reluctance to operate as a traditional number nine.",
      "During a discussion on the Wayne Rooney Show about young English strikers struggling to adjust to Premier Leaguefootball, the 40-year-old responded: \"The standard of English players has increased massively, I just think it's purely because they don't want to play number nine.",

      "Former Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has had his say on Jadon Sancho's time at Old Trafford.",
      "The English winger joined United in the summer of 2021, but fell out of favour at Old Trafford under both Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim. After being sidelined from the squad by two different managers, he has been sent on three separate loan spells, the first of which saw him return to his former club Borussia Dortmund, where he played a crucial role in getting the German side to the Champions League final.",
      "He was loaned to Chelsea last season, with his move including a £25million obligation-to-buy clause. However, the Blues chose to pay a fifth of that as a penalty fee for not exercising that option.",
      "Read more here",
      "Former Premier League star Don Hutchison feels United would be foolish not to consider re-signing Welbeck. The in-form Bright striker's leadership and experience could also really help Benjamin Sesko, who has scored two goals in 11 appearances.",
      "In an interview with SportCasting, Hutchinson said: \"I mean, it'd be a brilliant fit. He'd be a fantastic signing because Danny Welbeck's one of those players, where if he went back to Man United, it would be like when Jonny Evans returned.",
      "\"When Johnny Evans went back there a couple of years ago, he was happy to be a sort of mentor inside the dressing room. He was happy to be a mentor to the players that were playing. He was happy to play his part when needed. He was happy to be on the bench.",
      "\"I think Danny Welbeck going to Man United would be a really good fit in terms of he can still play, he can still score goals, he's still really fit. But he would still have the attitude where it would be a fantastic move forward, being back to Man United with the knowledge that he'd be mentoring the likes of Sesko. I think it would be a perfect move.\"",

      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano reports the left-back remains on the chopping block and won't stay at Old Trafford beyond 2026.",
      "His contract expires at the end of the campaign, so United could edge him out in January for a small fee.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly informed Joshua Zirkzee he's going nowhere in January.",
      "Despite the forward's lack of action and having slipped down the pecking order, the Dutchman has been told there is 'no chance' of him being let go, as per The Sun.",
      "With United losing Bryan Mbeumo and Amad to the African Cup of Nations, which starts on December 21, Zirkzee's minutes are set to increase over the winter period. It means clubs like West Ham and Everton may well have to look elsewhere to bolster their attack.",
      "Slovenia boss Matjaz Kek has revealed that any potential problems between the national team and Manchester United over Benjamin Sesko were quickly solved.",
      "The centre-forward picked up an injury during the draw with Tottenham which casted doubt over his fitness for fixtures over the international break.",
      "\"Completely expected from the English media,\" Slovenia head coach Kek said when presented with the idea that his initial comments regarding the lack of communication over Sesko were sensationalized.",
      "\"But I emphasise once again: the moment communication was established between us and the Manchester United medical team, the problem was solved in five minutes. I thank the club for their cooperation. Our medical team checked their documentation.",
      "\"The matter was quickly resolved. I wish Benjamin a successful rehabilitation and a speedy return to the field, because everyone who knows him knows that he feels best there.\"",
      "Manchester United will almost certainly face competition from Premier League rivals if they decide to actively pursue a transfer for Antoine Semenyo.",

      "It has been specifically noted that Spurs are looking at bringing in another forward in the winter window, particularly one that can play off the left.",
      "Manchester United have signed a number of young talents in recent years and look to be repeating that with Sporting CP's latest emerging starlet.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, a move for versatile teenager Salvador Blopa is being explored. Capable of playing at right-back or right-midfield, he has been compared to Paris Saint Germain's Nuno Mendes.",
      "He made quite the impact on his first-team debut last month with two goals in a 5-1 Portuguese league cup triumph over Alverca.",
      "He was also an unused substitute for the draw against Juventus in the Champions League the following week. Most of his appearances this season have arrived for the under-23s.",
      "Manchester United are moving out of their London offices in Kensington just two years on from signing a decade-long lease, as revealed by The Daily Mail.",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ractliffe has already made a number of significant decisions at the club in order to save money. While their new and smaller offices in Covent Garden will cost far less to rent, the report has added that is not the primary motivation.",
      "A few reasons for the move are to do with its location in London as it will be closer to Euston station while also placing them nearer other companies they work alongside.",
      "Manchester United supporters will love Matheus Cunha's response to being asked if he would ever join Arsenal.",
      "He has been in good form for United since sealing a £62.5million transfer from Wolves which has seen him called up to Brazil squad again.",

      "The 59-year-old was revealed to be the former player approached to help a Middle Eastern consortium launch a takeover bid of United. That has since gone quiet but Cantona has made his feelings brutally clear on the Glazers and Ratcliffe at an event in Drogheda, Ireland via the Telegraph.",
      "I have many other passions and projects, but I thought that for two or three years I could maybe put those to the side and try to give something to this club, which has given everything to me. But he didn’t seem interested.",
      "I did what I had to do, so I don’t feel guilty anymore. I tried my best. Sir Alex Ferguson created a style of beautiful attacking football, which the new owners should have used. Instead, they destroyed it.",
      "Several Manchester United players were in action for their respective national teams on Thursday evening.",
      "Marcus Rashford played 64 minutes of England's win over Serbia but it was not an enjoyable evening for other stars including Bryan Mbeumo with defeat to DR Congo meaning Cameroon will not be at next summer's World Cup.",
      "Andre Onana, on loan at Trabzonspor from United, was in goal for Cameroon but could do nothing about Chancel Mbemba's late winner.",
      "Portugal are also yet to qualify with a 2-0 loss to Ireland taking it down to the final game. Diogo Dalot played the full 90 minutes while Bruno Fernandes missed out through suspension and former player Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off.",
      "Transfer interest from Chelsea and Tottenham in Marcus Rashford has come as quite the shock, but Barcelona's potential reason for not wanting to sign him permanently is not too surprising.",
      "According to Spanish outlet El Nacional, Barcelona are not guaranteed to activate the £30million buy-option clause to sign him permanently as the bulk of their transfer budget is expected to be used on signing a successor to Robert Lewandowksi.",
      "Given their financial problems, such a stance certainly makes sense but their report has also claimed that there are also some concerns over Rashford's end product specially with regard to goals and where he would fit in once all of Barcelona's star attackers are fit.",
      "Reported Manchester United transfer target Victor Roque has spoken about his ambitions to return to Europe.",
      "The player made a move to Barcelona in 2023, but failed to make an impact and returne to Brazil with Palmeiras back in February.",
      "It's there he has again caught the eye, scoring 16 goals in 30 league appearances.",
      "During international duty, Roque spoke about his move to Barcelona and his future ambitions.",
      "“It wasn’t about money, no. I have between 10 and 15 years left in my career, God willing. It’s not the time to think about that,\" he said.",
      "\"But of course, when I left, I had a career plan for myself. Every athlete dreams of playing for a club like Barcelona, one of the best clubs in the world. It’s a dream.”",
      "He added: “It’s also a dream to return to Europe, to adapt. God willing, I’ll continue doing my job at Palmeiras, because that’s my goal today, and in the future I’ll return to Europe.”",

      "\"He deserves it because he has been nothing but impressive. He has to keep on going now though. He is a very complete and mobile midfielder, and that's what he keeps showing me.\"",
      "He did however refuse to confirm that his place in the World Cup squad has been sealed.",
      "\"He still has a long career ahead of him and a long way to go,\" Tuchel added. \"There are no guarantees, especially not publicly, for the World Cup.",
      "\"It doesn't help me right now to give predictions or guarantees to my players because it is all about competition at the moment.",

      "Last week, England U20s manager Ben Futcher called up Lacey for their match against Japan on Friday night in Doncaster. However, the 18-year-old, who only made his debut for the U20s last month against Switzerland, has already caught the eye of Carsley.",
      "While at St George's Park, Carsley drafted Lacey into two training sessions with the U21s and the former interim England senior manager has admitted he has one eye on the winger becoming part of his team. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he said: \"He's been in the pathway a good amount of time now and he's a player that we rate highly.",

      "The comments come with the midfielder again linked with a move away from the club.",
      "Speaking to the Daily Mail, Berbatov said:",
      "\"It's a very tough situation, especially for a young player.",
      "“And it shows you how football can be a really cruel game at times because Kobbie Mainoo was playing, he reached the England national team, he was going up, up, and up. All of a sudden he is not being picked.",
      "\"Now the question is, does he stay positive, patient, and wait for his moment again? Or he needs to move to a different place to play regularly to get his confidence back and come back to United and start playing more regularly?",
      "\"I'd like to see him play because the talent is there to see, that decision-making, that calmness and arrogance which you need with the ball at your feet is there, even at his age. I like that. But at the moment, the manager doesn't see something he can use from the first minute of the game.\"",
      "Manchester United have been handed a possible boost in their pursuit of Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",

      "That means that they won't play in the World Cup in the summer. It therefore gives the player more time to possibly compete a move in the summer transfer window, should United decide to pursue him again.",

      "Manchester City are understandably delighted that the Etihad Stadium has been selected as a host venue for Euro 2028.",
      "City have invested heavily in the stadium and believe that has been the key to their selection as a host venue, but the truth is Manchester United have had a hand in the decision.",
      "Euro 2028 will be played in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Old Trafford is the largest club football ground in the UK, but it withdrew from the venue selection process two years ago.",
      "United did not want to commit their stadium to being involved in the tournament amid ongoing discussions over the future of Old Trafford, and a mutual decision was reached with the Football Association to withdraw it from consideration, which meant the Etihad's bid to host in Manchester went unchallenged.",
      "Simply put, you could argue the Etihad has only been chosen to host Euro 2028 games in Manchester because Old Trafford couldn't commit to hosting during the tournament.",
      "City will likely feel that they would have been selected as a host venue regardless. The Etihad will expand capacity to over 60,000 when the North Stand redevelopment is complete.",
      "The Medlock hotel is part of the club's £300million expansion project, and it will boast 401 rooms in what has been billed as City's new \"entertainment destination\" in the new year.",
      "When the hosting venues were confirmed this week, City's managing director of operations said: “Hosting five matches as part of Euro 2028, including England’s opening match should they qualify directly, will be a special moment for the club, the city, and most importantly – its people.",
      "“Manchester has a proud history of hosting some of the world’s best sporting and cultural events, including the Commonwealth Games in 2002, which kick-started the sports-led regeneration of this area of Manchester.",
      "“Thanks to our work alongside Manchester City Council and the club’s continued commitment to investing in world-class facilities, we are proud to continue bringing the best of the world to Manchester, and in turn, showcasing the best of Manchester to the world.”",
      "City chiefs would have backed the Etihad to be selected ahead of Old Trafford in a potential venue battle due to their investment in facilities, but the bottom line is that Old Trafford has a greater capacity.",
      "Only Camp Nou (Barcelona), the Bernabeu (Real Madrid), Signal Iduna Park (Borussia Dortmund) and Olympiastadion (Hertha Berlin) hold more fans than Old Trafford from clubs in Europe.",
      "Old Trafford has a capacity of 74,197, which might have ultimately put the ground ahead of the Etihad had a decision been required from UEFA between the two venues for Euro 2028.",
      "United's home is regarded as an iconic football arena, whereas the Etihad lacks that rich history as a relatively newly-built stadium. Both grounds have similar public transport links and are close to Manchester city centre.",
      "Old Trafford would have had a greater capacity and a wealth of history in its favour, although there is no denying that the facilities at the Etihad are better after continued investment.",
      "We'll never know which stadium would have won in a potential Euro 2028 venue battle, and it's great to see the Etihad be selected to host five games due to the benefits it will bring to the region.",
      "The leader of Manchester City Council, Councillor Bev Craig, said: \"Manchester is known the world over as a great footballing city and we could not be more excited to be welcoming such a prestigious tournament, which is enjoyed by millions of fans around the world, to our city.",
      "\"We're a city where football runs deep in our DNA and we're counting down the days to UEFA Euro 2028. As well as our unrivalled love for football, the city brings together an exceptional network of partners who are working tirelessly to ensure a world-class experience for players, fans, and visitors alike.",
      "\"As well as enjoying some fantastic football from world-class players at the top of their game right here on our doorstep, we'll be going all out to maximise the benefits to Manchester of hosting the tournament, and with a projected economic boost to the local economy of over £200million, it's an absolute win-win for the city and for local residents.\"",

      "When Woodward made that comment, United were trailing Manchester City by 19 points in the Premier League, which further stoked tensions among an already disgruntled fanbase.",
      "Woodward rubbed supporters up the wrong way, but he was right. United are commercial giants and their global fame, sponsorship deals and broadcast revenue mean the coffers will never be empty.",
      "The club's latest financial figures were published in September, revealing a record revenue of £666.5million, despite the failure to qualify for any form of European football this term.",
      "However, United are still losing money when interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation are included, although the net loss was £33m in 2025, down from the £113m loss in 2024.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe launched an audit following his investment into the club and immediately began to cut costs. The scale of the cuts have been controversial and the identity of the club has been damaged - but September's financial numbers show Ratcliffe's changes have had the desired effect.",
      "Every outgoing penny at Old Trafford is now scrutinised. Ratcliffe has ordered his regime to leave no stone unturned in the effort to save money, so the current sponsorship situation will be a priority.",
      "United are in discussions to find a new sleeve sponsor and training kit sponsor. Their training gear £24m per season agreement with Tezos concluded at the end of June, and the £20m per season sleeve sponsorship deal with DXC Technology will expire at the end of the current campaign.",
      "For four seasons, DXC has been featured on the club’s home, away and third kits, providing global brand exposure for the tech company. The multi-year partnership has also seen DXC use their expertise to improve the way United engage with fans through their digital platforms.",
      "The Premier League permitted sleeve sponsorship from the start of 2017/18. United announced the first sponsors of their sleeves, Kohler, for the following campaign under a multi-year agreement. That deal ended in 2022, which led to DXC coming in.",
      "The Tezos-branded training kit had been worn by United's first-team squad across the last three years, and the logo had also featured on the training kit worn by the women's team.",
      "Matheus Cunha was pictured in a Tezos-sponsored hoodie in unveiling pictures when he signed from Wolves, but the deal had expired by the time of Bryan Mbeumo's arrival.",
      "Tezos replaced AON as the club's training kit sponsor when they struck their deal in 2022. United were without a training kit sponsor in 2021/2022 after the conclusion of their agreement with AON.",
      "History has repeated itself this season. United are currently without a training kit sponsor, but sources have indicated there is a \"strong pipeline\" of prospects for both sleeve and training kit sponsorships.",
      "The Tezos and DXC deals were thought to be worth a combined £44m per season, so it's crucial that United negotiate the best deal they can find from that \"strong pipeline\" of prospects.",
      "There is confidence within the club that similarly lucrative sponsorship deals will be agreed, but it will be interesting to see whether they are worth less, or whether the sleeve and kit sponsorship rights could be sold as part of a single, more comprehensive package.",
      "It's possible that United's lack of success will finally have an impact on how much they will command from sponsors. Marriott International's deal with United ended in the summer due to its company-wide cost-cutting, but perhaps it might have continued if the club had been performing better.",
      "Marriott International may have decided to extend their deal if United had been prominent in the Champions League, for example. Obviously, their decision might have been completely unrelated to results, but performing well on the pitch can only be a positive when trying to get the best sponsorship deals.",
      "It seems likely United will announce new partners for sleeve and training kit sponsorship in the near future. They have an opportunity to further boost their revenue with those new commercial deals.",

      "Rashford wanted Barca in January but an approach was not deemed viable by the La Liga giants. Fortunately for the United academy graduate, they returned in the summer and the deal was done.",
      "He joined the Camp Nou club on a season-long loan with the option to purchase him in the summer. If all goes according to plan for United, Rashford will impress, Barca will trigger that option and the winger's time in Spain continues.",
      "Six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances suggests Barca will want to keep Rashford. Whether they have the finances to do it is another issue. Barca can sign the England international for £28m in the summer but the financial pressures Barcelona face are well documented.",
      "No matter how well Rashford does at Barca or for England, he will not have a place to come back to at Old Trafford. Amorim has made his mind up and therefore the task would be to find him a new club.",

In Spain, El Nacional has reported that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have both made early contact with Rashford's agent to try and persuade him to move to the Premier League. United can't let that happen.",
      "If he was to impress in the Premier League, suddenly Rashford becomes a more prominent issue for the United head coach. So ideally United must find a way of making things work with Barca. The alternative of him returning to England with Chelsea or Spurs is not worth thinking about.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly scaling down their London office as part of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's ongoing cost-cutting measures. INEOS chief, Ratcliffe, has been fervently striving to economise since assuming control of United in February 2024.",
      "Ratcliffe has been candid about his conviction that United must significantly curtail spending and has made approximately 450 staff redundancies since taking the helm. The petrochemicals tycoon has also withdrawn staff benefits and hiked ticket prices at Old Trafford.",
      "In September, United announced record financial revenue of £666.5 million, record commercial revenue of £333.3 million, and record matchday revenue of £160.3 million. However, the measures persist, with United's London-based staff being relocated from their current Kensington office to a smaller Covent Garden site.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that United have prematurely ended their 10-year lease in Kensington after just two years. A substantial rent reduction is understood to be involved, although the club have emphasised that cost-saving isn't the primary motive for the move, citing the new location as more beneficial for various reasons.",
      "United refused to comment on the decision, according to the Daily Mail. United relocated to their impressive 23,000 square foot Kensington headquarters, complete with a rooftop terrace and two bars, in 2023.",
      "The facility was deemed cutting-edge at the time, boasting an LED tunnel designed to give employees the sensation of being at Old Trafford.",
      "However, Ratcliffe's arrival in February 2024 transformed the landscape, with the 73-year-old appointing consultants to carry out a review and pinpoint potential cost-cutting opportunities. Mass redundancies have ensued, with Ratcliffe showing no remorse for his choices.",
      "During an appearance on The Business podcast last month, Ratcliffe explained: \"The costs were just too high. There are some fantastic people at Manchester United, but there was also a level of mediocrity and it had become bloated. I got a lot of flak for the free lunches, but no-one's ever given me a free lunch.",
      "\"Manchester United has become mediocre,\" Ratcliffe remarked in a separate interview last season. \"It is supposed to be one of the best football clubs in the world. We have to make some difficult and unpopular decisions. If you shy away from the difficult decisions, then nothing much is going to change.",
      "\"I know we get criticism in the press, but we do need to challenge the cost of running this club because what I want to be free for us to do is buy really good footballers, not spend so much of the money on infrastructure. We can't run a business at a loss, which is where United have been in the last couple of years.\"",

      "Manchester United supporters were tearing their hair out during the summer as the Bryan Mbeumo transfer threatened to turn into a saga.",
      "The Reds have become no strangers to a saga during a window. The name Frenkie de Jong still makes fans wince.",
      "But there was hope United had managed to learn the lessons of the past - initially. On the first day of the transfer window, the Reds welcomed Matheus Cunha to Old Trafford.",
      "This was a refreshing change of pace. Cunha was a player who strengthened the squad immediately and was ready to hit the ground running.",
      "Targeting Mbeumo next was another green light for the club. However, the lack of a release clause in his contract at Brentford became a problem for the Reds.",
      "What followed was a period of tough negotiations with the Bees and United's next incoming did not arrive until moments before the start of the summer tour. Mbeumo only wanted a move to Old Trafford, a fact which led to the Reds becoming annoyed with their Premier League rivals, but there was no guarantee that once he was signed - he would be the right fit.",
      "Arriving at that stage of the transfer window can be difficult. There is a lot of transition for a player - new teammates, new manager, new city - never mind the upheaval of flying to America for a pre-season tour at short notice.",
      "Mbeumo only made his United debut in the third and final match of the tour against Everton, far from ideal preparation. And yet, unlike so many new signings at Old Trafford in recent years, the Cameroonian has managed to hit the ground running.",
      "The 26-year-old is one of only four players who have started every United Premier League game this season. He is also the only new signing to accomplish that feat this season and it is difficult to remember a player joining the Reds and slotting in so seamlessly.",
      "He has six goals in 12 appearances and is on track to at least match his record of 20 that he bagged for Brentford last season. This is the sort of impact that United have not had from a new signing in years. Antony's bright start soon petered out and there are too many new signings to count who have struggled from the first minute and never recovered.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt took time to adjust to the Premier League before we saw what he is truly capable of this season. Looking back, it is perhaps not since Zlatan Ibrahimovic that a player has arrived at Old Trafford and instantly started performing.",
      "Of course, when his time at United inevitably finishes, Mbeumo will not be judged on his start at Old Trafford but his entire career. But the signs are good and if he continues at this level, he would be one of a handful of successful purchases over the last few years.",

However, the danger with the international break is that Amorim does not know the challenges he will be faced with when all of his squad return to Carrington.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo suffered a blow with Cameroon. On Thursday, his national team bowed out of World Cup qualifying as they lost 1-0 to DR Congo.",
      "This defeat means Cameroon will not be competing at the World Cup next summer and that will be a bitter pill for Mbeumo and his international teammates to swallow. Cameroon have a proud history of competing at major tournaments and considering the opportunity to play at a World Cup is so rare, there's no doubting Mbeumo will be low when he returns to Carrington.",
      "Now Mbeumo's 2026 World Cup dream is over, Amorim's first job is obvious. He needs to lift his key man.",
      "Since arriving at United, Mbeumo has hit the ground running and his six goals in 12 appearances have helped push his new club to within touching distance of the top-four. Amorim simply cannot afford for his head to drop and allow that to impact his domestic form.",
      "That is easier said than done. There is only so much that Amorim can do to foster an environment at Carrington where personal disappointments during the international break are put to one side for the good of the team.",
      "But if you are Amorim, you will be hoping you can free Mbeumo from the disappointment easily and urge him on. The United boss needs to reiterate that his season is not over and there is plenty he can accomplish with United before he heads off for AFCON.",
      "Amorim will know exactly how critical his ability to lift Mbeumo is. Failure to do it, could easily resort in United's Champions League push derailing and that would not only be a disaster for the club but also for the Portuguese's stint in the dugout.",

      "The 16-year-old has been part of the Manchester United academy since 2020, where he has excelled across various age groups as a striker. However, the Reds legend recently disclosed that Kai has transitioned to the right wing, underlining the challenge the modern game presents regarding players' reluctance to operate as a traditional number nine.",
      "During a discussion on the Wayne Rooney Show about young English strikers struggling to adjust to Premier League football, the 40-year-old responded: \"The standard of English players has increased massively, I just think it's purely because they don't want to play number nine.",
      "\"The way the game is tactically. If you look worldwide there's not many number nines. So it's not just a problem in England, it's a problem throughout the world in number nines.\"",
      "When discussion shifted to Kai's role as a striker, Rooney clarified: \"He's gone to the right. Left-footed, coming in off the right,\" reinforcing his argument that developing as a traditional goalscorer has become unfashionable.",
      "This comes shortly after Kai stated that his life 'couldn't get any worse' earlier this year following a crushing blow in the form of an injury.",
      "The teenage prospect shared a sombre update on Instagram, appearing in pyjamas and on crutches, underlining just how serious his injury is. Whilst Kai is understood to have sustained the problem whilst representing the United youth side, the precise details of how it occurred, along with the specific nature of the injury, have not been disclosed.",
      "Encouragingly, it seems Kai could be returning to fitness soon, as the youngster posted several images of himself in Dubai on social media last month. He wrote alongside the photographs: \"Recovering,\" accompanied by an emoji of a face shrouded in smoke.",
      "In addition, Kai shared a photograph of his striking white Puma boots, adorned with fluorescent designs, on his Instagram stories on Thursday. He also tagged the manufacturer in the temporary story with emojis of bubbles and a face featuring love hearts for eyes.",

      "He said: \"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand-off approach. I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it - that's the main thing for me.\"",

      "It was not a given, but was perhaps to be expected. What was not in the script was the boos that rung out every time she touched the ball in the game.",
      "To their credit, the United fans aimed to drown out the boos with cheers and, by the end, Earps had won them round. But thanks to their performance on the pitch, the Reds changed the narrative.",
      "Instead of talking about Earps, the main takeaway from last night's game was the performances of the players in red. Safia Middleton-Patel who managed to overcome the nerves of replacing Phallon Tullis-Joyce, who suffered a facial injury against Aston Villa, produced a decent display to help win the game.",
      "Her save at the start of the second half was top draw and one which United keepers of all codes would have been proud of. Melvine Malard, before being forced off with cramp, was superb leading the line and left Earps with no chance as she curled the ball beyond the former England No.1.",
      "Jayde Riviere was dynamic at right-back and her last-ditch tackles helped keep PSG at bay as they pushed for an equaliser. Jess Park did superbly well for the winner, linking up play with neat one-twos before Anna Sandberg crossed for Fridolina Rolfo to win the match.",
      "Earps may have dominated the build-up to this fixture, but it will be the United players who will be remembered when we look back at this game at the end of the season. United now sit third in the Champions League table, with women's powerhouses Barcelona and Lyon the only other teams to have 100% starts to the competition.",
      "Marc Skinner was beaming in his post-match press conference and he had every right to be. This United team has really gelled and you now have to wonder just how far they can go in both the Women's Super League and the Champions League.",

      "Manchester United defender Matthijs de Ligt believes a combination of changing his mindset and staying injury-free is the reason for his excellent performances this season.",
      "Last weekend, De Ligt rescued a point against Tottenham in the Premier League with a late goal. The Dutchman is the only United player to have played every league minute during the campaign, and has been recalled to the Netherlands squad for the November internationals.",
      "De Ligt previously explained how he is benefiting from having an uninterrupted pre-season in the summer, and he provided fresh insight into his consistent displays during an interview with NOS Sport.",
      "“I’m 26 now and, I think, I’m entering the best years of my career, both physically and mentally,\" he said. \"I’ve changed my mindset. Initially, I didn’t want to make mistakes, now I want to do as many good things as possible.”",
      "De Ligt was asked to explain his improvement and discussed the toll injuries had taken on his confidence.",
      "He said: “There are a few explanations for that. I’ve had quite a few injuries in recent years, which took a toll on my confidence in my body. This year, I was able to participate in the entire pre-season. I know the club and the league better, and you feel more confident and can be more dominant.",
      "\"I'm actually doing more strength training again now. Just like I used to. So I don't care about that kind of criticism [about his condition] anymore. Although I did a few years ago. But I've been through a lot and now know what's good for me. I won't be deviating from that anytime soon.\"",
      "On his return to the Netherlands squad after being overlooked last month, the defender added: “If you’re not in the squad, it affects you. But the national coach decides. For me, it was important to stay true to myself and keep going. I think being selected again is a victory.\"",
      "Earlier in the week, Netherlands manager Koeman explained De Ligt's recall, saying: \"He didn't look confident in his play, and I told him so. He's calmer now, and I felt I should include him again.\"",
      "De Ligt was not included in the United leadership group that was introduced in the summer, but boss Ruben Amorim said the Dutchman leads by example when he spoke during his post-Spurs press conference.",
      "\"We choose. Sometimes there are players who lead in the way they play, then there are players who have a different involvement in everything that happens in Carrington,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"I am just trying to put different styles in the leadership group. But in the end, everyone has to be a leader and to help each other. I think he is doing really well, really aggressive, is defending well. I think he has more quality with the ball than he is showing. He is still in the point of not wanting to make mistakes with the ball.",
      "\"He is doing that really well because that is a smart thing for a player. But when we reach a very good point, our three centre-backs will control the tempo and the quality of the game.\"",

      "Former Manchester United and England goalkeeper Mary Earps was cheered by fans as she made her way out on to the pitch for Paris Saint-Germain's warm-up, before the goalkeeper was subject to a smattering of boos during the early stages of the Champions League match.",
      "Earps returned to Old Trafford for the first time this evening after leaving the club for the Parisians - in June 2024. The 32-year-old has made headlines in the past few weeks following the release of her book; 'All In'.",
      "An excerpt from that book caused controversy as she discussed a conversation she had with England head coach Sarina Wiegman about Chelsea star Hannah Hampton. It was claimed in the book that the goalkeeper, who helped England win Euro 2025, was criticised by Earps prior to the tournament.",
      "Earps alleged that Hampton was 'disruptive and unreliable' during Euro 2022 and is believed to have told Wiegman that the Dutch head coach was 'rewarding bad behaviour' by calling up the 24-year-old thereafter. These allegations were met with backlash from England fans and Earps has since spoken out to defend her comments.",
      "In a statement on Instagram following backlash, Earps said: \"It is not easy to be as vulnerable and open as I have been in the book, and I also understand that my honesty and rawness will divide opinion. That's okay, everyone is entitled to feel what they feel and I respect that.\"",
      "Speaking prior to the match, the goalkeeper admitted she expected a frosty reception at Old Trafford. That's not what played out on the night, at least pre-match, but Earps was booed when she took her first touch of the ball, even if the majority of fans tried to drown that out with further cheers!",
      "\"I'm probably expecting a little booing,\" she said. \"I hope it's a little bit, but it might be a lot.",
      "\"A few of the fans have come out to support me at PSG, but United is their No.1 team. I understand that.\"",
      "When asked about the prospect of Earps being booed, United head coach Marc Skinner also moved to ward off potential ill-will towards his former player. \"Deep down I know Mary is a good person,\" he said.",
      "\"I'm sure part of bringing out a book is bringing out controversial stuff that will help sell the book. I know that she has to defend that publicly.",
      "\"Knowing the human she is, I'm sure she will be getting criticism that she won't like. It's part of the other side of releasing a book.",
      "\"But she's a great person, she doesn't need me to say that really.",
      "\"I hope people toe the line with criticism, but I'm sure Mary understands the situation she's put herself in.",
      "\"She's on a platform where people are interested in what she says, so that's a credit to her and to her hard work. The goalkeeper we had at the start, to the one that left, was not the same person. She transformed.\"",
      "Once the whistle goes this evening, Earps will be hoping her performance will not leave the home fans so happy. United headed into the match with two wins from two matches in the Champions League - while PSG had yet to pick up a point in the competition this season.",

      "Manchester United Women have continued their 100 per cent record after a 2-1 victory over PSG at Old Trafford.",
      "Melvine Malard opened the scoring for United as she shrugged off a defender to curl the ball beyond Mary Earps. The Reds would have deserved to go into the break ahead however Olga Carmona had other ideas.",
      "Picking up the ball 25 yards out she fired right into the top corner to make it 1-1 at the break. But it was United who picked up the victory that they deserved when an excellent team move was finished by Fridolina Rolfo with a great header.",
      "The win keeps United's 100 per cent record intact while opponents PSG have lost all of their opening three games of the tournament.",
      "Catch up with updates from Old Trafford this evening in our live blog below;",

      "Earps is out before her teammates and is cheered at the other end of the stadium. It has been a mixed reception for her tonight",
      "United would have been deservedly ahead at the break. Malard's curling effort gave Earps no chance. However, Carmona has just produced a goal of the season contender to make it 1-1 at half time",
      "PSG level. Carmona with a beauty. She picks the ball up 25 yards out and curls it into the top corner. In fairness to PSG, that was special.",

      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is nestled between high-rise flats when you leave the overground White Hart Lane station.",
      "The glass facade and sleek design immediately catch the eye. It looks almost as if a spaceship from a faraway galaxy has docked in north London and you can't approach quickly enough.",
      "Manchester United visited Tottenham last weekend and I made my first visit to their stadium. I'd been repeatedly told it was the best arena in the country and it didn't fall short of that billing.",
      "Although the security staff took their time to admit the press into the media suite, it was worth the wait, as the press facilities and food offerings are second to none in the Premier League.",
      "The press food at Stamford Bridge is excellent, but Tottenham edges their London neighbours. The 12.30pm kick-off meant a full breakfast was on offer and the selection was superb for a media suite.",
      "The press room itself was akin to a luxury hotel reception. There was ample working space, comfortable leather-padded seats and Spurs offer lockers for journalists to store bags.",
      "The walk from the media suite to the press box is sign-posted - you could easily get lost on the way - and the interior of the ground is even more impressive than the exterior.",
      "Tottenham left White Hart Lane in 2016, spent nearly three seasons at Wembley, and moved to their new 61,000-seater venue three years later. Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a new 100,000-seater Old Trafford by 2030 and there are a few lessons to be learned from Tottenham.",
      "The design of the stadium is outstanding. You feel like you're working in a special arena throughout your visit, and architecture firm Populous deserved all the plaudits they received.",
      "From a journalist's perspective, the press box is spacious and well-positioned, offering a good vantage point, while the media auditorium is a superb space for managers to conduct their post-match duties.",
      "Ratcliffe wants the new Old Trafford, set to be designed by Foster + Partners, to be the greatest arena in the world, and they will deliver if the rebuild is anything like Tottenham's home.",
      "Tottenham's stadium was rebuilt 170 yards away from where White Hart Lane stood, which means the feeling of the old ground hasn't been totally lost, and the new Old Trafford will seek to retain that 'feeling'.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur Stadium is designed to maximise supporter experience and it brings fans closer to the pitch than at any comparable-sized stadium in the United Kingdom.",
      "The distances from the front row to the touchline range from just 4.9 metres to 7.9 metres, and the single-tier South Stand is the largest in the UK with a capacity of 17,500 people.",
      "The steep South Stand is remarkable. It was designed with the hope that it would generate an intimidating atmosphere, but no such noise was produced during the game on Saturday.",
      "Like a lot of big clubs in the Premier League, Spurs have become a tourist attraction, which means there were hundreds of fans with tickets in that stand who did not contribute to the atmosphere.",
      "That is their prerogative and 'tourist fans' are still valued fans, but local Tottenham season ticket holders have argued their South Stand should be a designated area for supporters looking to create noise.",
      "The Stretford End is currently that stand within Old Trafford, and United should consider introducing a designated singing section to ensure an atmosphere can be created in the new 100,000-seater stadium.",
      "I was fortunate enough to visit White Hart Lane before it was demolished. It was an ageing ground and Spurs were right to move on, but it could be intimidating for the opposition.",
      "The Tottenham Hotspur stadium is not intimidating. It feels welcoming. United need to ensure they don't fall into the same trap.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "A Manchester United attacker has reportedly been told there is ‘no chance’ that he’ll be allowed to leave in January, with the club to ‘block requests’ in the winter.",
      "United had an influx of forward talent in the summer. Of their spend of around £170million, the vast majority went on improving the forward line.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed to improve the attack, and that’s clearly had an impact, with the Red Devils netting 19 goals in the Premier League so far – only the top three have scored more.",
      "The signings have meant for far fewer opportunities for Joshua Zirkzee this season. The Dutchman was signed last summer but struggled in his debut season, netting only seven goals in more than 40 games.",
      "This term, it’s clear he’s not fancied, playing only 90 minutes across five appearances in all competitions.",
      "But still, The Sun reports he’s been told there is ‘no chance’ he’ll be allowed to leave in January, with United ready to ‘block requests’ from a number of players to depart mid-season.",
      "It’s explained that part of the reason United don’t want to let some players go in January is that they’ll lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to the African Cup of Nations over the winter.",
      "With Mbeumo going and Sesko having sustained an injury against Tottenham – though it’s not thought to be serious – there could be more minutes for Zirkzee.",
      "United would not want to struggle up top due to a lack of availability having let Zirkzee leave.",
      "The injury sustained by Sesko, meanwhile, has caused tension between United and Slovenia, with the national team not happy about their doctors not being able to look at the striker’s injury.",
      "While the documentation has now been sent to Slovenia, manager Matjaz Kek initially said: “With all due respect to a great club like Manchester United, we have officially not received anything yet; no papers, no documents.",
      "“We would certainly like to get them. We want our medical team to also take a look at it. Our doctor is an expert in this field. We don’t have just anyone in this position.",
      "“I cannot comment, of course I have certain information and I am also in contact with Beni. I can’t say anything because officially we don’t know anything at all.",
      "“United haven’t contacted anyone from our camp. Of course, I am concerned about the player. The only thing that matters to me is his wellbeing.",
      "“We are prepared to do everything for that and we have never sent anyone on the field if there was the slightest risk.”",
      "Real Madrid youngster Endrick has reportedly responded to shock interest from Man Utd after Benjamin Sesko suffered an injury.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have performed a ‘U-turn’ on Casemiro, while one exit could ‘open the door’ for a ‘gamble’ January transfer.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd will consider signing a striker if Benjamin Sesko’s injury is worse than first feared.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim reportedly wants a new attacker in the January transfer window amid Benjamin Sesko’s underwhelming performances.",
      "Former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer claims that Benjamin Sesko “struggled” once again as Man Utd drew 2-2 against Tottenham on Saturday.",
      "Amorim could easily have defended Sesko to the hilt after Neville’s ‘awkward’ criticism of the striker. What he actually did stands the Man Utd striker in good stead."

      "Fabrizio Romano has reiterated that Manchester United will allow Ruben Amorim to get rid of a signing made when Erik ten Hag was at the helm.",
      "United got rid of some players who are surplus to requirements in the summer. Antony was sold after a woeful spell, as was Alejandro Garnacho, while Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Rasmus Hojlund were all loaned out.",
      "The former pair of loan players are likely to make permanent exits come the summer.",
      "And Amorim shedding dead weight is set to continue. Tyrell Malacia has essentially gone missing in recent seasons and was loaned out last term.",
      "Upon his return, he has not played at all, and Romano revealed in October that the left-back will be allowed to leave in 2026.",
      "He said: “Tyrell Malacia, despite returning to training with the first team of Manchester United after a crazy window where he had several opportunities, Tyrell Malacia is not going to sign any new contract at Man United, and in any case, will leave the club for sure, 100 per cent in 2026..”",
      "Romano has reiterated that, stating for GIVEMESPORT: “At the moment, the most likely scenario is to part ways. This remains the intention on the club’s side for the future.”",
      "For Amorim, getting a signing made by predecessor Ten Hag – who he clearly doesn’t rate – off the books will be ideal.",
      "He has Patrick Dorgu, Diogo Dalot and Diego Leon who can play on the left flank, as well as Luke Shaw who generally plays more centrally now. and the Portuguese boss has also been told that one of United’s academy is ready to step up.",
      "Former United scout Piotr Sadowski has said 18-year-old Harry Amass – currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday – could make an impact.",
      "He said: “Now, United are wary of bringing in youngsters. Amorim was supposed to be the one to do this, but the results haven’t been right, so he prefers to buy ready-made players.",
      "“Whether he has anyone to choose from in the backroom is another matter. In my opinion, Harry Amass is the only player currently capable of making it into the United first-team squad after returning from his loan spell.”",
      "Whether Amass is given many opportunities in the United first team remains to be seen. He’s played just seven senior games for the club, but is impressing at Wednesday, where reports suggest he will be staying until the end of the campaign.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Man Utd defender Tyrell Malacia “will leave” in 2026 as he brings an update on Bruno Fernandes’ future.",
      "A forgotten Manchester United exile with an ‘outstanding’ trait Ruben Amorim sorely needs has returned to first-team training after a shock U21 ‘request’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have received a new ‘concrete offer’ to get rid of another ‘bomb squad’ member after offloading Marcus Rashford.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘agreed terms’ for their next summer signing, while one star has been ‘granted approval’ to leave the club."

      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘willing’ to offer Casemiro a new contract, but they want him to take a massive pay-cut.",
      "The Brazil international joined the Premier League giants from Real Madrid during the 2023 summer transfer window for around £60m.",
      "Man Utd signed Casemiro after failing to secure Barcelona star Frenkie de Jong, but they were heavily criticised for paying such a substantial fee for the 33-year-old, who was also handed a three-year contract with an option of a further year.",
      "Casemiro enjoyed a strong debut season at Old Trafford, though his form fell off a cliff in his second year as it appeared that he was on borrowed time at Man Utd.",
      "Ahead of this season, Casemiro was heavily linked with an exit and a move to the Saudi Pro League looked likely, though he ended up remaining at Man Utd.",
      "It had been assumed that the veteran midfielder would not play much for Man Utd this season, but he has enjoyed a remarkable resurgence and has re-established himself as one of Ruben Amorim’s most important players.",
      "READ: Man Utd, Arsenal, Spurs stars among PL sextet experiencing unexpected 2025/26 resurgence",
      "The Red Devils have certainly been a better team when Casemiro has been involved, so the centre-midfielder remaining at the club beyond this summer is becoming increasingly plausible.",
      "As alluded to above, Casemiro’s contract could be extended on the same terms until 2027, but this is unlikely to happen as he currently earns around £350,000 a week.",
      "Therefore, it has been widely reported that he needs to take a pay cut to extend his stay at Man Utd.",
      "Earlier this week, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed a detailed update on Casemiro and Harry Maguire’s future at Man Utd.",
      "“Casemiro is a crucial player, in this moment, for Manchester United,” Romano said.",

      "“After winning everything and everything and everything, as Casemiro did with Real Madrid, it’s not easy to try to change people’s minds, the manager, the staff, and also fans. Casemiro did it. Casemiro did a fantastic job, working hard and becoming, once again, a crucial player for this manager.",
      "“So, in this moment, he is really important for Rúben Amorim, but there will be a conversation about his contract because, at the moment, the numbers of his contract, salary, is way too high for Manchester United to extend that.”",
      "Romano added: “This is for Casemiro and for Harry Maguire, or the player could leave on a free.",
      "“Casemiro always received many proposals, especially from the Middle East, especially from Saudi. Casemiro remains a target for many clubs there, but, at the moment, it depends on financials, on the salary.",
      "“Casemiro is fully focused on the pitch now, he wants to help United in this moment, but his situation will depend on the salary. Amorim would love to continue with Casemiro, but again, this depends on the salary discussions.”",
      "Now, a respected account on X with over 680k followers and a ‘team of five elite reporters’ claims Man Utd are only ‘willing’ to offer a salary worth up to £150k a week.",
      "They said on X: ‘Exclusive: Casemiro was handed a contract worth around £350,000-a-week when he joined United over three years ago.",

That five-game winning run that kicked off their title defence involved far too much seat-of-the-pantsery.

Even the success Postecoglou did enjoy with Spurs in the Europa League involved, towards the end, precious little of anything that looked much like Angeball.",

      "This kind of predictable unpredictability is great for the rest of us, especially with Fulham apparently unable to deliver their usual sterling work on this front this season, but probably gets a bit annoying after a while for fans.

      "They are obviously a very good team with a very good manager doing very good things. But they are still tenth, and that just feels vaguely underwhelming somehow.",
      "Which itself, of course, is pretty strong evidence for the extent of Palace’s recent overachievement. This is the club that famously finished 12th every year with 40-something points. That exceeding that already feels a little meh does highlight just how good they’ve got. And how fast.",
      "",
      "Got to laugh, haven’t you? They are really, really trying to be a sensible team under a sensible manager, but it just refuses to happen. Still impossible to know whether they are or will be good under Thomas Frank, still not much easier to know what ‘good’ actually looks like for Spurs this season. What’s the actual aim? The point?",
      "That long-awaited trophy win has brought so much joy but robbed the club of what had become its driving focus over the last few years. Throw that into a club in such a state of on-field and off-field flux, and the uncertainty and instability is understandable. The fans aren’t just at a loss to know what constitutes success this season; in a post-Levy world they don’t even know where to aim their ire if they don’t get it.",
      "How much the swirling uncertainty plays a part in their wildly differing home and away form is hard to measure, but it feels too clear to ignore altogether. Only rock-bottom misery-bound Wolves have a worse home record than Spurs. Nobody has a better away record.",
      "It does seem unlikely that both those things remain true for long; the key will be which moves more compelling toward the other. It’s Spurs so we don’t really know – and we genuinely wouldn’t bat an eye at the sight of them finishing fifth or 15th this season – but you the nagging suspicion is that it’s the away form that will shift most.",
      "That’s what the eye test and data all suggest. Another good Spurs bit this season is that they remain relentless xG botherers. According to the boffins they should have scored way fewer and conceded way more goals than is in fact the case.",
      "Now significantly overperforming their xG is nothing new to Spurs. Historically it’s been because, in Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, this profoundly silly club possessed two of the most profoundly sensible finishers. When your two main goalscorers both consistently, year after year, exceed their xG then it should come as no surprise that a) you as a team will exceed your xG more often than not or more widely that b) playing with that outcome in mind becomes not just understandable but advisable.",
      "All perfectly logical and explainable. So how do we explain what’s happening now? How do we explain that a team that struggles to create pretty much anything is still wildly exceeding its xG while its most reliable finisher is a f***ing centre-back?",
      "And the only explanation that really works is, simply: Spurs, that.",
      "",
      "We couldn’t understand them as a football club, so we simply stopped trying and started treating them as something else.",
      "Which is fine everywhere except here, because how to rank the mood at so unfathomable a club? Third in the league and not technically out of title contention despite themselves is pretty good, though, and especially for a team that clearly has levels it’s not yet reaching.",
      "They’re not even as inconsistent as you think they are, not really. The defeat to Sunderland was maddening and avoidable, but it’s also the only defeat in a nine-game run across three competitions that features seven wins. The draw in that run? A really daft one as well, obviously, against Qarabag in the Champions League.",
      "They do appear determined to just chuck one of those games in every now and then to keep us all guessing, keep us all on our toes.",
      "",
      "A couple of hefty defeats, at Manchester City and then particularly at Aston Villa, have just harshed the buzz a bit for the Cherries, but from where they were in the summer to where they are now is still pretty crazy.",
      "We’re not sure anyone should really be able to cope with losing the players Bournemouth have lost with so apparently few consequences. This led us to believe some kind of witchcraft was involved, and we now believe losing 4-0 at Aston Villa to be an over-cautious act of misdirection and deception designed to put us all off the scent.",
      "It won’t work, Andoni. We’re entirely crazy, and you’ve just if anything made us more suspicious. We’re watching you.",
      "",
      "So, are they good now, or what? We demand to be told.",
      "Our gut feeling is that they still aren’t actually good, but they are no longer at least actively bad. They’ve been slightly fortunate at various points across this redemptive run of results, and quite how much they’ve benefited from the gentle luxury of a one-game-a-week schedule granted by their own incompetence might become clearer in December when they join everyone else in overindulging through the Busy Festive Period.",
      "But look, two months ago you’d have been laughed out of town even for proposing the question ‘Are Man United good now?’ so the progress is real and undeniable. And it’s very, very funny that they are above Liverpool in the league table now.",
      "",
      "We are in full hands-up mode here, because we thought they would be absolutely buggered without Thomas Frank and a great many of their best players and having entrusted their continued Premier League security to a rookie manager.",
      "Instead, turns out they are absolutely fine, and that promoting the set-piece coach was a genius idea because, if anything, they’ve just got even better at scoring from set-pieces. Can already count Aston Villa, Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle among their victims this season since defeat at Nottingham Forest on the opening weekend of the season, already a strong contender for most deceptive result of the season.",

      "For six games it really was bleak, the disappointment at how last season ended bleeding into a moribund start to this campaign, one in which five of their first six games ended either 0-0, 1-1 or a 1-0 defeat with the one exception a 3-0 paddling from Crystal Palace.",
      "It really did look and feel like something coming to an end. A bold and often brilliant attempt to disrupt the established Premier League elite under the astute leadership of Unai Emery, a manager who really quite recently found a club battling against relegation back to the Championship.",
      "Didn’t feel at all right that it might happen with nothing tangible to show for it, Villa having bollocksed some pretty presentable trophy opportunities, including but not limited to last season’s FA Cup and the Europa Conference League the year before – a competition not even West Ham had managed to West Ham up.",
      "But now, 10 games and eight wins later? All is once again well and the positive vibes are there for all to see. They’ve started beating decent teams in compelling fashion, even if the two defeats during that run are curiosities – against mid-crisis Liverpool in the Premier League and at Go Ahead Eagles in the Europa League.",
      "That Europa League defeat feels particularly incongruous, sitting as it does between deserved wins over Spurs and Man City in the league but also in stark contrast to what we think is in fact responsible for turning Villa’s season around.",
      "European football can be a curious beast. It can be both benefit and burden, often in the same season and occasionally even at the exact same time.",
      "Villa and Newcastle are not remotely the same club, but they are essentially trying to achieve the same thing: muscle in on the big boys’ turf. And we really don’t think it’s entirely a coincidence that they keep alternating Champions League status at the expense of both each other and whichever Big Six clubs happen to be in the process of fumbling about at that particular time.",
      "Newcastle are doing perfectly well in the Champions League, but its toll is already visible on their doom-spiralling league form. And ‘success’ in a competition you have no realistic chance of actually winning isn’t really worth it when your domestic form suffers.",
      "Villa, by contrast, are in the very winnable indeed Europa League which changes everything. There is not the same stress or toll on the same group of players. There is greater scope for personnel changes and the greater possibility that success in one competition boosts the other rather than the reverse.",
      "We’re not saying Villa are better off out of the Champions League, because who knows how different their summer might have looked had they made it. There’s also the financial implications of which tournament you’re in, which for Villa – who continue to fly close to the PSR wind – are more significant than their rivals.",
      "But missing out on the Champions League isn’t all bad. Spurs fans were widely mocked for ‘celebrating’ their Arsenal-scuppering defeat to Man City that may have cost them a Champions League place. A year later, they won the Europa League.",
      "There really is absolutely no reason Villa can’t go and do the same this season, and even if they don’t the Europa League has already had a positive kick-starting effect on their season. That divide between the bad and good parts of their season to date sits conveniently but not coincidentally on the moment their Europa League campaign began.",
      "And there really is every chance for things to get better yet, with Leeds, Young Boys, Wolves and Brighton to come in the first couple of weeks after the international break, before what does admittedly look like an absolute tw*t of a December where they have to play Man United, Chelsea and for some reason Arsenal twice.",
      "",
      "Something is happening. They’re still going to need a bit of help from Arsenal, but something is happening. They are the last club Arsenal would want to see looming over their shoulder, and Arsenal the club City would feel most confident pursuing.",
      "For both clubs, there is just so much muscle memory at play.",
      "The likelihood remains that City do come up short and that will mean a previously unthinkable two consecutive seasons without the title for Pep Guardiola. But even if that does happen, he appears reinvigorated and engaged again with the challenge of turning a new-look squad playing a slightly different version of Pepball into challengers once more.",
      "For so much of last season, Guardiola just clearly wasn’t enjoying himself or the challenge as City’s season collapsed in on itself around this time last year.",
      "At that point, there appeared a very good chance he wouldn’t even still be in charge of City this season, never mind back challenging at the very sharpest end of the title race.",
      "And history does tell us that if Pep’s City are in the title race at all, they generally come out on top.",
      "It still seems pretty clear that Arsenal are the best team in the country, but City and Pep know better than most that title races involve more than just that.",
      "",
      "You couldn’t blame them if some old memories are resurfacing, some wounds reopening. Their first dropped points – and first conceded goals – in ages happening the same weekend Man City produce a statement mauling of Liverpool to cut the lead back to four points.",
      "It’s understandable, when you’ve finished second for three seasons in a row, that nagging doubts are par for the course.",
      "But really, there is no need to be alarmed. A 2-2 draw at Sunderland is a far better result than might have been expected to be the case. Plenty of good teams will go there and lose before the season is out.",
      "And Arsenal are still clearly the team to beat in the title race this time. They have comfortably the best defence, an elite midfield and an attacking method that boils p*ss yet gets the job done with confirmed regularity.",
      "They have the deepest squad by far among the contenders as well as the most sustainable, repeatable method. For all the moral panic about set-piece goals, the only valid criticism is about becoming too predictable and reliant. But Arsenal are no more reliant on set-piece goals than City are on Erling Haaland ones.",
      "And that draw at Sunderland draw was moments away from being to our mind the perfect result. Had they managed to win 2-1, having gone behind, with open-play goals, away against a really decent team, it would have answered so many questions – fair and unfair – while also shutting down the noise around clean sheets and all-time defensive records before they became a distraction from the main business at hand.",
      "Right now it really does feel like the season where Arsenal end that wait for a trophy, and that really should involve winning (at least) one of the big two given the way they’ve started both at home and in Europe.",

They’ve just given Arsenal as good a game as anyone this season, with the first half at the Stadium of Light perhaps the best anyone, anywhere has yet played against the champions-elect.",
      "And they’re doing it time and again. There’s no longer any mystery to them being as high up the table as they are; they’re just playing that well.",
      "They’ve already pretty much taken relegation off the table, and while it’s fun to compare them to previous promoted sides they’ve already surpassed, it’s also now largely pointless. To consider this Sunderland team in terms of what promoted teams can or should achieve in their first season. How Sunderland compare to Southampton is simply no longer relevant.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says a poorly ear was to blame for Jadon Sancho’s struggles under him at Manchester United but can’t put his finger on why Marcus Rashford “didn’t enjoy himself” at Old Trafford.",
      "Solskjaer oversaw 149 games as United manager between March 2019 and November 2021 before being replaced by Erik ten Hag, and was pushing the club to sign Sancho for much of his time at the helm, eventually persuading them to sign the winger for £73m from Borussia Dortmund in the summer before the Norwegian was sacked.",
      "Sancho has never caught fire at United and has since returned to Dortmund on loan, before temporary switches to Chelsea and now Aston Villa.",
      "And Solskjaer, who is currently out of a job having been sacked by Besiktas after just 29 games, has claimed that Sancho being hospitalised with an ear infection just before arriving at United meant he was unable to get the best out of him.",
      "Speaking to The Overlap, Solskjaer said: “We wanted to take the next step — not move away from what we had, but add something different in the final third.",
      "“We wanted players who could break teams down, and Jadon, with his skill, link-up play, and little passes around the box, gave us that.",
      "“He was unlucky, though. Before he joined, he went on holiday, as you do, and ended up getting an ear infection.",
      "“He was in hospital and really struggled for his first 10 days or so before he could even start training with us.",
      "“That hasn’t really come out before. So, yeah, I never really got to play with him properly, because by the time he was finding form again, I was already on my way out.”",
      "While Sancho struggles to make an impact at Aston Villa, Rashford thrived under Unai Emery at Villa Park in the second half of last season and now he United loanee is pulling up trees in Barcelona, contributing six goals and nine assists in just 16 games for the Catalans, who are sure to take up the option to make his loan permanent for £30m at the end of the season.",
      "And Solskjaer, while admitting that Rashford “didn’t enjoy himself” at United, can’t work out any one reason why.",
      "“I’ve not spoken to Marcus since I’ve left, I text him a little bit but circumstances,” he said while appearing on Stick to Football.",
      "“I don’t know what’s happened in his life but you can see he’s certainly enjoying it now in Barcelona.",
      "“It looked like he didn’t enjoy himself here. I don’t think that’s just Man United [not enjoying it], it’s everywhere.",
      "“All the pressures, every single one is different, we don’t know what’s happened to the players when they walk in in the morning grumpy, that’s the manager’s job: ‘What’s up? I can see something’s wrong’.",

      "Sancho has had an awful time of it at Old Trafford following his £73million move in 2021. We’re now into the fifth season since then and the winger has spent time away from United in three of them.",
      "He’s been on loans back to Borussia Dortmund, as well as to Chelsea and Aston Villa, meaning he’s played just 83 games for United, in which he’s been directly involved in 18 goals.",
      "In his current spell at Villa, Sancho has failed to score or assist in eight games, and was substituted off after coming on as a sub in the win over Manchester City.",
      "With his loan set to last all season and Sancho’s United contract up beyond that spell – with an option for a one-year renewal – insider Pete O’Rourke has speculated on the Red Devils’ thoughts.",
      "“If he’s not part of United’s plans going forward, maybe it is best that they just cut their losses on him and everybody can move on and Sancho can go and put down roots at a new club as well because, undoubtedly, there’s a top player in there,” he told Football Insider.",
      "“His time at Man United, they spent big, big money on him, around £70million. It just doesn’t work out for either party.",
      "“He spent most of his time at Old Trafford alone. He had a loan spell at Dortmund, Chelsea and now Villa. I think really now United are probably thinking it’s probably best for them to let him go on a free transfer and get those wages off the book.”",
      "There have been suggestions that that is the route United will go down, with the only other option to recall him from his loan and sell him, but that would of course require a side to register their interest in him.",
      "There is an intriguing option for Sancho, a return to Dortmund, but they don’t want to spend a fee on him.",
      "Indeed, a separate Football Insider report has revealed that Dortmund are keen on re-signing the winger, but only if he becomes available on a free.",
      "They would surely be one of the first sides he’d look at if he does become available, knowing the wages on offer there would be decent, if not what he was making at United.",

      "It’s the last and dullest international break of the year, with January around the corner, so the sudden uptick in players being linked with Manchester United is absolutely and unavoidably inevitable.",
      "Conveniently for the gossip-mongers (yes, we know), Benjamin Sesko sustained an injury against Tottenham at the weekend.",
      "The instinctive reaction to any such blow is to look to the market for a replacement. Endrick, perhaps?",
      "That, of course, ignores the obvious solution to a problem that does not yet exist.",
      "Ruben Amorim has a number of options within his squad to replace Sesko as the frontman. Either Matheus Cunha or Bryan Mbeumo could play up instead of off, while Joshua Zirkzee still exists, even if he could be away in January.",
      "Even if none of that were true, United should be banned from signing anyone who identifies as anything other than a midfielder until they have filled the gaping hole in Amorim’s squad.",
      "The manager, now a year in post, is finally seeing some shoots of positivity after a chastening 12 months which many did not expect him to last.",
      "But that good work could yet be undermined with one tackle or tweak, or anything that leaves Amorim without Casemiro.",
      "For numerous reasons, it is astonishing how important to United that Casemiro has become once more. Barely a soul outside of the Brazilian’s family thought he wasn’t finished, and even some of his relatives probably agreed that ‘the football had left him’.",
      "Now, though, Casemiro has regained the influence he enjoyed on United through his first season in 2022/23. It is not just that United are currently a better team with the 33-year-old, it is how much worse they become without him.",
      "MORE: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",
      "This was hoped to be Manuel Ugarte’s breakout season having had a year to settle following his move from PSG, but Amorim’s admonishment at the end of his first campaign does not seem to have registered.",
      "To play in the base of midfield, that only leaves Kobbie Mainoo, who Amorim really does not fancy for the role. It feels wrong to write – given Mainoo’s obvious class – that there is no place for the academy graduate in Amorim’s box midfield. Perhaps there is a glimmer of hope from reports that Amorim is also spending time on drilling United in 4-3-3, but given the manager’s fanaticism for three at the back, Mainoo seems destined only ever to be a bit-part player under Amorim. In which case, for his sake, he needs to get away.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is doing a stellar job in a role that doesn’t suit his best attributes either but, quite simply, if you manage Manchester United, you find a way to play Fernandes.",
      "Beyond Casemiro and Fernandes, Amorim is out of options. Certainly of the quality necessary to take United back into Europe, which is what will define the season, and the manager, as a success or failure.",
      "In which case, in the unlikely event he isn’t already, Amorim needs to be badgering his board for the midfielder they knew they needed in the summer but never bought.",
      "With it being such an obvious flaw, there are plenty being linked with the Red Devils with less than 50 days until the window opens.",
      "Elliot Anderson. Adam Wharton. Carlos Baleba. Joao Gomes. Conor Gallagher. Alex Scott. It’s not that any will do. But it almost is.",
      "Of course, United’s scouting department don’t work on that basis, despite previous impressions to the contrary. They will identify the best, most suitable target. Then almost certainly decide he’s too expensive and, therefore, unattainable in January.",
      "And they may be right. It would take obscene offers for Palace to part with Wharton or for Forest to flog Anderson in January. Prices are hardly likely to tumble in the summer, especially if either England international makes a positive impression at the World Cup. But their clubs, you would think, would be far less motivated to sell mid-season.",
      "So a stop-gap may be necessary and United should not be too proud to admit that. Casemiro will be out of contract next summer so by then they would need two midfielders anyway. Even if they are prepared to wait until after this season for their primary midfield target, they still need one to avoid a wholly unaffordable gamble to make it to May.",
      "Until they source that midfielder, given how these huge recruitment departments are seemingly incapable of doing more than one thing at once, United should be thinking of nothing else.",
      "It should not be that Harry Kane dropping deep to be brilliant is framed as an ‘infuriating’ problem for England in actual 2025 but here we are again.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea are ‘leading the race’ to sign Crystal Palace and England star Adam Wharton, who is also wanted by Manchester United.",
      "The way Phil Foden’s five-yard pass for Eberechi Eze’s stunning finish was spoken up was bizarre but also proof that some players benefit from ‘blind bias’.",
      "Arsenal have reportedly entered the race to sign Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson with the Gunners ‘not backing down’ over his price tag.",
      "The F365 England Selection Committee has convened to pick the XI to win the World Cup for Sir Thomas Tuchel…",
      "This England XI have all been called up by their country in the last 12 months, which remains extraordinary in some cases."

      "Really interesting mail from Gofezo, who is, I believe, a very old head here. And it shows.",
      "Whilst I disagree with some of what he says, he says it in a reasoned and reasonable way. Also interesting, and relevant I feel, was some mope from The West Country screaming down the phone on t’wireless earlier this morning – the usual PGMOL conspiracy nonsense, expressed in the usual baseless and confrontational fashion so beloved of the majority of Liverpool “fans”. He followed a Scouse guy whose view was much more reasonable, and expressed more reasonably. Adds credence to my views on people who have f**k all to do with the location of the team they support if nothing else. But I digress.",
      "The central point here is something that has eluded the vast majority of people who have selected Liverpool FC as the star to which they have hitched their (Cornish) wagon. Namely: if you act like insufferable pr*cks when your team is doing well, expect to get the boot put in hard when things go awry (that’s if you have the balls to show up in the comments at all – comments that you’ve been ever-present, and unpleasant, in through the whole of last season and the start of this).",
      "Try following Gofezo’s lead and act like a grown up, might find the general discourse a bit more enjoyable. You just don’t see/hear the kind of aggravated lunacy from other fanbases in this country. Well, apart from an ever growing contingent of Arsenal fans, which is arguably worse, since they have zero grounds for it. At least Liverpool have won stuff in living memory. But that’s another story for another day.",
      "Finally, also for another day, but I do feel a good hard look at Mo ‘One Trick’ Salah is long overdue, especially since said trick has seemingly finally fallen victim to Old Father Time. Maybe help young Bradley out if you’re contributing f**k all going forward? Perhaps a reasonable kopite could pick up that baton and give us all a fan view rooted in reality\nRHT/TS",

      "Diogo Dalot has been blasted for not being good enough in attack or defence for Manchester United by a man who really, really hates “high fives”.",
      "Dalot is now one of the longest-serving players at United having joined the club as a 19-year-old in 2018 and only Bruno Fernandes has played more minutes under Ruben Amorim than the full-back.",
      "Capable of playing on the left or the right, Dalot has started seven of United’s 11 Premier League games this season but was dropped for Patrick Dorgu for the trip to Tottenham after his less than convincing display against Nottingham Forest.",
      "Dalot is often seen celebrating tackles and defensive work, and congratulating teammates for their contributions, and former United full-back Paul Parker isn’t a fan of the Portuguese star’s cheerleading.",
      "“Dalot’s making far too many mistakes, unnecessary mistakes. He’s more interested in high-fiving people when he makes a tackle than actually doing his job properly,” Parker told Metro via online casino Unibet.",
      "“So, high-fives don’t win you games of football. By the time you’ve done your high-five, they could have actually bounced off of your great tackle and gone and scored a goal. So, high-five at half-time or after the game. So, no, you can’t trust Dalot there.",
      "“You’re not getting enough quality in the final third from him as well. He doesn’t do enough defensively. He switches off too much, his clearances are poor, very poor, that’s one reason.”",
      "Explaining his penchant for high fives and fist bumps, Dalot once said: “Us defenders, we don’t score goals too often, so these are our little goals during the 90 minutes.",
      "“This is the goal for us so we will celebrate and I think it’s something that came completely naturally from us.”",
      "MORE MANCHESTER UNITED COVERAGE ON F365\n👉 Man Utd secret talks with world-class goalkeeper revealed: ‘He’s never been closer to leaving’\n👉 Six Man Utd transfer targets revealed ahead of January in ‘major rebuilding process’\n👉 Patrick Dorgu isn’t ‘a dud’ and Man Utd should be embarrassed for trusting the man who thinks he is",
      "Parker also took aim at midfielder Manuel Ugarte, insisting Amorim must “keep him on the bench” rather than using him to save Casemiro’s legs late in games.",
      "“He hasn’t done that well,” Parker said. “I quite liked him because he was a breath of fresh air when he arrived, someone who wanted to run around and he got stuck in, very rarely lost possession even when under pressure.",
      "“But when he comes on now, United concede. They generally concede. At best they start to be under pressure, and that’s because of someone like Casemiro’s coming off for him. So, at the moment in time, if I’m the manager of Manchester United, no need to make systematic changes.",
      "“Full-backs might change, but the middle stays the same. Get continuity in that midfield. Even when things are going okay and you’re 1-0 up and the team look comfortable, they can be more comfortable.",
      "“Especially if you keep it the same rather than making three or four changes. Unnecessary changes, just to give people minutes. Keep Casemiro on, keep Ugarte on the bench.”",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has been tipped to replace two players in January, while Matheus Cunha’s impact on the team has been “exaggerated”.",

      "It has been a breakthrough season for Radek Vitek.",
      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",

      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 14:47, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has urged people to \"forget\" the past after Cristiano Ronaldo's scathing criticism of the club.",
      "Ronaldo delivered a damning verdict of United's current squad and suggested Amorim cannot perform \"miracles\" at Old Trafford.",
      "In another interview on Piers Morgan Uncensored, after his 2022 sitdown led to the premature end of his second spell at United, Ronaldo said: \"He's [Amorim] doing his best. What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",
      "\"What we need to do is focus on the future. We know that we, as a club, made a lot of mistakes in the past, but we are trying to change that. So let's not focus on what happened.",
      "\"Let's focus on what we are doing now, and we are doing that. We are changing a lot of things in the structure, the way we do things, that we want the players to behave. We are doing that, and we are improving.",
      "\"So let's focus on the way we are doing things; we are improving. Let's continue and forget a little bit [about] the past.\"",
      "Amorim was facing the media ahead of United's trip to Tottenham on Saturday lunchtime. It's the first time United will have met Spurs since a sobering 1-0 Europa League final defeat in May.",
      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League. Amorim believes he will take a better United team to Tottenham than the one that lost to Spurs in Bilbao. Asked about the differences in his current side, Amorim said:",
      "\"First of all, the characteristics of the players. We have different characteristics in our team. We also have a lot of players who played last year, so we are a better team. We play better. We understand the game better.",
      "\"I think we are more confident. We reached that final confident that we could win because we were doing well in Europe. But in this moment, we play with a different confidence.",
      "\"We manage the moments of the game better. But if you remember that game, they have that shot on the goal; they won the game. So I expect a different game, that we can play better, but also to have a little bit of luck to help us to win the game.",
      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",
      "Despite a lack of European football for just the second time in Premier League history, Amorim maintains he sees the positives of the loss in the final.",
      "\"It's not the fact of seeing the positive is using the positives. So any situation that you have in your life, you can look in a positive way or in a bad way. If you ask me, you prefer to be here with a cup in the Champions League.",
      "\"Champions League, more money, more players? Maybe, of course, I will say yes, but you have the other side. You have more time to train, to know your players, to arrange everything, the connection between staff and to prepare the future.",
      "\"In the future will be with European competition. So we just tried to use the positive thing of not playing all the games during the week. So yes, I can see the positives.\"",

      "His role playing as the emergency striker in the final 15 minutes of this crucial clash with Burnley provided the spark that the Hammers were lacking as the game wore on. His legs may not move as quick as they once did but his game intelligence and the nuisance factor he brings certainly remains.",

      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",

      "Cristiano Ronaldo left Manchester United after his second spell came to a sour end following a bombshell interview in 2022; the Al Nassr forward says, despite an upturn in form at Old Trafford the Premier League club is not on the right path and needs to change",
      "Wednesday 5 November 2025 15:01, UK",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo says Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim cannot work miracles at Old Trafford and has revealed the sadness he feels for his former club.",
      "Amorim managed to steer his United side to three wins in a row for the first time since taking over at Old Trafford before Saturday's 2-2 draw at Nottingham Forest marked his one-year anniversary at the club.",
      "It has been a turbulent year for the Portuguese coach as Manchester United recorded their worst Premier League finish last season in 15th, as well as ending the campaign trophyless, having lost the Europa League final and therefore missing out on Europe for this season.",
      "While United have shown positive signs recently, Ronaldo still has reservations over the club's current situation.",
      "\"He's [Amorim] doing his best,\" said Ronaldo, speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored.",
      "\"What are you gonna do? Miracles? Miracles are impossible. We say in Portugal, miracles are only in Fatima.",
      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind, what is Manchester United.\"",
      "The Al Nassr forward was speaking to Morgan three years on from his bombshell interview that ultimately brought his second spell at Old Trafford to a sour end. In 2022, Ronaldo infamously criticised the club's hierarchy, then head coach Erik ten Hag and slammed the club's facilities, leading to his transfer to the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Despite his public views on United, Ronaldo said he maintains his love for the club he represented 346 times over his two spells, scoring 145 goals. However, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner suggests the club must still find a working structure.",
      "\"I'm sad, because the club is one of the most important clubs in the world - and a club that I still have in my heart - because of the obvious reasons you have to follow with intelligent people, smart people, to create a base for the future as Manchester United.",
      "\"So many years ago, Nicky Butt, Gary Neville, Roy Keane, [David] Beckham, they became big players, but they had youth.",
      "\"So Manchester United right now, they don't have a structure. I hope that changes in the present-future, because the potential of the club is amazing. It's one of the most important clubs of the century.\"",
      "Ronaldo first signed for United in 2003, teeing up a legendary career that would see him win his first Ballon d'Or and first of five Champions Leagues while at Old Trafford.",
      "The now-40-year-old would also win three league titles at United before completing a then-world-record transfer to Real Madrid in 2009. The Portugal captain returned in dramatic fashion in 2021 under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but, despite his 27 goals in 54 games upon his return, his comeback is largely viewed as being unsuccessful.",
      "Asked if he still keeps up with United's results and whether they bring him sadness, Ronaldo said: \"Of course, because I was a player there. So many, many years ago, I won the Champions League there.",
      "\"I win the Golden Ball. I won like 12, 13, 14 titles there. So, as I say, and I repeat, Manchester United are still in my heart; I love that club.",
      "\"But we have all to be honest and look for ourselves and say, listen, they are not on a good path, so they need to change. And it's not only about the coach and players, in my opinion.\"",
      "Ronaldo, who turns 41 in February, also revealed he is planning to retire \"soon\" and predicts he \"probably will cry\" when the time comes.",
      "The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has scored 952 goals in his career so far and is targeting 1,000 goals before he hangs up his boots.",
      "Asked when he might consider retiring, Ronaldo replied: \"Soon. But I think I will be prepared.",
      "\"It will be tough, of course. I probably will cry, yes... I'm an open person. It will be very, very difficult, yes.",
      "\"But, I have prepared my future since [the age of] 25, 26, 27 years old. I think I will be capable to support that pressure.\"",
      "Gary Neville believes Manchester United's experienced players \"should be doing a lot better\" to help carry Amorim's side.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap and Betfair's Stick to Cricket, Neville said: \"I think your spine of a football team is critical. When I first came into Man Utd, our spine was [Peter] Schmeichel, [Steve] Bruce, [Gary] Pallister, [Roy] Keane and [Eric] Cantona and so we were all scattered around it.",
      "\"I think [Harry] Maguire and [Matthijs] De Ligt should be doing a lot better than they are. You look at the experience that those two have got.",
      "\"De Ligt's played a mountain of games at the highest level. Harry's played so many times for England. You've got the midfield, Casemiro and Bruno [Fernandes] have got massive experience.",
      "\"Up front, they haven't got the experience. But to me, that spine of Bruno, Casemiro, Maguire and De Ligt is ageing, but should be doing a lot better at holding it all together than they do.",
      "\"That's why I think Liverpool are good because they've got Alisson, Van Dijk, they've got Mac Allister and Gravenberch in midfield and then they've got obviously the centre-forwards that they've got.\""
