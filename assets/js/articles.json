      "Omar Berrada is confident Manchester United can return to the Premier League's summit by 2028. A tall order, the chief executive admitted, but very much possible.",
      "And if it is to become a reality this transfer window needs to see a shambolic squad that finished 15th in the season just completed receive some significant surgery. It has already begun following Matheus Cunha's £62.5m arrival from Wolves, while Eintracht Frankfurt forward Hugo Ekitike and Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo remain high on the wishlist.",
      "Yet United have been clear for months that outgoings are a must to fund new arrivals and there is still no clarity on where Marcus Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and several others will be playing once the recruitment window closes on September 1. None of those are in head coach Ruben Amorim’s plans.",
      "Here is the transfer state of play at Old Trafford after the window reopened on Monday.",
      "Cunha's arrival from Molineux, on a five-year deal with the option to extend by another 12 months, brings justifiable excitement considering how impressive the Brazil forward performed in the middle part of the season for a club that began the campaign worried about relegation.",
      "A deal to sign young left back Diego Leon from Paraguay's Cerro Porteno was confirmed in January.",
      "Having scored a pitiful 44 goals in 38 league games, with both Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee devoid of confidence, strengthening the attack has been an obvious priority.",
      "And that is why United are so keen on £70m Mbeumo , who looks almost certain to leave Brentford following another impressive season for the top flight's smartest run club. The big issue is whether Mbeumo instead chooses to follow his Bees boss Thomas Frank in joining Tottenham Hotspur - where he can be guaranteed of Champions League football.",
      "A similar fee will be required to bring in French striker Ekitike , 22, from Frankfurt - despite him having only one decent season in the Bundesliga under his belt. Ekitike could not make an impact at Paris Saint-Germain, albeit in their galacticos era, with Mbeumo the far safer bet for a club that has counted the cost of bringing in players with no Premier League experience.",
      "Interest in Sweden striker Viktor Gyokeres has diminished with his preferred destination appearing to be Arsenal.",
      "Senior men Christian Eriksen , Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof are to be joined by Hubert Graczyk , Jack Kingdon , Sam Murray , Tom Myles , James Nolan and Tom Wooster in being released at the end of their contracts on June 30.",
      "The entire squad is available for the right price but there are several who clearly have no roles to play under Amorim.",
      "Rashford shone in parts while on loan at Aston Villa and has been linked with a switch to Barcelona but only a select few clubs can afford his £1m a month salary.",
      "Similar is true of Antony, who did well at Real Betis. Except the La Liga club cannot afford the Brazilian’s wages either.",
      "Garnacho , meanwhile, was supposedly told to find a new club after a row because he was left on the bench for much of the nightmare Europa League defeat to Tottenham last month.",
      "Veteran midfielder Casemiro is welcome to find a new club, so too flop striker Hojlund because he is yet to adapt after two full seasons up front.",
      "The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13.",

      "Angry Ginge continued his running feud with Carlos Tevez by labelling the football legend a \"f***ing traitor\" after their Soccer Aid clash. Popular streamer Angry Ginge, real name Morgan Burtwistle, lived out his childhood dream of playing on the Old Trafford turf during Sunday's charity game.",
      "The lifelong United fan played in defence for England during Soccer Aid 2025, which meant he faced former Red Devils striker Tevez, who represented the World XI.",
      "Tevez won two Premier League titles and the Champions League with United but infamously joined rivals Manchester City in 2009. He instantly became a loathed figure at the Theatre of Dreams and severed all ties by celebrating against his former club during a Manchester Derby.",
      "That was evidently still fresh in Burtwistle's mind as the YouTuber saw his chance to get revenge during Sunday's friendly game, flying in with a crunching challenge on the Argentine.",
      "He got the ball but Tevez was left unhappy with the aggressive nature of the challenge and made sure to leave something on Ginge, slightly kicking out at the defender.",
      "Tevez quickly realised where he was and decided to then shake hands with the 23-year-old. For Ginge, however, the bad blood remained beyond the final whistle as he took to Instagram to post a photo of a nasty gash on his leg courtesy of Tevez.",
      "His caption read: \"Cheers Tevez, t***,\" echoing his thoughts on the Boca Juniors icon, having once admitted that he \"can't stand\" him. And he wasn't done there, later revealing on one of his live streams that he had his match-worn Soccer Aid shirt signed by everyone on both teams, except Tevez, who he slammed.",
      "The internet personality said: \"Look at that. Signed by every single person on the team. And the away team. Bar one man. The f***ing traitor. Tevez ain't signing my f***ing shirt. Not in a million years. No chance.\"",
      "Tevez had the last laugh, however, scoring four goals in just 15 minutes to lead the World XI's comeback. He was booed after each goal by the crowd but appeared to revel in his role as the pantomime villain, cupping his ear and pointing to the name on the back of his shirt.",
      "He managed to level the game, which paved the way for musician Big Zuu to score the late winner and secure a memorable 5-4 victory. Zuu emphatically celebrated with his own version of Cristiano Ronaldo's Siu celebration.",
      "Ginge, meanwhile, had the consolation of being awarded Player of the Match over Tevez. His tireless defensive work included diving across the goal to stop France World Cup winner David Trezeguet from scoring the equaliser.",

      "It is now suggested that the Danish head coach wishes to bring Mbeumo to north London with him, and with a superior £70million offer tabled, doubts loom over whether he'll prefer to stay in the capital or jump ship for Old Trafford.",
      "One of Amorim's former players, Sporting CP ace Viktor Gyokeres, was also targeted this window as the club looks to add potency to their strikeforce, but reports from Portugal suggest he has turned his nose up at a reunion in Manchester.",
      "Such dismissal harkens memories of 25 years ago, when PSV's star striker Van Nistelrooy looked certain to complete a move to Sir Alex Ferguson's United, only for medical tests to throw a decisive spanner in the works. However, in this instance, the Red Devils got the last laugh.",
      "Van Nistelrooy made light work of the Eredivisie during his stint with PSV from 1998 to 2000. He scored 77 goals in 90 league games, won the Dutch Player of the Year award in all three terms, and was twice the league's top scorer.",
      "It was only a matter of time before top European sides came sniffing, and Ferguson's United did just that, with the Scottish boss being tipped off about the striker by his son and agreeing to a deal one day after sending scouts to the Netherlands.",
      "A fee of £18.5m was shaken hands upon, a prospective British record sum, however niggling concerns about the then-sidelined Dutchman's knee led to the request of additional tests during Van Nistelrooy's medical.",
      "United wished to keep the striker in Manchester for extra tests, but the player and his club refused, citing that the tests could potentially delay his recovery, and the deal was called off.",
      "\"Manchester United is very disappointed that the transfer of Ruud van Nistelrooy from PSV Eindhoven cannot proceed at this present time,\" read a statement from the club. \"As reported on Tuesday, April 25, 2000, further tests were necessary for Manchester United to proceed with the transfer.",
      "\"The discussions that have been held between all the parties failed to reach agreement as to the extent of these tests, and as a result of this difference in opinion, we cannot proceed at this present time.\"",
      "Alas, Ferguson and his team breathed an immediate sigh of relief when, just a week after the deal folded, Van Nistelrooy suffered a serious knee injury in training that kept him out of action for the year.",
      "Fast forward to 12 months later, Van Nistelrooy put pen to paper on a British record £19m deal, and he touched down in Manchester to lead the Red Devils' line. He would play over 200 games for United, scoring a staggering 150 goals while winning a league title and FA Cup crown.",

      "There's been no indication so far in the early going of the window that anyone will be willing to push that high. Nonetheless, it seems that Konrad Borzyskowski, the man behind the lens for Garnacho, can't foresee a future where the Argentinian talent is playing for the Red Devils again next season.",
      "He took to Instagram on Monday to share a collection of photos he'd taken of Garnacho throughout the 2024/25 campaign. It was captioned: \"One last time in @manchesterunited red... @garnacho7 under the microscope.\"",
      "Whether Borzyskowski possesses insider knowledge is unknown, but he does share connections with numerous football stars in the Premier League and across Europe. Garnacho himself is said to prefer staying in the UK.",

      "Amorim had enjoyed success in his homeland, playing a specific 3-4-3 system, that helped Sporting win numerous honours. The manager himself expressed concerns about making the hop during the campaign due to the time needed to embed his philosophy.",
      "United made it clear it was now or never following a request to join in the summer and Amorim eventually took charge of his first game in November. The team struggled for results and posted their worst campaign since the 1970s but Berrada believes the short-term pain will work out for the best.",
      "He told United We Stand: \"We knew that by bringing in Ruben mid-season that it was going to be even more difficult for the team to perform. We saw it as an investment for the following seasons, because we were going to give Ruben time to get to know the squad, the club, the Premier League. We have a very clear roadmap.",
      "\"Had Ruben started on 1 July 2025, we wouldn't have been able to have all that knowledge, right? And that's what I feel about these seven or eight months that he's had in the Premier League and what he's suffered in the Premier League and the team has suffered. It's really going to help us in the future.",
      "Berrada ultimately confessed: \"I think we probably underestimated the time it would have required the team to adjust to the system. But we don't regret the decision because I'm convinced that we'll see this pay off next season.\"",
      "Amorim himself had warned the Manchester bosses of the risk they were taking in asking him to join midway through a season, but ultimately couldn't say no to the opportunity. That was before he would win just seven of his 27 Premier League games and lost the Europa League final.",
      "The 40-year-old said: \"When you start a season, it's completely different. You feel things, have a pre-season and time to change things you feel are necessary in a team and a squad. That is clear. That was the choice so I don't want to talk about that. I had my reasons to ask for it. I knew it would be tough and a risk, but it's Manchester United and you can't say no.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha has been compared to Manchester United legend Eric Cantona in terms of the transformative impact he can have on the club.",
      "Brazil forward Cunha became United's first signing of the summer after they met his £62.5million release clause to bring him from Wolves.",
      "Cantona is credited for unlocking the door to United's first Premier League title in 1993, ending the club's 26-year wait to be English champions again.",
      "United chief executive Omar Berrada reckons 26-year-old Cunha possesses a similar charisma and playing style to Cantona, and can prove a modern-day version of the enigmatic Frenchman at Old Trafford.",
      "“He’s a player that I think fans are going to love,” Berrada said. “We can talk about his technical abilities and he can play in three different positions.",
      "“He’s a playmaking attacking midfielder; he can score goals, he can make assists. I think he’s going to lift people off their seats. He’s got a bit of a swagger about him that people are going to really like. Dare I say, Cantona-esque. He was an important one to get done. We’re going to do our best to do more signings quickly.",
      "“Sometimes, when you’re not quick, it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn’t necessarily the best thing for the club.”",
      "Berrada also doubled down on his belief that United can win the title by 2028 – despite ending last season in 15th place – their worst finish of the Premier League era.",
      "Asked if winning the title in three years was realistic, Berrada said: “Of course. We’ve just finished 15th and it seems like an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power?",
      "“I firmly believe that we can do it. We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League and if we can achieve it before then, we’ll all be happy — and so nobody’s saying that we don’t want to win it until then.”",
      "Berrada admitted appointing Ruben Amorim midway through the season was always likely to make it even more difficult for the team to perform. He said: “We saw it as an investment for the following seasons, because we were going to give time to Ruben to get to know the squad, the club, the Premier League.",
      "“So by the time that we got to now, we’ll have had all the discussions about what does the squad need, the two-to-three-year plan to get to a squad that’s capable of winning the Premier League.",
      "\"We have a very clear roadmap of how we’re going to get there. Had Ruben started on July 1, 2025, we wouldn’t have been able to have all that knowledge, right? And that’s what I feel these seven or eight months that he’s had. He’s suffered in the Premier League, and the team has suffered. That’s why I feel that it’s really going to help us in the future.\"",
      "Berrada, who worked at Manchester City before crossing the city to join United, said there were similarities between Amorim's start at United and Pep Guardiola's first season at City.",
      "“Very much so,” Berrada told United We Stand. “Pep stuck to his principles and given what he’d won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank. He was allowed that first year to be below-par by his standards. The club backed him that summer, the team started winning and created this winning cycle that lasted until this season.",
      "\"We’ve taken all the short-term pain in this season, but as of this summer, the worst bit is going to be behind us. We will have settled the management team; we will have settled the coaching team with the technical team around them.",
      "\"On the football side, there’s a clear idea of what we want to do, what players we want to get, how we want to see the team playing, how we’re going to integrate academy players, how we’re going to go and invest in future talent.",
      "\"I’m actually very optimistic and quite positive about what’s ahead. Of course we need to get a lot of decisions right. And we will make mistakes, there’s no doubt. We’ll try to minimise those. But what we want is to build something that’s sustainable for the long, long term.",
      "\"We’ve put ourselves in the best position possible by doing everything that we’ve had this year around cost-cutting. I’m confident that we will come out of the window with a much stronger team than what we’ve gone into.\"",

      "Dwight Yorke has laid into former club Manchester United and claimed they are “way off” competing with the top teams in the Premier League.",
      "United ended last season in 15th place, their worst finish of the Premier League era, and failed to secure European football for next term after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "Against that backdrop, Yorke – who won the Treble with United in 1999 – said there is no way Ruben Amorim's side can challenge the top clubs in England, like Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.",
      "\"I don't think so,” Yorke told Flash Score. “They are probably not in the conversation right now. Let's get back to trying to compete at a very consistent, sort of consistent, what we do consistently.",
      "\"And if we can do that, then we'll have to see where we finish. But in terms of challenging the big boys in the minute, we're way off the mark.",
      "\"I think it's been well documented that it's been a really poor season by our standards. Of course we don't like to see Manchester United in the position that they are, but it's where the club is at the moment.",
      "\"It's been a very difficult campaign all round, so we have to look at the season and have a reflection and hopefully come back stronger and with a bit of fighting spirit. If we're finishing 15th in the league, then something is really wrong. So we have to reflect and start building immediately.\"",
      "Asked how much time Amorim should be given to turn United's fortunes around, Yorke said: \"I don't know the exact amount of time. What I do know as a manager, is you've got to win football matches. And the more you go about not winning football matches, you're certainly making life difficult for yourself.",
      "\"So I think as any manager, he has got to find a way to try to win matches and be a little bit more consistent. But if you're not winning matches, you're sort of forcing the way in terms of trying to put a real negative spin on it.”",
      "Asked what he would do differently if he were in Amorim's position, Yorke said: \"Well, to begin with, I would need some players. If I don't get the players, then it's a bit difficult to sort of even implement those ideas. I think that there's enough in the team.",
      "\"I think there's a lot of talent within the squad. You've just got to find a way to win matches.\"",

      "Bryan Mbeumo looks to be on the move from Brentford this summer, but the burning question is will he arrive at Old Trafford or the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The 25-year-old winger scored 20 goals and bagged eight assists for the Bees this season, and as a result, a number of their Premier League rivals are linked with him.",
      "Manchester United have been pursuing Mbeumo since the initial summer transfer window opened, with Ruben Amorim looking to bolster his firepower for 2025/26 following a dismal 15th-place finish. The Red Devils saw an initial bid worth up to £55million rejected by Brentford, who value Mbeumo at £60m.",
      "However, it is said that United are currently preparing another offer for the Cameroon international, who has 22 caps for the country. Thomas Frank moving to north London put the cat amongst the pigeons.",
      "The Danish mastermind, who enjoyed seven years at Brentford, was appointed as Spurs' new manager earlier this month in the wake of Ange Postecoglou's sacking, and he will also be hoping to enhance his attacking options as the Lilywhites finished even lower than United in 17th, albeit beating them in the Europa League final.",
      "It's claimed United remain confident in their pursuit of Mbeumo despite interest from Spurs. According to the MEN, the forward has told confidants that Old Trafford is his destination of choice, although other sources have claimed that he has not snubbed the possibility of reuniting with Frank at Spurs.",
      "Sources say Spurs are \"going hard\" for the talisman and are potentially ready to offer a higher salary, but United are still the frontrunners in the race to secure his signature. After already shelling out £62.5m on Matheus Cunha, it's clear Amorim has the backing of the board this summer as he looks to overhaul his inherited squad from Erik ten Hag.",
      "And it is thought that Mbeumo would be perfect for Amorim's patented 3-4-2-1 system as United hope to find an answer for their right-hand flank, given that it has been a problem position at Old Trafford for more than a decade now.",
      "Elsewhere, Mbeumo has noted that he \"accepts\" the speculation surrounding his future. Spurs are said to have held initial talks with Brentford over a deal for the attacker, who finds himself more intrigued by the team now that they have playing under Frank as an added incentive.",
      "He added: \"It's been my best season so far in the Premier League. And even collectively, I think we did play very good games. I think we've been unlucky to chase the Europe spot, but I think it's been a fantastic season.\"",
      "Despite sources claiming that Mbeumo is more favouring of United this summer, the star has kept his cards incredibly close to his chest since Spurs entered the race for his signature.",
      "Spurs have a back-up in mind should they be unable to sign Mbeumo this summer, with talks having been held with the representatives of Antoine Semenyo of Bournemouth. The winger enjoyed somewhat of a breakthrough season with the Cherries in 2024/25, scoring 11 goals and providing six assists in the Premier League.",
      "Spurs like his versatility, able to play wide or as a No.9. But Bournemouth have no intention of parting with the Ghanaian, 25, cheaply - refusing to go for anything less than £60m, however, reflecting his importance as a key player.",

      "Fernandes, who will soon be 30, decided he didn't want to leave the Premier League for Saudi at this stage of his career, despite United's dismal 2024-25 campaign, which saw them finish 15th in the top flight and fail to qualify for Europe.",
      "And club legend Ferdinand believes that his decision to snub a move away and continue fighting to get United back where they believe they should be, tells fans everything they need to know about their talisman.",
      "\"And listen, I understand it's a business. But I think he looks at this as pure, 'I've got unfinished business at United. There's stuff I want to do here. Yes, I've been paid well here. The fans love me.' But I think he's in the game of wanting to give back after all he's received. So I've got nothing but respect for him. I would have understood him leaving if he left, 100 percent.",
      "\"But the fact that he stayed and said, listen, there's stuff for me still to do here. I think it's a testament to him as a person, but also another reason why the managers comfortably give him the armband.\"",
      "And Ferdinand admitted: \"If I was him, I think I'd have found it difficult to say no. I've got to be honest.\"",
      "One thing that badly hampered United last term was their struggles in front of goal. They have already struck a £62.5m deal with Wolves for Matheus Cunha as they bid to rectify that issue, with Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo now being targeted too. A new No.9 is also on their list, with Viktor Gyokeres and Hugo Ekitike both having been mooted as potential arrivals.",
      "On the personal front, ex-England ace Ferdinand recently launched his Career Transfer Hub in collaboration with Talking Futures, with hopes of bridging the gap between teenagers and their parents in terms of future planning. He says about the cause: \" I think it's about empowering kind of families to talk more about education, especially parents.",
      "\"I think we're comfortable talking about a lot of things, i.e. football, a lot of the time in and around the front room or across the table with your kids, but getting that kind of common ground when you're talking about education, sometimes it's quite difficult, even I've found it difficult at times.",
      "\"So something like this is definitely a good way in and a good avenue in to kind of having those conversations about what's next in your life, education wise, where do you see yourself going? What paths are you looking at?",
      "\"And this is a great, I think, avenue for parents to really kind of touch the paper and go, right, listen, here we go, and start walking their kids down the right path, giving them a little bit of autonomy over it, but also guide them a little bit at the same time.",

For example, Liverpool and Everton are not allowed to play at home on the same weekend, due to the intense strain it would put on police resources. The same would also apply to Manchester United and Manchester City, but the rules are relaxed when it comes to London teams, due to the large number of clubs in the capital.",

      "Meanwhile, Sporting president Federico Varandas has confirmed that his side won’t be bullied into selling his star forward. Speaking to Record, he said: \"One thing you should already know is me better. Threats, blackmail and insults don't work with me.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyökeres will not leave for €60m+10m (£51m+£8.5m) because I never promised him that. This game that the agent is playing only makes the situation worse. To this day, Sporting has not had an offer for Viktor Gyökeres, neither today nor last season.\""

      "Manchester United will have a fight on their hands to snap up the best talent this summer after missing out on Champions League football, with their bid to sign Bryan Mbeumo proving more difficult than first anticipated.",
      "The Red Devils looked like favourites to sign the Brentford forward before having a £60million bid rejected and then Tottenham entered the race - buoyed by the arrival of Mbeumo's ex-manager Thomas Frank. Spurs have since submitted a £70m offer.",
      "United remain confident they will secure the player's signature, having already sign Matheus Cunha from Wolves for around £62m. But Amorim has bigger problems on his hands trying to shift unwanted stars like Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford and Antony.",
      "Amorim will be eager to bolster his squad as much as possible after a dismal Premier League season saw them finish 15th in the table and he needs much better quality to boost the depth of his talent.",
      "United are already the frontrunners to sign Mbeumo after he impressed with 20 goals in the top flight last season, by far his best campaign for Brentford.",
      "Mbeumo is said to be \"leaning towards\" a move to Old Trafford, but the saga remains unclear after United's rejected bid.",
      "And Frank's move to Tottenham has complicated matters, with the player said to be \"intrigued\" by the north London switch now that Frank has arrived - a manager he admires so much.",
      "But United are doing their best to persuade Mbeumo his future lies in Manchester and now goalkeeper Andre Onana is reportedly on the case trying to convince his international team-mate.",
      "Onana and Mbeumo play together for the Cameroonian national team and are thought to be close friends, with the shot-stopper hoping he can work his magic given the nature of their relationship.",
      "United are in need of new forward players after some dismal performances from Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee last season. The duo managed only seven goals in the Premier League between them.",
      "Speaking of Onana - while he appears to be the No 1 goalkeeper at United, that could change quickly if a decent alternative option appears in the transfer window.",
      "And while Amorim is understood happy to have Onana as his first-choice going into the new season, he might have his head turned after ESPN Argentina reported Emiliano Martinez is angling for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "The report also adds that United have already began negotiations with the Argentine World Cup winner to replace Onana.",
      "Martinez has a contract until 2029 at Aston Villa but is expected to leave the club this summer after appearing to give a tearful farewell following the team's last home game of the season.",
      "He has made 212 appearances for Villa since joining from Arsenal in 2020, while also picking up a total of 53 caps for his country.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho is one of United's transfer misfits they are trying to shift this summer after falling out with Amorim.",
      "The winger gave an outspoken interview after being dropped for United's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham and declared the team's season as \"s***\" - and his agent brother Roberto added fuel to the fire by claiming he had been \"thrown under the boss\" by his manager.",
      "The Argentine has been strongly linked with Napoli in this window in a move that would unite him with ex-Chelsea boss Antonio Conte.",
      "Bayer Leverkusen were also said to be interested in the player, but Erik ten Hag's side were put off United's £70m valuation.",
      "However, despite the interest from abroad, Garnacho is prioritising a Premier League stay, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "It says Garnacho would have interest from Chelsea, Aston Villa and Tottenham should he opt to continue playing in England's top flight.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Kleberson had the world at his feet back in 2003. Fresh from winning the World Cup just 12 months before, he became the first-ever Brazilian to sign for Manchester United.",
      "Supporters were understandably excited after a fresh-faced Kleberson was pictured alongside a teenage Cristiano Ronaldo on the Old Trafford touchline after putting pen to paper with the Red Devils. But the former midfielder struggled to hit the heights expected of him in the Premier League having made just 30 appearances for the club over two seasons before being allowed to join Turkish giants Besiktas.",
      "“It all happened so fast. It’s so fast. Unfortunately, I got a lot of injuries that push me back. I only say that because when I got an injury, I got back 100% to play, I need to compete against Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo who started to fly.",
      "“It’s not easy. I know I won the World Cup at the time and at a big name Manchester United but it took time to get to a better level. But injuries didn’t help me at that time.",
      "“But I was the first Brazilian in the Reds jersey, the first to score in Old Trafford and my sons are born there. I have great memories, I really enjoyed that time.”",
      "While Kleberson’s injuries limited his contributions for United, the man who he was unveiled alongside - Cristiano Ronaldo - enjoyed plenty of success. The five-time Ballon d'Or scored 118 goals across his first spell before his record move to Real Madrid.",
      "Kleberson knew he was destined for stardom after meeting him for the first time. He said: \"It’s so funny because when I get into Old Trafford to sign my contract, I remember I was on a table with a lot of agents. And then a young guy was there. I asked ‘who’s that kid?’ And it was Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "“I was told he played in a friendly game for Sporting vs United and he destroyed the game. Before Cristiano, they tried to bring Ronaldinho and I think ‘wow, that kid is probably special’.",
      "“As soon as I saw that kid on the field, his dribbling, his technical quality, it’s amazing. But one thing is was how focused he was. He was really focused on the things he wanted to see, concentrated.",
      "\"He wants to get better quickly. He had a special mentor in Sir Alex Ferguson and he put him in the right direction. Ferdinand, Roy Keane and Gary Neville helped him to improve. But the strong mind he had at that time really impressed me. To see him score goals in a final for Portugal, that kid never stops.”",
      "With it now being over two decades since Kleberson became the first Brazilian to sign for the club, United have once again turned to a Selecao star in the transfer market. Ruben Amorim’s side quickly paid Matheus Cunha’s £62.5m release clause to sign him from Wolves.",
      "Kleberson believes he could be just the answer the club are looking for to solve their goalscoring woes. He added: “It’s a big signing for Man United. I really enjoy watching Cunha play.",
      "“He starts to play in my town in Coritiba. I really enjoyed watching his game against Paraguay. It was the first time I watched him this close.",
      "“He does a little bit more close movement, a lot of runs without the ball, diagonal moves. It’s a big signing. I think United are going to be scoring well with him.”",
      "Another Premier League player who has been on the move this summer has been Jorginho. The Arsenal midfielder was allowed to leave the Emirates Stadium to sign for Brazilian side Flamengo ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "And Kleberson believes that the Italian could have a big impact for his former side in the USA this summer. He said: “I think that’s a big signing for Flamengo because of the experience he brings for the club, it’s amazing.",
      "“He’s a leader. He wants to come to Brazil, wants to play in the Maracana and now he can help the club a lot. But for this tournament, it’s a great signing and he’s going to be helping Flamengo a lot in some of the games.”",
      "Kleberson was speaking ahead of the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup 2025. Watch all 63 games live on DAZN for free.",

      "After spending £81.3million on Antony in September 2022 and an initial £64m on Rasmus Hojlund 11 months later, Manchester United know what it's like to get stung in the transfer market.",
      "United spent the entirety of the 2022 summer transfer window chasing Antony's tail, confident that a reunion with Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford would fix their long-term right-wing problems.",
      "Having never once stepped foot in one of Europe's top five leagues, the fee United paid Ajax to bring Antony to England was nothing short of astronomical. United had been reluctant to meet Ajax's demands for much of the summer.",
      "Less than three years later, United have made Antony one of three players they want to sell as a priority this summer. They need to bank £32.5m for him to avoid a loss under the profit and sustainability [PSR] regulations.",
      "Antony will go down as one of the Premier League's greatest flops. Perhaps the greatest. No club wants to be associated with that particular tag.",
      "The addition of Antony, likewise Hojlund the following summer, is a prime example of just how reckless United have been in their spending in recent years. They have had their pants pulled down far too often, sometimes through sheer desperation to get a deal over the line.",
      "Both Ajax and Atalanta must not have been able to believe their luck when United agreed to such big-money deals to sign two raw and unproven attackers. Chelsea, too, must have been rubbing their hands together when they pocketed an initial fee of £55m for Mason Mount with just one year remaining on his contract in July 2023.",
      "Recruitment failings have been a massive contributor to United's decline. Too many deals have been conducted without football specialists or recruitment gurus overseeing them.",
      "However, under Ineos' leadership, United have offered signs of encouragement on the recruitment front. Although last summer's recruitment was not perfect, it was certainly better than what had been served up in previous years.",
      "Noussair Mazraoui arrived for a bargain base fee of just £12.8m and Leny Yoro, who is widely regarded as one of the most promising centre-backs in world football, was drafted in with the ambition of making him a mainstay in United's defence for years to come.",
      "With a sensible recruitment strategy in place, United will believe they are on the right track in their quest to achieve 'Project 150' in 2028 and win both the Premier League and the Women's Super League.",
      "Having laid the foundations and offered an insight into how they plan to recruit under Ineos' stewardship last summer, United are trying to raise the bar again this summer. Matheus Cunha has already arrived from Wolves for £62.5m and United hope Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo will be the next arrival.",
      "United want to move at speed this summer to get the squad in as good a position as possible ahead of the start of the 2025/26 season, and the addition of Cunha so early on in the window is a reflection of their ambitions.",
      "Just days after confirming they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Cunha, United saw a £55m offer turned down for Mbeumo. Yes, the offer fell short of Brentford's valuation, but it once again highlighted how keen the club is to get on with rebuilding the squad this summer.",
      "As hungry as United are for new additions, they need to ensure they find the right balance between moving at speed and not paying over the odds and repeating mistakes of yesteryear.",
      "\"We're going to do our best to do more signings quickly,\" chief executive Omar Berrada recently told United We Stand.",
      "\"Sometimes when you're not quick, it's because you're negotiating and you're trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn't necessarily the best thing for the club.\"",
      "Every club dreams of getting deals done quickly. It is every coach's dream to have the bulk of his business done in time for the start of pre-season.",
      "That, however, is a dream that rarely becomes a reality. Nevertheless, United are actively working to get new signings through the door.",
      "As commendable as that particular element is, United also deserve recognition for trying to distance themselves from mistakes of the past. They understand and embrace the hunger for signings, but they are not prepared to have their pants pulled down again."

      "Matheus Cunha has already been added to United's attack, arriving from Wolves last week after his £62.5m release clause was triggered, and they still want to add Mbeumo and an out-and-out centre-forward.",
      "Spurs' interest in the former Troyes man should come as no surprise amid the fact they appointed Thomas Frank as their new head coach last week after extracting him from the Gtech Community Stadium. Frank worked with Mbeumo for six years in west London.",
      "Despite his former boss being keen on a reunion in north London, Mbeumo has informed confidants that United, just as they were two weeks ago, remain his preferred choice. He has his sights set on playing at Old Trafford and making a name for himself under Ruben Amorim.",
      "United lost to Spurs in last month's Europa League final, of course, meaning the Londoners secured Champions League qualification for next season at their expense. Champions League football is the holy grail for most players, meaning it would be easy to understand why Mbeumo could favour a move to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium over Old Trafford.",
      "However, despite United being unable to offer any form of European football in 2025/26, Mbeumo remains keen to move to M16. And it is players of that mindset and mentality United need to recruit this summer.",
      "Furthermore, it has highlighted Amorim was right that any player will always dream of playing for United's because of their history and heritage.",
      "Speaking in April, Amorim said: \"It's Manchester United. What I feel is that there's a lot of players that want to play for our club.",

      "\"That is the easiest part to explain to a player. And then it's Manchester United. Everybody wants to play for Manchester United.\"",
      "There is no denying the fact the 2024/25 campaign was a forgettable period in United's history, but one bad season cannot undo all of the pomp and pageantry that comes with arguably the biggest sporting institution in the world.",
      "United will always appeal to players and they have clearly caught Mbeumo's attention. The fact he is so keen on joining United at this current juncture is also a positive reflection of his character and mentality."

      "Supporters may have to wait to get a new striker's name on the back of their shirt. It has largely flown under the radar that United's priority signing is seldom the first through the door.",
      "In last year's case, he was the last. United had to wait for Scott McTominay to go for Manuel Ugarte to come in. Both of their transfers were finalised on deadline day, with Ugarte's confirmed at 9.15pm.",
      "United bought two centre backs and a right back before a defensive midfielder when the glaring issue in their madcap 2023-24 campaign was the absence of a shield in front of the back four. Erik ten Hag had two No.6s but Casemiro was injury-prone and Sofyan Amrabat not entrusted until the final two weeks of the season. He was not signed permanently.",
      "Two years ago, a starting striker was essential. The belated call on David de Gea's future made a new goalkeeper inevitable and Andre Onana came in less than three weeks after his predecessor brought down the curtain on 12 years at United.",
      "United had been yearning for a goalscorer for a year. At the start of United's 2023 pre-season tour in New Jersey, we stopped Ten Hag in the mixed zone for an impromptu chat. When did he hope the striker would arrive?",
      "\"Last year!\" he chuckled. Cristiano Ronaldo's heart was no longer in it at United in his second season. Martial's body had more breakdowns than a day on the M6 and United had quietly bade farewell to Wout Weghorst, scorer of two tap-ins in 31 games.",
      "Hojlund was the last of the three major incomings, a deal still concluded early enough for him to be introduced to United fans before their pre-season friendly with Lens at Old Trafford. The downside was a stress fracture of his back delayed his debut by four more weeks.",
      "In Ten Hag's first window, a midfield linchpin was sought. United travelled to Thailand and Australia that summer while Frenkie de Jong headed to the United States with Barcelona. A deal for De Jong always seemed as distant.",
      "Two damaging results to Brighton and Brentford later, United were panicked into a £70m deal for Casemiro in late August. Without Casemiro, they might not have qualified for the Champions League that season.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was one of the weakest United managers, which may account for the enviable backing he often enjoyed. Whether you regarded a winger or a centre back as United's priority in 2021, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane were United's first two buys and they had both in the building before the season started.",
      "The 2020 window was unique amid the Covid-19 pandemic, with United restricted to a four-week turnaround between the seasons. They had also been bolstered by the season-changing winter signing of Bruno Fernandes.",
      "With a back five firmly established and United inundated with midfielders, an incisive forward was wanted. Sancho and Jack Grealish were unattainable. Donny van de Beek was on the same shortlist as the latter and, even with the protocols about isolating, was able to debut in United's first fixture.",
      "Solskjaer had to wait a while for Harry Maguire in 2019, a summer infamous for United's one-at-a-time strategy. With the transfer window's closure date brought forward to before the start of the season, United spent roughly a month apiece to bring in Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka before the world-record £80m they spent on Maguire in August.",
      "2018-19 had been United's worst defensive season in 40 years after Ed Woodward failed, or refused, to furnish Jose Mourinho with a new centre back. Maguire, also coveted by Mourinho, was priced at £75m by Leicester in 2018 and left for only £5m more a year later. Mourinho is the only modern United manager to be deprived of a priority target.",
      "Cunha has been rubbing shoulders with Ronaldo and Ronaldinho, two Brazilians who got away from United. The club has a dire hit-rate with Brazilian players but Cunha is the first to join them who has already played in the Premier League.",
      "So has Bryan Mbeumo. Mohamed Salah, Alexander Isak and Erling Haaland are the only players who scored more Premier League goals than Mbeumo in 2024-25. Mbeumo tallied a superb 20. Cunha got 15.",
      "Nobody would expect, or want, either to lead the line for United. They have needed a proven goalscorer for three years and Liam Delap is not that. Delap is not a miss but missing out on him will prolong United's search for a striker, almost certainly into July. Perhaps even August.",
      "Cunha may top the pre-season shirt sales.",

      "Manchester United's chief executive Omar Berrada has expressed his confidence in the club's ability to clinch both the men's and women's league titles by their 150th anniversary in 2028.",
      "Despite acknowledging the challenges faced, with the men's team having their worst top-flight season since 1973-74 and Chelsea dominating the Women's Super League, Berrada remains optimistic about achieving this milestone for the club, which was founded as Newton Heath in 1878.",
      "In an upcoming interview with the United We Stand fanzine, Berrada outlined his \"Project 150\" vision that he first shared with staff last September, setting a series of targets within a specific timeframe to concentrate the club's efforts and energy.",
      "\"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal,\" Berrada said.",
      "\"Can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.\"",
      "The men's team finished just above the relegation zone and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham, and the women's team finished third in the WSL, 16 points behind champions Chelsea.",
      "Nonetheless, Berrada has questioned why they shouldn't aim high and do everything within their power to reach their goals.",
      "Highlighting the importance of the upcoming summer transfer windows to build a competitive team, Berrada added: \"I firmly believe we can do it.",
      "\"We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League.\"",
      "United's men's team have made a solid start to the summer transfer window with the £62.5million addition of Wolves forward Matheus Cunha while they are also keen on a move for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Tuesday, June 17.",
      "The summer transfer window has officially reopened and clubs can now start doing business freely again until the market closes for good on Monday, September 1. United have plenty of business to do both this week, and the subsequent weeks which are to follow.",
      "United's top priority will be to bring Bryan Mbeumo to Old Trafford after the Brentford star's ongoing negotiations with the Reds. Tottenham Hotspur have also shown an interest in him following the appointment of Thomas Frank and the Cameroonian has now broken his silence surrounding his future.",
      "Elsewhere, United appeared to receive a boost in their hunt to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer. Reports in Portugal suggest that Arsenal's interest is cooling in the Swedish star due to Sporting's valuation of the forward.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund continues to be linked with a move back to Italy with Inter Milan seemingly desperate for his signature. All United players are available to be sold in the summer window, for the right price, and thus Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Marcus Rashford all have suitors chasing their services.",
      "Keep across the United transfer updates in our blog below:",
      "Amid ongoing reports linking United with a move for Emi Martinez this summer, MEN Sport understands that Andre Onana is expected to stay at the club this summer.",
      "It is believed that Onana has been working hard to convince his fellow countryman Bryan Mbeumo to sign for the Reds.",
      "Onana is thought to have held a meeting last week with United officials where he was reassured that he shall remain at the club beyond this summer.",
      "The new Manchester United kit is draped over the mannequins in the Old Trafford Megastore. On the online store, a handful of players' names are pre-printed on the new shirt.",
      "Fernandes, Yoro, Martinez, Amad and Maguire are all featured. Safe choices. Ella Toone, Maya le Tissier and Grace Clinton also have that privilege.",
      "It would be remiss of United to proactively plug 'Hojlund 9'. Get 'Rashford 10' or 'Garnacho 17' at your peril. 'Sancho' and 'Antony 21' are not even listed on the online options.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "The Athletic understands that Real Betis remain keen to bring Antony to their club permanently this summer.",
      "Talks are understood to have taken place with United to find out what their stance is. MEN Sport understands that United are keen to sell the Brazilian winger.",
      "No offers have yet been made for Antony and there is a realisation that this one could take time to complete.",
      "In perhaps the biggest hint yet that Garnacho will be leaving, his personal photographer Konrad Borzy appeared to confirm that the Aregentine had made his last appearances for the club.",
      "Posting on Instagram a selection of photos of the winger in action, Borzy wrote:",
      "One last time in Manchester United red… Garnacho under the lens.",
      "After turning down a move to Al Hilal this summer, Galatasaray remain interested in Victor Osimhen.",
      "The Athletic understands that Osimhen's wage demands are not a problem for the Istanbul club.",
      "However, they would likely struggle to activate the forward's £63m release clause this summer and would need Napoli to soften their position.",
      "Now Football Insider have claimed that United are unlikely to pursue a summer deal for Ekitke.",
      "The 22-year-old is in high demand but the outlet has claimed that sources have told them that the price-tag for the France youngster.",
      "The transfer mystery continues.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United have agreed a new deal for third choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton.",
      "It is understood this news has been shared with Amorim and his coaching staff.",
      "Heaton has reportedly signed a new one-year contract and the news will be confirmed soon.",
      "In an interview with United We Stand, the club's CEO Omar Berrada has spoken about the potential timeline for new additions to this squad this summer.",
      "Explaining the plan, he said:",
      "He [Matheus Cunha] was an important one to get done. We’re going to do our best to do more signings quickly. Sometimes when you’re not quick, it’s because you’re negotiating and you’re trying to make sure you get the right value for money. So being efficient or quick isn’t necessarily the best thing for the club.",
      "According to Sky Sport Italia, the interest in Sancho from Napoli is there but his wages could prevent a deal from happening.",
      "The structure of a deal is currently unknown but this will apparently not stop the Naples club trying for him.",
      "Sancho has just one year remaining on his deal at United.",
      "If we were in Sancho's shoes right now, we would be all over a move to Napoli this summer.",
      "The club is on a high after winning Serie A, shall be playing in the Champions League and has already shown what they can do for a player that has lost their way.",
      "McTominay has progressed leaps and bounds under Conte and Sancho must surely feel he can follow in those footsteps.",
      "Journalist Gianluca di Marzio understands that Napoli have opened up as a potential home for Jadon Sancho this summer.",
      "United are on the lookout for suitors for Sancho after he failed to reach personal terms with Chelsea at the end of the season.",
      "Napoli reinvigorated the career of Scott McTominay this season and are looking to strengthen their wings ahead of the new campaign.",
      "With Boudaoui currently playing for Nice, another arm of Ineos' sporting empire, there may be some concerns as to whether United can actually purchase the midfielder.",
      "Last year, it was thought that United were blocked from signing Jean-Clair Todibo because both Nice and the Reds were competing in the Europa League.",
      "However, because United are not competing in Europe next season, it is unlikely that UEFA would block the sale as it would not be seen as a conflict of interest.",
      "Manchester United reportedly sent scouts to watch OGC Nice midfielder Hicham Boudaoui during Algeria's encounter with Sweden.",
      "It has been said that the transfer chiefs at Old Trafford monitored the 25-year-old's performance with reports suggesting that the club are eyeing a midfield addition this summer.",
      "In a report last month, it was claimed that an exit was looking increasingly likely for the Nice man.",
      "According to The Athletic, Eintracht Frankfurt remain stubborn with their £85m price tag for their talisman this summer.",
      "However, United have contacted the German club regarding his availability and how much the deal would cost.",
      "It is believed that these enquiries have found that Frankfurt are flexible on the structure of the £85m deal which could open the door for Ekitike to arrive in Manchester.",
      "Remaining on Hugo Ekitike, according to Caught Offside, United are still keen on his signature.",
      "It has been said that the fee for the Eintracht Frankfurt star is problematic but they are trying to bring the €100m (£85m) fee down.",
      "A swap deal isn't being ruled out either, the report adds. United could offer Ramus Hojlund or Joshua Zirkzee as part of the deal.",
      "Fabrizio Romano reported that Manchester United face a fight to sign Eintracht Frankfurt star Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Liverpool are also reportedly interested.",
      "However, the Anfield club face a number of factors surrounding their pursuit namely the future of Darwin Nunez.",
      "Romano claimed: “With Darwin leaving, Ekitike is a concrete target for Liverpool. Liverpool already spoke to the agents of the player at the end of May.",
      "\"Liverpool are in regular contact with people close to Hugo Ekitike, so for sure Ekitike remains a player on Liverpool’s list.",
      "“I know there are rumours on several clubs for this kind of striker, but don’t forget Liverpool, because they are still there.”",
      "Hello, we are back for another day of news and all things transfers.",
      "The window reopened yesterday and Manchester United will be pushing to ensure that they can acquire their targets as the market heats up.",
      "That is it for our live Manchester United transfer news blog tonight.",
      "Thank you for tuning in and stay alerted for updates tomorrow...",
      "TuttoAtalanta have reported that Atalanta's Marco Carnesecchi is Manchester United's first-choice goalkeeper target to replace Andre Onana this summer.",
      "While Atalanta don't want to sell, they could be willing to cash in if a bid of £38million comes in for Carnesecchi. That would allow the Serie A club to make a serious amount on a homegrown player.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has praised Bruno Fernandes after the Manchester United captain turned down a move to Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"The one thing it says to me, there's a loyalty. And I think that word gets banded about quite a lot, but we don't really see it often from the club's point of view and the players,\" Ferdinand told the Mirror.",
      "\"I understand it's a business. But I think he looks at this as pure, 'I've got unfinished business at United. There's stuff I want to do here. Yes, I've been paid well here. The fans love me.' But I think he's in the game of wanting to give back after all he's received. So I've got nothing but respect for him. I would have understood him leaving if he left, 100%. But the fact that he stayed and said there's stuff for me still to do here. I think it's a testament to him as a person, but also another reason why managers comfortably give him the armband.",
      "\"If I was him, I think I'd have found it difficult to say no [to Al Hilal]. I've got to be honest.\"",
      "Manchester United are showing interest in a summer move for Inter Milan midfielder Davide Frattesi, according to Sky Sport Switzerland journalist Sacha Tavolieri.",
      "The Reds are among several European clubs keeping an eye on the Italy international, with Napoli and Atletico Madrid also keen.",
      "Frattesi is said to be considering an exit from Inter following Simone Inzaghi's departure, having struggled for game time last season.",
      "Manchester United could have an unexpected boost in the race to sign Hugo Ekitike after the Eintracht Frankfurt forward revealed he supported the Reds as a child.",
      "The 22-year-old has been linked with a move to the Premier League this summer, with United, Chelsea and Liverpool all credited with an interest in the Frenchman.",
      "But if United's interest in the forward is genuine, then they will need to be creative with their pitch to the forward after missing out on Champions League qualification, while both Liverpool and Chelsea will be able to offer Ekitike the chance to play in Europe's premier competition.",
      "The Reds, though, will be able to play on the Frenchman's emotional connection to the club, after he revealed last year he supported United when he was younger.",
      "\"My favourite club as a child was Manchester United. I've always admired them,\" Ekitike told German broadcaster RTL in December 2024.",
      "Antony is keen to remain at Real Betis and the Spanish club have held several meetings in Manchester regarding his future, as per Diario AS.",
      "The Brazilian, 25, joined Betis on loan in January and impressed during the second half of the season, scoring nine goals and adding five assists in 26 appearances.",
      "Betis want to keep hold of Antony, and while there is concerns over the size of a transfer fee, work is ongoing and confidence is growing.",
      "Manchester United have made contact to sign Real Madrid forward Brahim Diaz this summer, according to a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes.",
      "It's added that United would be looking to give him a 'greater role' in the side, with Real said to be prepared to cash in on the 25-year-old former Manchester City man.",
      "Manchester United are keen on signing Algerian midfielder Hicham Boudaoui from INEOS-owned Ligue 1 side Nice, it has been claimed.",
      "The Sun report that United send scouts to watch Boudaoui in international action as Algeria took on Sweden at the Friends Arena.",
      "Club officials monitored the performance of Boudaoui, who started and played an hour before he was taken off. United are now thinking of signing the 25-year-old, who has been tipped to leave Nice.",
      "Marcus Rashford's 'dream' transfer to Barcelona could be left in tatters as the Catalan club press ahead to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Club de Bilbao instead.",
      "The Manchester United forward has seen his long-term future become uncertain after a successful loan at Aston Villa, where he scored four times and added six assists in 17 matches.",
      "Despite this, United are expected to sever ties with the 27-year-old and want to secure a permanent exit, with Barcelona among those that have been linked with a potential summer move.",
      "But Barca appear to be focusing on another target, with Spain international Williams at the top of their shopping list. According to Sky Sport Germany, Barca have the 'best chance' to sign the 22-year-old ahead of Arsenal, Chelsea and Bayern Munich after 'important negotiations' took place over the last 24 hours.",
      "Spanish outlet Partidazo de Cope [via Footmercato] have reported that Man United target Marc-Andre ter Stegen has no intention of leaving Barcelona this summer.",
      "The goalkeeper has been linked with a move to Old Trafford but it's now said the 33-year-old will not consider terminating his contract despite Joan Garcia joining.",
      "Jadon Sancho is reportedly refusing to lower his wage demands in a move that could stop Man United selling the winger.",
      "GiveMeSport claim that Sancho's demands are putting off potential buyers due to his £300k-per-week wages.",
      "It's claimed Borussia Dortmund remain keen on signing him.",
      "Fabrizio Romano has suggested that Man United's move for Bryan Mbeumo is still 'ongoing' with the club yet to agree on a deal with Brentford.",
      "The journalist has expressed how an agreement is in place with the forward but conversations with Brentford remain ongoing. That's the reason a deal hasn't yet been fully agreed.",
      "The outlet claims that agreeing personal terms with the Frenchman won't be a problem. Ekitike has been linked with United in the last week."

Sancho spent last season on loan at Chelsea and while he scored in the Conference League final against Real Betis, the winger's time at Stamford Bridge was largely considered underwhelming.",
      "At the end of this season, it was no surprise to see Sancho and Chelsea fail to reach personal terms on a new contract. Despite being obligated to purchase the 25-year-old, the Blues agreed to pay United £5m to allow him to return to Old Trafford.",
      "This was seen as bad news for United who are keen to sell Sancho permanently this summer and now face the task of finding him a new home. Fortunately, an escape route to Italy has opened for the winger with journalist Gianluca di Marzio insisting that Napoli are interested in the England international.",

Despite this, it is insisted that they are willing to give it a go for the winger who has just one year remaining on his deal at United."

      "But Los Blancos have said 'no' and turned down the chance to sign Gyokeres. It's added that while Xabi Alonso's side 'like him', they ruled him out because of the potential cost and his demand to be a starter.",

      "As for Gyokeres, he is still expected to leave Sporting and seek a new adventure, almost a week on since the club's president revealed that there is no gentleman's agreement for him to leave for £59million.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" Frederico Varandas said in a press conference last Wednesday.",

      "Angry Ginge has branded Carlos Tevez a \"f***ing traitor\" on his live stream following his clash with the former Manchester United star during Soccer Aid.",
      "Popular streamer Angry Ginge, real name Morgan Burtwistle, fulfilled his boyhood dream of playing at Old Trafford by taking part in Sunday's charity match.",
      "The lifelong Red Devils supporter featured in defence for England in Soccer Aid 2025, which pitted him directly against ex-United forward Tevez, who was playing for the World XI team.",
      "Tevez lifted two Premier League titles and a Champions League trophy with United before controversially moving to Manchester City in 2009.",
      "He became a despised figure among many of the Old Trafford faithful, especially after celebrating a goal against his former side in a Manchester Derby.",
      "Burtwistle clearly hadn't forgotten that as he seized the opportunity to exact some punishment on Tevez during the friendly match, delivering a hefty tackle on the Argentine legend.",
      "Although he won the ball, Tevez was visibly angry with the robust nature of the tackle and retaliated by seemingly kicking out at the defender, which led to a brief exchange between the two.",
      "Tevez quickly realised where he was and shook hands with the 23-year-old. For Ginge, however, the bad blood remained beyond the final whistle as he took to Instagram to share a photo of a nasty cut on his leg courtesy of Tevez.",
      "His caption read: \"Cheers Tevez, t***,\" echoing his thoughts on the Boca Juniors icon, having once admitted that he \"can't stand\" him. And he didn't stop there, going on to reveal during one of his live streams that he had his match-worn Soccer Aid shirt signed by everyone on both teams, except Tevez, whom he took aim at in an explosive outburst.",
      "The internet personality said: \"Look at that. Signed by every single person on the team. And the away team. Bar one man. The f***ing traitor. Tevez ain't signing my f***ing shirt. Not in a million years. No chance.\"",
      "But it was Tevez who ultimately had the last laugh, netting four goals within 15 minutes to spearhead the World XI's comeback. Despite being booed after each goal he scored, Tevez seemed to thrive as the antagonist, cupping his ear and pointing to the name on the back of his shirt.",
      "His goals levelled the match, setting the stage for Big Zuu to score a late goal and secure a 5-4 win. Zuu emphatically celebrated with his own version of Cristiano Ronaldo's 'Siu' celebration.",
      "Ginge was, however, named the Player of the Match despite Tevez's eye-catching performance. His stunning defensive efforts included a dive across the goal to deny France World Cup winner David Trezeguet the chance to level the score."

      "\"We knew that by bringing in Ruben mid-season that it was going to be even more difficult for the team to perform,\" Berrada told United We Stand.",

      "\"And the team has suffered. It's really going to help us in the future.",
      "\"I couldn't have said that we were going to finish 15th. That was never the goal.",

They are also confident in adding Bryan Mbeumo to Amorim's team with the Brentford star understood to prefer a move to Old Trafford despite interest from Thomas Frank's Tottenham.",
      "Further down the line, a new striker remains a priority. United recorded their worst goalscoring season in 35 years last term and their intention to recruit one early in the window hit a stumbling block after Liam Delap joined Chelsea.",
      "Unsurprisingly, signings are the priority for United. Should Mbeumo arrive, the focus could shift more towards selling players to raise funds for further reinforcements. Worryingly, no asset has come close to leaving.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho are all players United will, in a dream scenario, sell to bring in an estimated £155m. Garnacho, who United reportedly want £70m for, is the big one after his antics at the end of the season.",
      "Their exit would give Amorim the green light to get his hands on his new striker. Right now, it's unclear who that will be but Viktor Gyokeres and Victor Osimhen fit the mould that the United boss desires.",
      "Reports from The Athletic have claimed Amorim wants a striker who can play with his back to goal, work as a hook for others to play-off him, have explosive pace, turn half-chances into goals and score a high volume of goals. That criteria does spark concern over the likes of Hugo Ekitike, who is similar to Joshua Zirkzee.",

      "In securing Cunha's signature so early, United made their mark on the window quickly, highlighting just how keen they are to show some ambition.",
      "As well as getting a deal in place to sign Cunha prior to the temporary closure, they also made their first move for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. They saw an opening offer of £55m turned down just under a fortnight ago but talks between the two clubs remain ongoing.",
      "Mbeumo has informed Brentford's hierarchy that Old Trafford is his preferred destination this summer. However, United are yet to table a second bid for the Cameroon international.",
      "However, since the window temporarily closed last Tuesday, Tottenham Hotspur have also been credited with interest in Mbeumo. That was almost inevitable after Spurs recently appointed Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach.",
      "Despite having an excellent relationship with Frank, Mbeumo is understood to be determined to move to Old Trafford. United want to strengthen their attacking options this summer and adding the versatile attacker to the addition of Cunha would be a real statement of intent.",

After missing out on Liam Delap earlier this month, they have been linked with a crop of alternative options, including the likes of Napoli's Victor Osimhen, Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon and most recently Eintracht Frankfurt ace Hugo Ekitike.",
      "Whoever United plan to try and make their first-choice No.9 will be dependent on outgoings. The prospect of signing Mbeumo for a fee in the region of £60m will take their spending past the £120m mark before sanctioning any sales.",
      "United are also keen to sign a midfielder and a goalkeeper this summer. Head coach Ruben Amorim wants a new shot-stopper who can challenge and compete with Andre Onana for the No.1 spot. The addition of a specialist right wing-back is also possible.",
      "Much of what United will be able to do on the incoming front will rest on outgoings. Preparing to oversee up to ten departures, United have a collection of players they would like to offload this summer.",
      "The Reds have identified Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony as priority sales. Each of them spent time out on loan in 2024/25 and United want to offload them permanently ahead of the September 1 deadline.",
      "Rashford is valued at £40m, Antony is available at £32.5m and Sancho could command a fee of somewhere in the region of £20m-£25m after Chelsea paid a £5m penalty clause to break their obligation to sign him permanently.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave Old Trafford for the right price. Napoli had a £40m bid turned down for him back in January, meaning United are expected to ask for a fee north of £50m.",

Cheaper selections, such as Jean-Phillipe Mateta, have been tipped, but there's one striker that seems to be completely forgotten about.",

      "In spite of this, there is one complication. At the end of March, Sky Sport Switzerland [via FCInterNews] reported one thing that has forced interested parties to look elsewhere is the players financial idealisation.",
      "The 25-year-old is aiming for a salary worth €9m (£7.6m) - around £145k-per-week - as well as a whopping €15m (£12.7m) sign-on bonus and €10m (£8.5m) in agent fees. That would make the deal worth just over £20m despite being a 'free' signing.",
      "However, that is still less than the figures discussed for Gyokeres, Osimhen, Mateta or Hugo Ekitike. Bringing in David also frees up more funds to be spent on other targets in midfield or defence."

      "Co-ownership of footballers is a common method in European football, but it is currently banned in the Premier League. The method was outlawed in 2007, with the Premier League stating: \"We believe that the practice threatens the integrity of competitions, reduces the flow of transfer income into sport and has the potential to exert external influence on player transfer decisions.\"",

      "Incredibly, the Swede has scored 97 goals in two seasons for the Portuguese club which is proof enough that Gyokeres is worthy of all the interest circulating around him. Manchester United and Arsenal appear to be leading the way for the 27-year-old but they are not alone in their desire to sign him.",
      "Serie A giants Juventus are also looking on while a move to the Saudi Pro League is not thought to be out of the question either. So with all the toing and froing that is encompassing the Gyokeres deal, MEN Sport has taken the time to round-up everything you need to know about the current situation.",
      "The first thing to point out with Gyokeres is that this move could run smoothly for all involved. Sporting included a £85m release clause in Gyokeres' contract and should that be met by either United, Arsenal or whoever else, then the Lisbon club could not stand his way of an exit.",
      "However, the complications arise surrounding the 'gentleman's agreement' that either exists or does not, depending on who you listen to.",
      "Gyokeres' camp believe that Sporting agreed to sell the Swede for roughly £51m up front and £8.5m in add-ons this summer. It is believed this was agreed as a thank you for his efforts in Lisbon since arriving.",
      "However, Sporting president Frederico Varandas has disputed this and insisted that he would not sell Gyokeres for as little as £60m all in. This was disputed again in the Portuguese media with Gyokeres' agency claiming that they have the agreement in writing.",
      "To his credit, Gyokeres has managed to stay out of this situation for the most part. During the season, he was asked if he liked London to which he replied that he liked Lisbon.",
      "It was claimed that Gyokeres deleted reference to Sporting on his Instagram bio as evidence that he was unhappy with the club blocking his exit. However, he fired a cryptic message shortly afterwards which read: \"There is a lot of talks at the moment, most of it false.",
      "\"I will speak when the time is right.\" It is unclear whether this was aimed at Sporting or media reports about his happiness.",
      "Varandas has since clarified his stance regarding Gyokeres' release clause. He admits that he will not hold the player to his release clause but no price was ever agreed.",
      "\"It was agreed that Sporting would not demand the release clause at the end of the following season, especially because he was going to be 27,\" the president explained to Record. \"Then, we knew Viktor's dream of going to a club where he could fight for the Champions League and we have common sense.",
      "\"We guaranteed that we would not demand 100 million (£85m). In that meeting, the agent wanted to anchor the departure to a value, he spoke of 60 million (£51m), 70 million (£59.7m)... And I said: 'There's no point in setting a value,' because I don't know what will happen here in a year, if he gets injured, if he has a disappointing season...",
      "\"From then on, I never spoke to the agent again, I never spoke to the player about departures and values. Ten months have passed and I see the agent in the press spouting information here and there, but Sporting has common sense, it keeps its word.",
      "\"The president of Sporting said that the club would not demand the clause and that we would adjust the value to Viktor's performance, he was one of the best players ever to step on the pitch in Portugal.\"",
      "In Portugal, further reports emerged on Sunday to suggest that Arsenal had frozen their interest in Gyokeres. It was claimed that the Gunners were frustrated by Sporting's desire to stick to their £68m asking price.",
      "Arsenal would therefore turn their attention to other targets, including Ollie Watkins at Aston Villa.",
      "Gyokeres and Ruben Amorim have a good working relationship and it would be shocking if the Reds were not interested in him. MEN Sport understands that Bryan Mbeumo remains the priority for the time being as they look to seal that deal before Tottenham.",
      "However, a striker is next on their incoming agenda. That search was delayed at the beginning of the window after Liam Delap chose Chelsea ahead of the Reds.",
      "To add even more confusion to the matter, Juventus are trying to muscle in on the act. The Turin club want to sign Gyokeres as a replacement for Dusan Vlahovic.",
      "Corriere dello Sport understands that the Turin club are willing to offer him a salary of £11m per year if he was to commit to them. However, the catch is that they would need to offload Vlahovic before pursuing Gyokeres.",
      "Now that is all explained, here is how the bookmakers bet365 see this situation unfolding, based on which club Gyokeres will be at by September 3, when the transfer window will have shut."

      "Manchester United could be under threat from the same European giant for two of their players, as they are ‘making an attempt’ to land a second forward.",
      "United could allow a few of their forwards to leave this summer. There’s speculation over the exits of Antony, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "The latter has been told by Ruben Amorim to “pray” that he can find a club to sign him, though that has backfired, as interested sides are now refusing to pay the asking price, with United weakening their negotiating position.",
      "Napoli are one of the clubs interested in Garnacho – interest which has been evident since January, when they bid for him – and they could now attack United for two forwards.",
      "According to Gianluca di Marzio, Napoli are looking for a ‘big move’ by ‘making an attempt’ to sign Sancho.",
      "He impressed on loan at Chelsea last season, where he scored five goals and chipped in with 10 assists in all competitions – and won the UEFA Conference League – but the Blues paid £5million to send him back to United rather than keep him permanently.",
      "It’s not believed he will have a role back at Old Trafford this season, so Napoli could be in with a chance of landing him.",
      "Whether they still want Garnacho as well is unclear. The winger was certainly still subject to interest from the Serie A champions in May, when our friends at TEAMtalk reported they had not been discouraged by being knocked back in January, and planned to return with an improved package.",
      "Links with Napoli have continued since then, but Garnacho is also linked with a number of other clubs, which could make the snare a more difficult one.",
      "Atletico Madrid, Chelsea and Bayer Leverkusen are among the sides who are reportedly interested in signing the winger.",
      "The Blues are said to be his favoured destination, with Garnacho seemingly hoping that he can remain in England, but there is a chance that he moves abroad.",
      "In any case, the snare of Sancho might be an easier one for Napoli than that of Garnacho, given there aren’t likely to be as many big sides in the mix for him. Where either of the United pair ends up remains to be seen.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have given their ‘response’ to ‘offers’ for forward Darwin Nunez, who has ‘opened up’ a transfer to a European giant.",

      "Transfer insider Fabrizio Romano has revealed that Alejandro Garnacho leaving Manchester United to reunite with a former boss will be “complicated.”",

      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada has confirmed their “target” date to win the Premier League amid his surprise at Ruben Amorim’s dire start.",
      "Berrada and Man Utd‘s other board members have come under intense scrutiny since joining the Premier League giants as they reached an embarrassing new low in 2024/25, finishing 15th and failing to win a trophy.",
      "The Red Devils made a mistake last summer as they retained Erik ten Hag, who was sacked a few months into the 24/25 season.",
      "United identified Amorim as their top target after he was linked with Liverpool and Man City and he was appointed mid-season, even though he was initially against leaving Sporting Lisbon for the Premier League before the summer.",
      "United’s performances under Amorim were worse than under Ten Hag as he struggled to implement his preferred 3-4-3 formation and Berrada has revealed what he “underestimated” about their start under the head coach.",
      "“We knew that by bringing in Ruben mid-season that it was going to be even more difficult for the team to perform,” Berrada said on United We Stand.",
      "READ: Transfer rumour power ranking: Spurs eye another Man Utd target, Sancho to land on his feet again?",
      "“We saw it as an investment for the following seasons, because we were going to give Ruben time to get to know the squad, the club, the Premier League.",
      "“We have a very clear roadmap. Had Ruben started on 1 July 2025, we wouldn’t have been able to have all that knowledge, right? And that’s what I feel about these seven or eight months that he’s had in the Premier League and what he’s suffered in the Premier League. And the team has suffered. It’s really going to help us in the future.",
      "“I couldn’t have said that we were going to finish 15th. That was never the goal. I think we probably underestimated the time it would have required the team to adjust to the system. But we don’t regret the decision because I’m convinced that we’ll see this pay off next season.”",
      "Despite this, Berrada has explained Man Utd’s bold “target” to win the Premier League “by 2028”.",
      "“Project 150 is a very simple idea,” Berrada claimed.”We’re going to celebrate our 150th anniversary in June 2028, an important milestone in the history of the club.",
      "“It’s a way of setting a time-bound period where we’re going to focus our efforts to achieve certain goals: winning the Premier League, having the women’s team win the first WSL, becoming one of the most commercially innovative clubs in the world, as we have been in the past, being cash positive.",
      "“We have been a bit distracted with all the issues around the men’s first team but we are committed to making the women’s team very successful. You’ve heard Jim say, if you’re wearing the United shirt then you must win, and that’s exactly how I feel. A club of our scale has a responsibility to grow football in general and to contribute to women’s football.",
      "“Overall, it’s establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal. And if you ask me today, can the team win the Premier League title by 2028? Of course.",
      "“We’ve just finished 15th and it seems like an impossible task. But why not aim for it? Why not do everything in our power? There have been other turnarounds and other big teams have had bad seasons and gone on to win the Premier League or La Liga.”",
      "He added: “I firmly believe that we can do it (win the Premier League in 2028).",
      "“We have two or three summer windows to build a team to start competing to win the Premier League and if we can achieve it before then, we’ll all be happy, and so nobody’s saying that we don’t want to win it until then.”",

      "A Manchester United player has reportedly played a role in stopping his club getting hijacked for a star forward, who they will bid again for soon.",
      "United have improved their attack already this summer, after they were very underwhelming in the Premier League last season. The top goalscorers scored just eight goals, and between strikers Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee, just seven were scored.",
      "Matheus Cunha has come through the door in a £62.5million transfer, and if Bryan Mbeumo follows, United’s attack will look much stronger.",
      "The Red Devils have been heavily linked with the Brentford forward of late, as it’s been revealed he wants to play at Old Trafford.",
      "But Tottenham moves have thrown a spanner into the works, as they have hired Mbeumo’s former boss, Thomas Frank, and it’s believed the forward is now intrigued by a transfer there.",
      "The report suggests Mbeumo is leaving towards United, and after their last bid for the forward was rejected, they are ‘expected’ to go back in for him soon.",
      "It’s suggested that the Cameroon keeper has swayed Mbeumo in the direction of United.",
      "Onana has played with the forward on 15 occasions for the national team, winning seven of those. They did not play together in the recent international fixtures, though.",
      "Whether Onana is still at United to play with Mbeumo once he arrives remains to be seen. The United goalkeeper was at fault for a number of goals last season, and as a result, his club are being linked with a number of new stoppers.",
      "Emi Martinez and Marc-Andre ter Stegen are among them. It has recently been stated that United have ‘initiated’ direct talks for Aston Villa keeper Martinez, and it’s believed he is eager to make the move to Old Trafford.",
      "If he joined, he’d certainly be a better option than Onana, and the Cameroonian would not want to be second choice, so might well leave Old Trafford in search of opportunities, which it seems will be available to him in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ruben Amorim has now decided he ‘trusts’ the supposedly ‘sentenced’ Man Utd star to ‘redeem himself with a more solid structure’ rather than signing a replacement.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo is a player in demand and Tottenham Hotspur’s appointment of Thomas Frank might have affected Manchester United’s hopes of making him their next big summer signing.",

      "After a 15th-placed finish in last season’s Premier League, United might need more reinforcements.",
      "And they have been given some level of confidence that a transfer could be possible.",

      "It’s believed he’s disappointed by his lack of playing time last season – though he played 47 times in all competitions – and has sent a ‘clear message’ to his entourage to begin discussions with ‘potentially interested clubs’.",
      "That could give United hope that a move for the midfielder – who scored seven goals and assisted two more last term – could move there.",
      "That said, there is competition from Napoli, and they could have the best chance of landing Frattesi. Antonio Conte is said to have identified the midfielder as a ‘priority’ and Frattesi himself is ‘prioritising’ Serie A, as he’d rather stay in Italy than leave.",
      "That would seemingly put the Italian champions at the top of his list.",
      "A potential United exit could help their cause, though. The Dane has been a target of Inter for a while, and it’s been reported recently that he is ‘ahead of everyone’ on their priority list and there has been an ‘acceleration’ for the transfer of late.",
      "If Inter are to be given an easier route to Hojlund, they could potentially return the favour and allow United the chance to land Frattesi.",
      "His preference could make or break a deal, though. It’s believed the Inter midfielder will command a fee of €35million (£29.8m), but while that should not be hard to come by, he could reject the chance to sign for United in favour of a Serie A club.",
      "That figure should also not be hard for Napoli to pay, after they won the title last season, so there’s a chance the Red Devils are out of luck.",

      "Man Utd have also taken a step in the right direction with the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves for around £62.5m, and top target Bryan Mbeumo would be another upgrade in the No.10 position as they look to beat Spurs to secure his services.",

      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to becoming done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "20) 🆕 Brahim Diaz – Real Madrid to Manchester United\nWe don’t think this is even the first time Diaz has used supposed interest from United as leverage in contract talks. Maybe it’s done the trick since reports suggest the attacker has agreed a new deal. Nothing doing.",
      "19) 🆕 Jarrad Branthwaite – Everton to Tottenham\nAre Tottenham and Manchester United using the same scouts? Will Spurs be linked with Nicolas Gaitan next? Or maybe Wesley Sneijder? Regardless, Everton have told everyone the defender is not for sale. Given they priced out United last year when he probably was up for grabs, we can forget this one for now unless Branthwaite kicks up a fuss.",
      "",
      "18) 🆕 Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Napoli\nWe almost want this to happen just to see Antonio Conte’s head fall off by Christmas. We’re told Napoli have £45million to spend on a winger, but they have a couple of better options in Manchester. More specifically, they have a better option in the United cast-off bin. And if Chelsea wouldn’t pay Sancho’s wages, an amount he is due for another year from United, then the ex-England winger has no hope of getting such a salary from Napoli.",
      "",
      "17) 🔽 Rodrygo – Real Madrid to Arsenal\nWith Nico Williams preferring to join Barcelona, the Arsenal-Rodrygo links are resurfacing, But the Brazilian is at the Club World Cup with Real Madrid and if anyone is likely to make a decisive move, it’s the Saudis.",
      "",
      "16) Antoine Semenyo – Bournemouth to Manchester United\nTottenham were linked with the Bournemouth attacker and now United apparently have him in their sights if Mbeumo chooses a reunion with Thomas Frank at Spurs. Eberechi Eze is also an alternative target. This is a long way from being a thing.",
      "",
      "",
      "14) Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Napoli\nNapoli are looking for a striker, and Nunez would probably be very popular in Naples. But the chances of Napoli meeting Liverpool’s asking price seem slim, especially while the Reds know their Saudi friends are willing to pay in excess of £60million for a player who definitely isn’t worth that.",

      "",
      "13) 🔽 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting to Manchester United\nThere was a report from Record in Portugal that Gyokeres had told United he wasn’t interested, but others dispute that claim. Either way, it seems to us that the Swede is holding out for Arsenal. If the Gunners go a different way, then United might be in. But then they have to deal with Sporting, who deny they ever agreed to sell for £59million.",
      "",
      "12) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Napoli\nApparently, Napoli have £45million to spend on a left winger, with Grealish and Alejandro Garnacho in the frame. City value Grealish at £50million, which is a much smaller gap to bridge than United’s hopeless demand of £70million for Garnacho. Grealish in Naples? Yes please.",
      "",
      "11) Luis Diaz – Liverpool to Barcelona\nOur reading on this: Barca want Diaz, who would be happy to move to the Nou Camp. Liverpool might be interested in a deal, but only on their terms. Which Barca won’t meet, and Diaz knows it so he won’t kick up a fuss – yet. If this is going to happen, someone needs to change tack. There is plenty of noise coming from Barca, but nothing Liverpool can take to the bank.",

Which won’t happen at Newcastle for as long as Alexander Isak is around. So what does it say about Isak’s future that Newcastle are about to enter talks to bring Pedro from the south coast to the North East? If that is the Magpies’ intention, they will have to get around Brighton’s £60million valuation and the fact that the Brazilian’s mate says he wants to live in London. Hide all the maps, lads.",

      "9) 🔼 Andy Robertson – Liverpool to Atletico Madrid\nThis appears to be gathering pace rather quickly. Atletico Madrid have made a cheeky request to secure their ‘dream’ signing. We can see A-Rob being right up Diego Simeone’s street.",
      "",
      "8) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Tottenham\nAll Spurs had to do to pique Mbeumo’s intrigue was sack the manager and appoint the Cameroonian’s old one. Thomas Frank’s appointment has, apparently, opened Mbeumo’s mind to the possibility of joining Tottenham. But he did seem pretty determined to join the Man Utd circus.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nArsenal are still keeping both Gyokeres and Sesko dangling, getting as far as they can with both before they have to make a decision either way. It’s a dangerous game, especially while both attract interest from elsewhere and players like to feel wanted. The Gunners will get no discount on either. Right now, there seems to be a little more noise around Sesko, but that could quickly change with the wind.",
      "",
      "6) Bryan Mbeumo – Brentford to Manchester United\nMbeumo is giving mixed signals. At first he only had eyes for United but Thomas Frank’s appointment has given Spurs renewed hope. If nothing else, it should prompt United into decisive action in the form of a second offer, though they would ‘abandon’ a move on one condition.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nArsenal, apparently, are coming around to RB Leipzig’s thinking and they were due to spend the weekend gathering their loose change with the intention of submitting a serious bid this week. The Gunners are trying to keep their options open, which can only take them so far. Especially while Bayern Munich eye Sesko as a potential successor to Harry Kane.",
      "",
      "4) Martin Zubimendi – Real Sociedad to Arsenal\nThis one got the ‘Here we go’ treatment well over a month ago but then it all went a bit quiet. And then there was talk of Real Madrid sticking their nose in. Fear not, though, Gooners. Ornstein said it’s done. But still we wait.",
      "",
      "3) Milos Kerkez – Bournemouth to Liverpool\nIt’s happening, apparently. For around £40million. Which represents decent business for both sides. Things have gone a little quiet since while Liverpool pursue Wirtz but seemingly there is nothing or Reds to worry about here. The fact Bournemouth have now signed a replacement suggests this will get moving again very soon.",
      "",
      "2) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical is scheduled for Monday, so we’re told.",
      "",
      "1) Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool\nLiverpool will reportedly pay a British record £116.9m for Wirtz. That’s a lot of wonga for everyone to get very worked up about. Regardless, we are now at the point of arranging a medical, which is set for Friday, apparently. Stand by your flight trackers, Reds.",

      "Chelsea have already directly replaced three transfer-listed players they are yet to sell this summer, with 10 stars available for £337.6m on their ways out.",
      "",
      "10) Lucas Digne (unknown)\nIt seems curious for Atletico Madrid to lead their transfer philosophy on old Marco Silva quotes dredging up the Merseyside rivalry between Digne and Andy Robertson, but Diego Simeone has his methods.",
      "If Robertson cannot be procured on a cheap basis from Liverpool then Digne is a suitable alternative: 31, with a contract expiring soon, abundant experience and a skillset which could thrive in La Liga.",
      "Unai Emery might ordinarily be loathe to lose a player who started 37 Premier and Champions League games last season, but with Ian Maatsen ready to step up and £5.9m teenage signing Yasin Ozcan capable of moving into that back-up void, it could be a perfect opportunity to trim a ludicrous wage bill.",
      "",
      "9) Milos Kerkez (£45m)\nAnother domino fell in The Great Left-Back Transfer Exchange when Bournemouth completed the signing of Adrien Truffert from Rennes, who themselves have brought in Lilian Brassier to help cover a side vacated by their erstwhile captain.",
      "Whether Robertson remains at Anfield or not, his Liverpool starting place will be lost either way when Kerkez is finally picked from the Cherries, who have moved decisively for their own replacement.",
      "“It’s a dream for any player to play in the Premier League,” said Truffert upon his £11.4m switch to the south coast. “It’s a great opportunity for me to keep progressing and to be part of an ambitious project.”",
      "It is also, crucially, a wide-open berth on his side of the defence. Kerkez has shown the power of the Bournemouth stepping stone and it was a contractual obligation to describe his current employers as ‘paving the way’ for the Hungarian to leave for Liverpool with a necessary Truffert shuffle.",
      "",
      "8) Mateo Joseph (£13m)\n“There was a change, the other striker started to play. I started playing quite a bit and then went from everything to nothing. It was a blow,” said young Joseph of a season in which he started the first eight Championship games, then three of the next 16 and none of the final 22.",
      "Having played all but seven of the club’s league matches en route to promotion, yet ranking 16th for minutes played in the squad, the hint has been entirely taken and Real Betis are hoping they have found a cost-efficient Antony equivalent.",
      "Eight goals in 11 Spain U21 caps suggest he could flourish in a more comfortable environment yet it seems unlikely Leeds and Daniel Farke would trust Joseph any more in the Premier League than they did on the journey there.",
      "It might be that the free transfer capture of Lukas Nmecha from Wolfsburg was a signal of intent to cash in on Joseph if enough can be raised through his sale for necessary reinforcements.",
      "",
      "7) Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (£30m)\nThere is an element of sympathy for Dewsbury-Hall, the usual comfort blanket signing made by a manager climbing up the football ladder, who was discarded almost as soon as Enzo Maresca unpacked.",
      "But there is equally a sense that he really ought to have known things could turn out this way for a big fish in the little pond at Leicester when dropped into the shark-infested transfer ocean of Chelsea.",
      "Including the Club World Cup, with Dewsbury-Hall an inevitable unused substitute in the opening game, the midfielder ranked 15th for minutes played this season at Chelsea.",
      "Remove from the equation the Conference League – in which he finished the full 90 minutes in nine of 12 games and started 11 before coming on as a late substitute in the final – and he comes 22nd behind Benoit Badiashile.",
      "That is his reality with Champions League qualification secured. Dario Essugo has arrived from Sporting and immediately established himself as the Moises Caicedo understudy guaranteed a great many minutes. Dewsbury-Hall knows the bomb squad treatment awaits unless he accepts his fate of a move to Burnley or West Ham or some such.",
      "",
      "6) Mateo Kovacic (£25.5m)\nTijjani Reijnders has already dismissed the idea he is “here to replace” Kevin de Bruyne, and 19 goals with nine assists in 104 Milan appearances, while admirable, do not scream attacking midfield genius.",
      "“A lot of times I watched Kevin but another player I can learn a lot of things from is Gundogan. It is nice to see him up close and see how he does it,” said Reijnders of a more apt comparison. But it feels as though Kovacic has the most to lose in this sudden midfield evolution at the Etihad.",
      "The return of Rodri to the fold was bound to reduce the chances for his midfield companions but it is easy to envisage how responsibilities might otherwise be shared between Reijnders, Gundogan, Bernardo Silva, weird FA Cup final substitute Claudio Echeverri, forgotten January signing Nico Gonzalez and academy graduate Nico O’Reilly.",
      "For Kovacic, any answer beyond an exit with his transitional purpose under Pep Guardiola served is less obvious.",
      "",
      "5) Evan Ferguson (£60m)\nA West Ham loan under Graham Potter did nothing to resuscitate the career of Ferguson, who nevertheless seems destined for another hopeful loan. Given the current choice of Everton or Celtic, he might be in no rush to make a decision.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler seemed open to the idea of working with Ferguson in January but accepted his desire for more minutes and a change of surroundings. Yet his short stay at West Ham only deepened the sense of a player having lost his way.",
      "And Brighton know they cannot stand still and wait for the 20-year-old to realise his potential, hence the double down on teenage orthodox Greek forwards in January signing Stefanos Tzimas and £29.8m Olympiacos prodigy Charalampos Kostoulas.",
      "",
      "4) Noni Madueke (£51.1m)\nWith Chelsea having already made a faintly ludicrous five signings for almost £100m this summer, their planned 14-player exodus will proceed as planned to sate their weird transfer fetish.",
      "As one of the longest-serving players in the squad, Madueke has had his turn and is among those for whom the club will listen to offers while not actively and desperately seeking a sale.",
      "A prohibitive price narrows Madueke’s options considerably with Chelsea wanting around double what they paid in January 2023 for a forward with 20 goals and nine assists in 88 appearances since.",
      "But nowhere are new toys shinier than at Stamford Bridge and there is a particular sparkle emanating from 18-year-old Brazilian winger Estevao Willian, who will link up with his new employers and take someone’s place upon the conclusion of the Club World Cup.",
      "",
      "3) Jack Grealish (£40m)\n“I’m not Kevin De Bruyne,” revealed Rayan Cherki. “He is the legend.”",
      "But the Ballon d’Or-chasing Frenchman might well be the successor to Jack Grealish as the exciting, absurdly talented wide forward who is destined to be accused at some point of being ruined by Guardiola and turned into a backwards-passing robot.",
      "“Today’s game is less beautiful, fewer mistakes, but also fewer risks taken,” Cherki added in what could quite easily have been interpreted as a dig at his new manager. “I want to bring that spark back and give kids the joy it once had.”",
      "It was a battle Grealish fought and quite convincingly lost in the end, to the extent there are precious few takers at a considerable knock-down price this summer for a player Manchester City absolutely no longer want.",
      "",
      "2) Christopher Nkunku (£35m)\nIt was something of a surprise to see Nkunku given some cameo minutes against LAFC, the forward having been imbued with the aura of a pre-match chat with a beshirted Olivier Giroud.",
      "But that might well be where his Chelsea odyssey ends, considering Liam Delap proved his almost immediate suitability to the Enzo Maresca cause in a way many have struggled before him.",
      "Delap stands to take the permanent place of Nicolas Jackson, as he did from the bench in that impressive Club World Cup cameo. But the Senegal forward has shown enough to remain a fine squad option, dropping down the pecking order to knock Nkunku out of it entirely.",
      "“I think it is always healthy to have competition, it is football,” Delap said after the game. “The good thing about Liam is that he knows the way we want to play, so the process is quite quick,” Maresca added, with Nkunku having no part to play in a bright future.",
      "",
      "1) Rasmus Hojlund (£38m)\nThe complexion will change again once Harry Kane definitely joins Manchester United, but there are no feasible scenarios which benefit Hojlund in this transfer window.",
      "Ruben Amorim has neither the time nor the patience to invest on a project, even with his public admiration of a 22-year-old who has never lacked in attitude and application.",
      "But Manchester United renewing an old transfer policy betrays their need to sign players who are as close to a guarantee of quality in the current day as possible. Matheus Cunha ticks all the boxes Hojlund cannot yet wish to.",
      "Pep Guardiola has reportedly asked Manchester City to include Jack Grealish in a deal for a Real Madrid superstar in order to lower the price of the deal.",
      "According to reports, Jack Grealish could join another Manchester City star in joining Everton this summer as Kyle Walker has ‘agreed a sensational’ move.",
      "According to reports, Jack Grealish’s proposed move from Manchester City to Napoli hinges on Manchester United star Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Premier League giants Arsenal have been urged to sanction another raid on rivals Manchester City to reunite Mikel Arteta with a former player.",
      "Florian Wirtz is set to become the Premier League’s most expensive signing but how have his predecessors fared?",
      "Man City boss Pep Guardiola has offered Citizens winger Jack Grealish to La Liga side Barcelona for £34m, according to reports."

      "Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all expected to sign a new striker this summer – and even the Premier League champions could let one go.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "",
      "10) Darwin Nunez (Liverpool)\nYou may question whether Darwin Nunez even deserves a place in this top 10. Statistics are not in his favour, but we wanted to include him and know he is available this summer. The only players we feel harsh leaving out are Mateo Retegui, Loic Openda and Randal Kolo Muani. And then you’ve got more debatably ‘available’ players like Alexander Isak.",
      "The Liverpool striker is an enigma. He is Captain Chaos. We love him – but for all the wrong reasons. Who in their right mind will be brazen enough to take him on? Your guess is as good as ours.",
      "He’ll almost certainly move abroad, and La Liga feels right. He did well at Almeria before joining Benfica and reeks of Atletico Madrid. They do have Julian Alvarez, but Antoine Griezmann is 34 and Angel Correa is leaving.",
      "Darwin is still just 25, but 40 goals in 142 Liverpool games leaves a lot to be desired. Whoever signs him is taking a risk – but the potential reward is enormous. If someone can polish the rough edges, there’s a talented boy in there. Somewhere.",
      "",
      "9) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr)\nThe big dog Cristiano Ronaldo is out of contract at Al Nassr this summer…who wants him?! Come on, step forward. Anyone? Please.",
      "He’s won absolutely nothing of note out there, but that hasn’t stopped him scoring 91 goals in 103 games. If you’ve just stumbled on this article by accident – hello, and yes, those numbers are very good.",
      "A return to the Premier League is, of course, pure fantasy. But a free transfer to Al Hilal to chase trophies in the Middle East (and be annoying) feels entirely on brand. The most shameless move of the summer might still belong to Cristiano.",
      "",
      "8) Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nThere was an offer from Arsenal in January that was incredibly ill-timed as Aston Villa had just agreed to sell Jhon Duran, but both club and player would likely be interested if the Gunners returned again.",
      "The problem? Watkins is now 29, which puts him firmly in the undesirable camp in modern football. But he does guarantee Premier League goals, delivering double figures in each of his last five seasons. If he’s patient, he might be the beneficiary of a late panic.",
      "",
      "7) Dusan Vlahovic (Juventus)\nDusan Vlahovic turned down Arsenal for Juventus in 2022, and it’s hard to fault him; it looked like the right call at the time. But hindsight is cruel and Arsenal are now a Champions League force while Juventus… aren’t.",
      "Things haven’t quite clicked for the Serbian in Turin. A goal every three games is fine, but not what you expect from a £70million signing. Juventus are reportedly open to selling, though swap deals seem to be their go-to route.",
      "It’s tough to pin down his next move – he’s good enough to start for a big club, but not quite good enough to justify a bidding war. Vlahovic’s future might be the most unpredictable on this list.",
      "",
      "6) Victor Boniface (Bayer Leverkusen)\nWith Xabi Alonso off to Real Madrid, Leverkusen are braced for a summer exodus. Victor Boniface could be part of that.",
      "Boniface was reportedly close to joining Al Nassr in January but they went for Jhon Duran instead, so there is clearly an openness on Leverkusen’s side to sell, while the player is happy to take on a new challenge.",
      "The Nigerian’s stock was at its peak during Leverkusen’s unbeaten Bundesliga run in 2023/24, but he’s still a hugely viable option for big European sides. He shouldn’t be vanishing into the Saudi wilderness just yet, regardless of how many zeroes are on the cheque.",
      "",
      "5) Jonathan David (Lille)\nJonathan David is available on a free transfer after confirming he’ll leave Lille this summer, making him one of the biggest bargains out there – if he drops his reportedly ridiculous wage demands.",
      "He’s scored 109 goals in 232 games for Lille, including 10 in 18 Champions League appearances. Those numbers, plus the lack of a transfer fee, make him extremely appealing.",
      "Unfortunately, it’s mostly Saudi clubs who can meet his current terms – which include €15m in commissions. If he gets realistic, there’s a proper forward here for someone in need.",
      "",
      "4) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig)\nTrying to predict Benjamin Sesko’s future is pointless. He could be world-class, or he could disappear into a Chelsea-shaped vortex and be playing for Wolves in 2027, with all due respect to Wolves.",
      "Still, the hype is real. And Mikel Arteta reportedly prefers him to Gyokeres. Sesko has the size, pace, and technical skill to become an elite striker – but he’s not there yet. If someone’s patient, he could end up being the best player on this entire list.",
      "",
      "3) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt)\nNewcastle United tried to sign Hugo Ekitike from Stade Reims before he joined Paris Saint-Germain, only to flop disastrously in the French capital while the Magpies soared into the Champions League with Alexander Isak leading the line. It worked out okay for the latter but Ekitike’s time in Paris was miserable.",
      "Ekitike reportedly blocked PSG’s attempts to sign Randal Kolo Muani by refusing to go the other way – then eventually went to Frankfurt anyway, where he’s been a revelation and will make them a lot of money.",
      "After scoring 22 goals and providing 12 assists in 48 matches for Frankfurt this season, he is being strongly linked with Manchester United.",
      "Ekitike is a unique striker with a very high ceiling. Like Sesko, his height makes him a problem for any defender when it’s combined with such pace and power. Given he’s already been at PSG and flopped, a move to the Premier League feels likely. We’re not ruling out Juventus, though.",
      "",
      "2) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting CP)\nReportedly Arsenal’s top striker target and adored by Mikel Arteta’s new sporting director Andrea Berta, Viktor Gyokeres has been red hot this year after finishing 2024 as Europe’s top scorer.",
      "Arsenal have been crying out for an out-and-out goalscorer ever since Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang left in the 2022 winter transfer window, and Gyokeres would be a smart signing. Hopefully the last piece of the puzzle that can help the Gunners win the Premier League or Champions League next season.",
      "He scored 39 goals in 33 league games this season and topped the charts in Europe across all competitions. The fact it’s in Portugal doesn’t dilute the achievement – he also got six in eight in the Champions League, including a hat-trick in a win against Manchester City that got Man United fans all giddy.",
      "Sometimes stats don’t lie and that’s the case with Gyokeres. He’s clearly just what Arteta needs. It’s now just about meeting Sporting’s price.",
      "",
      "1) Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nIt’s bizarre how little noise there’s been around Victor Osimhen. In the last five years, there have not been many better strikers and he was the main man in Napoli’s first title-winning campaign 33 years in 2022/23. Despite his reputation, goal record and availability, there have been next to no transfer links going into the summer transfer window.",
      "We are left scratching our head trying to work out why. Is it down to his attitude? It could well be. There have been some questionable things said by the player and his agent in recent years and with no big clubs seemingly interested, other big clubs are reluctant to bring him in. His wage demands could be a key factor. We all know that Napoli want to sell and at a price that is very reasonable for a player of Osimhen’s quality.",
      "A transfer to Chelsea last summer ticked all of the boxes but the Premier League club didn’t fancy it and went into the season with Nicolas Jackson as their only out-and-out striker and versatile forward Christopher Nkunku as back-up. Chelsea have now brought in Liam Delap, meaning Osimhen is unlikely to get a Premier League move that not so long ago felt inevitable.",
      "Saudi Arabia now feels the most obvious next move for Osimhen, but that would open him up to ridicule after calling Khvicha Kvaratskhelia’s agent a “dumb f**k” for saying he was moving there.",
      "Clubs seem to be oblivious to Osimhen’s availability but it’s guaranteed that the Nigerian will leave Napoli this summer after spending the season on loan at Galatasaray. His bridges in Naples have been burned to the ground.",
      "READ NOW: Predicting where the 12 players *definitely* leaving in the top 100 are going this summer",
      "A new report has revealed Arsenal’s striker “priority” during this summer’s transfer window, with a journalist revealing what he’s “known for a month”.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have ‘opened a direct channel’ as they look to sign Napoli star Victor Osimhen in a ‘sensational swap deal’.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have submitted a higher ‘offer’ than FC Barcelona as the Premier League giants look to sign a long-term target.",
      "The longer Viktor Gyokeres’ future remains undecided, the more clubs join Arsenal in pursuing an interest in one of Europe’s most potent strikers.",
      "Arsenal are in ‘advanced talks’ over signing a new striker as a fresh report has revealed sporting director Andrea Berta’s ‘plan’ in an ‘unusual approach’.",
      "Viktor Gyokeres was the top scorer of 2024, ending the year on 52 goals. Can he do it again? Not if Kylian Mbappe has anything to do with it…"

If Rayan Cherki ends up doing skills on the edge of the pitch and losing the ball when City are 1-0 (like he often did at Lyon) he will feel like wasted money even though it was a small fee. If Wirtz scores the winner in a Champions League final it will feel worth it. That’s just how it works.",
      "If the player does the job they were brought in to do he’s worth it. Allison for example was brought in for an enormous price because we hadn’t had a keeper who can stop one on ones and distribute the ball well in a decade, Allison did that and much more so nobody ever talks about the price.",
      "If a player doesn’t do the job they’re brought in to do, they’re not worth it. Liverpool don’t have too many of these anymore but Nunez and Naby Keita are two that spring to mind who weren’t worth it.",
      "And it largely doesn’t matter what the price was. If Nunez cost £1 he still didn’t score enough goals so he would still not be worth it. If Van Dijk cost £200m he still led the team to many trophies and did all the things we needed him to do, so he would still be worth it.",
      "Is any United fan really gonna tell me that if Antony cost a quid they believe he would be a good players who brings something to the team it doesn’t already have? If Jack Grealish didn’t cost £100m would he be a better player for City?\nLee",

      "Declan Rice: Overrated\nI wanted to share some opinions on Declan Rice. First of all, he seems like a great bloke, and a footballer you’d definitely want to have a pint with. However he isn’t good enough to play DM for England or Arsenal.",
      "Some Arsenal fans have this weird obsession with comparing their players with Rodri. I was told Partey was better than Rodri after the former joined Arsenal in 2020 (he wasn’t). And then they repeated the trick when announcing that Rice is better than Rodri after Arsenal signed him in 2023. Partey was now, no longer worthy of comparison strangely. And I bet that they will say that Zubimendi is better than Rodri if he signs for Arsenal as planned.",
      "The weirdest bit is that Arteta doesn’t play Rice at DM. He played Partey or Jorginho instead, and has bought Zubimendi, as he knows Rice isn’t good enough to play DM at a team that wants to compete at the highest level. So it makes no sense to compare Rice to Rodri, when Rice is a box to box number 8 now, that compliments his physical strengths.",
      "If we assume that Tuchel will end up playing 4-3-3, as most of the English players he can pick play in that formation I find it weird how high Rice is rated in the England Ladder.",
      "When Rice played DM for England at the Euros, the back 4 ended up playing the ball left and right in a horseshoe shape as Rice wasn’t showing for the ball. He pretty much man marked the opposition and took himself out of the game. He wasn’t on the half turn, he didn’t get into space quick enough when pressed and his first touch isn’t good enough. As a result England couldn’t transition from defence to midfield when pressed. What England need is a proper DM for that role. We tried Angel Gomes and I still have hopes for Wharton, but we need someone who can play that role properly.",
      "Then England need two other midfielders and this is where Rice should play. But if everyone was fit and on form, and with a proper DM, would Rice be in the team ahead of all but one of Bellingham, Palmer, Foden, Eze, Rogers or Mainoo? Bellingham, when not being stroppy, provides the physicality that Rice does, so there should be a space for a more creative player next to him. Personally, I’d choose Palmer, so I’m surprised that Rice is number 3 on the ladder.",
      "TL;DR – Rice seems like a nice bloke, but isn’t a DM, shouldn’t be compared to Rodri, and shouldn’t play DM for England, and has a battle IMO to keep his England place in a midfield 3 if everyone is fit.\nAndy D. Manchester. MCFC",

All you have to do is look at the players when they win whatever trophy it is and that will tell you whether it’s ‘worth’ it or not. FA Cup, Coca-Cola Cup, Charity Shield, Super Cup…..the players that win those trophies quite clearly think they are worth winning.",

No Johnny, what people were shocked by was it was so clean & without flaws that it clearly meant that he’d been learning it for quite some time – let’s say a lot longer than when Real first approached Liverpool back in January. Which means his decision to join Real has probably been taken long time ago & he could’ve even met privately with people from the club to discuss a potential move, whilst firmly a contracted Liverpool player.",
      "I think that will be the real kicker for Liverpool fans – it’s not like he’s had his head turned in January by Real’s interest but that he’s probably been sounded out by people at Madrid several years ago & he’s just allowed his contract to run down.",

I’ve travelled most of the world and I’ve English, Americans and australians all in foreign countries just using English with little to no attempt at the local language. This isn’t just my opinion either, the locals I speak to on my travels are always surprised when I can speak their language (Portuguese, Spanish, Filipino and Vietnamese in case you’re curious) and they’re surprised because English speaking people don’t usually make the effort.",
      "And I confess in my teenage school years I did not bother with french because had the naive opinion that “everywhere speaks English anyway.”",
      "I currently reside in Brasil and local faces light up when they learn I’m not a brasileiro and speak it well. In fact the only places where people don’t seem to appreciate that effort is Paris (where they have actual disdain if you attempt french and would rather you use English) and in the UK where people swat someone attempt at English aside like it’s a simple thing.",
      "So perhaps Johnny , the reason everyone is surprised at Trents Spanish is because the English aren’t known for their linguistic skills…Joey Barton speaking french is how it often turns out.\nLee",

      "Manchester United have reportedly ‘put an offer of £127m on the table’ for Barcelona star Raphinha as the Red Devils ‘strike a blow to the market’.",
      "Amorim is working closely with newly-promoted Director of Football Jason Wilcox to rebuild an ailing squad which produced the worst season in living memory last term.",
      "The focus is very much on attacking players in the transfer market, with Matheus Cunha already joining the club after the Red Devils triggered his £62.5m release clause to land him from Wolves.",
      "Having been beaten to the signing of Liam Delap – who impressed on his debut for Chelsea on Monday – they’re also scouring the market for a new No.9, though their pursuit of Viktor Gyokeres appears to have ended after the striker told them where to go.",
      "They’ve had one bid rejected for Bryan Mbeumo of £55m plus a further £10m in add-ons rejected by Brentford, and are considering an improved bid amid competition from Thomas Frank’s Tottenham.",
      "And now, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, the Red Devils have made a genuinely unbelievable ‘offer of €150m [£127m] for Raphinha’, having found some loose change down the back of one of their canteen chairs now collecting dust in a warehouse.",
      "‘The figure has surprised even in the Camp Nou offices’ the report admits, ‘where a proposal of such magnitude was not expected by the Brazilian winger’.",
      "No mention of the dire financial straits that Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed would have seen Manchester United go “bust by Christmas” had he not stopped providing lunches for staff though, nor their failure to qualify for European competition next season to further increase their woes, with the report instead stating that ‘the interest of the English team responds to its desire to strike a blow to the market’.",
      "United supposedly ‘see in Raphinha a piece that could make a difference from day one’ and that ‘his experience in the Premier League, after his time at Leeds United, makes his adaptation to the rhythm and demands of English football not unknown’.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Although Barça does not contemplate easily parting with one of its most decisive players – with 34 goals and 25 assists in 57 games this season – the economic dimension of the offer forces the club to reflect. United’s proposal comes at a time when the Barcelona entity needs financial balance, and that income would be an opportunity difficult to ignore.’",
      "By far the strangest claim in the report appears to be an assertion that ‘United’s sporting situation’, which saw them finish 15th in the Premier League last season – could actually be a factor in persuading him to leave Barcelona for Old Trafford.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘It remains to know Raphinha’s position. At 28 years old, the Brazilian is in the best moment of his career, and although he has shown commitment to Flick’s project, United’s sporting situation could weigh on his decision.’",
      "Absurd.",
      "Barcelona forward Raphinha is against any move to bring Liverpool winger Luis Diaz to the Camp Nou this summer, according to reports.",
      "Another Big Midweek brings another huge Champions League test for Arsenal and a potential last dance for Spurs head coach Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Chelsea and Man City have both identified Barcelona winger Raphinha as a ‘top priority’ for the summer transfer window, according to a report.",
      "According to reports, a ‘last-minute offer’ to Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has ‘boosted’ FC Barcelona and done the Spanish giants a ‘favour’.",
      "According to reports, Manchester City are among two potential destinations for Barcelona star Raphinha, who has ‘offers on the table to leave’.",
      "Raphinha was made to eat his own words after his Brazil side were thumped 4-1 against rivals Argentina in the World Cup qualifiers."

At times, they’ve not been good enough. You can see it all over the pitch sometimes, and the standard needs to raise a little bit.”",

      "The Ballon d’Or has become A Thing for players in the modern era but this summer has been marked by transfer decisions being made based on winning it, with Liverpool heavily impacted.",
      "",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving Liverpool for Real Madrid\nFinishing 19th in the 2019 Ballon d’Or vote – and collecting more career votes than Paul Scholes in the process – planted a seed in the mind of Alexander-Arnold.",
      "Zero points from his next and most recent shortlist appearance in 2022 helped crystallise a decision he would formalise three years later, dragging him kicking and screaming (in fluent Spanish) away from his Anfield home.",
      "In hindsight, publicly and proudly picking a Ballon d’Or win over becoming Liverpool captain, lifting the World Cup with England or claiming a second Champions League was the first sign for the Reds that simply being the sole Scouser in their team was not enough to sate some grandiose life goals.",
      "“I want to be the first full-back to ever do it,” he said of his Ballon d’Or ambition, adding that his desire was to be remembered as “a legend of football, someone who changed the game” with a “legacy of being the greatest right-back to have played football”.",
      "Jan Kromkamp has a lot to answer for.",
      "With Michael Owen in 2001 still the only winner of the award as a Liverpool player, and Real Madrid offering a platform to more individual champions than any other club in history, it was not difficult to see where Alexander-Arnold was signalling and manoeuvring with his career crossroads on the horizon.",
      "Conducted in October 2024 at a time Alexander-Arnold was supposedly locked in negotiations with Liverpool over extending a contract due to expire in the summer, it might as well have been an exit interview.",
      "Alexander-Arnold did downplay the Ballon d’Or lure at his Real unveiling, saying he was not sure it “influenced my decision to come here at all” as “it is going to be quite hard to win the Ballon d’Or with the amount of superstars in this team”.",
      "But he also claimed to have been learning Spanish for “a few months”, and said he “grew up watching Real Madrid win three Champions League titles in a row” despite literally appearing in the last of those finals, so his status as a reliable narrator is uncertain.",
      "",
      "Rayan Cherki joining Manchester City\n“I want to win the Ballon d’Or and win the Champions League,” reads and sounds like a bold but feasible set of objectives laid out by Cherki as a new Manchester City signing.",
      "Yet that was his response to Lyon academy director Jean-Francois Vulliez when the 15-year-old was asked about what he wanted to achieve as a player, around the time Manchester United were considering an ‘unusual’ move for one of Europe’s most thrilling young talents.",
      "The Frenchman understandably never came close to enacting that plan in a solid but unspectacular Lyon side, but the Manchester City spotlight was a specific driving factor in his £30.5m summer switch.",
      "“When you see Rodri win the Ballon d’Or it is clear with Manchester City it is possible to do so and I am here for this,” he said in his first Etihad interview.",
      "Manchester City do only have as many Ballon d’Or wins as Blackpool, Dukla Prague and Ferencvaros, but you see his point.",
      "",
      "Mohamed Salah staying at Liverpool\nMany seemed to consider it an inevitability but the 2025 award was beyond Salah once his no-show across two legs of a Champions League last-16 exit to Paris Saint-Germain was completed.",
      "The Egyptian was at one stage most certainly among the favourites, but record-breaking excellence in a Premier League title win was never likely to be enough by itself.",
      "But it remains a holy grail of sorts – and a key motivation behind his decision to resist Saudi Arabia overtures and continue at Liverpool with a new contract.",
      "“It’s not in my hands, but obviously, one day I would like to win the Ballon d’Or for my people,” he said in May. “When you come from a village in Egypt, as a child, it’s difficult to dream of the Ballon d’Or. It was when I came to Liverpool that I started to think that, maybe, one day…”",

      "He knows Harry Kane is not leaving Bayern Munich. He knows Manchester United are not signing Harry Kane. He also knows this is not remotely linked with Arsenal, but we suspect he tried and failed to crowbar Liverpool into the headline and eventually settled on the next best thing.",

      "Tuesday 17 June 2025 10:54, UK",
      "Manchester United chief executive Omar Berrada remains confident the club can mark their 150th anniversary in 2028 by winning both the men’s and women’s league titles and believes there are similarities between head coach Ruben Amorim and Man City boss Pep Guardiola.",
      "Berrada, who first told staff of his \"Project 150\" vision in September last year, knows that represents a significant challenge with United having just endured a worst top-flight season since relegation in 1973-74, while Chelsea continue to dominate the Women's Super League.",
      "However, he believes marking a major milestone in the club's history since it was founded as Newton Heath in 1878 with double title success is realistic.",
      "In an interview with the United We Stand fanzine to be published on Wednesday, Berrada said: \"It's establishing a series of targets within a timeframe so we can focus our efforts and energy on that goal.",

      "He added: \"He didn't win anything and there was suspicion about whether he could implement his football vision in the Premier League. People said he was arrogant and wouldn't change his style of play. But he stuck to his principles and given what he'd won, he had an enormous amount of credit in the bank.",

      "With Hugo Ekitike linked with a summer transfer to the Premier League, Adam Bate speaks to Oscar Garcia, who coached Ekitike at Stade Reims, to find out more about the Eintracht Frankfurt forward and what he could bring to the Premier League",
      "Friday 13 June 2025 10:31, UK",
      "When Hugo Ekitike was still a teenager at Stade Reims, the coaching staff prepared a development plan for him. They analysed the performances of Kylian Mbappe and then picked out two more players that Ekitike might realistically aspire to replicate.",
      "On the face of it, that was a perfectly reasonable short-term target. Prior to his final season at Reims, Ekitike had not even scored a goal in France's top tier. He had spent the second half of the previous campaign on loan at Danish club Vejle Boldklub.",
      "He returned to Reims as the fourth-choice forward but soon forced Oscar to reassess. Soon after that, the two strikers whose level he had been encouraged to hit were no longer in his sights. \"Within months, he wanted to reach the same level as Mbappe.\"",
      "It is a tale that offers a glimpse into the mindset of the Eintracht Frankfurt forward who has long been linked with a move to the Premier League. In the past it was Newcastle. Now it is Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool as proposed landing destinations.",
      "\"He always was a talented player but some coaches did not like him because of his profile and sometimes because of his character,\" concedes Oscar. \"They were thinking he was a little bit arrogant. He always wanted to be compared with the best ones.\"",
      "Ekitike is now beginning to justify those comparisons after a strong season with Frankfurt. With 22 goals in all competitions for the Bundesliga club, this was something of a breakthrough for a player who had looked set to shine a little earlier.",
      "The move from Reims to PSG was a bold one given the competition. With Mbappe, Neymar and Lionel Messi still at the club, Ekitike's minutes were limited. The majority of his appearances came off the bench. \"Any striker would have struggled,\" says Oscar.",
      "\"But, for sure, he learned a lot and now he is a better player because of it.\" Frankfurt have long been shrewd operators in the transfer market and recognised that failing to shine amid the stars at PSG was no slight on such a talented young prospect.",
      "Following an initial loan last season, Ekitike made the move permanent last summer and kicked on significantly after turning 22 last summer. Under coach Dino Toppmoller, the football seemed to suit him and he was fundamental to Frankfurt's success.",
      "Ekitike provided the impetus up front as they shrugged off the sale of Omar Marmoush to Manchester City in January to secure third spot, matching their best finish of the Bundesliga era, not achieved since the days when the great Tony Yeboah was leading the line.",
      "During the first part of the season, he operated alongside Marmoush in a modern-looking strike partnership. It was not exactly a case of the big man and the little man. Instead, they both had freedom to roam into wide areas and shared the responsibilities.",
      "That is because, despite being 6'3\" tall, Ekitike is far from a traditional target man. \"He is not a kind of a striker who will be always into the box waiting for a cross, he is very mobile and very difficult to mark.\" He likes to use his pace to run into the channels.",
      "The only player to score as many goals on the counter-attack as Ekitike in the Bundesliga this past season was Marmoush himself - indicative of Frankfurt's approach. But Oscar believes that the skillset is such that he can adapt if needed.",
      "\"He can fit with teams that play more counter-attack but also with teams with more possession, because he has the skill for both styles.\" That is what makes him an intriguing option for the elite clubs. There is a belief that there is much more to come.",
      "\"You do not find many strikers like him at his age. He is tall, fast, mobile, very good one against one, holds the ball and scores goals.\"",
      "While his total of 15 Bundesliga goals represents his best return yet, that too might just be a sign of better things to come. Analysts will have noted that Ekitike had 117 shots in the competition during the 2024/25 season - more than anyone else, including Harry Kane.",
      "Ekitike actually significantly underperformed his expected-goals total. And while that statistic could be used to criticise his finishing, it also suggests that he is a player who is able to consistently get himself into scoring positions. Work to do. But lots to work with.",
      "\"All players can improve. He knows which aspects he can improve on but he also needs help to develop his potential to reach the level that all the people who know him believe he can reach. Individual work with him will be fundamental for his development.\"",
      "But that development is happening. Already quick and skilful, physically there are signs that he is learning how to use his frame to better effect, while mentally it was a positive for scouts that he stepped up when more was needed in the second half of the season.",
      "After the PSG experience, Frankfurt was a smart choice, but it is the next move, the next page in his development plan, that will be fascinating. Is he now ready for that super club second time around? However big the target, Ekitike will back himself to hit it.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres is summer target for both Manchester United and Arsenal; Utd have made approaches through intermediaries to explore the conditions of potential deal; Sporting president says club has received 'no offers', but striker will be allowed to leave for less than release clause",
      "Wednesday 11 June 2025 14:36, UK",
      "Sporting have not received any offers for Viktor Gyokeres and the striker will not be allowed to leave for £59m (€70m) this summer, club president Frederico Varandas said on Wednesday morning.",
      "Varandas has disputed the existence of a 'gentleman's agreement' with Gyokeres' agent that would allow the Man Utd and Arsenal target to leave for a fixed fee of £50.8m (€60m) plus £8.4m (€10m) in add-ons.",
      "Reports in Portugal claim Gyokeres has told Sporting he will not play for them again because he feels disappointed they have not kept to their promise.",
      "Varandas says he has guaranteed that Gyokeres will be allowed to go for less than his €100m release clause but has made clear there will be an open negotiation for the 27-year-old, who scored 54 goals in 52 games for Sporting last season.",
      "\"I can guarantee that Viktor Gyokeres will not leave for 60m euros plus 10m euros because I never promised that,\" said Varandas. \"To this day, Sporting has not received an offer for Gyokeres - neither today nor last summer.\"",
      "Varandas says Gyokeres' agent sought assurances from him and sporting director Hugo Viana - who has now left to join Man City in a similar role - that the player would be allowed to leave for less than his release clause in a meeting earlier this season.",
      "The Sporting president said the agent also asked for an agreement over the asking price - but he was unwilling to commit to specific numbers.",
      "Varandas added: \"What was agreed in that meeting? That Sporting would not demand the release clause [this summer].",
      "\"For one reason, it was because we know no player leaves Portugal at 27 for €100m or €90m euros.",
      "\"In that same meeting the agent wanted to anchor the exit to a value. I said this sentence: 'It's not worth us setting a value because I don't know what will happen in a year's time. I don't know if it will be 40m euros, 60m or 80m. What I can guarantee is that I will not demand 100m euros.'\"",
      "Two years after signing him for around £20m from Coventry, Sporting stand to make a huge profit on Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The 27-year-old, who hit 40 goals in 97 games after joining Coventry from Brighton in 2021, has scaled new heights in Portugal, scoring 97 times in 102 games for Sporting in all competitions since his arrival in 2023 and becoming one of the most coveted strikers in Europe.",
      "Manchester United have made an initial approach over a potential reunion with his former boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres is also of interest to Arsenal as the Gunners aim to strengthen their attack.",
      "His scoring exploits for Sporting, which include six goals in eight Champions League appearances last season, have seen him treble in value to £75m in the space of two years, according to the website Transfermarkt, reflecting the speed of his rise to prominence.",
