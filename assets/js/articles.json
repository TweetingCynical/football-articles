      "United have appointed Michael Carrick on an interim basis until the end of the season. Club owners the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe will look to name a full-time boss in the summer.",
      "Tuchel, Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Enrique, Mauricio Pochettino and Xabi Alonso are all on United's radar. But United legend Rooney reckons his former club have to go for Tuchel.",
      "The German will be in charge of England at this summer's World Cup, but is expected to stand down following the tournament.",

      "Jamie Carragher has claimed that Manchester United and Chelsea's recent managerial hires are \"underwhelming\" and don't offer them with the best chances to eventually win the Premier League.",
      "The Blues axed Enzo Maresca on New Year's Day and moved quick to replace him, bringing in Liam Rosenior from Strasbourg. The former player has a CV that reads Derby, Hull and the French side, but he's yet to work in the top flight despite his rising reputation.",
      "He's won one and lost one of his two games in charge, but his appointment follows a trend from the ownership that has seen them go for managers with potential - Graham Potter and Maresca among them - rather than pursue big names as was the case in the past.",
      "United meanwhile sacked Ruben Amorim and bought in Michael Carrick until the end of the season. Bar a three-match caretaker spell, he too has never held a top job in the Premier League. His managerial history coming with Middlesbrough.",
      "Carragher claims the big name manager is almost being killed off and both aforementioned clubs have not hired the best individual, despite both having potential.",
      "He wrote in the Telegraph: \"For those working their way through a shortlist of suitable candidates, there has to be a key, overriding question: 'Does this coach give us the best chance of winning the Premier League?' With respect to Rosenior and Carrick, the answer is no.",
      "\"They may become brilliant coaches. If they go on to have stellar coaching careers, those who backed and identified their potential to manage at the highest level will deserve applause.

      "He said: \"Chelsea fans yearn for another Mourinho or Ancelotti, and United supporters continue to wait for the next Ferguson – the embodiment of their ambitions who they can describe as their manager. Meanwhile, their directors look elsewhere because many of the responsibilities once absorbed by an all-powerful leader are delegated.\"",

      "The Nottingham Forest ace, previously on Newcastle's books, was looking for regular minutes earlier in his career and dropped down to League Two. Initially those from the Memorial Stadium had their sights on someone else, with Anderson proving a back-up option.",
      "So much so that they originally weren't keen on taking the then Newcastle youngster on loan. Even when he arrived he was told that opportunities were likely going to be at a premium, but Anderson's quality quickly had them changing their mind.",
      "His quality later had Barton, who would lead Bristol Rovers to promotion that season in dramatic style, giving him a nickname that drew comparisons with the great Diego Maradona.",
      "Anderson told the Daily Mail: \"I was struggling to get a loan and Joey said he could only do it in the summer. I was gutted but then he said: 'Go on then, we will.' So I go down and they told me they were originally after someone else and that it was going to be really tough for me to get in the team as they were winning. It was fine.",
      "\"That's exactly why I had stepped out of my comfort level. To try to play in a senior team. Then after training the next day I think they just thought, 'Oh, OK… he can actually play'. I came on at half-time of the first game – Sutton away – and basically played every one after that. I never looked back.’",
      "Barton would make it clear to Anderson, then still a teenager, that England recognition was within his sights after being hugely impressed with what he could offer. The man nicknamed the 'Geordie Maradona' crediting the former Manchester City midfielder with having a huge influence on his development.",
      "Elliot Anderson's development was aided by a loan at Bristol Rovers(Image: )",
      "\"I loved working under him,\" Anderson said. \"He helped me so much when I was there. He was just really nice to me and gave me that platform to go and play. Joey’s message to me was about believing in myself. He played once for England and just used to say to me: 'If I have got one cap, then you can get a hundred.' That really lifted me.\"",
      "Anderson's England exploits have seen his stock skyrocket with Manchester United now keen on a summer move. The midfielder admitting that he wouldn't be where he is had he not been sold by Newcastle for £35m, with his form at the City Ground proving crucial.",

      "Bruno Fernandes is believed to be unsettled(Image: PETER POWELL, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Bruno Fernandes' reasons for quitting a previous club should raise alarm bells about his future at Manchester United. There are reportedly fears around Old Trafford club that the captain has had enough of the continued turmoil and will push for a move.",
      "Fernandes was close to the recently sacked Ruben Amorim, who has been replaced by Michael Carrick for the rest of the season before a new permanent boss is appointed in the summer. The 31-year-old will not be going anywhere this month but the rest of the season could be crucial to his future.",
      "If United continue to struggle, it could push him closer to the exit door. Only last summer, he considered switching to the Saudi Pro League before Amorim persuaded him to stay.",
      "Fernandes was in a similar situation at Udinese earlier in his career, deciding to move on for two clear reasons: The team's underperformance and the departure of a manager he had a strong bond with.",
      "The playmaker moved to Italy aged 17 and spent five years in the country, initially joining Novara before moving to Udinese in 2013.",
      "After an impressive first season in Udin, head coach Francesco Guidolin stepped away from his role to become technical supervisor for club owner Giampaolo Pozzo, whose son, Gino, owns Watford. Guidolin later had a brief spell in charge of Swansea City, then in the Premier League.",
      "Guidolin's departure played a part in Fernandes leaving for Sampdoria on loan in 2016 before his permanent move to Sporting CP the following year.",
      "Fernandes was close to Ruben Amorim(Image: Getty Images)",
      "In a stark parallel to his time at United, Fernandes recalled Udinese having quality players but not being able to produce what was expected of them.",
      "He said once told Cronache di Spogliatoio: \"The three years I spent at Udinese were not easy in terms of the team because we didn't have great campaigns, except for the first one, where we had a great squad. We had a strong team, but we weren't able to achieve what was expected of us.",
      "Fernandes during his three years at Udinese(Image: Getty)",
      "\"Then in the second and third year they decided to change manager after so long with Guidolin, and it didn’t go very well. Guidolin had managed to get the most of my abilities and made me understand that I had to train more, but he had faith in me.\"",
      "United fans will be hoping history doesn't repeat itself. Fernandes has 18 months left on his United deal with the option of a further 12 months, meaning this summer could be crunch time for his future at the club. Bayern Munich are reportedly among the clubs monitoring the situation.",

      "Villa still need to tread carefully in negotiations, given their own PSR issues and with Abraham on loan at Besiktas from Roma, with the Turkish club triggering an obligation to buy him. As a result Emery could let Besiktas have a player on loan to soften the blow of losing a striker who's scored 12 times.",

      "\"We’ll see what happens,\" Robertson said. \"We’ve had chats now which will remain private. I've spoken to them and we’ll see what happens. Would I like to stay?

      "Michael Carrick has honed his communication skills doing media work(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Had things gone differently at Manchester United, then Michael Carrick would have been sitting in a TV studio on Saturday, not inside the Old Trafford dugout.",
      "Since being dismissed by Middlesbrough in June, Carrick had been enjoying his first proper break from the game. He’d spent almost his entire life inside the professional football bubble up until then, having gone straight into coaching on Jose Mourinho’s staff after retiring from playing in 2018.",
      "Carrick suddenly had more time to spend with his family and on the golf course, yet made sure to keep in touch with football through media work. And had he not beaten his former colleague Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the United interim head coach role, then he would have spent the day with Steve Bower, who has known him for 25 years.",
      "Bower is lead presenter for the Premier League’s global TV channel and has enjoyed spending time with Carrick during the 2025/26 season. The 44-year-old has covered around seven games for the channel, which is broadcast around the world and watched by millions, and has made a real impression with his punditry.",
      "“He is an outstanding pundit,” says Bower, who is also a commentator on Match of the Day. “He speaks like he plays and manages; he would never go low and lambast somebody or go high and give ridiculous praise, he’d look at it from every angle.",
      "“I’ve been doing this for over 30 years so I’ve seen all the categories of pundits and he’s a natural at talking about football. He’s a football nut and he understands the game – and when you look at how he played in that position, it’s quite easy to see why.",
      "“He is outstanding at explaining the why and how, not just saying what we can all see. When he’s talking you can hear the production staff in my ear go silent because they’re just listening to him, fascinated because they’re all football fans.",
      "Michael Carrick talking to Steve Bower in his role as a pundit(Image: )",
      "“He’s part of a small group of people we use – Glenn Hoddle, Michael Owen, Alan Shearer – where you watch games and you learn something over 90 minutes. Michael is in that category: he’s top drawer.”",
      "Punditry and coaching are the two most well-trodden paths for players post-retirement, but being a success in both is not a given. Carrick has made a success of both so far, but coaching was always the first love.",
      "Bower conducted Carrick’s first interview as a United player for MUTV after he signed from Tottenham in 2006. He now counts himself as a friend and has seen first-hand how deeply he thinks about the game.",
      "“Michael went into coaching because Mourinho said ‘I want you’. So he finished as a player on the Wednesday and started as a coach on the Thursday – it wasn’t something he was planning. You take a route and things happen.",
      "Michael Carrick worked on Prime Video's Champions League coverage this season(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "He was United caretaker for three games back in 2021(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“By the end of those three games at United [as caretaker in 2021], when I spoke to him he was like: ‘Yeah, I fancy this, but it’s got to be the right one’.”",
      "Three years, the Championship play-off semi-finals and a Carabao Cup semi-final followed at Middlesbrough and now he’s back where he felt most at home during his playing career. So will his hours in the studio, spent analysing Ruben Amorim’s team and articulating his thoughts, stand him in good stead for the job?",
      "“It does help with the analysis side of it, absolutely, because if he hadn’t done that, and he was just watching Manchester United from the TV screen, or in the stands, you see a different game, you don’t watch it in the same way,” Bower says. “The fact he’s been doing that and predominantly watching this United team will certainly give him a headstart.”",
      "Michael Carrick has jumped into training this week with Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "“I think that whatever happens, even if they don’t get back into the Champions League or Europa League, I think he will,” Bower says. “His phone has probably been buzzing before United, but he was adamant he wanted a break. But this can only be a positive for his coaching career personally.",
      "“For instance, if things go badly at Spurs, he’d be right at the top of their list, surely. It’s a no-brainer for him. Whatever happens, I don’t think it’s going to damage him in any way.”",

      "Bruno Fernandes has been linked with a move away from Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has a hectic first month at the helm of Manchester United in store. Not only will the 44-year-old have to work quickly to get to grips with the squad the interim head coach has inherited from Ruben Amorim, but he may also have to accommodate exits and arrivals.",
      "The January transfer window is in full swing at present, with a number of players linked with moves to and from Old Trafford. And while United are not expected to stray from their plans to remain with their current crop of talent this month, that hasn't prevented the rumour mill from churning.",
      "Bruno Fernandes is not thought to be looking for the exit at United this month. The club captain has been linked with a number of Saudi sides as of recent, including Al-Ittihad, Al-Nassr and Al Hilal.",
      "Recent reports also suggested that Fernandes is considering his future with his current club following the sacking of Amorim. The 31-year-old met with one of his former head coach's backroom staff, Carlos Fernandes, in the aftermath, heightening concerns that he could be looking to follow Amorim out the door.",
      "However, a new reports from BBC Sport highlights that sources have claimed Fernandes is committed to the task at hand with United for the rest of the season. It is understood that he will assess his options in the summer, when he enters his final year of contract with the Red Devils.",
      "Bruno Fernandes looks to be staying with Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "United are believed to hold a longstanding interest in the Frenchman, who has racked up eight Premier League goals in 21 games for the Eagles this season alone. Should Juventus accelerate discussions for Mateta, it could probe other interested clubs to also chase his signature.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta has been linked with Juventus(Image: Getty Images)",
      "That could in-turn prompt United to finally enter the race for the striker, or risk missing out on ever seeing him ply his trade at the Theatre of Dreams. United currently have a number of options to choose from up top, with Benjamin Sesko leading the line at present, supported by Matheus Cunha - who can also operate as a No. 9 but has dropped into an attacking midfield role this season.",
      "As per reports, Palace will expect around £30million to let Mateta leave this month, although that figure could rise if the interest is there.",
      "United fans will have to wait a little longer to find out what the future holds for Joshua Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo, as Fabrizio Romano claims that \"there are no signals from United,\" with regard to movement this month.",
      "Roma remain admirers of Zirkzee despite recently welcoming Robinio Vaz while they are looking to bring in Donyell Malen. The Dutchman is also thought to be open to a return to Serie A, but the ball remains in United's court.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee could be looking for a Man united exit(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Elsewhere, Napoli are thought to hold an interest in Mainoo, who is reportedly aggrieved by a lack of consistent playing time as of recent. It remains to be seen what Carrick's intentions are for the midfielder, especially considering the Red Devils' faith has been instilled in Fernandes and Casemiro for the bulk of the season.",
      "However, Carrick may be wise to hold discussions with Mainoo and Zirkzee before deadline day lands on February 2, so everyone is on the same page.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly targeting Murillo for a summer transfer, but they might have some difficulty in persuading the Nottingham Forest star. Murillo has emerged as a target for United as they consider replacements for Harry Maguire this summer.",
      "Maguire’s contract with United is due to expire in June and the club’s recruitment department is planning ahead by considering possible replacements. Murillo has impressed since joining Forest from Corinthians for £10million in 2023 and is understood to be open to leaving at the end of the 2025/26 campaign, despite signing a new deal a year ago.",
      "United are keen on both the defender and the midfielder, but know they will face fierce competition, especially if they don’t get back into Europe under Michael Carrick’s guidance. In the case of Murillo, they also have his stated desire to play for their biggest rivals.",
      "The 23-year-old told the Benja Me Mucho podcast a year ago: “I had the dream of playing in the Premier League and I had that thought. I thought, ‘I’ll go to Nottingham Forest, have a good year and then I’ll go to a big club’.",
      "“I had that in my head. I’d choose Manchester City but it would be more difficult for me to be a regular starter given the players they have in their squad. There’s City, Arsenal as well who are fighting for the Premier League title. I wouldn’t discard Liverpool either. It would be a good opportunity for me to show my football in a big club.”",
      "Back in January 2025, it was Liverpool who were most strongly linked to Murillo and the Reds will also be on the lookout for centre-backs this summer, with Ibrahima Konate’s current deal set to expire.",

      "They saw a £35m deal for Marc Guehi collapse on deadline day in the summer and are facing competition for the Crystal Palace star from Manchester City, who have injury problems of their own.",
      "Murillo has made 96 appearances for Forest since arriving two and a half years ago and has formed a solid partnership with Nikola Milenkovic. Interest in his services is nothing new for Forest, who also rejected a 'club-record offer' to cash in on him last year from Chelsea.",

      "United have long been in the market for midfield reinforcements, with Anderson among a host of names being mentioned as potential targets.",
      "Brighton's Carlos Baleba, Wolves' Joao Gomes and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton have all been mentioned as possible arrivals at Old Trafford in recent months, alongside Anderson.",
      "Despite making four signings last summer, United opted not to bolster their midfield options. Multiple reports now suggest the Red Devils will seek to address this midfield either before the February 2 deadline or during the summer window.",
      "A report in the Daily Mail has provided more insight further on Anderson's situation, including Tuchel's assessment of the midfielder, whom he is expected to manage for England at this summer's World Cup.",
      "Tuchel has reportedly described Anderson in private as a \"gift\", which will be encouraging news for United if they remain genuinely interested in securing the England international's services. Anderson shone for England's Under-21s last summer at the Euro U21 Championships in Slovakia, with the Young Lions triumphing over Germany in the final.",
      "The Forest midfielder was instrumental in that final victory, and it was that performance which earned Anderson his promotion to Tuchel's first team.",

      "Murillo, 23, has been one of the Premier League's most impressive young centre-backs over the last two seasons after joining Forest from Corinthians for just £10million. And his form has not gone unnoticed at Old Trafford, with United's top brass already making plans ahead of a big summer, where they will decide on a new permanent head coach.",

      "The report goes on to add that Murillo is among the options Manchester United are considering ahead of the summer as they plan to bolster their defence, potentially with a view to replacing Maguire, who is now inside the final six months of his contract.",

      "Gareth Southgate remains out of work since resigning as England manager(Image: ADRIAN DENNIS, POOL/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Gareth Southgate has said he has no concerns about directors of football undermining a manager's power following Manchester United's decision to part ways with Ruben Amorim. The former England manager believes the fundamental reason behind Amorim's downfall was a battle for control with senior club officials.",
      "United's director of football, Jason Wilcox, a former England colleague of Southgate's, ultimately prevailed in the dispute. Whilst discussing the distinction between a manager and a head coach, Southgate - who was previously touted as a potential United appointment - disclosed that he demanded his job title be changed from head coach to manager when offered the England position.",
      "He now describes himself as a 'leader, manager, coach - in that order'. An extensive LinkedIn article entitled 'Manager v Head Coach', which Southgate characterises as his \"thoughts on the importance of the title of manager as opposed to head coach\", adds his voice to the conversation.",
      "It reads: \"In the last fortnight, three of Europe's biggest football clubs, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Chelsea, have parted company with their head coaches. Of the three, Enzo Maresca served the longest period at 18 months.",
      "\"Although each coach left under slightly different circumstances and for more than one reason, power struggles either with club executives (Amorim), club employees (Maresca) or players (Alonso) were ultimately the root cause of the end of each tenure.",
      "\"The erosion of a manager's authority has been a gradual process over many years. It has accelerated with the widespread introduction of football, technical, or sporting directors, who now oversee long-term football strategy, report directly to CEOs or owners (or both), and sit structurally above the head coach. Personally, I have no issue with this evolution.",
      "Gareth Southgate has plenty to say about the manager vs head coach debate(Image: PA)",
      "\"Strategy, culture, planning, and continuity are critical to success in any organisation - and a football club is no different. A head coach neither has the time nor, in many cases, the specialist expertise to manage complex player contracts, oversee global scouting networks, or run sophisticated data operations. Equally, it makes little sense to dismantle medical or sports science departments every time there is a change of head coach.",
      "\"However, in a classic example of Parkinson's Law (where time saved by reducing responsibilities is quickly filled by something else), the modern head coach now finds themselves managing larger squads, bigger backroom teams, far greater analytical demands, and ever-increasing media and commercial obligations.\"",
      "Southgate's remarks about backroom staff emerge just days after the revelation that his former England number two, Steve Holland, would be joining Michael Carrick at United temporarily until the campaign concludes. The ex-Chelsea assistant forms part of a coaching setup that also features Craig Mawson, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion.",
      "Southgate's post goes on to say: \"Contrary to the belief of some fans that the role has become simpler (\"they just need to coach\"), the opposite is true. Add to this the complexity of managing modern-day players (many of whom are effectively individual brands), alongside the financial stakes for clubs, and the relentless scrutiny of both traditional and social media, and you have a significant melting pot of problems and pressure. This is not helped by the subtle, sometimes unintentional, shift in power and status implied by moving from the title of manager to head coach.",
      "\"People may argue that 'it's just a title', or merely semantics. From personal experience, it's not. So much so that when I was offered the role of head coach for the England National team, I insisted on changing the title to manager. Even though I consider myself calm, collaborative and confident, I understood the importance of authority, influence and control when leading a football operation.",
      "\"You may have noticed that my current LinkedIn title reads 'leader, manager, coach' - in that order. That is entirely intentional. It reflects the hierarchy of skills I believed were required to run the England team effectively.",
      "\"The leader operates in the public eye, engaging fans, setting the vision, shaping the culture, and championing and protecting the players and staff.",
      "\"The manager is 'managing' stakeholders, departments and people, maximising collaboration and making plans stay on track. Oh, and don't forget the role of persuading 25 financially independent elite performers to put collective purpose ahead of their ego.",
      "\"Finally, the coach works on the pitch, setting the style of play, preparing tactics to exploit opponents, and developing the technical abilities of individual players.",
      "\"My belief is that we should embrace a modernised version of the traditional manager, where we recognise the people they lead, manage and coach. As I once said to my bosses at England: players are not magnets on a tactics board that can simply be moved around. They are human beings. And managing that reality is at the heart of modern football leadership.\"",

      "Carlo Ancelotti has previously taken aim at the Glazers for their running of Manchester United, as the legendary boss has been suggested as a potential option to replace Ruben Amorim in the summer. The hierarchy at Old Trafford decided to wield the axe on the head coach, following an outburst that seemingly criticised his role in the club.",
      "The Portuguese coach was the first full-time hire made by Ineos and Sir Jim Ratcliffe as part of their co-ownership of United, which has looked to transform the sporting departments of the club. With no clear favourite lined up to immediately replace Amorim, they have turned to Michael Carrick as caretaker manager.",
      "As a result, the shortlist of potential names for the summer continues to grow, with international coaches such as Thomas Tuchel, Mauricio Pochettino, and Julian Nagelsmann among those who may be available. There is also the case of Ancelotti, who is in charge of the Brazilian national team, with former United assistant Rene Meulensteen believing he should be on the club's radar.",
      "\"Carlo Ancelotti is the guy with the type of pedigree who can handle it because he’s done it, he’s seen it and he knows what a winning culture looks like,\" he said. \"I don’t think Ancelotti would listen to anybody else. Ancelotti would say this is what I’m doing. I’m managing what I’m here to do.",
      "“Football has changed. You’ve got Directors of Football now or Sporting Directors and Technical Directors who are there to safeguard the big picture of the whole football operation at a club and then you’ve got a Head Coach who should be working with the squad of players.",
      "“As a coach, you need to be very clear on that. That’s why Ruben Amorim ran into trouble. They obviously weren’t aligned. He had different ideas about how it should be run than the people in the background.”",
      "It's unclear whether Ancelotti would be open to making the move to Old Trafford, or whether the hierarchy at the club are even looking at the former Chelsea and Real Madrid man. However, when it comes to alignment, there may be concerns over the role of the Glazers.",
      "While the partial sale of the club saw Ineos and Ratcliffe take a minority stake, along with control on the sporting side of things, the American family are still the majority shareholders. This may cause some friction, not least as Ancelotti made it clear exactly what he thought about the family back in 2016.",
      "The Glazer family, including Avram Glazer (left), have been a majority shareholders at Manchester United since 2005.(Image: (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images))",
      "He said: \"I was fortunate to be able to coach Real Madrid, although then the club decided to change managers. That is part of the job, we are exposed to that. In the big clubs it is difficult to stay a long time because the expectations of results are so high.",
      "\"Madrid’s history and demands mean that if a coach doesn’t win trophies, a change is made. You have to respect that. It’s true that there are other clubs like Manchester United, where [Sir Alex] Ferguson was there many years, and now [Arsene] Wenger at Arsenal.",
      "\"These cases are different, as their owners are from the US and they are more interested in the financial aspect than in who is coach.”",
      "It remains to be seen whether Ancelotti is a serious target for United or not in their search for a new head coach, but it will continue talk surrounding what the club wants or needs for the future. The 'Man United DNA' has been a common theme surrounding discussion on who should be the next appointment.",
      "Figuring out exactly what that means, and how to deploy it into action, will be the job of the sporting department. Director of Football Jason Wilcox will be in charge of deploying a game model that can align through the club, uniting the recruitment team, directors, and the management team.",
      "The appointment of Carrick has bought them time to make those key decisions, but they will have to be spot on to help rebuild the team for the future.",

      "Gareth Southgate could be on Manchester United's radar again(Image: Adrian Dennis - WPA Pool/Getty Images)",
      "The timing of Gareth Southgate's comments couldn't be more ironic. Within 48 hours of Steve Holland being parachuted into Manchester United, Southgate has gone public with his views on the current power struggle between managers and club bosses.",
      "\"The erosion of a manager's authority has been a gradual process over many years,\" he said. \"It has accelerated with the widespread introduction of Football, Technical, or Sporting Directors, who now oversee long-term football strategy, report directly to CEOs or owners (or both), and sit structurally above the Head Coach.",
      "\"Personally, I have no issue with this evolution. Strategy, culture, planning, and continuity are critical to success in any organisation - and a football club is no different.\"",
      "Is it a nod to United co-owner and friend Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he's still around and available for work?",
      "Because if Southgate has no problem with people above him sticking their noses into his business, United might just be the perfect place for him. Not least considering what the roles of Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada were in the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "There is nothing to suggest Holland appointment as assistant to interim boss Michael Carrick will lead to Southgate taking charge at Old Trafford in the summer.",
      "There is nothing to suggest Holland has been sent in to assess the state of the club, before reporting back to Southgate.",
      "There is nothing to suggest United are considering Southgate as an option. And there is nothing to suggest Southgate wants a return to club management, following his draining but successful time in charge of England.",
      "New Manchester United No 2 Steve Holland was Gareth Southgate's right-hand man for England(Image: Alex Pantling - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "But there is no hiding from the fact the United job remains one the most iconic ones in club football. While Ratcliffe considered appointing Southgate when it became clear Erik Ten Hag was toast. The timing wasn't right, with Southgate preparing for Euro 2024, and then stepping away from management altogether following the tournament.",
      "Theories continue to swirl around United like a plague of locust. Is Holland putting the building blocks in place for Southgate? Or is the former England No.2 using United to help himself get a more attractive job in six months time?",
      "While you can argue that if United wanted Southgate now, why didn't they appoint him? He's available, and free of charge in terms of compensation.",
      "The truth probably lies somewhere in between. And one thing we do know, is that Southgate is keeping himself relevant.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has reduced the asking price for Nice(Image: (Photo by Chris Brunskill/Fantasista/Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has dramatically reduced the asking price for French club OGC Nice as he attempts to offload his stake in the team, it is claimed. According to Bloomberg, Ineos had initially been seeking more than €200m (£173m) to complete a full sale of the club in the coming weeks and months.",
      "Ratcliffe put Nice on the market last year, but potential investors were reportedly unwilling to meet the asking price for the Ligue 1 side. This has since prompted the valuation to \"come down significantly\" to help facilitate a sale.",
      "The primary obstacle facing the British billionaire and advisory firm Lazard Inc, who were brought in to help secure a deal, centres around uncertainty surrounding the television rights deal in France. DAZN had initially acquired the rights but, following the collapse of that agreement, Ligue 1 have been managing and distributing their own broadcast deal among clubs.",
      "Any agreement for an investor to purchase the Ineos stake in Nice would bring an end to nearly seven years of the company's ownership of the French club, which has produced mixed results. Currently, Les Aiglons sit 14th in the league with just a six-point cushion above the relegation zone.",
      "Those struggles have been exemplified in Europe, as they are yet to register a single point in the Europa League, with criticism mounting over the club's management in recent years. This comes at a time when United face their own challenges and turbulence under the part-ownership of Ineos and Ratcliffe.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has slashed the price of Nice amid a potential sale of the French club(Image: (Photo by Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images))",
      "There have been glimmers of progress following last season's disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League, but turmoil has erupted in the wake of Ruben Amorim's dismissal. The Portuguese coach was the first permanent appointment under the new ownership and sporting structure, a move by Ratcliffe's group to overhaul the club's behind-the-scenes operations.",
      "This evidently created friction for Amorim, who made it clear that he saw himself as a manager rather than a head coach at the club, despite the new setup including a director of football, Jason Wilcox. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" he declared in early January when questioned about his rapport with the board.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club.",
      "\"No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "His departure, coupled with Michael Carrick's appointment as interim boss, highlighted the pressure on Ineos to make the correct choice for the next permanent manager to steer United back on track, whilst questions have been raised about the circumstances surrounding the outgoing head coach.",
      "That shift in approach must align with a coherent playing philosophy established by the sporting department, alongside targeted recruitment of players who fit specific tactical requirements.",
      "Whether the club can achieve that unified vision across its leadership structure is yet to be determined.",

      "As we approach the halfway point of the January transfer window, Manchester United have yet to add any new players to their squad. There has been a change in the dugout, though, with Ruben Amorim sacked and Michael Carrick taking interim charge until the end of the season.",
      "The deal for former United midfielder Carrick was confirmed on Tuesday and he will be thrown straight in at the deep end. United play host to Manchester City on Saturday lunchtime, looking to gain revenge for their 3-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium back in September.",
      "It remains to be seen whether there will be a great deal of transfer activity without a permanent manager in place. United signed Patrick Dorgu and Ayden Heaven during the winter window last season but may end up waiting until the summer this time.",

      "Those reports in Italy claim Juve offered just over £30m for the striker, who is out of contract at the end of the 2026/27 season. That's some way shy of the £50m asking price reported in 2025, but it has been suggested his contract situation is responsible for the drop.",

      "United, meanwhile, filled their striker vacancy with the £73m arrival of Benjamin Sesko last summer. However, the Slovenian has appeared far from the finished product this season, and with Joshua Zirkzee seemingly bound for an exit this year, Mateta could remain on United's watchlist.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly growing more and more confident that they will be able to prise Carlos Baleba away from Brighton in the summer transfer window. United have been long-term admirers of Baleba and believe their chances are increasing.",
      "United have made little secret of their interest in the Cameroon international, who was one of their primary targets before the 2025/26 season began. Brighton held firm in the summer, quoting a price north of £100million, with the £115m they landed from Chelsea for Moises Caicedo setting the bar high.",
      "The Seagulls have continued to insist publicly that Baleba is not for sale, but United are still monitoring the 22-year-old midfielder. And they have been given hope that a deal can be struck in the upcoming off-season, partly due to a gradual decline in his performances for Fabian Hurzeler’s side.",
      "The Sun reports that United are ‘increasingly confident’ of getting their man this summer, with an overhaul of midfield in the works. Baleba is under contract with Brighton until June 2028, but the club have shown time and again that they are willing to do business because they back their recruitment system to find a replacement.",
      "Baleba may not be the only arrival at Old Trafford in the summer, too, with United hoping to sign more than one central midfielder. Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton and Bournemouth’s Alex Scott are also being monitored.",
      "Casemiro is expected to leave United upon the expiry of his contract in June, while there are growing concerns about the future of Bruno Fernandes following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim. Meanwhile, Kobbie Mainoo has been unsettled this season amid interest from Napoli.",
      "United are currently being managed by Michael Carrick but will appoint a long-term successor to Amorim in the summer. While the identity of their new boss and their tactical outlook will shape their transfer plans, the hierarchy have already started work on targets for what will be a hugely important summer.",
      "Carlos Baleba could leave Brighton in the summer(Image: Warren Little/Getty Images)",
      "Brighton have shown themselves to be tough negotiators, driving hard bargains for their star players previously, and deputy chairman Paul Barber recently set out their stance. “[We’ve had] no call from Old Trafford, no call from anyone connected to Manchester United,” he said this month.",
      "“We have no plans or desire to sell Carlos Baleba in this window or any future window. We know he’s a talented player and I am sure he’s got a lot of options ahead of him in the future. For us he’s an important player in the second half of the season and we’re looking forward to having back from AFCON.”",
      "Meanwhile, Brighton chairman Tony Bloom told The Argus in October: “I don’t think Baleba was a saga. There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn’t available this summer and they went away.”",

      "Carrick previously took charge of three games in 2021 before joining Championship side Middlesbrough. He returned to the club this week following positive discussions with the club's hierarchy.",
      "His appointment was a main talking point on the Stick to Football podcast and Keane seemed to reignite a previous feud with Carrick's wife, Lisa, when discussing the chances of success this season. When speaking about the impact of Carrick on the United squad, Keane said; \"His wife can always come in [if Carrick doesn't do well], cause she's got a bit of a big mouth sometimes. She's probably doing the team talk.\"",
      "In 2014, Lisa responded to Keane's criticism of Carrick's performance and post-match interview following the 2-0 defeat to Greek side Olympiacos in the Champions League. Carrick's wife posted on Twitter, now X: \"Roy Keane what a ****, says anything to provoke a reaction.\"",
      "She then deleted the tweet and apologised for her words. \"Deleted my tweet... Emotions got the better of me,” she wrote.",
      "Keane was also critical of Carrick's backroom staff members. Former England assistant manager Steve Holland will be Carrick's number two, with Jonny Evans, Jonathan Woodgate and Travis Binnion making up the management team.",
      "\"He's on the beach two weeks ago, Jonny Evans,\" Keane said. \"Jonny Evans leaves Man United four or five weeks ago as a loans manager and then Darren Fletcher gives him a job, strangely enough gives him a job.",

      "\"He has two games, Fletch goes and Carrick gives him a job, great isn't it. We should all go to Barbados for a week. You're on about getting your coaching staff in, you're praising one of them saying he's experienced and then we just let the other two go, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans.",
      "\"What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach of Man United's first team? He left the job four weeks ago - loans manager, and ironically comes back working with the first team. That's a big step up, isn't it?\"",
      "He added: \"My point is, if Steve Holland is on the training pitch at least you know they're going to get top class training sessions. I'm not saying they weren't before because they probably were as well. I don't know what Evans or Woodgate are like as coaches, don't know what Carrick is like as a coach.\"",

The former Red Devils midfielder was appointed interim manager earlier this week, relieving Darren Fletcher of his caretaker post following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "While Carrick's time at the helm will only last until the end of the season, United do have previous when it comes to rewarding temporary managers with permanent contracts following a run of good form.",
      "It was over seven years ago, in December 2018, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer returned to Old Trafford as a caretaker manager after Jose Mourinho was dismissed. And three months later, the Norwegian, who won 14 of 19 games in charge, was handed a three-year deal as the club's new head coach.",
      "United's good form and performances led to former players, including Rio Ferdinand, pressuring the board to appoint Solskjaer on a permanent basis. Rio Ferdinand infamously told the club to give the Norwegian a blank cheque after Man United knocked PSG out of the Champions League.",
      "An excitable Ferdinand said live on BT Sport after United's 3-1 win in Paris: \"Listen, Man United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done now since he's come in.",
      "\"Let him sign the contract and go. Ole's at the wheel. He's doing it, he's doing his thing. Man United are back!\" Ferdinand's comments are infamous for a reason, as United never returned to the same form they showed during Solskjaer's reign.",
      "They went without silverware in the three years he was at the club before he was sacked following an embarrassing 4-1 defeat by Watford. It was on talkSPORT that former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy urged United not to make the same mistake when it comes to Carrick's situation.",

      "There are plenty of questions to answer at Manchester United(Image: )",
      "A lot can change in a week and the last time we answered your Manchester United questions it looked like Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be the man in the Old Trafford dugout for this weekend's Manchester derby. Instead, Michael Carrick is the man who will aim to oversee a win against United's city rivals.",
      "The former Middlesbrough boss impressed Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox during the interview process and has been handed the reins until the end of the season. Everyone wants to know what we can expect to see from the new man in charge and who the winners and losers will be from his appointment, and we'll look to answer some of those questions in this week's Q&A.",
      "We run weekly question and answer sessions so click here to submit your questions and we'll answer them next week. Here are the answers to some of this week's questions:",
      "What is the plan of the board of directors to bring the glory days back to United?",
      "A nice, easy one to start with. The board of directors have essentially given control of football matters to Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox. So their plan is for Berrada and Wilcox to get things right. As for the plan of Berrada and Wilcox, well, who knows?",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "This isn't hindsight; I have consistently said that the appointment of Amorim was a strange one for a club looking to move away from a dominant head coach/manager. Amorim has one of the most distinctive playing systems in Europe and the only way that can work is by signing him specialists.",
      "The one positive recently has been recruitment, which was better in the summer. But the decision on who to appoint next is vital and could make or break this Ineos regime. Berrada has championed Project 150, which is a desire to win the league in the club's 150th anniversary season in 2027/28. Right now those look like hollow words and bland executive speak.",
      "The plan right now has to be get the right head coach. Do that and things might fall into place, but there is no escaping the fact that the structure of ownership and the combination of the Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe make success a challenge for this club at the moment.",
      "What is Carrick's formation?",
      "He was a 4-2-3-1 man at Middlesbrough and I would imagine we will see that again. That was the system Ole Gunnar Solskjaer played at United and Carrick kept it during his three games in charge.",
      "That kind of shape can easily become a 4-3-3 if one of the two sitting midfielders moves forward, but I imagine it will be more of a cautious set-up for now, given the first two games are against Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Give Lacey a chance - Cunha and Dalot are not worth United shirts.",
      "Lacey has started to get a chance of late and I think he will stay in and around the first-team set-up. His problem now is Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are back and after this weekend (when Lacey is suspended) there are only 16 games left of the season. As talented as Lacey is, I don't think anyone can suggest he should be starting games ahead of Amad or Mbeumo right now.",
      "Cunha has had a slow start to his Old Trafford career. I thought there were positive signs in mid-December but he's gone off the boil again. With Amad and Mbeumo away, he should have grabbed this team by the scruff of the neck, but he's gone back to playing with the handbrake on. I wouldn't be giving up on him any time soon, though. We have seen there is a very good Premier League player in there.",
      "Let's get Xabi Alonso - he's a man with vision and a winning mentality.",
      "Alonso feels like a difficult appointment, given his Liverpool connections, but I do think he would be a very good one. I wouldn't hold what happened at Real Madrid against him; that place chews up and spits out coaches and Alonso's desire to actually try and change the culture should be seen as a positive, if anything.",
      "But there is a good chance Alonso is next in line at Anfield and he would have to ask himself if he was willing to blow up the chance of ever coaching Liverpool by moving to United. I'm not sure I can see it.",
      "Why is Harry Maguire not starting as well as Shea Lacey and Kobbie Mainoo?",
      "Maguire has just returned from injury and needs to get back to full fitness. I would have him in central defence alongside Martinez at the moment, but he had two months out and needs to make sure he is fully recovered.",
      "I don't think there has been an obvious time to start Lacey and with all the attacking players now back, I don't think he gets a start anytime soon. His development is going along just fine if he stays around the first-team squad.",
      "As for Mainoo, I think we all know why he wasn't starting under Amorim. He just didn't trust the 20-year-old in his midfield. I'd be amazed if Carrick didn't hand him more opportunities.",
      "Why don't the club send Diogo Dalot out on loan?",
      "Not sure I see any merit in this, to be honest. Dalot is 26, there is no point sending him on loan to develop and he is the first-choice right-back and a member of the leadership group.",
      "He's had a difficult season and the criticism of him from supporters has been noticeably louder this year. I'm not sure he's the long-term answer at right-back but there is no replacement ready to go either. Even if Noussair Mazraoui takes that place next week, Dalot would be needed as back-up.",
      "There is probably an argument to sign a right-back in the summer, although midfield has to be the priority. It feels inevitable that Dalot will face more competition at some point.",

      "Carrick was confirmed as head coach on Wednesday.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "Michael Carrick spent just under a year out of the game after his stint as Manchester United caretaker, taking over at Middlesbrough for his first full-time managerial role. Carrick made an immediate impact, impressing Boro fans with a progressive style of play and guiding the club into the play-offs.",
      "Carrick took the job with Middlesbrough in a Championship relegation battle, but they ended the season by having a crack at promotion to the Premier League, with Carrick winning 16 of his first 23 league games.",
      "It began to unravel for Carrick in his second year in charge at the Riverside Stadium. The former United midfielder oversaw an eighth-placed finish, missing out on the play-offs, and there was regression in his third campaign, which resulted in a disappointing 10th-placed finish.",
      "Carrick was backed in the transfer market in the summer of 2024 but failed to meet expectations, which ultimately led to his dismissal. Carrick had been out of work since his departure from Middlesbrough, but now has the chance to manage the club that he represented for 464 games as a player.",
      "United announced Carrick's appointment as head coach on Tuesday. He will be supported by a backroom staff of Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion.",
      "Carrick was undefeated in three games as United caretaker in 2021/22, and he had the confidence to drop Cristiano Ronaldo, but there is a larger body of evidence from his time at Middlesbrough to provide meaningful insight into what to expect from him as interim for the remainder of the campaign.",
      "Dominic Shaw, sports reporter at The Northern Echo, covered Carrick's stint at Middlesbrough. \"I think there has to be an element of surprise considering he ultimately failed to get Middlesbrough promoted,\" he said.",
      "\"But the appointment also feels understandable at the same time, given the position United are in and Carrick's association with the club.",
      "\"What will be interesting is what happens if Carrick can repeat at Old Trafford the immediate impact he had at Middlesbrough. His appointment was initially transformational at Boro and his side should, in truth, have won promotion in that first season. That was the high point of his time on Teesside.",
      "\"In his last season, Aaron Danks seemed to be a big miss after his departure to join Vincent Kompany's staff at Bayern Munich. With that in mind, the Steve Holland appointment feels wise.\"",
      "Carrick celebrates a win in February 2023.(Image: 2023 Getty Images)",
      "Shaw described Carrick's tenure at Middlesbrough as mixed. \"As mentioned above, Boro were brilliant for large spells of his first season after he took charge in October 2022,\" he explained.",
      "\"For a spell in the second half of the season they were the best team in the Championship, but they came up short in their bid to catch the top two and then lost in the play-offs.",
      "\"That resulted in an exodus of star players and loanees, so the following campaign was very much a season of transition, though Boro still reached the last four of the Carabao Cup.",
      "\"Last season was a disappointment. The aim was promotion, but Boro underachieved and came up well short, finishing 10th. After a long review at the end of the season, Boro officials decided it was time for change. Most Boro fans agreed.\"",
      "So what went wrong? Carrick was accused of stubbornness and his plan became stale. \"In his first season, the football on offer was as good as Boro fans have seen in a long time,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"But come last year, Boro were too often predictable and ponderous in attack, and at the other end they gave away a string of shambolic goals. Their game-management - or lack of it - let them down again and again and they threw away countless points from position of dominance in games. One criticism that Carrick didn't like but was fair was that his side was soft-centred. It lacked steel and leadership.\"",
      "Carrick during his first training session as head coach.(Image: )",
      "Carrick operated with 4-2-3-1 at Middlesbrough and is expected to use that formation at United. \"Carrick craves control. His Boro side were always possession-based and his preference was a 4-2-3-1 shape,\" Shaw said.",
      "\"He did move to a back three and wing-backs on a couple of occasions, but it was always clear it was a short-term fix. He wants his goalkeeper and defenders to play out from the back and talked often about the need for his forward players to be 'fluid'.",
      "\"At Boro, he also had huge success in transforming Chuba Akpom into a No.10. Akpom had been signed as a striker but had flopped on Teesside until Carrick moved him into a deeper attacking role, a position he'd never previously played. Akpom was the Championship's Player of the Year in 2022/23 and earned a move to Ajax.",
      "\"He said Carrick was 'the manager he'd been dreaming of his whole career'. Carrick played down his role, saying he'd just followed his instinct after watching Akpom in training.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim was box office during press conferences, sometimes critical of his own players, but Shaw warned that Carrick's appearances with the media will be business-like for the remainder of the season.",
      "\"Don't expect any repeats of the explosive Ruben Amorim press conferences,\" he said. \"Carrick is always extremely measured and reluctant to give too much away. He's fiercely defensive of his players. Never once did he stray close to criticising his players, or club officials for that matter.\"",
      "Shaw added: \"Boro made a huge profit on a number of players during Carrick's time in charge. Morgan Rogers signed for £1m and left in a deal worth £16m. Emmanuel Latte Lath signed for £4m and left for north of £20m. That's obviously testament to Boro's recruitment work, but also Carrick's coaching.",
      "\"He made mistakes at Boro but that was to be expected - it was his first role as a permanent head coach. Now we'll see whether he's learned from them.\"",

      "Michael Carrick has a simple decision to make ahead of the derby(Image: OLI SCARFF/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "How do you stop Erling Haaland? A question Michael Carrick probably did not anticipate answering when he sat down for his Christmas meal but now it will be at the forefront of his mind heading into Saturday's derby. The answer for most Premier League clubs over the past three-and-a-half years has been simple: you can't.",
      "Manchester United have found Manchester City's talisman to be a thorn in their side but the Reds are not the only ones left cursing his name. He has a solid goalscoring record against most clubs in the division and he has shown he only needs a sniff of a chance to score.",
      "Not really what United fans nor Carrick will be wanting to read, especially when this derby is so crucial for all those of a red persuasion.",
      "The Haaland question will be prominent in Carrick's thinking as he prepares his team for the derby. The Norwegian is by no means City's only threat, especially now Antoine Semenyo has joined them, but if United can find a way to stop him, they have a good shot at a positive result.",
      "If they are to do it, they will need to rely on their centre-backs having great games. In Darren Fletcher's two matches in charge, there was one constant in the centre-back partnership and that was Lisandro Martinez.",
      "The Argentine has benefitted from the return of the back four and will likely start for Carrick in the derby. But who partners him is a different conversation entirely.",
      "Ayden Heaven started against Burnley and he had a difficult night before his substitution on the hour mark. He was replaced on Sunday by Leny Yoro but the Frenchman is in a really tough spot form-wise.",
      "United cannot afford to pick a defender low on confidence and form against City, especially with Haaland the man they will come up against. This is not the game to try and help Yoro get back to his best.",
      "In an ideal world, Matthijs de Ligt would be fit to face City, but he looks set to be out again so that leaves just one simple decision for Carrick to make: recall Harry Maguire to the starting XI.",
      "He has recently spent time in the treatment room at Carrington but is back to full fitness now and a return against City makes the most sense. In a physical battle, United need a player like Maguire up against Haaland.",
      "Both Heaven and Yoro have huge potential but this game, with everything that is at stake, calls for experienced heads. Maguire has his doubters but he must start on Saturday.",

      "\"He's taken his own staff in there which I think was really important to do. The experience of Steve Holland and he obviously worked with Jonathan Woodgate before at Middlesbrough.",
      "\"Michael will be wanting to do a good job so he can stake a claim to take it long-term, that's what his motivation will be. Darren Fletcher managed one defeat and a draw so that didn't work but it'll be fascinating to see what Michael does differently to try and get the team up the table.",
      "\"They've got no cup competitions; the only target is to try and get into Europe and that's what he'll try to do. Man United probably didn't have a choice when it came to hiring another interim manager.",
      "\"They were probably in a situation where, and it bides them time, that Michael's connections will make his appointment go down well with the crowd. It gives Man United a chance to breathe and weigh up the situation to see where they go from now until the end of the season. Getting someone in from now until the end of the season was probably the only choice Man United had.",
      "\"Michael used to be at the same club as I was, Wallsend Boys Club. I never played with him and never worked with him, but I know him and have done little bits with him. He's very measured. I don't know what happened at Middlesbrough, but I know he tried to play front-foot, attacking football.",
      "\"It's a sensible appointment for Man United and it'll be really interesting to see what he can do with that team. It's purely going to be a game per week from now. He's got 17 games to get them into Europe.",
      "\"I think Michael will handle the pressure of the job like he did being a player there. He'll relish it. He's very calm, measured in what he does, and I think he'll be exactly the same as he was on the pitch.",
      "\"Michael isn't a magician, and there's no doubt that some of the players in that team are under-performing and have been for a while. It'll be fascinating to see whether he can get a tune out of them and drag them up the league.\"",

      "During the World Cup in Qatar in 2022, White was part of the England squad preparing for a group game against the USA. And Holland was less than impressed with White's attitude, when he decided the full back didn't share the same obsession with football he had - or expected. One barbed comment towards White, which is understood to have been made in front of teammates, left White so upset he asked to go home.",
      "Which he did, with Gareth Southgate's blessing. White hasn't pulled on an England shirt since. Southgate wanted him to, but White refused the invitation.",
      "It must be assumed White had no desire to work under Holland again, given what happened at England's training base at Souq Al Wakra, on the outskirts of Doha. Yet the fall-out between White and Holland is a cautionary tale for the Manchester United squad, now Holland has been appointed No.2 to Michael Carrick.",
      "United have broken with tradition and made a shrewd appointment. Let's be honest, the current United team needs an experienced hand to guide it out of the current carnage, not to mention give certain individuals a kick up the backside. United need some structure and identity.",

      "Harrison has been recalled from Shrewsbury.(Image: 2026 Malcolm Couzens)",
      "Manchester United have recalled goalkeeper Elyh Harrison from Shrewsbury Town. Harrison started for Shrewsbury against Wolves in the FA Cup last weekend, but his minutes in the league were limited.",
      "After missing the opening two games of the League Two campaign due to a minor injury, Harrison started the next four games before reporting for England Under-20 duty in September. Young goalkeeper Will Brook came into the side and helped Shrewsbury to their first win of the season.",
      "Harrison started the two matches upon his return, but Brook was recalled and has kept his place since, which saw him pick up the Shrewsbury Player of the Month award for October. Against Wolves in the FA Cup, Harrison made his first start for Shrewsbury since losing his place in the team, and United have decided to recall him from the loan in the January window.",
      "A statement from Shewsbury confirming the recall said: \"Elyh Harrison has returned to Manchester United following his loan spell. The young goalkeeper featured nine times in all competitions, and we thank him for his efforts in our colours. Best of luck for the rest of your career, Elyh!",
      "Harrison's first loan away in the first half of 2024/25 was with Chester FC in the National League North. Harrison kept seven clean sheets, and his temporary stint was considered a resounding success.",
      "There are high hopes for Harrison in the academy and United believe they have a goalkeeper who has the potential to break into the first team, which will ultimately be his long-term goal.",
      "However, the youngster will look to bounce back in the second half of the season after struggling for game time at Shrewsbury. United have recalled a handful of other academy players this month.",
      "Jonny Evans stepped down from his position as head of loans and pathways in December, which means Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is overseeing loans in the winter window.",

      "Manchester United are interested in signing Elliot Anderson and one of his Nottingham Forest teammates(Image: (Photo by Matt West/Shutterstock))",
      "Manchester United are primed for a huge summer overhaul in several departments. Though the January transfer window is open, it certainly seems that the focus is on preparing for the 2026/27 season with a handful of new signings and a fresh face in the dugout.",
      "Interim head coach Michael Carrick is set to take charge of his first game this weekend and it is a big one as Manchester City head to Old Trafford. Though United have not made any additions this month, it could feel as though they have with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad back available after their AFCON exploits.",
      "With United well-stocked for attacking options, the priority position for recruitment is midfield. Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are the main names that have been strongly linked with Angelo Stiller, Morten Hjulmand and Joao Gomes just a few alternatives potentially under consideration.",
      "The latter is likely to depart Wolves at the end of the season, following their expected relegation, with one European club very keen to sign him. Strengthening in defence could also become a priority given the injuries those in that position have suffered.",
      "With his contract expiring, Marcos Senesi could become a cost-effective option while Anderson's Forest teammate Murillo is now under consideration. With all of that being said, MEN Sport has taken a closer look at the latest United transfer rumours and provided a fresh perspective on the updates.",
      "Manchester United - FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "According to Brazilian outlet Globo, Napoli have made contact for Joao Gomes with the hopes of signing him for next season. Wolves are reportedly demanding £43million (€50m) to sell.",
      "However, their report adds that Gomes' priority is remaining in England, which hands United a major boost if they opt to pursue his services. Ruben Amorim appeared to be the main driving force behind a potential deal but he has now left the club and thus it remains to be seen whether or not United will remain interested.",
      "Manchester United transfer target Joao Gomes is wanted by Napoli(Image: CameraSport via Getty Images)",
      "MEN Sport says: Gomes would be a great addition to United's midfield, but he is likely relatively far down on their shortlist.",
      "Past interest in Carlos Baleba and the undeniable ability of both Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson makes them more attractive options, but with that comes a higher asking price. The clear priority is midfield for United, with that likely to be where the majority of funds go.",
      "Even if United bring in one of Wharton or Anderson, Gomes could still yet arrive given how depleted United are in that area and because of the different traits they would bring to United's midfield.",
      "United could well be hoping Nottingham Forest are relegated to help with their potential double swoop of Anderson and Murillo. The former is a long-term target while the Brazilian centre-back is under consideration by those at Old Trafford, according to The Daily Mail.",
      "Their report adds that Murillo is open to departing the City Ground with United targeting replacements for Harry Maguire. Signing both would likely set United back over £150million with a triple-figure fee wanted for Anderson and Forest hoping to secure at least £70million if Murillo departs.",
      "Manchester United are considering a move for Murillo(Image: Kieran McManus/Shutterstock)",
      "MEN Sport says: United's summer business is likely to depend on a number of things with league position arguably the biggest factor.",
      "Having Champions League football again would make a move much more attractive for most, if not all, targets, while Forest being relegated would make exits for Anderson and Murillo far more likely.",
      "There is also likely to be a partnership between those two players which could certainly help when it comes to settling in and playing together. It would be an expensive double swoop for United but one that would arguably instantly improve their squad.",

      "Michael Carrick was confirmed as head coach this week.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Manchester United are not expected to deviate from their January transfer window plan following Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach. Carrick returned to United this week to oversee the remainder of the season, and there has been speculation that he could be backed with new additions.",
      "It's understood, however, that United are unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets are not available in the winter window. United committed an outlay of £215million (excluding add-ons) to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in the summer window, which the club views as the preferred time to land their top targets for value-for-money transfer fees.",
      "Carrick has just 17 games to oversee in the Premier League due to United's early exits from cup competitions, and the 44-year-old will try to steer the club into the Champions League. Investment has already been earmarked to strengthen United's midfield at the end of the season. Casemiro is out of contract in June, while Bruno Fernandes is expected to consider his future after the World Cup.",
      "Speaking in October, Fernandes said: \"I haven't spoken with anyone. I could tell you that there are still people talking to me and saying that they will be very eager to have me next year, of course.",
      "\"But from my side, that's not talked about. Because my agent also knows how I work, so if he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Because until then, I won't speak to anyone.\"",

      "United considered a move for Carlos Baleba last summer. Brighton valued the midfielder in excess of £100million, and United focused their resources on other areas of the team. Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton have also been tracked.",

Carrick has inherited a side that could still secure European football. Darren Fletcher, speaking during his stint as caretaker, stressed that a return to the Champions League must be the target, and United are just three points adrift of Liverpool in fourth position.",
      "When Carrick's appointment was announced, he said: \"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour. I know what it takes to succeed here, my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",

      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Jason Wilcox, director of football, said: “Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United. He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.”",

      "Tyrell Malacia is planning Manchester United talks with Michael Carrick(Image: (Photo by Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images))",
      "Tyrell Malacia is set for talks over his immediate future with Manchester United interim head coach Michael Carrick. The 26-year-old was part of the club's 'bomb squad' alongside Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, but those four all secured exits from Old Trafford over the summer.",
      "It was a permanent move to Chelsea for the latter with Antony re-joining Real Betis, Rashford signing for Barcelona on a season-long loan and Sancho making a temporary switch to Aston Villa. Malacia was primed for a deadline day move to Elche, but that collapsed at the eleventh hour.",
      "Despite being frozen and spending the following two months out of the team, the Dutchmen returned to the fold as an unused substitute for the 4-2 win over Brighton. He was named in the following six squads before coming on for the final two minutes against Newcastle United.",
      "Injured stars returning have resulted in him featuring for the under-21s and he scored in a 45-minute appearance for the developmental side against Wolves earlier this week. With his future unclear, Malacia is looking for clarity from Carrick before making a final decision, according to The Sun.",
      "He has entered the final few months of his contract at Old Trafford and as such, a winter window exit has not been ruled out. It has been claimed that there is interest in Malacia but none of those current options appeal to him.",
      "Michael Carrick is already set for talks over the future of one Manchester United player(Image: (Photo by Paul Harding/Getty Images))",
      "United are not expected to sanction any transfers this month but the return of three players over the coming days will feel like new signings.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Amad have already returned to training at Carrington after Cameroon and the Ivory Coast were eliminated from AFCON. Noussair Mazraoui is still at the tournament with Morocco, but will be back in England next week regardless of what happens in the remaining games.",
      "Harry Maguire joined Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo as recent returners from injury last weekend after a two-month absence, though Matthijs de Ligt is still unavailable.",
      "Carrick will certainly be boosted by the Dutchmen being the only senior United player out of action, but he faces a huge task after a challenging last few years.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt has missed the last few months with injury(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Despite that, the club's former midfielder, who managed Middlesbrough for three years, is excited by the task that awaits him and several other ex-United stars.",

      "“There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.”",
      "It has been confirmed that the 44-year-old will be joined in the dugout by former England assistant by Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Travis Binnion, Jonny Evans and Craig Mawson.",

      "Former Manchester United star Ryan Giggs has revealed he would like to see Kobbie Mainoo stay at the club as a deadline approaches for a decision on his future. The young midfielder had been widely linked to a number of clubs before Ruben Amorim was sacked earlier this month.",
      "Michael Carrick has now been placed in charge until the end of the season and quickly has the Manchester derby to take his attention. But little over two weeks are available to shape his squad and to ship out any unwanted players before the transfer deadline.",
      "Mainoo is set to remain at Old Trafford for the rest of the season, and was rejected the opportunity to move on loan earlier in the term, with Napoli interested. But come the summer, he will reach the final 12 months of his contract.",
      "Talks over an extension have stalled, and Mainoo remains one of the lowest-paid players in the squad, on a deal he signed way back in February 2023. Chelsea have even been said to be lurking.",
      "The 20-year-old has started just twice in 2025/26, and both have come with cup exits. Giggs reckons Mainoo must show patience.",
      "\"As a footballer, you want to play. But I would have more patience because he is only 20, and it is difficult to play centre midfield for Man United,\" Giggs told BetSelect.",
      "Michael Carrick is in charge of Kobbie Mainoo for now(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "\"It's like a striker. You don't see many really young strikers playing for Man United because it is difficult.",
      "\"But yeah, we all feel that he should be getting more minutes, but he needs to be patient.",
      "\"He's still young, he's still learning the game. And when he does get his chance, he needs to take it. So I’d like to see him stay.”",
      "It appears Carrick already has a vision for how to best use Mainoo. Speaking to Rio Ferdinand in September, Carrick said: \"He's more of an attacker.",
      "\"I don't see him as a holding midfielder. He's that line above where he needs a little bit more freedom.",
      "\"He can defend the higher line, but I think that bit deeper, around the centre-backs, that's a bit of a different thing completely. I see him playing that little bit higher and creating.",
      "\"I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, he just needs that patience and a little bit of a break again.\"",
      "Patience could yet be key as Mainoo seems likely to remain in competition with Bruno Fernandes unless Carrick opts to use the England international in a midfield pairing, while Fernandes becomes United's No.10.",

      "He has been able to welcome back Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo who returned from the Africa Cup of Nations shortly after Cameroon were knocked out by hosts Morocco and Ivory Coast were beaten by Egypt in the quarter-finals. Carrick was joined by his assistants Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, while first team coaches Jonny Evans, Travis Binnion and Craig Mawson also got involved.",

      "Having only recently lost to Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations, Bryan Mbeumo has wasted no time in getting back into training with United.",
      "Carrick was right in the middle of all the sessions, suggesting he will be looking at every small detail while he is in charge.",
      "Carrick's assistant Jonathan Woodgate was snapped talking to Senne Lammens, suggesting there could be more work with the ball required from the goalkeeper.",

      "Ex-England No.2 is Michael Carrick's new right-hand man at Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "If Michael Carrick represents a gamble for Manchester United, then Steve Holland is the banker. It is such a shrewd move on United’s part to bring on Holland because he represents the tried and trusted, experienced and highly-respected No.2 in Carrick’s new backroom team.",
      "Carrick is still relatively inexperienced as a manager and appointing Holland could genuinely give him a chance of passing this five-month audition to get the job on a permanent basis. Holland is the senior figure in Carrick’s backroom staff of Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans, former youth coach Travis Binnion and keeper coach Craig Mawson.",
      "There are obvious parallels because, just like former England boss Gareth Southgate, Carrick managed Middlesbrough and cut his teeth under a strong, supportive chairman Steve Gibson. Southgate always spoke about Holland as if he was an equal. He ran every big decision by him and even talked about having a lunch together to discuss whether to quit before the 2022 World Cup. They stayed on. They were a package because that was how much faith and store Southgate put in his No.2.",
      "Holland, 55, spent six years at Chelsea working under the likes of Jose Mourinho, Rafa Benitez, Antonio Conte and Guus Hiddink. His playing career was curtailed by injury and he immediately set his sights on coaching. He is regarded as someone with an eye for detail, a diligent planner and former Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas said he has a “meticulous coaching brain.”",
      "He is very happy to be in the background and out of the limelight. A brief spell in charge at Crewe ended amid mixed messages about his role and he had a stint as caretaker at Chelsea.",
      "But this is a man who has never courted the limelight or been particularly comfortable in it. He did not seem to enjoy the rare occasions when he had to do press conferences at Chelsea.",
      "Back in Covid times, scouts would often sit in random places in near-empty stadiums. Holland ended up a few seats away from me in my seat at an Arsenal game. I could tell he was not hugely impressed to look across and see me being the closest person sat to him in the stadium.",
      "Next time we saw each other there was a bit of small talk and he would pass the time of day if you saw him around an England camp. But generally there is this cliche about coaches being the conduit and the nice guy to the touch manager.",
      "Steve Holland speaks to Gareth Southgate during Euro 2024(Image: Getty Images)",
      "With Southgate and Holland, it was role reversal. Southgate was the likeable, friendly face whereas Holland was happy to be in the background. He is serious and intense.",
      "His reputation on the training ground is far more important, of course. Players talk about good, well-thought out sessions and he is strong on tactics and planning.",
      "He is fiercely secretive. He hates any details getting out and, for example, the theory was always he was more sensitive about the opposition having any clue about England’s tactics and the line-up than Southgate. But if you look at his CV, the managers he has worked under, this is a manager with a stellar reputation. He will bring gravitas to Carrick’s coaching staff.",
      "Younger managers often bring in older heads and this is a shrewd move by Carrick. He could not have done better than Holland.",
      "It is also a reason why, if things go well in the next few months, Carrick will feel as if he has a genuine chance of being a long term United option.",

      "Darren Fletcher deserves credit for his work at Manchester United last week(Image: )",
      "There was the slightest hint of a crack in Darren Fletcher's voice as he spoke for the final time as Manchester United's caretaker head coach. Although Fletcher had just revealed he had been told to report to Carrington on Monday morning, he would have known his time in the hot seat was up.",
      "You could see how much it had hurt him not to be able to deliver a victory. A Premier League draw with Burnley and an FA Cup defeat to Brighton was the kind of ending Fletcher didn't deserve, and it pained him to come to terms with that.",
      "\"I've given it my best, and ultimately, I'm disappointed to not be able to win a game or to get a result,\" he said. \"But I feel like there were some good things in there, created a lot of chances, shots, things like that.",
      "\"Ultimately, it wasn't enough. I am more disappointed than anybody really because I care for the club and I want the club to do well.\"",
      "Fletcher was spoken of as a candidate for the job until the end of the season and spoke to chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox at Carrington. However, he always knew this was a two-game deal and that the powerbrokers preferred experience to see them through until the end of the campaign.",
      "When Michael Carrick's appointment was confirmed, Fletcher was offered the chance to stay on the first-team staff but opted for a return to his role as head coach of the Under-18s. He has had a spell as technical director at Old Trafford and been on the coaching staff, but taking charge of the age-group side offers the chance to continue his development as a head coach.",
      "And whatever the results last week, he has shown enough around Carrington and within games to suggest that he has a bright future in that department and that he is someone United should look to nurture over the next few years. United officials were said to be impressed by the way he conducted himself and rate him very highly.",
      "Certainly, the performance against Burnley was encouraging. United had 30 shots and drew a game they should have won handsomely. It was one of the best attacking displays they have produced all season.",
      "Fletcher was disappointed not to get a win during his two games in charge(Image: )",
      "Fletcher certainly spoke like a United boss and he carried himself with class and dignity. He was open and engaging in his press conferences, particularly his first one, when he made all the right noises and said all the right things. That he had switched by Sunday night to delivering a slightly harsher critique of the players and demanding they now step up showed he got the tone right when required.",
      "One particularly memorable moment is the smile he flashed when told of comments he had made as a pundit in 2018, when Jose Mourinho was sacked and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brought in as a caretaker. Fletcher has said, \"They're almost writing off this season\". As the quotes were read back to him, he could see what was coming.",
      "“Good research, that! I was young and naive when I said that, wasn’t I?\" he joked.",
      "“That was my feeling at the time, and I was speaking in the context of probably being out of the game and not involved in it from the inside.\"",
      "Fletcher handled a potential grenade with warmth and humour, and it was diffused with relative ease. It was a far cry from the fireworks that often emanated from a Ruben Amorim press conference.",
      "But being sure-footed with the media and sounding like a United manager are irrelevant if you can't deliver. Strip away the results, and Fletcher's two dealings with United players marked out his ability as a man-manager.",
      "First of all, he took Benjamin Sesko aside at Carrington on his first day in the job. He had no prior relationship with the £73million summer signing and wanted to get to know him, but he was aware his confidence needed a lift as well after two goals in 17 games under Amorim.",
      "The Portuguese had been critical of Sesko at times and only days earlier had refuted a suggestion that his teammates needed to be better at finding his runs. Fletcher showed the 22-year-old videos of his movement and assured him the goals would come if that continues. He also contradicted Amorim and told the striker his teammates did have a responsibility to find him.",
      "Fletcher got a tune out of Sesko, who scored three goals in his two games in charge(Image: )",
      "It came together immediately at Turf Moor, when Sesko scored twice and could have had more. He scored again on Sunday and a return of 13 shots in two games showed Fletcher had got him back on track and Carrick will be grateful for that.",
      "Then there is Shea Lacey. Amorim had shown little desire to trust youth at Old Trafford, especially young attacking talents, and Lacey was restricted to six minutes off the bench despite being named as a substitute in eight games. In seven of them, he didn't get on, despite United chasing goals against Everton, West Ham, Wolves and Leeds.",
      "Fletcher used the 18-year-old twice, for six minutes at Turf Moor and then for 27 against Brighton. He showed trust in a player he clearly rates and the instructions he gave him against Burnley resulted in a dazzling cameo in which he was unlucky not to score.",
      "\"I said to him, stay wide and go and do what you do, and he did that,\" Fletcher said. \"I know he's gonna make an impact. I know he's creative. He's got goals in him. He's exciting, he's direct, he's fearless and he hit the crossbar and he had another shot so he had a really bright game.",
      "\"I'm pleased for him because there's a lot of injuries in recent years and he's not really got going with his momentum, but we know the talent that he's got, and he'll be a big part of Manchester United's future, I've no doubt it's about that.\"",
      "It was exactly what Lacey needed to hear after being underused by Amorim and the confidence boost did the trick. Those examples show that judging Fletcher just on the results last week doesn't tell us the full story.",

      "A new year but some very famliar faces at Manchester United. 13 days into 2026 and there have already been three different men at the helm of England's biggest club. Michael Carrick is the latest to occupy the Old Trafford hotseat, with former interim boss Darren Fletcher moving back to his role as Under-18 coach.",
      "Including interim bosses, seven different managerial appointments have been made at Old Trafford in little over four years, a list bookended by Carrick. There's every chance an eighth will be added come the summer, but for now it is Carrick who will have the chance to show his credentials.",
      "A manager sacked by Championship side Middlesbrough just seven months ago was always going to jump at the chance to manage United, but the fixture list has thrown up something of a hospital pass for Carrick. A Manchester derby followed by a trip to the league leaders leaves no time for him to settle in. United need a spark and with the halfway point of the Premier League season disappearing in the rear-view mirror they need one fast.",
      "But anyone looking for a crumb of comfort as United look to navigate their way through yet another period of crisis need only look at Carrick's previous spells as a manager.",
      "Solskjaer waved goodbye at Vicarage Road in November 2021, having won just 3 of his previous 11 games, yet Carrick's promotion to interim boss saw an immediate upturn in results with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal sandwiched by a creditable draw away at Chelsea. While it's a small sample size to work with, the way in which United's season unravelled under Ralf Rangnick and the turbulence prior to Carrick's appointment shines a light on the impressive work he did in such a short time.",
      "He enjoyed a similar new-manager bounce during his time at Middlesbrough. Defeat in his opening game was followed by a run of 15 wins from 19 league games, with relegation worries exchanged for promotion hopes in a matter of months.",
      "From a team that looked lost under Chris Wilder, suddenly Boro were on an upward trajectory. The atmosphere at the Riverside was electric and there was a real sense of unity between players and fans, something that had been missing for far too long. Middlesbrough's Chuba Akpom finished as top scorer in the division and was named Championship Player of the Season, with Boro finishing in fourth - not bad for a team embroiled in a relegation battle when Carrick arrived.",
      "Unfortunately for Carrick, he was unable to build on what had been a superb start to life at the Riverside. Defeat in the play-offs in 2022/23 was followed by near misses in the next two seasons, and it was clear the former midfielder had reached the end of the road on Teesside last summer.",
      "Opposition sides became wise to Boro's play, with no real urgency to their attack and a manager who struggled to impact matches with in-game changes.",
      "United fans may shudder reading that, given what went before Carrick, but the impact he made at Boro in such a short space of time cannot be ignored.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Man Utd mainly spent the money on improving their attack with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all signing for big fees.",

      "It has been revealed recently by widespread reports that the Red Devils are unlikely to sign a new midfielder in the January transfer window.",
      "But Spanish website Fichajes insists that Man Utd’s transfer plans have ‘taken an aggressive turn’ with news that they are ‘preparing a €100m (£87m) bid’ for Atletico Madrid’s Barrios in the summer.",
      "Man Utd ‘are desperately seeking to revamp their midfield in the upcoming summer transfer window’ and the Premier League giants ‘have identified the young Spaniard as the ideal playmaker for their new project’.",
      "The Man Utd hierarchy are convinced that Barrios ‘would bring the clarity and passing ability that the current squad urgently needs to generate attacking football’.",
      "On the potential signing of Barrios, the report adds: ‘The signing of the Spanish Under-21 international reflects a clear intention to rejuvenate the squad with technically gifted players hungry for continental glory. Manchester United doesn’t want to repeat past mistakes and prefers to invest in proven players from top-level leagues rather than unfinished prospects.",
      "‘Pablo Barrios fits this description of a versatile player who can operate both as a holding midfielder and an attacking midfielder, consistently making runs into the opposition’s penalty area.’",

      "Speaking in December, transfer insider Dean Jones insisted that Barrios was a player that he’d heard Man Utd “really like”.",

      "“I think the interest may have even come as a consequence of looking at Conor Gallagher. But, regardless of how they ended up watching him, he’s spoken about glowingly at a few clubs and United are one of them.",
      "“Gallagher has obviously been spoken about as a midfield option but Barrios would actually be a very good fit for what United want long term – and Amorim doesn’t just want a loan in midfield or to sign someone for the sake of it. He wants players that fit the longer vision.",
      "“Atleti won’t want to lose him because he has become very important in their midfield but I think there could be some potential for them to have a fight on their hands to keep Barrios across 2026.”",

      "Carrick is set to lead United on an interim basis for the rest of the season and faces a daunting task with City coming to Old Trafford in the early kick-of on Saturday.",
      "The former Middlesbrough boss is expected to start with a back four as Darren Fletcher did in his two games in (even more) interim charge, and former Red Devils defender Paul Parker expects Diogo Dalot and Luke Shaw – who look set to start as the full-backs – to struggle against City’s wingers.",
      "“Well, you don’t have to be an ex-full-back or an ex-defender. you can be the man on the street, and you know that the full-backs that United have got are going to struggle,” he told Metro via online casinos UK.",
      "“Dalot and Shaw are going to struggle pace-wise. And because there’s no, at this moment, out-and-out defender there, you know they’re going to get exposed in one-against-ones.",
      "“So that’s going to be a big, big problem for Michael Carrick, and generally what it would mean is that you would use one of your wider players to help by trying to help you by not allowing the ball to get to the feet of those players too far up the park.",
      "“When it gets close to the goal and then you’re a little bit more congested as a team, compact, then yes, you can understand it and that makes it easier because there’s more players around. But the last thing you want to be doing is getting caught too far up the park one-against-ones.",
      "“That’s going to be the problem because there’s going to be a lot of acres for people to run in behind. So it’s going to be a massive problem. I don’t know how Michael Carrick is going to deal with that.”",

      "It’s hard not to see bitterness underneath it. Keane had his chance in management and was exposed — Sunderland, Ipswich, end of story. The snarling, the shouting, the talk of standards never translated into building a team or managing people. Once that door closed, the managerial career ended and the pundit persona took over.",
      "Between them, they confuse volume with insight and contempt with intelligence. Lecturing from a safe distance is easy when you’re no longer accountable for results, selections, or decisions that actually matter.",
      "Dragging families into it isn’t “telling it like it is”. It’s lazy, snide, and beneath anyone who wants to be taken seriously. It’s what happens when the football content runs out and resentment fills the gap.",

      "It included a Brighton loan, 2 academy players, a free agent, a player who has been injured for 4 months and a goal keeper, £1.3 billion???? It’s a Private Equity business so the reality we are being driven on a model similar to Dortmund. Identify and purchase the best young talent, develop and sell. Next year we should see the arrival of Penders, Sarr, Quenda, Emegha, Barco, average age 20.7!!! The injury to Palmer may buy us an extra year with him, but Cucurella and Fernandez possibly off to City and PSG respectively.",
      "One other observation, although I’m banging on about Chelsea it looks like the majority of the PL is adopting this model. Look at the managers, apart from Guardiola, there is no super managers here. You may make a case for Emery and Arteta if he wins this year. But the rest are definitely potential only.",

      "Interesting to see Garey Vance bring up Wenger’s “daylight” offside proposal this morning. I’d coincidentally read a reference to it a couple of hours previously so it was fresh in the mind.",
      "So far as I can tell, the arguments for a (big) revision to the offside rule are that it will help to clarify the current VAR mess, and that there will be more goals if attackers have more leeway. In theory I suppose they’re both correct, but in practice would it really be the case?",
      "Taking the VAR angle first – the lines don’t go away if the point of intersection between onside/offside is moved. Instead of a toe ahead of the defensive line being the determinant as it is now, we’ll just see a toe intersecting with the last defender’s silhouette. We’ll still be at the mercy of the competence or otherwise of the same set of minions at the PGMOL.",
      "Maybe more important though is the knock-on effect of allowing attackers a generous margin for error when making their runs. Taken in isolation, it sounds great and should allow them to unpick defences with far higher regularity. More chances = more goals, better game to watch, everybody wins.",
      "But how will defenders react to having their margin of error narrowed dramatically? I can only think of one natural response, and that’s to close off the spaces in behind. Start with a line 10-15 yards deeper so they’re in a more secure position when possession turns over, and adopt a low block as a necessity when the opposition has sustained possession.",
      "Of course players will still manage to get in behind when an attack is quick enough or imaginative enough to pull that defence apart, but I’m not convinced that we’d necessarily have a flood of high-scoring games as a result of such a dramatic change to the rule.",
      "No issue with seeing this trialled at some level of the game, it would still be an interesting experiment. But does anyone else think that there should always be a place in the game for defending to be preserved as an art and an appropriate challenge to the attackers?",
      "Football is a low-scoring sport by nature, and that has never prevented it from becoming the most popular game in the world. It can definitely be improved, and VAR reform is definitely part of that. But there has to be a way to align it with the spirit of the game instead of looking to rewrite one of the core laws of the game, doesn’t there?\nKeith Reilly",

      "Wirtz was offside. It was obviously offside. He himself didn’t celebrate as he knew he was offside. The commentary team described it as offside. And both the ref, and the lino, flagged it as offside. Everyone in the ground was on the same page.",
      "However, after a delay, the goal was given.",
      "Not because VAR could prove the ref was wrong, but because they have declared that the technology is not good enough to accurately determine when exactly a ball is kicked, and so to that end being ‘forensic’ about lines on a screen is a faux science. There are therefore ‘thickening the lines’ of offside players to give the benefit of the doubt to the attacking side.",
      "So-as to be consistent with potential future cases which may require the benefit of the doubt, they granted an offside goal.",
      "It is, as far as I am aware, the first instance of VAR over-ruling a correct decision. Or at the very least, of VAR over-ruling an on field decision because the person in a booth could not confirm if the ref was correct.",
      "This breaks the game.",
      "And beyond that, the dangerous loon in a suit who created this law has said it should be ‘good news’ to fans as it rewards attacking play.

      "Rio Ferdinand insists Victor Osimhen would “100% come to Manchester United” if the Red Devils pushed for his signing.",
      "Osimhen has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford and the Premier League in general but signed a four-year deal with Galatasaray in the summer, making his loan move from Napoli permanent for £65m.",
      "He’s scored 49 goals in 57 games for the Turkish giants and has scored an abundance of goals wherever he’s been, in stark contrast to the goal-shy strikers at Manchester United in the last few years.",
      "Well aware of the quality of their asset, Galatasaray have slapped a €14om (£121m) price tag on Osimhen, which is surely beyond the reach of United, who signed Benjamin Sesko in the summer for £74m.",
      "But in conversation with Asamoah Gyan on the Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel, Ferdinand insisted that Osimhen would jump at the chance to play for United if they offered him the chance.",
      "“Victor Osimhen, he loves scoring goals, he plays with his heart, and gives everything. I’m surprised big clubs didn’t go for him in this transfer window. Hopefully, I’m feeling Manchester United too, only if he wants to come because of their history and everything,” Gyan said.",
      "Ferdinand then responded, “Osimhen will come to United, if United offer to take Osimhen, he would go, 100%.”",
      "“That is the type of striker we need right now, we have Mbeumo on the side doing what he needs to do,” Gyan then added in conclusion.",
      "Reports have suggested that caretaker boss Michael Carrick looked set to have to make do with what he already has available to him in the United squad, but it was claimed on Thursday that Director of Football Jason Wilcox is prepared to sign a new left winger to bolster his options.",

      "Amorim’s 3-4-3 system with inverted wide players means the current squad is short of out-and-out wingers.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are the only natural wide forwards in the squad and are both right-sided, with the lack of options on the left seen as a ‘major problem’ by Carrick, according to Football Insider.",
      "Matheus Cunha started on the left wing during Man United’s 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup, but is not seen as a long-term option in that position.",
      "Amorim held talks with Antoine Semenyo at the end of last month before he decided to join Manchester City in a £65m deal, and although the United chiefs aren’t willing to spend that money on an alternative, a short-term deal is now on the cards.",

It’s been made clear to me if there is a long-term target who United have had, who becomes available in January at the right price, they will make a move for him, but certainly the changing of the head coach will make no difference to the chase of new transfers.”",

      "After last weekend’s FA Cup action, with its exciting games and baffling refusal to have all of them feature a five-minute delay to check some blurry pictures for where somebody’s toenail might have been, we’re delighted to confirm it’s normal service resumed this weekend. The Barclays is back! VAR is back! What passes for a title race is back!",
      "There are some brilliant games this weekend, as well, and the big twist is the one we all want to watch while pointing and laughing – the most spectacularly beleaguered El Sackico imaginable between Spurs and West Ham – isn’t even on the TV.",

      "",
      "Can’t say fairer than a Manchester derby for a bit of Saturday lunchtime entertainment, can you?",
      "And let’s be honest, derby games are always most fun when both teams are in what is in modern football always for some reason now called a ‘bad moment’.",
      "Now there are levels to this game. City’s bad moment means winning their two most recent matches 10-1 and 2-0 after slipping off the title race pace with some annoying draws, while for United it means going out of a second domestic cup at the earliest opportunity to ensure this will be their shortest season in terms of matches played since 1915, when there was a literal world war happening.",
      "And also they’ve sacked the manager and replaced him with one of Fergie’s Boys, and then replaced that one of Fergie’s Boys with another one of Fergie’s Boys, who was most recently seen leaving Middlesbrough after not getting them promoted.",
      "So yeah, not quite the same thing. But it does all mean this is a game riddled with glorious uncertainty.",
      "For all the contrasts, both teams’ recent Premier League record is one of irritating draws. The key difference again there being that United’s recent run of irritating draws have been against three of the bottom five.",
      "Even if we accept that drawing at Leeds right now is a halfway acceptable result for anyone given their current resurgence, failing to beat both Burnley and Wolves having somehow managed to fall upwards into Champions League contention is immensely daft.",
      "Ifs and buts never got anyone anywhere, but if United had done everything else the same and just won those two games against the two worst teams in the league they would now be fourth.",
      "Instead they are seventh, with a rookie manager, and about to face City and Arsenal back to back with a retreat right back into the mid-table slop firmly on the cards. But it’s derby day, isn’t it? And you just never know on derby day.",
      "",
      "That’s now four games unbeaten for Wolves in all competitions. It’s not much, but when you consider the record-breaking appallingness of what had gone before, then it is definitely and absolutely something.",
      "Getting Shrewsbury in the cup helped on multiple levels, we fancy. One, a nice easy game to rack up some goals and boost confidence further, obviously, but also a reminder that however bad things might feel for you as a Premier League team – and things have felt really quite abysmally sh*t for Wolves this season – there is always somebody worse off than you. And a team currently hurtling towards double relegation to fall outside the Football League altogether for the first time since the 2003/04 season is certainly that.",
      "In the Premier League, it’s been a win and two draws in the last three for Wolves ahead of a clash with a Newcastle side that has shown the sheer awesome power of three straight wins in this compacted and congested league without ever really looking like they’ve actually compellingly resolved any of the issues that had them rotting in the bottom half to begin with.",
      "",
      "Funny old week at Aston Villa, who’ve spent it proving how much better they are than Tottenham on the field and how little that still means at transfer time. Losing out to Spurs for Conor Gallagher is no catastrophe in itself; he is a good footballer who would have been a useful squad player for Villa’s Champions League push but it is abundantly clear that Spurs’ need for midfield legs is far greater.",
      "It’s more irritating for what it represents; another reminder that PSR rules continue to limit Villa’s gravity-defying efforts just as much as being in Birmingham rather than London does. It’s not ‘unfair’ as many still insist, of course. A level playing field doesn’t mean letting every club spend the same amount of money; it means not letting any club spend more money than they actually have.",
      "But still. It’s annoying, isn’t it? And the financial tightrope Villa continue to walk has had further consequences this week with the departure of Donyell Malen. He’s precisely the sort of good-not-great squad player it can be surprisingly damaging to lose midway through a season going well.",
      "It can cause unexpected ripples and leave a hole where no hole existed before. It leaves a lot of responsibility now on the shoulders of Ollie Watkins, who is suddenly very short of back-up.",
      "Luckily his own form has significantly turned around, more than doubling his Premier League goal tally for the season with four in his last four games, but there is pressure now to continue that form.",
      "Sure, Tammy Abraham is set for a return to the club where he sparkled on loan in the Championship back in 2018/19. But that was a long time ago. He scored 17 Serie A goals for Roma in 21/22 but hasn’t managed more than eight in a league season since.",
      "There is new and significant weight on Watkins’ shoulders now.",
      "",

      "Having previously managed a star-studded Barcelona side and a PSG squad full of highly paid players, Enrique has proven he can handle egos.",
      "Alonso reportedly tried to change too much at Madrid, which annoyed several players, and club president Florentino Perez is keen to avoid a similar situation. It is believed Enrique is the ‘strong figure’ players like Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Junior need.",
      "The biggest issue is that Enrique ‘isn’t a beloved figure among Real Madrid fans’, having left the club for Barcelona in 1996. His relationship with the supporters was strained even further by his success as Blaugrana boss.",
      "If he does replace Alonso, winning games and trophies would win sceptical supporters back over.",
      "The report adds:",
      "The debate is open. From a sporting perspective, Luis Enrique would be one of the most qualified coaches for the challenge. From a social perspective, his appointment would be a bold, even unpopular, move. But the club has made similar decisions in the past when it deemed them necessary.",
      "Real Madrid needs a manager who commands respect from day one. Luis Enrique fits that profile, even if he isn’t the fans’ favorite. In a time of rebuilding, sporting logic can outweigh emotional appeals. That’s why, despite some reservations, Luis Enrique remains a real option to return Real Madrid to the top in La Liga and in Europe.",

      "He has shown an ability to adapt, moving from La Liga to international football and back into club management in a different country. He is clearly a world-class coach.",
      "United do not want a project manager; they want someone capable of restoring their glory days.",
      "The issue is that they do not currently have the players to support that ambition. Enrique’s teams have included Lionel Messi, Neymar, Andres Iniesta, and more recently Ousmane Dembele, Vitinha and Achraf Hakimi.",
      "United arguably have just one world-class player in Bruno Fernandes. The rest of the squad is not close to competing for the Premier League title, and it is even debatable whether they are good enough to finish in the top four.",

      "Manchester United may claim to be a little tied up right now while they faff about with managers. But even an ‘omnishambles of a club’ cannot let slide what seems to be unfolding around their best player in over a decade.",
      "Reports suggest Bruno Fernandes is looking to move on the summer. And United appear to be idling on as if that isn’t a massive f***ing problem.",
      "You wouldn’t blame Fernandes if he felt like a change of scene. Since he arrived at Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon in January 2020, just as the world was about to get very weird indeed as Covid took hold, the Portuguese playmaker has been the one (positive) constant United fans could cling to during an unsettling six years.",
      "Unfathomably, though, many still don’t recognise his genius. Sure, antipathy from outsiders is to be expected but even some who root for United have spent far too much of Fernandes’ time thinking that somehow he’s A Problem. When, in fact, he has been the single thing United haven’t had to fret over in the last half-dozen years.",
      "Even with one of the most creative forces of the Premier League era, United have still been tough to follow or fathom. It doesn’t bear thinking about how bad things would have been without Fernandes, last season especially, when he scored more goals and offered more assists than any team-mate in a side that finished 15th. Take Fernandes out of that sorry team, and only the wretchedness of the bottom three might have spared United from relegation.",
      "We can only hypothesise over that outcome, but we do know for a fact that Fernandes is one of the top 10 most creative players ever in the Premier League. This is the company he’s keeping…",
      "There are reams of stats to highlight Fernandes’ importance, in a wider Premier League and European context, but most startlingly, to United.",
      "In all but one of his full seasons at Old Trafford, he’s led the way for assists, usually by a long way. In the only season he was second for creativity, in 2020/21, he was United’s top scorer with 28 goals in all competitions, seven more than anyone else. During the darkness of last season, he scored eight more goals than any team-mate and created nine more, 19 of each in total. This term, from a deeper position that doesn’t play to his strengths, he’s had a hand in 14 goals – six more than any other United player.",
      "If his current form was out of the ordinary for Fernandes, it might be suggested that the captain is being fuelled by the ‘hurt’ he felt at United’s apparent willingness to sell him to Saudi last summer. That, above all of the other rotten decisions Ratcliffe, Wilcox and co. have made, would have been the worst of their calamities.",
      "And even a year later, it seems a prospect too stupid even for this leadership group. But you just know that if Fernandes decides he wants a different environment, something perhaps bordering on functional, United would only look at the fee being banked rather than the cost of losing the skipper.",
      "As has already been highlighted, his form is hardly diminishing, and his reliability has never been an issue. Actually, he has showed superhuman levels of robustness, missing three games in nearly six years to injury or illness prior to his recent hamstring injury. From which he recovered in double-quick time.",
      "Fernandes is 31. He’ll be 32 in September. On a spreadsheet, that might be a red flag to any of Ratcliffe’s bean-counters but the Portugal star is far from finished. It’s weird that it even needs to be pointed out. Yet seemingly it does to those at Old Trafford who really should know their skipper better by now.",
      "No wonder Fernandes feels affronted. Not only by how dispensable he is viewed at United, but by the assumption that he will be off to Saudi. Sure, the sheikhs will be queueing up, but so too will be big hitters across Europe. And if the likes Bayern Munich are eager to take him, that in itself ought to prompt someone – anyone – at Old Trafford to suspect that they might be missing the bleedin’ obvious.",
      "MORE: Ian Wright would take Bruno Fernandes at Arsenal ‘tomorrow’",
      "Fernandes’ will, seemingly, is the only reason he remains at United. As he said just last month: “I decided not to go, not only for family reasons but because I genuinely love the club.” But you can push anyone only so far.",
      "Wilcox and Ratcliffe ought to be love-bombing Fernandes, or at the very least, making him feel the appreciation that was sorely lacking in the summer. Because hiring a new head coach, especially one of the calibre required, will be even more difficult when candidates learn that the one and only player five of his predecessors have all been able to rely on is being discarded for no good reason.",
      "United are already facing a summer in which they need a new manager and at least one new midfielder. Perhaps the board will surprise us all in those processes. But finding a new Bruno, replacing his attacking contribution amid the other upheaval, is almost certainly beyond them.",
      "Roy Keane having a pop at Michael Carrick’s wife only exposed his ‘bitterness’ and laziness, with fellow failed manager Gary Neville just ‘nodding along’.",
      "El Sackico may scandalously be hidden beneath the 3pm Blackout, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t still all sorts of good stuff to watch.",
      "Jurgen Klopp has been very clear about the chances of him returning to day-to-day football management; for the first time, we doubt him.",
      "Arsenal have a couple of representatives a good five decades or so apart in an England D-Team which also has a heavy Spurs influence.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have received a ‘substantial offer’ for Bruno Fernandes worth around £86m as he looks increasingly likely to leave.",
      "William Saliba is sick and ‘tired’ of having ‘nothing in my pockets’, with the Frenchman among nine Arsenal and Manchester City players eyeing a Quadruple."

      "A new report has explained why Manchester United are ‘growing increasingly confident’ regarding their chances of signing Brighton star Carlos Baleba.",
      "In the summer, Man Utd made an audacious attempt to sign Baleba from Brighton, but they were priced out of a move for the young centre-midfielder.",
      "Baleba has established himself as one of the best young midfielders in Europe over the past couple of seasons and he has been mooted as a potential long-term replacement for Casemiro.",
      "However, after Man Utd spent around £230m on signings and failed to offload Bruno Fernandes, they had little funds remaining to invest on a new midfielder and they certainly could not afford a deal for Baleba, which would have cost around £100m.",
      "Therefore, Man Utd have kicked their midfield issues down the road until this year and a significant overhaul is expected in this department in the coming months.",
      "READ: Man Utd boss Carrick handed ‘£20m transfer boost’ after dramatic ‘DAWN RAID’",
      "Recent reports have indicated that Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo and/or Bruno Fernandes could leave, while Baleba remains ont the radar with several other targets, including Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton.",
      "Regarding Baleba, a new report from The Sun claims the Red Devils are ‘growing increasingly confident of securing him’ this year as they ‘plan to resurrect’ their midfield.",
      "The report claims: ‘According to well-placed sources, United are becoming more optimistic about prising Baleba away from the Amex in the summer.",
      "‘The 22-year-old central midfielder is tied to Brighton until 2028 but his stock has dropped since United’s interest surfaced last year.’",
      "They claim that the Red Devils have ‘made a January transfer decision’ as ‘they are not expected to deviate from their January transfer window plan following Michael Carrick’s appointment as head coach’.",
      "Regarding the two reasons for this stance, the report explains: ‘Carrick returned to United this week to oversee the remainder of the season, and there has been speculation that he could be backed with new additions. It’s understood, however, that United are unlikely to make any signings in January because they are focused on long-term planning and their targets are not available in the winter window.",
      "‘United committed an outlay of £215million (excluding add-ons) to sign Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in the summer window, which the club views as the preferred time to land their top targets for value-for-money transfer fees.’",
      "Would ‘main target’ Luis Enrique say yes to Manchester United? Probably not, but this could be the XI he would pick if he did replace Michael Carrick…",
      "After Antoine Semenyo, Manchester City’s latest ‘hijack’ on Manchester United leaves INEOS with the lesser of two £100m signings…",
      "Oliver Glasner is the ‘top candidate’ to be Manchester United’s next permanent head coach, with this the XI we think he would select if he’s appointed…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United could still offload Manuel Ugarte this month, while they have been ‘set a price’ for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba.",

      "United‘s dire decline under Amorim and the head coach’s fractured relationship with club chiefs made his position untenable, with the Premier League giants opting to appoint an interim before bringing in a new permanent manager in the summer.",
      "More tempting candidates will be available in the summer due to expiring contracts and the upcoming World Cup, but Man Utd cannot afford to get this appointment wrong.",
      "The Red Devils also cannot fall into the trap of keeping Carrick beyond this season if he does well. Neville does not think this can be given “any consideration”.",

      "“But there cannot be any consideration that Michael takes the job beyond the end of this season, for the sake of Michael and the club, even if he wins every single game.”",
      "Neville went on to name four “standout” contenders to replace Carrick, explaining why these bosses need to tick six boxes.",
      "“Manchester United have tried everything when it comes to appointing a manager, absolutely everything,” Neville added.",
      "“They just have to try to remove risks now. Who can handle the media? Who can sort the dressing room out? Who can handle the owners? Who plays a style of football that fans will at least enjoy watching? Who has Champions League experience? Who has big‑game experience?",
      "“The three that standout are Tuchel, Ancelotti and Pochettino. They could all be available after the World Cup. Eddie Howe – who has won a trophy, finished in the top four, and managed a big club in Newcastle – is another.",
      "“To make United an attractive club for players, Tuchel and Ancelotti bring a seriousness to matters. If you appoint a younger manager, United will miss out on players.",
      "“United are going to miss out on a lot of players anyway, but someone like Ancelotti would encourage players to come. They need that right now, because I’m not sure players are queuing up to join unless there is someone to believe in.”"

      "Roy Keane has ripped into Manchester United over their new coaching setup as the legendary captain engaged in a tense discussion with Gary Neville.",
      "Michael Carrick will lead United on an interim basis for the rest of the season having replaced Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford and has chosen former England assistant Steve Holland, Carrick’s ex-Middlesbrough No 2 Jonathan Woodgate, retired defender Jonny Evans and Under-21s boss Travis Binnion to join him on his staff.",
      "Keane is far from impressed by the quartet chosen by Carrick to aid him at United, rejecting the suggestion that Holland’s experience makes him some kind of “guru” and questioning how Jonny Evans has been handed such a significant role having left his post as loans and pathways manager at United in December.",
      "Speaking on the latest episode of the Stick to Football podcast, Neville said: “Steve Holland, I’m not saying it’s going to bring success, but he is a serious operator. I think it’s made Carrick’s staff better.",
      "Keane was quick to follow up, asking: “What about the other coaches he’s brought in?",
      "“The other two look like people he’s sort of relied upon. I don’t know I’ve never seen the other two coach,” Neville admitted.",
      "Keane went on: “He’s on the beach two weeks ago Jonny Evans. Jonny Evans leaves Man United four or five weeks ago as a loans manager and then Darren Fletcher gives him a job, strangely enough gives him a job.",
      "“He has two games, Fletch goes and Carrick gives him a job, great isn’t it. We should all go to Barbados for a week.",
      "“You’re on about getting your coaching staff in, you’re praising one of them saying he’s experienced and then we just let the other two go, Jonathan Woodgate and Jonny Evans. What has Jonny Evans done to be a coach of Man United’s first team?",
      "“He left the job four weeks ago – loans manager and ironically comes back working with the first team. That’s a big step up isn’t it?”",
      "Neville then tried to clarify his point, adding: “When Michael gets announced I think, “okay he’s going to come under a lot of pressure, needs to make sure his information on the training pitch is s*** hot”. If he’d have just brought in Woodgate and Evans that would have made his job a lot harder I think.",
      "Keane then wanted to drill down on Holland becoming the assistant manager.",
      "He said: “Going back to what I said earlier, with Steve Holland, you think what United need at this moment in time, is it just about coaching then?",
      "Neville replied: “My point is, if Steve Holland is on the training pitch at least you know they’re going to get top class training sessions. I’m not saying they weren’t before because they probably were as well. I don’t know what Evans or Woodgate are like as coaches, don’t know what Carrick is like as a coach.",
      "“My point is he has a lot of experience, are you against the appointment of Steve Holland?”",
      "Keane thought Neville was deliberately ignoring the counter point to his experience argument about Holland but failing to point out the lack of top level coaching in the rest of Carrick’s staff.",
      "“On one hand you’re sitting here going, ‘I’m so happy they brought Steve Holland in’, but they brought another two staff in who you’re dismissing as ‘I’m not really bothered about them,'” he said.",
      "“I wish we were sitting here with you saying he’s brought three staff in and they’re all brilliant, so we think Steve Holland is the man now?”",
      "“I think he’s got a lot of experience, a good coach,” Neville reasoned.",
      "Keane was quick to point out that experience does not guarantee coaching success and gave examples of previous staff members in the post-Ferguson era who did not work out.",
      "“Steve McCLaren was experienced, Mike Phelan was experienced, these are all guys over the last few years,” he added.",

      "Manchester United chef Jason Wilcox is now ‘accelerating plans’ to sign a new left winger after talks with caretaker manager Michael Carrick this week.",
      "Carrick will lead United on an interim basis until the end of the season after Ruben Amorim was given his marching orders earlier this month having fallen out with the Red Devils hierarchy.",
      "Reports have suggested that Carrick looked set to have to make do with what he already has available to him in the United squad, but it’s now been claimed Director of Football Wilcox is prepared to sign a new left winger to bolster his options.",
      "Amorim’s 3-4-3 system with inverted wide players means the current squad is short of out-and-out wingers.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo are the only natural wide forwards in the squad and are both right-sided, with the lack of options on the left seen as a ‘major problem’ by Carrick, according to Football Insider.",
      "Matheus Cunha started on the left wing during Man United’s 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup, but is not seen as a long-term option in that position.",
      "Amorim held talks with Antoine Semenyo at the end of last month before he decided to join Manchester City in a £65m deal, and although the United chiefs aren’t willing to spend that money on an alternative, a short-term deal is now on the cards.",
      "The report states:",

      "It was claimed earlier this month that United had ‘tabled an offer’ for 19-year-old RB Leipzig star Yan Diomande, who’s got seven goals and four assists in all competitions this season.",
      "But the report from CaughtOffside explained why a January move is unlikely as RB Leipzig insist on receiving 100 million euros (£86m) for their prized asset.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘Sources have informed CaughtOffside that Liverpool, Manchester City, and Tottenham from the Premier League, Bayern Munich in Germany, PSG in France and Barcelona in Spain are all “closely monitoring” the player. The market mood points to “summer, not January,” with Leipzig expected to keep the door shut until bids near the €100m mark arrive later in the year.",
      "‘United have already moved forward, with reports suggesting talks over a five‑plus‑one‑year deal worth around €3.5m per season. Leipzig have allowed discussions despite their stance against a January sale. Still, the picture is clear: unless a huge bid lands now, Diomande’s future battle will be fought in the summer among Europe’s biggest clubs.’",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was left ‘baffled’ at one point in the Manchester United manager race which ‘hands-on’ Michael Carrick won despite a media ‘campaign’.",
      "There is, to nobody’s great surprise, a lot of nonsense about Michael Carrick’s first day in his new job as Manchester United interim manager.",
      "We now know that Michael Carrick is likely to be named interim Manchester United manager this week. But who will be in charge at the start of the 2026/27 season?"

      "Former Manchester United defender Gary Pallister has hit back at Roy Keane after his former team-mate accused the club’s legendary manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, of having a damaging influence at the club since he stepped down in 2013.",
      "Pallister’s move to United set a British transfer record fee for a defender when he signed for £2.3m in August 1989, with the Old Trafford club then paying a British record transfer fee to sign Keane from Nottingham Forest in the summer of 1993.",
      "The duo went on to play a part in three Premier League title successes under Ferguson, including a league and FA Cup double in their first season together at United.",
      "Yet Keane famously fell out with Ferguson when he left the club in acrimonious circumstances in November 2005, with his animosity towards his former manager barely waning more than two decades later.",
      "Even though Ferguson stepped down as United manager in 2013, Keane suggested his input behind the scenes at the club remains strong, as he hinted the Scot is still influential in the hiring and firing of managers.",
      "READ: Carrick beats ‘baffled’ Solskjaer: The inside story of the Manchester United inside stories, including Van Gaal plan",
      "“What happens in the interview that they sit there and go, and 12, 14 months later, ‘he’s not the guy for us’. Do you not suss that out when you speak to them?",
      "“You see who’s making the decisions at Man United… you still have [Alex] Ferguson and David Gill [former chief executive] hanging around like a bad smell.”",
      "Those comments predictably created a stir, with Pallister suggesting Keane was wrong to reopen his feud with Ferguson, as he encouraged new United interim manager Michael Carrick to seek out the advice of his former manager after taking on the role at Old Trafford after the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "“I wouldn’t agree with Roy. I think those comments have more to do with the relationship between the two of them,” Pallister told Football365 with Spreadex Sports.",
      "“We know there is no love lost there. There is not going to be any bouquets being exchanged between those two [Ferguson and Keane].",
      "“He also had a little go at David Gill as well, but David was a consummate professional and a great guy to work with.",
      "“Listen, you expect Roy to be controversial and he doesn’t disappoint, but I’m sure Michael Carrick will speak to Sir Alex about the job he has taken on and he would be mad not to.",
      "“I always remember sitting down and chatting to Sir Alex about his difficult times and that was just after I arrived at the club and the banners were there saying, ‘Enough is Enough’ and ‘Fergie Out’.",
      "“He was chatting about that period and told me how good it was for him to be able to go and talk to Sir Matt, who still had an office at Old Trafford",
      "“Sir Alex said speaking to the club’s greatest manager at the time was invaluable and why wouldn’t you lean on all of those years of experience? Especially with someone who has been manager at Manchester United. It’s a difficult place to manage because the expectation is huge.”",
      "Pallister went on to give his verdict on Amorim’s exit, as he suggested the Portuguese tactician appeared to throw in the towel when he knew the axe was about to fall after a fall-out with Sporting Director Jason Wilcox.",
      "“When you hear the explosion he had at his last press conference, it was probably a build up and when you hear him talk the way he was talking, maybe he’d had enough,” he added.",
      "“You read in the papers that the decision had been made the day before and he might have got wind of it and aired his grievances.",
      "“In the end, you have got to base it on results and his winning ratio wasn’t great and even though he was given the backing of the club, results speak louder than words.",
      "“It was better than last year, but did we have any real confidence of getting into the Champions League slots? I don’t think so.",
      "“What was damning in the end was the Newcastle game. We went to four at the back, we got a result and while you can say Newcastle deserved something from that game, we all waited to see what would happen next.",
      "“Then he went to five at the back for the Wolves and people were asking why he went for that when statistically, they were playing one of the worst teams in the history of the Premier League. It didn’t make sense.",
      "“Ultimately, we didn’t do great against Wolves and if you are Jason Wilcox, maybe it is your job to ask questions.",
      "“The manager didn’t like being asked and I kind of get that as well because he has to be allowed to pick the players and pick the team.",
      "“I don’t really understand what the job of the Sporting Directors is these days, but I thought they were there to help the manager, take some weight off his shoulders.",
      "“If a Sporting Director is choosing players and deciding the team and its style of play, then might as well be the manager or Head Coach.”",
      "Roy Keane having a pop at Michael Carrick’s wife only exposed his ‘bitterness’ and laziness, with fellow failed manager Gary Neville just ‘nodding along’.",
      "Ruben Amorim put forward the names of two Premier League strikers as he looked for Man Utd to sign more attackers in the January transfer window.",

      "“What I saw in both of the games [under Darren Fletcher], there’s gaps all over the place and opposition will exploit that. He has to come in, especially in the games against City and Arsenal coming up, and make sure that’s sorted.",

      "Thursday 15 January 2026 16:33, UK",
      "I've had the pleasure of spending a bit of time with Michael Carrick in the last few months at two different charity events, the last being his own foundation's boot collection at Macclesfield FC recently.",
      "As I spoke to him off camera, I was left in awe.",
      "We were in a room with former Rochdale player Luke Matheson, who scored against Manchester United at the age of 16 in the Carabao Cup in 2019.",
      "Carrick, who was part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's backroom staff at the time, remembered every moment of the game while talking to Matheson - whether it was details of the match or Rochdale's coaching staff and where they are now.",
      "One observation I have through my limited interactions with Carrick over these last few months is that he absolutely understands the significance of not just Manchester United, but how important football is as a tool to impact the community in various positive ways.",
      "As he repeatedly said in his first interview with the club, 'I am one of them,' he said when referring to the fan base at Old Trafford.",
      "You may ask, why is this important?",
      "Carrick takes over a club that seems to be at an all-time low. Not just in terms of results and missed opportunities this season, but in terms of morale and confidence - whether that is the players or the Old Trafford attendees.",
      "Being at Old Trafford after the 2-1 FA Cup defeat to Brighton, it was not about the performance or even about the result - it was more about what the loss meant in the grand context of where Manchester United are at.",
      "Call it a climax of sustained mismanagement or a rude-awakening of years of decline, facts are facts: this United team have reached record-low numbers - whether it is the first time they've been knocked out of both cups in the first round since 1982 or having their lowest games in a season in over 110 years.",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford was telling as well.",
      "A crowd who have remained as patient as possible, who have repeatedly been praised for that same trait, are losing faith with the team that is in front of them.",
      "It was telling after 14 months of Ruben Amorim (mostly) defending his players to the media and trying to protect them from the noise, Darren Fletcher had a different message to send after their FA Cup exit.",
      "In his last news conference as interim, Fletcher repeated that the responsibility has to be on the players in the squad to step up and change the fortunes at the club. He even sounded emotional towards the end. A man who has seen the highest of the highs at the club gave the impression he was left more than unimpressed by what he had seen.",
      "And that makes you wonder what Carrick's new backroom staff, which includes the likes of Steve Holland and Jonathan Woodgate, will find as they take training for the first time this week.",
      "Will it be a team still reeling from Amorim's sacking, which happened just a couple of weeks ago?",
      "Amorim made it clear he had to essentially babysit the players at Carrington and they were not capable of carrying on through training sessions without him. I am not sure that was truly the case but it is easy to forget some, if not much of this squad, has now had five different voices coach and lead them since the start of last season.",
      "The team need consistency, time and more importantly - someone who can lead them.",
      "Whether we will see a repeat of the sad period that former caretaker Ralf Rangnick led or a resurgence which Carrick's competition for the role, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, led during his interim stint... well, that is what will make United an intriguing story for the rest of the season.",
      "The good news for Carrick and United fans alike is he'll have much needed fire-power back in his squad for when they take on Manchester City this weekend, with Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo having returned from AFCON.",
      "As they have shown in recent years, once again this season, this team have seemingly performed better against 'bigger' opposition this season and have notched impressive wins against Liverpool and Newcastle United for example.",
      "And who knows, maybe City will be the right type of opposition at the right time for this team.",
      "They have shown in draws against Wolves, West Ham and Burnley in the last month just how much they struggle to break down teams, especially when they sit in a low-to-mid block and that is the last thing you would expect to see from a City team who feel like the entertainers of the league at this present time.",
      "We know United entertained two former players in Carrick and Solskjaer in this process, but it is important to point out the hierarchy - including director of football Jason Wilcox and CEO Omar Berrada - would argue they were not looking to capitalise on nostalgia.",
      "Instead they wanted an appointment who understood the club and could immediately hit the ground running, while also working in the current and relatively new leadership structure implemented at the club.",
      "Carrick certainly does have the above. He spent 12 years at the club as a player while also working under Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer during his last stint at the club as a coach.",
      "A balanced and determined individual who has grown from his last time at Old Trafford, it will be especially intriguing to see how Carrick develops the playing style he implemented at Middlesbrough. His 4-2-3-1 out of possession would morph into something more similar to a 3-2-5 when his side attacked, but his team perhaps lacked the firepower and flair required to maximise that type of system.",
      "Whether this United are capable of showing the fight and passion to rescue their season remains to be seen, but Carrick's calm and collected approach feels the right type of character required at a time this team could not be lower on confidence and form.",
      "But it almost feels pointless looking too closely at his stint at Middlesbrough. He would himself admit how much he learned from his first permanent managerial position in football and has wisely stayed out of other positions to digest the two and a half years he had at his previous club.",
      "Solskjaer felt like the right person to manage the club when he rejoined at the end of 2019. He gave United the lift they needed after the end of the Jose Mourinho era.",
      "Although he was sacked in November 2021 after a turbulent run of performances and results, he had an incredibly moving exit interview that was published by the club where he was practically in tears saying goodbye.",
      "There were undeniable highs from Solskjaer's reign and perhaps if history had been tweaked - the Europa League final springs to mind - maybe we would frame his managerial pedigree in a different way with a European trophy to his name.",
      "But do sequels often work, even if it is a temporary one?",
      "Solskjaer's return would have been a popular one. There is no doubting his connection and relationship to the club and its supporters but there would have been fair questions targeted at the hierarchy.",
      "Since INEOS' investment, they have attempted to modernise the club as much as they have felt is possible.",
      "A revamped and improved training ground; a more data-led approach for recruitment and analysis; a drive to become best in class in several departments.",
      "Going back to an appointment who worked under the previous regime led by Ed Woodward does not quite feel connected to the previous points mentioned.",
      "Unfortunately for the Norwegian, we cannot forget history. We have to remember how Solskjaer's reign ended in a chaotic, sad fashion.",
      "His final five matches at the club included a crushing 5-0 defeat at home to Liverpool, an incredibly one-sided 2-0 loss to Manchester City and a 4-1 loss to Watford at Vicarage Road.",
      "Context is required too. Perhaps what pulls at United fans' heartstrings is that, after finishing second in his second full season in charge, there is an argument the carpet was pulled under him rather than letting him develop his system and style of play.",
      "In the summer of 2021, when United should have reinforced in midfield and a youthful long-term striker, the club re-signed a 36-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo and added Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.",
      "Ronaldo compromised the counter-attacking style of football Solskjaer had tried to implement, while Sancho never found a home in the team.",
      "So maybe Solskjaer does deserve a reprieve for how his managerial era at the club ended, but perhaps he needs to rebuild his career elsewhere before a return to Old Trafford in the future.",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend and tips Manchester City to win a thrilling Manchester derby.",
      "Pep Guardiola is enjoying playing with his shiny new toy.",
      "Antonie Semenyo has hit the ground running at Manchester City and his anytime goalscorer angle for this Manchester derby at 15/8 with Sky Bet really appeals.",
      "What really stood out in the win at Newcastle was how different Semenyo makes this Manchester City attack look. City have brilliance, control and structure coming out of their ears but what they don't always have is raw, aggressive directness. Semenyo brings that in bucketloads.",
      "Defenders are obsessed with Erling Haaland - that is only going to help Semenyo. It creates pockets of space and Semenyo is clever enough and aggressive enough to exploit them. Whether he's starting wide left, drifting inside from the right or ghosting in around Haaland, he's constantly sniffing danger rather than waiting for it.",
      "And, for whatever reason, space seems to open up for him against Manchester United and he revels in it. Semenyo has scored in his last three appearances against United, including that bonkers 4-4 draw at Old Trafford earlier this season.",
      "Brentford rocking up at Stamford Bridge doesn't feel like a mismatch anymore - in fact, it's becoming a fixture they quietly look forward to. They've lost just once in their last eight visits across west London and that tells you everything about the mentality of this team. There is no fear.",
      "And right now, they are absolutely humming.",
      "Brentford are in the middle of their best unbeaten Premier League run of the season - six games without defeat, winning four of the last five. And since December 14, no Premier League team has picked up more points than the Bees (14). They are 11/10 with Sky Bet on the double chance.",
      "Leeds are a great watch and their games are quite chaotic by design. They play on the edge, get in your face and they ask questions of the opposition, but they also invite pressure. Across their last 18 fixtures their games are averaging 3.5 goals and they've kept just one clean sheet in that period.",
      "Fulham arrive as the perfect dance partner to punt on goals with over 2.5 looking very generous at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "They've scored in their last 12 matches across all competitions, showing a level of attacking consistency that travels well. Marco Silva's side don't need huge dominance to find the net either - they're sharp in transition, clever in the half-spaces and dangerous from wide areas.",
      "Arne Slot's Liverpool are beginning to look like a serious team again.",
      "The big shift has come in their structure in defence. Slot has clearly prioritised control without the ball, giving Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate proper protection in front of them rather than leaving them exposed, which in turn has cut out the silly errors costing them goals.",
      "Across their last eight games, Liverpool have conceded just five goals. That's not smoke and mirrors either. The expected goals against data backs it up nicely at 0.8 per 90, pointing to a side that is limiting high-quality chances rather than relying on last-ditch defending or goalkeeping heroics.",
      "When you combine Liverpool's improved defensive process with Burnley's limited attacking threat, Liverpool to win to nil shapes up as a shrewd play at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "Crystal Palace arrive off the back of that damaging FA Cup exit, knocked out in the third round by non-league Macclesfield. The instinctive reaction is to expect a fierce response. But history strongly pushes back against that idea.",
      "Looking at the last 13 Premier League teams dumped out by League One opposition or below at that stage, the next-game record reads poorly: three wins, four draws and six defeats. And even those three wins were by the bare minimum - a single-goal margin. There's no evidence of a bounce-back surge. If anything, the hangover lingers.",
      "Sunderland remain unbeaten at home this season - a run built on energy, structure and a crowd that turns the Stadium of Light into a very uncomfortable place to visit. They look a great price on the draw no bet at 10/11 with Sky Bet.",
      "Jarrod Bowen and Crysencio Summerville are the livewires for West Ham. Stop them, and you largely stop West Ham.",
      "The problem for the visitors is that they're running into a Tottenham side specifically designed to take that weapon away.",
      "One of the defining traits of Thomas Frank's Spurs is how well they manage transition moments. They don't allow games to become stretched, they recover their shape quickly and they suffocate counter-attacks before they ever get going. That's backed up by the numbers.",
      "Across the season, Spurs have conceded the second-fewest fast breaks in the league (11) - and crucially, they haven't conceded a single goal from a fast break.",
      "There's also a very strong angle under Frank in that nine of his 10 wins as Spurs boss have come to nil. When Tottenham win, they don't just win, they shut the door. It's 2/1 with Sky Bet to land again.",
      "Gabriel Magalhaes is quietly becoming a magnet for fouls. Not because he's theatrical, but because of how Arsenal use him. He steps in aggressively during build-up, carries the ball forward into pressure and is constantly involved in physical duels at set pieces. That combination naturally invites contact and referees have been happy to blow the whistle.",
      "The recent numbers underline that trend. Gabriel has been fouled at least once in nine of his last 10 starts, averaging 1.53 fouls drawn per 90. That's a healthy baseline for a centre-back, and it puts the 2+ fouls line well within reach in the right type of game at 11/4 with Sky Bet. Here, he's coming up against Igor Jesus.",
      "The Forest striker is aggressive, raw and still learning when to step in and when to back off. He's committed 22 fouls across his recent matches.",
      "Wolves have quietly become a very difficult team to score against. The standout trend in their recent performances is defensive improvement, and it's backed up by serious underlying numbers.",
      "Across their last six games, only Arsenal can better Wolves' expected goals against process of 0.99 per 90. That's elite territory. Wolves have faced Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United in that spell. So while the sample size is small, the quality of opposition gives those numbers real credibility.",
      "We know Newcastle are a very different proposition away from St James' Park - and it's the attacking drop-off that's most striking. In their last 17 Premier League away games, they've scored more than 1.5 goals just three times.",
      "On average, Newcastle are managing just 1.2 goals per away game in that run, struggling to generate sustained pressure or high-quality chances on their travels. The 6/5 with Sky Bet on them scoring under 1.5 goals again on the road looks a winner in waiting.",
      "David Moyes' record away from home against top-level opposition is horrendous.",
      "Going all the way back to his West Ham days, his record away at Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City reads 20 losses from 21 games. It's a brutal return.",
      "Those games tend to follow the same script too: sit deep, limit damage, slow the tempo and hope to stay in the contest for as long as possible. Now, this fixture doesn't technically fall into that bracket - but at what point do we start calling Aston Villa an elite home side?",
      "Villa Park has become a fortress. They've won their last 11 home games, a run that includes statement victories over Arsenal and Manchester City. The intensity, structure and belief Unai Emery has created there is right up there with the very best in the league.",
      "Moyes' away games are rarely chaotic though. Since returning to Everton, just two of his 20 away matches have gone over 3.5 goals, with the average sitting at just 1.8 goals per 90. That's why combining a Villa win and under 3.5 goals makes sense at 11/10 with Sky Bet.",
      "Bournemouth's away games this season are bonkers. They're averaging 4.8 goals per game on the road. Nope, not a typo. Yes, almost five goals per game.",
      "The markets are fully aligned for goals in this one though, which naturally pushes us toward the anytime goalscorer angle.",
      "And who better to target than Kaoru Mitoma? The Japanese winger is starting to look like his old sparky, nightmare-for-defenders self. His movement, bursts in behind and instinct for goal are all back in evidence - as shown by his goal vs Manchester City.",
      "History gives us even more confidence. Mitoma has scored five goals in his last six games against Bournemouth - that bit of a psychological edge over the opposition isn't factored into the prices at 5/2 with Sky Bet.",

      "Gary Neville says Michael Carrick must not be Manchester United manager at the start of next season, and has offered his three-man shortlist he would like installed instead.",
      "Carrick succeeded Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford on Tuesday and has been tasked with leading the club - where he won five Premier League titles as a player - to European qualification before the season ends.",
      "Neville wished his former team‑mate well but warned any new‑manager bounce under Carrick, however transformative, should not be viewed as a long‑term solution.",

      "💥 Semenyo's instant impact at Man City🔴 Attack best form of defence for Carrick📈 Fernandes' return to No 10 role🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Antoine Semenyo has only been a Manchester City player for a week following his £64m arrival from Bournemouth but he has wasted no time in showing just how much he has to offer his new side.",
      "After starting on the left flank and scoring with his right foot in his first game against Exeter, he started on the right flank and scored with his left foot in his second against Newcastle.",
      "One goal came from a run in behind, the other from a back-post tap-in. There was even a demonstration of his set-piece threat with his ludicrously ruled-out second goal on Tuesday night.",
      "He has arrived at the Etihad Stadium with a total of 10 goals in 20 Premier League games which puts him behind only Igor Thiago and his new team-mate Erling Haaland this season. The 26-year-old ranks similarly highly for shots and shots on target.",
      "The hope for Manchester City is that he will ease the scoring burden on Haaland, who has scored a higher percentage of his side's goals than any other Premier League player this season.",
      "But he has been signed for the variety as well as the volume of his attacking output. His two-footedness has been cited by Pep Guardiola as a major part of his attraction. Semenyo has an almost even split between right and left-footed goals in the Premier League and ranks as one of the most two-footed shooters in Europe.",
      "His versatility is another factor. Semenyo is comfortable on either flank, as he has already shown in City colours, and that's not all. \"He can play as a striker too with his pace,\" said Guardiola.",
      "Semenyo as a No 9 is an intriguing possibility, especially with Guardiola describing Haaland as \"exhausted\" after the Newcastle game. Maybe Omar Marmoush is not his only rotation option. But it is of course on the flanks that Semenyo can bring the most value.",
      "He was mostly used on the left by Bournemouth in the first half of the season but Manchester City already have Jeremy Doku there. Semenyo provides another option but it is worth noting he played more minutes on the right across his time with his former club.",
      "Semenyo's goal against Newcastle, swept home from close range after Bernardo Silva had flicked on Doku's low cross from left to right, was a first glimpse of how the two wingers can combine.",
      "It also typified their different styles as wide players.",
      "While Semenyo is more of a goal threat, shooting roughly twice as frequently as his new team-mate, Doku excels as a provider, creating nearly twice as many chances for team-mates as Semenyo.",
      "The numbers further illustrate how Semenyo gives Guardiola something different and his penchant for the spectacular is another asset. His long-range strike against Spurs in his final Bournemouth appearance was his fourth from outside the box in the Premier League this season. No City player has scored more than two.",
      "He has scored in each of his last three appearances against Manchester United, giving him the chance to become only the fourth player in Premier League history, after Mohamed Salah, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Sergio Aguero, to find the net in four consecutively.",
      "A look back at those previous three goals offers another reminder of the variety of his threat. While one was fired in off the post with ruthless precision following a run in behind, the others were dispatched first-time, with his supposedly weaker foot, having found space to finish in the box, just as he did on Tuesday night.",
      "Michael Carrick faces Guardiola for the first time in his managerial career on Saturday but he knows better than most how disorientating a meeting with one of his teams can be.",
      "Carrick was part of the Manchester United sides outplayed by Guardiola's Barcelona in the 2009 and 2011 Champions League finals. The first, he later revealed, left psychological scars.",
      "Present-day Manchester City are a different proposition to peak Barcelona. Guardiola has adapted his style in recent years. But they have the same capacity to blow teams away.",
      "Opponents tend to err on the side of caution against them. Manchester United did just that when they ground out a goalless draw in last season's Old Trafford meeting under Ruben Amorim. But attack might be the best form of defence for Carrick as he plots his first game as Amorim's successor.",
      "Manchester United have, after all, displayed attacking improvement amid their inconsistency this season. Only Manchester City and Arsenal have scored more goals, while only City have a higher 'expected' total. They rank top for shots and shots on target.",
      "Carrick's efforts to build on that attacking improvement will be helped on Saturday by the return of two of his most dangerous offensive players in Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo following their involvement at AFCON. It was Amad, of course, who inspired the late victory at the Etihad Stadium last season.",
      "In support of an improving Benjamin Sesko, who has scored three goals in his last two games, they should be confident of causing problems for what is likely to be a makeshift City backline.",
      "Abdukodir Khusanov and Max Alleyne impressed in helping Guardiola's side keep out Newcastle on Tuesday but they are 21 and 20 respectively and only have 11 Premier League starts between them. Carrick should make it his mission to test them at Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United's back three is no more. Amorim's exit may also signal the end of Bruno Fernandes playing in a midfield two. He returned to the No 10 role in Darren Fletcher's two games in charge and will surely continue there under Carrick, who used a 4-2-3-1 formation in 112 of his 124 league games in charge of Middlesbrough.",
      "Fernandes' heat maps show an increase in activity in his own half in the last two seasons, illustrating how his role changed under Amorim. It is to the 31-year-old's credit that, despite being asked to play deeper, crowbarred into a system that did not suit him, he continued to carry the same influence in the final third.",
      "This season, he ranks either top or second among Premier League players in a host of creative metrics. His total of 56 chances created is the highest by any player not just in the Premier League but in any of the major European leagues.",
      "Not bad for a guy playing out of position.",
      "Now what can he do back at No 10?",
      "Join David Jones and Jamie Carragher for Brighton vs Bournemouth on Monday Night Football from 7pm, kick-off 8pm.",

      "Thursday 15 January 2026 17:31, UK",
      "\"Free Kobbie Mainoo.\"",
      "That's the sentiment that a number of Manchester United fans and even members of Mainoo's own family haven't been shy in making known over the past year. Under Ruben Amorim, it's fair to say the 20-year-old's early career and momentum hit a major bump in the road.",
      "The midfielder - who Gary Neville once said had \"the world at his feet\" after his maiden games - played a key role for England as the Three Lions reached the Euros final in 2024.",
      "Now, still yet to make a Premier League start this season but still harbouring hopes of making a sensational return to the national team fold, Mainoo has Michael Carrick to learn from.",
      "United's new interim head coach patrolled the midfield to great distinction in his playing days. Now, with the middle of the park a lingering concern at Old Trafford, one of his many tasks will be freeing Mainoo.",
      "\"I think he's more of an attacker. I don't see him as a holding midfielder,\" Carrick said in the summer on Rio Meets, asked about Mainoo.",
      "\"He's probably that line above with that little bit more freedom. I think there are different ways of defending. You can defend on that higher line a little bit but defending right deep around your centre back is a bit of a different thing.",
      "\"I've seen him playing a little bit higher with that freedom and create and take the ball. I think he's got a massive future. I really like him, I think he just needs a bit of patience and that little bit of break again, which I'm sure he'll get.",
      "\"He's got it and he's shown that. It's a breath of fresh air the way he takes the ball and plays forward and commits people, can play, can dribble, can pass. That doesn't leave you and I think it's just waves that can come and go with time. I've seen it so many times.\"",
      "Asked a direct question whether he'd build the current United team around him, Carrick said: \"I think for a club to have a player that's come through the academy and knows the club and feels it, I think you have to.",
      "\"United's got to have an element of that. Always has done, always should, always have.",
      "\"To have a talent like that he's shown already, you've got to have players like that, you can say they get it, they know it, let's help them, let's build them and stick with them and I think there's definitely a place for him there for sure.\"",
      "The same thoughts were echoed by Carrick, who told Rio Ferdinand that a \"good midfielder can play in different ways\". Mainoo has been the subject of an experiment to test that theory since he broke through.",
      "Under Erik ten Hag, the then 18-year-old was handed his first start at the foot of United's midfield at Everton, impressing alongside Scott McTominay. A flash in the pan turned to a crash in the box as his first season as being involved in the first game culminated in a winning goal in the FA Cup final, again, as part of a midfield two - this time partnering Sofyan Amrabat.",
      "For England, Mainoo would go on to fill a similar role as a No 8 alongside Declan Rice at the Euros, starting every game from the last group stage onwards.",
      "Amorim's eventual arrival at Man Utd plunged Mainoo's role into doubt. Initially used as part of a two, sat ahead of Amorim's infamous back three, Mainoo would go on to be deployed as a No 10 and as a false No 9 at times throughout the course of the season.",
      "In this campaign, Amorim made it clear that Mainoo would be challenging for a spot in the team against an immovable Bruno Fernandes. The United captain, up until his injury in December, had started every game this season bar United's Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby.",
      "However, his injury didn't provide an opportunity for Mainoo as he too picked up a knock that ruled him out until Fernandes' return. The 3-4-2-1 didn't suit Mainoo but in a return to a flatter back four upon his return to the team under Darren Fletcher, he showed some promise.",
      "The 4-2-3-1 was Carrick's most-used formation during his time at Middlesbrough, with the former Man Utd midfielder setting up that way in 90% of his matches in charge at the Riverside.",
      "Mainoo could emerge as one of the key beneficiaries of Carrick's 17 games in charge at his old stomping ground. Maybe then, we might see a change in matchday attire for any members of the Mainoo family concerned about his lack of 'freedom'.",

      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:40, UK",
      "Manchester United have appointed Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season.",
      "Carrick emerged as the frontrunner for the role after the club held discussions with the former midfielder and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer following the departure of Ruben Amorim on January 5.",
      "United have only the Premier League to focus on following their 2-1 defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday, which was overseen by caretaker boss Darren Fletcher. Plans to appoint an interim head coach were accelerated following that defeat.",
      "Gareth Southgate's former England assistant coach Steve Holland will be Carrick's No 2, while ex-Boro assistant and Leeds player Jonathan Woodgate, current U21s coach Travis Binnion and Jonny Evans, who rejoined the club during Darren Fletcher's interim period, will also all form part of the backroom team.",
      "\"Having the responsibility to lead Manchester United is an honour,\" Carrick said. \"I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing.",
      "\"I have worked with a number of the players already and have obviously continued to watch the team closely in recent years, I have total belief in their talents, dedication and ability to be successful here.",
      "\"There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves.\"",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox added: \"Michael is an excellent coach and knows exactly what it takes to win at Manchester United.",
      "\"He is ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.\"",
      "United did not want to be in a position of changing head coaches mid season but results and behaviours meant they needed to act immediately in order to have the best chance of still achieving their objectives this season.",
      "Wilcox began the process of identifying a head coach until the end of the season to give them time to run a thorough process for a permanent coach.",
      "United wanted to bring in someone who knew and understood the club to reduce the risk of a period of adaptation and after speaking to three candidates, Carrick was the unanimous choice.",
      "Wilcox and Carrick worked together to identify and select the right profile of coaches to support him and agreed to approach Holland and Woodgate. Neither had worked with Holland but felt his skillset and experience would be beneficial. Carrick worked closely with Woodgate, an accomplished coach, and has a strong relationship with him.",
      "Meanwhile, all at United are aligned for Fletcher, who has impressed the hierachy, to return to U18s in order to support his desire to further his development and keep an excellent coach in a key position.",
      "Carrick made 464 appearances for the club across his 12 years at Old Trafford but remained there as part of Jose Mourinho's coaching staff when he retired in 2018.",
      "After Mourinho was sacked in December of that year, Carrick was briefly named interim manager before joining Solskjaer's backroom staff upon his arrival on an interim basis.",
      "The duo, who were both in the running to temporarily succeed Ruben Amorim, then remained at the club permanently when Solskjaer was handed the role in March 2019.",
      "The Norwegian coach was sacked in November 2021, and Carrick resumed the position of caretaker boss, going unbeaten in his three games at the helm with wins against Villarreal and Arsenal, as well as a point at Chelsea.",
      "Carrick stepped down from his role and left the club when Ralf Rangnick arrived before then taking charge at Middlesbrough in October 2022.",
      "Boro were 21st and one point above the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but narrowly missed out on promotion after losing to Coventry City in the play-off semi-finals that year, after rising to a fourth-place finish.",
      "Carrick then guided the team to eighth and 10th-place finishes in the following two seasons, leading to his departure in June 2025.",
      "Carrick predominantly deployed a 4-2-3-1 formation during his time at Middlesbrough, occasionally reverting to Sir Alex Ferguson's favoured 4-4-2 on six occasions - more than the five times he opted for a three-at-the-back system.",
      "Under his management, Middlesbrough recorded league-leading numbers for high turnovers and fast breaks, while also ranking among the top sides for build-up attacks and direct attacks.",
      "Given this, Carrick is likely to implement a 4-2-3-1 with an aggressive press, combining patient possession-based build-up with frequent switches to long passes and rapid transitions.",

      "Between the Lines takes a look at this season's increase in set-piece goals as Premier League clubs try to give themselves an edge; Arsenal are most effective side, Liverpool least, but what are they doing differently? And where does every team rank?",
      "By Adam Smith, Nick Wright and David Fraser",
      "Friday 16 January 2026 09:38, UK",
      "Set-pieces goals are on the rise in the Premier League.",
      "What's behind the growing emphasis on dead-ball situations? And why are some teams excelling and others struggling?",
      "This week's Between the Lines looks at one of this season's defining trends as clubs vie for set-piece supremacy.",
      "The increase in non-penalty set-piece goals can be seen in the numbers. This season, there has been an average of 0.8 per game, up from 0.6 last term and an increase of roughly 50 per cent from the 0.5 per game average in the 2020/21 campaign.",
      "The inverse pattern can be seen for open-play goals. This season's average of 1.8 open-play goals per game is down from 2.2 last season and 2.4 in the campaign before that.",
      "It is part of a shift of emphasis towards set-piece efficiency. Spurs boss Thomas Frank recently used the term \"low-hanging fruit\" to describe set-pieces as a route to goal. It is clearly a view shared by a growing number of clubs up and down the division.",
      "Specialist set-piece coaches were unusual as recently as a few years ago. Now, 15 out of 20 Premier League clubs employ set-piece coaches. Brentford even promoted their set-piece coach to the role of head coach when Keith Andrews replaced Frank.",
      "Arsenal have had success with one of the Premier League's most recognisable set-piece coaches in Nicolas Jover. They recently hired former Liverpool throw-in coach Thomas Gronnemark, underlining their commitment to maximising set-pieces.",
      "The specialist coaches are responsible for implementing techniques and devising routines which are honed through practice and repetition on the training ground. Teams are now spending more time on set-pieces during games as well as behind closed doors.",
      "According to Opta, the average number of seconds spent preparing for corners has increased steadily over the last 10 seasons in the Premier League, from 26 seconds in 2016/17 to 36 seconds this term, as players take time to communicate routines.",
      "There has been a similar pattern in time spent preparing for free-kicks, while the time spent preparing for throw-ins has increased even more dramatically this season following the resurgence of long throws up and down the division.",
      "Arsenal continue to be leaders in the set-piece field. The Gunners topped the rankings for set-piece goals, excluding penalties, in each of the last two seasons and occupy the same spot this term, their total of 14 putting them one clear of Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea and Leeds have the next-highest-totals, with 12, while Liverpool are at the opposite end of the scale having only scored three non-penalty set-piece goals, fewer than even the Premier League's bottom side Wolves, who have scored four.",
      "Liverpool's issues are not limited to attacking set-pieces. They are struggling just as badly defensively. Their total of 13 set-piece goals conceded this term is the joint-second highest in the Premier League behind Bournemouth, on 14.",
      "The result is that while Arsenal sit top for net set-piece goals on nine, having only conceded five to the 14 they have scored, putting them just ahead of Spurs, who have improved considerably in the area under Frank, Liverpool sit bottom on -10.",
      "So what do Arsenal and Liverpool do differently?",
      "On corners, there is a significant difference in delivery type.",
      "Inswinging corners are statistically more likely to lead to goals but Liverpool have taken the lowest percentage of inswingers in the Premier League this season at 48 per cent. Arsenal, by contrast, have one of the highest percentages, at 81 per cent.",
      "This season in the Premier League, there have been 77 goals from inswinging corners, according to Opta, compared to only 11 from outswinging corners.",
      "The difference is partly down to a higher volume of inswingers compared to outswingers. But inswingers have a higher success rate too, with 5.3 per cent of inswingers leading to goals this season compared to only 3.6 per cent of outswingers.",
      "Leeds appear an anomaly given they rank joint-third for set-piece goals despite having taken an even higher percentage of outswinging corners than Liverpool, but it is worth noting their last four corner goals have in fact come from inswinging deliveries.",
      "Spurs are another side enjoying success with inswingers. They have an even higher proportion of inswinging deliveries than Arsenal at 83 per cent and rank as the only side with a better corner conversion rate than the Gunners, as per the graphic below.",
      "By using inswingers, teams are able to target the six-yard box, putting opposition goalkeepers under direct pressure and generating close-range chances from flicks and headers.",
      "The trajectory of an inswinger also opens up the possibility of scoring directly from a corner, as done by Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes against Burnley in December.",
      "Targeting the six-yard box with inswingers continues to pay off for Arsenal, most recently in their 3-2 Carabao Cup semi-final first leg win at Chelsea, when Ben White headed the opener from an inswinging Declan Rice delivery.",
      "The most recent Premier League example came from the other side, when Bukayo Saka's centre was bundled over the line by Gabriel from a few yards out during the 4-1 win over Aston Villa.",
      "There is a big contrast in Liverpool's corner delivery locations.",
      "While Arsenal have sent 58 per cent of their corners into the six-yard box, Liverpool have only hit the six-yard box with 36 per cent of theirs. A much higher proportion land further away from goal, and therefore in less dangerous areas, due to their use of outswingers",
      "It is a factor which helps to explain Arsenal's superior set-piece scoring record. Meanwhile, Jamie Carragher has put Liverpool's issues defending set-pieces down to a zonal marking system which leaves too much space to opposition players.",
      "\"What Liverpool like to do on set-pieces is man-to-man mark, and also have three players in a zone. What that means is, there's an overload outside of the box.\"",
      "Fulham ended up capitalising on that overload in spectacular style but the issue has been apparent all season, with the vast majority of the set-piece goals Liverpool have conceded coming from second balls dispatched by opposition players in space.",
      "The extent of the issue can be seen in the fact that only one Premier League side, Crystal Palace, have conceded a higher percentage of goals from set-pieces than Liverpool this term.",
      "Long throws have been adopted by the majority of Premier League teams this season. The average has more than doubled to nearly four per game. But which clubs use them most effectively?",
      "Brentford have launched the most long throws this season, becoming the first side to reach 100 for the campaign during their 3-0 win over Sunderland last weekend.",
      "Their use of long throws is not new. The Bees were early adopters. This season, their throws have led to three goals, the joint-most in the Premier League along with Crystal Palace and Sunderland.",
      "Interestingly, though, it is Leeds, not Brentford, Palace or Sunderland, who rank top for shots and expected goals from long throws, suggesting they are the most dangerous.",
      "Daniel Farke's side have only scored twice from long throws this season but, from a total of 75 long throws, they have managed 28 shots worth 3.46 xG, compared to Brentford's 27 shots worth 2.73 xG from 100 long throws.",
      "It is just another area in which Premier League teams are scrambling to find an edge as the trend towards set-pieces continues.",
      "Before Michael Carrick's appointment as head coach, we looked at which managers best fit the fabled Man Utd 'DNA' using a stylistic profile of Sir Alex Ferguson's 2012/13 title-winners. Carrick ranked pretty highly but which former Chelsea boss came out top?",

      "By Rob Dorsett & Danyal Khan",
      "Tuesday 13 January 2026 21:27, UK",
      "Manchester United have gone with Michael Carrick as head coach until the end of the season, as Rob Dorsett and Danyal Khan break down why the club's hierarchy and Jason Wilcox landed on the appointment...",
      "When Ruben Amorim was sacked last week, people close to him told us the Portuguese coach had been surprised - and struggled - with the sheer volume of noise in and around Old Trafford. Amorim confided in his friends to say how impossible it was to fully prepare or predict what the unique challenges were of being the main man at Manchester United.",
      "United's bosses weren't about to make the same mistake twice.",
      "That is why United's shortlist of candidates for the interim head coach position was made up entirely of United old-boys. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Carrick were to the fore.",
      "The club hierarchy, led by director of football Jason Wilcox, wanted someone who knows the club, who has experienced the pressure and the expectation, who would feel comfortable in a difficult environment where the spotlight is blinding, and where the mood among the fanbase is still filled with frustration, remembering glories past.",
      "Michael Carrick was up front and central in that glorious past. As a player under Sir Alex Ferguson, he won five Premier League titles, one Champions League, one Europa League, one FA Cup, two League Cups and one Club World Cup. His first taste of coaching was at Old Trafford under Jose Mourinho, and he had short stints as caretaker boss, either side of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's spell in charge. United's bosses are as confident as they can be, that he will not be fazed by the environment he is stepping back into.",
      "It is clear the club's hierarchy didn't want to change head coach mid-season, but with poor results and a total breakdown in the relationship with Amorim, the club was forced to act. Many fans and commentators will ask why United couldn't appoint a new, high-profile manager straight away. But the reality is that Manchester United doesn't have the same pull for the world's elite coaches that it did a decade ago. There is no European football. Budgets are tight. There is still a major restructuring of the entire club taking place.",
      "And so it was sensible for the club to take a pragmatic approach, and save the big decision about the next big boss until the summer, when more big names will be available. Once that decision was made, it was a question of who would be best to run things for the remainder of the season, and give the team maximum chance to achieve European football for 2026/27.",
      "That man, it was decided, was Carrick. And even though he and no one else on the coaching staff has ever worked with Steve Holland before, there was a unanimous feeling that his experience and tactical nous could prove invaluable. Importantly, he was also available to start immediately, without the need to pay compensation.",
      "Other key factors in Carrick's appointment were his familiarity with the structure of power at United. Wilcox works closely with the head coach over strategy, philosophy and team selection. Ultimately, it was the significant differences of opinion and Amorim's reluctance to align tactically with Wilcox that saw him get the boot.",
      "Carrick has made it clear he is happy to work within United's existing systems, pointing out that he did so effectively at Middlesbrough, where he worked closely with head of football Kieran Scott. He also impressed in interview in terms of his ability to lead a team, and his strong knowledge of the players already at the club.",
      "Sometimes criticised for a lack of adaptability at the Riverside Stadium, Carrick stuck true to his footballing philosophy - one where dominating the football, and opposition, was the primary game plan. That idea, too, aligns with the type of football Wilcox wants to see this United squad play.",
      "But what about the other main candidate, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer?",
      "The noise from Solskjaer's camp early on was that he was not just interested in the role, he was the favourite. That was noticed inside Carrington with bemusement considering they were clear that no decision would be made until they sat down with the two candidates.",
      "Multiple sources have told us after meeting Carrick face-to-face last Thursday, United's leadership were left impressed. More so than for Solskjaer.",
      "As mentioned, his philosophy and tactical approach undoubtedly made an impact on the likes of Wilcox and Berrada but his willingness to take on the role with no guarantee of a permanent role at the end of the season was also to his advantage during the process.",
      "Solskjaer, it is understood, wanted a permanent option if he performed well in the role - a desire which the United hierarchy were not willing to entertain - clear that role was until the end of the season.",
      "It also has to be considered that a potential return for Solskjaer, who was manager under the previous regime, could be interpreted as a backward step. After consistent messaging around INEOS being forward-thinking, questions would have been asked about returning to a previous manager who did not necessarily succeed during his first spell at the club. Popular with the fan base, yes, but it was a difficult sell and not a good look.",
      "And so Carrick begins his limited reign as United's main man. As things stand, it is unlikely he will be considered for the longer-term role in the summer, alongside the likes of Thomas Tuchel, Oliver Glasner, Carlo Ancelotti, Luis Enrique, Marco Silva et al. But the hope is that his appointment will prove to be a positive one for both the coach, and the club which he now heads.",
      "He needs to hit the ground running, but he will be given a little leeway early on - Manchester City at home and Arsenal away - will prove a baptism of fire.",

      "Manchester United are out of the FA Cup meaning they will only play 40 games this season; with the club out of both domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle and a league title highly unlikely this term - where do the managerless club go this season?",
      "Monday 12 January 2026 07:50, UK",
      "No manager, no trophy hopes, no noise. The final whistle against Brighton was met with a few boos, then stunned silence. Just where do Manchester United go from here?",
      "One statistic flew around United's FA Cup defeat to Brighton. 40 games - that is how long United's season will be. Their shortest season since the 1914-15 campaign, where there were no cup games due to the First World War.",
      "Defeat to Grimsby in the Carabao Cup second round, then a first ever defeat to Brighton in the FA Cup also made it the first time United have been knocked out the two domestic cup competitions at the first hurdle since the 1981-82 season.",
      "That was not the only déjà vu United experienced on Sunday night. Another was Danny Welbeck. The last time United had 45 games or fewer in the season was 11 years ago, when Welbeck scored an FA Cup winner in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford for Arsenal. Sounds familiar.",
      "And with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick the two main contenders for the United interim job - having held those positions in the past - it's one nod to the past too many.",
      "So what does the future hold?",
      "United are now one of only three Premier League teams who just have top-flight football on their calendar between now and May, the others being Bournemouth and Everton. Even the bottom five teams in the division still have a chance of a trophy this season. United's silverware ship has sailed.",
      "There is still a Champions League place up for grabs, with the club three points behind fourth place in a race that even could see fifth place qualify - and interim head coach Darren Fletcher believes this team can qualify for Europe's top table next season.",
      "\"That can be achieved this season,\" said Fletcher. \"It's not what fans want to hear about Manchester United. They should be winning cups and challenging for the Premier League.",
      "\"That is where we're at. We have to face that and deal with that. It's not Manchester United level and what's expected. But we have to do something about that. We have to take a step forward by qualifying for the Champions League, which is important for a number of reasons.",
      "\"The players have to step up. They will come together. I challenge them to do that, they have enough quality and leaders to do that.",
      "\"Don't waste the season, that is the challenge I would set.\"",
      "Champions League football from here would represent success for United - it wouldn't for the old version of United that we used to know but it absolutely would for this current standard of the club. But even then, there are a few problems in the way of that goal.",
      "United's next two games - which follow this latest blow - are against the two best teams in the country. Manchester City come to Old Trafford next. It's a difficult challenge anyway, but it's even harder when nobody inside the club knows who will take the team for that game.",
      "Come the end of Arsenal away, the game after the Manchester derby, United could be nine points adrift of the top four. United could, of course, take points from both fixtures. But given where they are right now and Fletcher calling them a \"fragile\" team, two defeats are very possible.",
      "Another problem is: can this United team be really backed to qualify for the Champions League?",
      "The Opta supercomputer gives them a 4.9 per cent chance of reaching that goal come May. Right now, four teams are statistically better placed than United to finish in the top four. That includes fifth-placed Brentford, who Opta believe have twice as much of a chance than United of getting there.",
      "With Keith Andrews' side being a club completely aligned top to bottom, making transfers to improve the squad, possessing excellent home form and a striker on course for over 30 goals for the campaign, how do you argue against that logic when United have the opposite of all of them?",
      "United are currently predicted to finish eighth, 10 points off the Champions League places, which may not even be enough for European football. The prospect of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS' two full seasons at the club ending in back-to-back trophyless campaigns and no European football is a more than realistic possibility.",
      "No wonder there was a banner claiming Ratcliffe is unable to fix the current situation - and a protest planned for the upcoming Fulham game about the current ownership structure being unfit for purpose.",
      "Like at full-time against Brighton on Sunday, United fans have little to shout about between now and May. Perhaps the silver lining for them is - with 17 games of the season to go - they don't have to put themselves through the mill for much longer."
