      "Ruben Amorim will surely be delighted by Mason Mount's Manchester United resurgence after a troublesome start to his Old Trafford career. The midfielder has been in hot goal-scoring form with two goals in his last three games with United rising to sixth in the Premier League following their 4-1 win against Wolves.",
      "Amorim was full of praise for the Englishman after his performance at the Molineux, saying: \"He can defend, he can attack, is really the quality that when he touched the ball is really good. So it's not a surprise for me, but of course, we need to take care of him.\"",
      "It's been quite the career resurgence for Mason Mount after an injury-plagued first two seasons at Old Trafford. The ex-Chelsea star, who cost United £60m in the summer of 2023, had made just 31 league appearances for the Red Devils prior to the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "But Mount has sent a clear message to his boss that he is over the hump when it comes to injuries and ready to be a regular starter as he finds a way to start paying back his price tag.",
      "The 26-year-old is once again adding goals to his game, having found the net three times in his last four league starts.",
      "Most recently netting in United's 4-1 rout of Wolves on Monday, Mount's growing importance to the team spells for surprising reading. In the seven league games he's started this season, United have won five of them while drawing and losing one each.",
      "Compared to the six games where he was used as a substitute, United won just two, drawn three and lost one. United are earning 2.3 points per game when Mount starts which would see the club hypothetically top of the table with 34 points if he had started all 15 matches.",
      "A repeat of Manchester United's 2023 pre-season clash against Wrexham could be on the cards for next summer. According to Mail Sport, the two clubs have had discussions about a potential match in Europe.",
      "Should an agreement on the friendly come to fruition, it is expected to take place to be in Scandinavia due to the mass popularity both clubs have in that region. Nothing has yet to be confirmed due to the clubs having to navigate their pre-season schedules around the World Cup next year which is being hosted in North America.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Their first clash was a feisty one which Wrexham ran out 3-1 winners against what was a youthful United side. Dan Gore was sent off in the second half while Paul Mullin suffered a punctured lung and broken ribs following a challenge from goalkeeper Nathan Bishop who issued an apology to the striker after the game.",

      "Manchester United wonderkid JJ Gabriel has smashed a Red Devils’ record amid speculation about his Old Trafford future. The 15-year-old has made quite the impression within the club’s youth ranks alongside Kai Rooney and Jacey Carrick.",
      "Barcelona have been credited with an interest in the youngster following an eye-catching start to the season. But it appears that Gabriel is remaining focused on his current role with United. The talented teenager was included in United’s side for their FA Youth Cup clash against Peterborough United and ended up being key to victory, scoring the only goal of the game.",
      "Gabriel's strike also means he is now the youngest-ever player to have scored in the FA Youth Cup at just 15 years of age. It also saw him extend a scintillating start to the campaign.",
      "Gabriel now has 11 goals in just 12 games, having also chalked up a hat-trick against Liverpool’s under-18s earlier this campaign. United have already been making a concerted effort to retain his services.",
      "Jason Wilcox wants to tie him down to a further two years at least, while Ruben Amorim has also held a meeting with the youngster. Speaking about Gabriel earlier this season, the United boss said: \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy.",
      "\"We try to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty and pace of our training.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",
      "Away from Amorim, Gabriel has also met former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. Sharing a picture of the pair on Instagram, he wrote: “Great honour to meet legend Sir Alex Ferguson.”",
      "While United are keen to tie the youngster down to a new deal, he could potentially be set to link up with a fellow Red Devils academy graduate should he move to Barcelona. Marcus Rashford is currently in the middle of a loan spell at the Camp Nou, having fallen down the pecking order under Amorim.",
      "The forward has scored six goals and provided 11 assists so far in all competitions. Barcelona have an option in the agreement to sign the 28-year-old permanently for a fee of £26m.",

      "Manchester United forward Joshua Zirkzee has reportedly made it clear that he wants to stay and fight for his place at Old Trafford, despite ongoing reports linking him with a return to the Serie A. The Dutch international has scored just eight goals in 58 appearances for United since arriving from Bologna in the summer of 2024.",
      "He's fallen down the pecking order under Ruben Amorim following Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo's arrival at the club. Zirkzee has been repeatedly linked with a return to Italy, with AS Roma the latest club said to be keen on his signature.",
      "However, recent injuries to Sesko and Cunha opened the door for Zirzkee to feature in Amorim's starting XI. He started and scored in the comeback win at Crystal Palace, his first goal in the Premier League for United this season.",
      "It was after that win, former Premier League striker Troy Deeney revealed he thinks he'd do a better job than Zirkzee, despite being retired for two years. Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: \"It’s really poor again from Zirkzee.",
      "\"I’ve been retired for two years – Man United give me six weeks and a third of what he’s doing and I’m probably sure I can do better.",
      "\"It is embarrassing watching him play at this moment in time. He just looks like a lost soul, an absolute lost soul.\"",
      "Nevertheless, that goal at Palace took Deeney by surprise and said: \"He’s got no right to score that. I’m questioning the ‘keeper, but it’s a wonderful finish. We’ve been giving him grief, and rightly so, but that’s a massive moment in his career.",
      "\"I’m flabbergasted that he’s done that. It’s not even the fact that he scored the goal, it’s the fact he’s shown you nothing in this game so far that you would even get a shot off.",
      "\"But to even have that level of self-assuredness to even take the shot. The confidence of it is frightening.\"",
      "The United boss was also full of praise for how Zirkzee took his goal against the Eagles. Amorim said: “It’s so important for the strikers to score goals. He’s not playing many minutes but the way he responds in the second-half is so important.",
      "\"It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.”",
      "Zirkzee started the following match against West Ham United before coming on a substitute in the win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. He is under contract with the Red Devils until 2029.",

      "Thomas Tuchel and Ruben Amorim appear to be in disagreement over the impact Mason Mount can have for England. The Manchester United star has endured a difficult few years with injuries, but has been performing well over the last few months.",
      "Mount made it two goals from his last three appearances in the 4-1 win over Wolves this past Monday, with the 26-year-old named player of the match. Just a few days prior, England discovered their World Cup fate with Tuchel's side to face Croatia, Ghana and Panama in the group stages.",
      "A number of spots in his squad are up for grabs with the most competition almost certainly in the forward areas. Mount will be one of those hoping to make the cut, though it seems Tuchel is not that keen on him for one key reason.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, the differing styles of Amorim and the Three Lions head coach is an issue, with conversations between the two camps giving off the feeling that a call-up is ‘highly unlikely’. It is further stated that regardless of whether or not he continues impressing, Tuchel is not expected to look in Mount's direction.",
      "Such a stance could significantly derail Mount's hopes of getting back into the England squad for next summer's tournament in the United States.",
      "Back in November, The Sun had reported that it was the Manchester United head coach's 'special plan' for the upcoming months as he views Mount as England's most underrated player.",
      "It was also claimed at the time that Mount is viewed by Amorim as a \"super talent\" with that on full display against Wolves earlier this week in what was arguably his most impressive outing for United.",
      "The United boss thinks there is 'no other' England player who can offer Tuchel what Mount can. However, despite helping him get back to his best, with three goals in his last seven Premier League games, Amorim's plan is set to bomb with Mount expected to be snubbed again, having last played for his country at the 2022 World Cup.",
      "Even though Amorim may be fighting a losing battle against Tuchel, more prominent minutes for Mount are very likely with the Portuguese tactician blown away by his performance at Molineux.",
      "Amorim said: \"He can defend, he can attack, the quality when he touches the ball is really good, so it's not a surprise for me.\"",
      "\"He's a different type of leader. It's not like Licha [Lisandro Martínez], for example. It's a guy that leads by the example.",
      "Bruno Fernandes (x2) and Bryan Mbeumo were also on target in the victory, with United moving up sixth as a result of those three points.",
      "United's next game is against Bournemouth, and it is their third Monday evening clash since late November, with the win over Crystal Palace the only Premier League clash of their last five not played under the lights.",
      "Following the Cherries' visit to Old Trafford, United travel to Aston Villa before returning to home soil for games against Newcastle United and Wolves after Christmas.",

      "Scott McTominay has seen a remarkable turnaround in his career since swapping Manchester United for Napoli. The Scottish star has been amassing trophies, accolades and praise following his £25.7million transfer 18 months ago.",
      "The 29-year-old midfielder had an exceptional season last year, guiding the Italian giants to Serie A glory. McTominay will be back on the pitch for Napoli on Wednesday night as the Italian champions take on Benfica in the Champions League league phase.",
      "While his potential was always evident at the Red Devils, it's in Italy where McTominay has truly come into his own, netting 12 league goals in 34 matches and playing a key role in Napoli's second Scudetto win in three years. His outstanding performances earned him the Serie A MVP title and he also helped Scotland qualify for their first World Cup since 1998 last month.",
      "But it's not just on the pitch where McTominay is making waves. From his stunning girlfriend, his popularity among the locals, to his appreciation for Italian culture, we delve deeper into the Scotland international's life in Naples.",
      "McTominay's glamorous girlfriend Cam Reading has been christened the 'Queen of Italy' by some media outlets. The model caused quite a stir in a sheer dress when McTominay was named Serie A Player of the Year earlier this month.",
      "Reading commanded attention in a stunning see-through black gown, accessorised with a sparkling necklace. McTominay's girlfriend has settled seamlessly into Neapolitan life, where she resides alongside the club's newest icon.",
      "She even took to social media to express her pride following his successful evening at the awards ceremony, showcasing some of her Italian.",
      "Taking to Instagram, she wrote: \"Gran Gala del Calcio, Scott walked away with two awards and I walked away even prouder of the man he is...dedicated, hardworking and always striving for more. Ti amo.\"",
      "Last year the couple were snapped along the Amalfi coast in a snap shared by Reading on her Instagram. She revealed that she and McTominay had \"fallen in love with Italy\".",
      "Former Scotland manager Gordon Strachan previously lauded McTominay for achieving \"god-like\" standing at Napoli. He remains a crucial component of Antonio Conte's squad, with the club presently embroiled in an early-season championship battle alongside rivals Inter and Milan at the summit of Serie A.",
      "Speaking to OLBG, Strachan commended McTominay for establishing a new beginning in Italy. He said: \"Sometimes it's about finding the right team for you as a player.",
      "\"Maybe that's the tip. I think for a long time, I think Scott McTominay was looked upon as the new kind of Stephen Fletcher who could pop in and help and all the rest of it.",
      "\"He didn't really have his own identity at Manchester United, I think when he went to Napoli, he found his own identity.\"",
      "He continued: \"He's transformed into arguably one of Italy's finest players this year, if not the very best. I was in Sorrento recently and that man is now revered like a deity and he achieved it through his own efforts. Regardless of what you might say about managers, you still have to deliver personally. So I believe he's excelled brilliantly.\"",
      "Whilst McTominay has seamlessly adjusted to Serie A football on the field, it seems he's also completely immersed himself in the lifestyle beyond the pitch. From sipping espresso to savouring fresh tomatoes, the Scotsman has been effusive about his existence in Naples.",
      "A source within Napoli disclosed that McTominay has developed a taste for Italian coffee. Speaking to Gazzetta della Sport, veteran Napoli staff member Tommaso Starace revealed: \"McTominay was sceptical at first; now he averages two in the morning with me.\"",
      "McTominay also confessed earlier this year about his unexpected passion for tomatoes, despite previously avoiding the fruit. In an April conversation with The Athletic, he explained: \"Oh my goodness, the tomatoes. I never ate them at home, they're just red water.",
      "\"Here, they actually taste like tomatoes. Now I eat them as a snack. I eat all the vegetables, all of the fruits. It is all so fresh. It's incredible.\"",
      "There's no question that McTominay took a massive gamble when he exchanged Old Trafford for the Diego Armando Maradona stadium, but he's convinced the entire adventure of residing overseas has genuinely pushed him beyond his comfort zone. McTominay's stellar performances have earned him a mural in the heart of Naples.",
      "Speaking about the affection he receives from the locals, he said: \"The people in Naples are incredible. They're so passionate and everywhere you go there are people who say 'Forza Napoli' and they want to speak to you and have a conversation and that inspires you every time you go on the pitch because they care.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Erling Haaland has admitted he's a proper football fanatic in his downtime, though his girlfriend Isabel Haugseng Johansen seems to have had enough of the sport taking over their relationship. The striker opened up about his passion for the game during a chat with Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker on The Rest Is Football podcast, recalling how he tuned into Manchester United's 1-1 draw with West Ham last Thursday.",
      "When quizzed about his viewing habits, the 25-year-old said: \"Yeah, I'm a football fan, so I watch all kinds of football.",
      "\"Actually, yesterday, we were eating dinner, and I checked if there were any games. Man Utd, West Ham is playing. Let's put it on. My missus said, 'I'm so sick of football. We watch it all the time.' And I'm like, 'Yeah, that's the reason why we are sitting here.'\"",
      "The revelation offers a fascinating glimpse into Haaland's world away from his goal-scoring exploits for Manchester City. Haaland is currently dating 21-year-old Isabel, with the couple first crossing paths back in Norway when the striker was playing for Bryne FK – his maiden club.",
      "It's rather revealing that Haaland's own partner complained about football being on 'all the time', highlighting just how consumed the striker is by the beautiful game.",
      "Whilst this might appear typical for a professional footballer, that's not necessarily the reality, as some players treat it purely as work and don't maintain such keen interest.",
      "Arsenal's Ben White serves as perhaps the most striking example, with the Premier League star admitting that he doesn't particularly care for watching the sport and staying abreast of the stories surrounding it.",
      "Haaland, meanwhile, clearly does and that may well contribute to the obsession he harbours with netting goals and smashing records at every opportunity.",
      "\"This is what it's like if you play with Messi or Ronaldo, his influence is so big,\" said Pep Guardiola last month when he was talking about the quality of Haaland.",
      "\"You see the numbers of that guy? Of course he's that level. Messi and Ronaldo have done it for 15 years, but this is the level. The first goal, the way he shoots the ball, it's like, 'I am going to score.'",
      "\"He has that hunger. It's top. I said how incredibly coachable and manageable he is. I am tough sometimes with Haaland, but he is open-minded. He lives for the goals and sometimes the pressure cannot sustain 90 minutes, but that's normal.\"",
      "With 144 goals to his name in 166 City appearances so far, Haaland must be keenly aware of the records that lie ahead of him, having become so attuned to the narratives of football and the Premier League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "In a tale that's sure to bruise the former Madrid player's ego, a Lithuanian influencer mistook a random bloke for the real CR7.",
      "Taking to Instagram, Goda Problema shared a video of herself enjoying a drink at a lively club with a man she mistook for the footballing legend.",

      "Heaven above - what was he thinking?",
      "Because one comfortable win over the worst team in the Premier League doesn’t make Manchester United world beaters.",
      "Nor will the result have the rest of United’s rivals running scared. But this didn’t stop Ayden Heaven from throwing down the gauntlet to the rest, in the wake of United’s 4-1 triumph at Molineux.",
      "Perhaps it was the exuberance of youth? Heaven is only 19, after all.",
      "Perhaps he got carried away, still high on the emotion of helping his team score four goals in a game for just the second time this season. Albeit against opponents who have conceded 40 of them in just 18 games in all competitions this season.",
      "Or perhaps it was another example of how there is still that unjustified sense of entitlement and arrogance at a club where genuine success is expected - but cannot be achieved.",
      "\"I don't think anyone can stop us when we play like this,” said Heaven, with a straight face. “We’ve just got to do what we did in every game.",
      "\"Hopefully we can be in Europe next season, which I think we'll do. That's where Manchester United belong.\"",
      "United don’t ‘belong’ in Europe. They don’t belong anywhere. Memo to Heaven. United are just like every other club, in the sense they have no divine right to be in the Champions League or at the top of the Premier League.",
      "Most people bang on about Leeds United being a club which belongs in the top flight. But this didn’t stop them spending years in the Championship, did it?",
      "The privilege of competing at the highest level at home and abroad has to be earned.",
      "Which is why Heaven & Co are spending their midweeks this season with nothing better to do than watching games in the Champions and Europa League on TV - instead of playing in them.",
      "For his sake, it can only be hoped that the likes of Arsenal and Manchester City have been too focused on more important matters this week, to miss what Heaven said.",
      "For the record, the last time United beat someone by scoring goals, they failed to win their next three games. Heaven is still a teenager, feeling his way as a professional footballer at one of the world’s most high profile clubs.",
      "He’s started just four league games for United.",
      "In other words, he’s still got a long way to go, just like his team does, before being in a position of being able to make such bullish statements.",
      "He’s still got a lot to learn - and might well have to do this the hard way.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Scott McTominay left an indelible mark on Jose Mourinho during their time together at Manchester United. The duo are poised for a reunion tonight as Mourinho's Benfica take on Napoli in the Champions League.",
      "The 2017/18 campaign proved to be McTominay's breakout season, clocking up 23 appearances across all competitions under Mourinho's guidance. The emerging midfielder was even crowned Manager's Player of the Year after the United boss discovered that he had been overlooked for other end-of-season honours.",
      "Since swapping Old Trafford for Napoli last summer, the Scotland international has flourished in a more attacking midfield position. Yet Mourinho would have needed little persuasion that his former player would excel elsewhere, fondly referring to him as \"my boy\" and confessing he was among his favourite players to coach.",
      "\"The players that I most enjoyed [coaching] were the ones that gave me everything,\" Mourinho revealed to Rio Ferdinand Presents in 2024. \"Everything. The ones that I felt they couldn't give anything more than what they gave, these are my players.",
      "\"Then if you want to, kind of, preferred... I don't want to be unfair to people and I will be unfair but when you play a kid, the kid becomes your kid for life. That is always my feeling.",
      "\"So I look to Raphael Varane [at Real Madrid] now at the end of his career, he is my kid. When I look to Scott McTominay, [Paul] Pogba on the bench, play Scott McTominay in Champions League against Sevilla, he is my boy. When I go club to club, I find my boys, and they are always going to be my boys.\"",
      "The admiration between the pair was clearly mutual. Despite Mourinho leaving the club in December 2018 after a disappointing run of results, McTominay treasured the manager's advice.",
      "\"Jose Mourinho has been absolutely incredible to me this year. He's helped me so much in terms of what I can do, from being more humble, to being better on the training pitch and just being a better person in general,\" McTominay told United's club website in April 2018.",
      "\"When I first came into the group he said, 'The players have to like you,' and it's one of the most important things going into a new dressing room, that you are a likeable person and you get on with everybody.",
      "\"That has stood me in good stead. It's important to be liked on the pitch. It's the manager having the faith to play me that's been incredible and I can't thank him enough.\"",
      "While McTominay made 255 appearances for his beloved club, scoring some crucial goals, it was not until his move to Italy that the midfielder truly flourished. In his first season under Antonio Conte, he clinched the Serie A title and earned the league's Most Valuable Player award, leaving United to ponder what might have been in a transfer decision now widely questioned.",
      "However, McTominay has no second thoughts about his decision to leave the Red Devils. Speaking at the Gran Gala del Calcio awards ceremony, where he received the Serie A Player of the Year award, McTominay said: \"Coming to Napoli was an easy choice, I came to the right place.\"",
      "He continued: \"It's sensational, it's incredible to be here and win this award. Thank you to everyone, the team, the staff, and my team-mates. My bond with Napoli is special, there are so many special places here.\"",

      "Former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood was the star of the show for Marseille in their thrilling 3-2 victory over Belgian outfit Union Saint-Gilloise on Tuesday night. The 24-year-old's two goals in the Champions League took his season tally to 13 across all competitions.",
      "His vital contributions in Belgium secured Marseille's third win in six Champions League outings, putting Roberto De Zerbi's squad 16th in the table before Wednesday's matches. After another standout performance from Greenwood, who has scored 35 times in 56 games for the French club, the former Brighton manager heaped praise on the attacker. However, he believes the striker can improve his game.",
      "\"Yes, I think he's one of the best strikers in Europe,\" the Marseille manager told RMC Sport. \"But even he, when we're leading 3-1, needs to learn to manage the ball, not to force things and not to lose possession.\"",
      "De Zerbi continued: \"He's a great player, but in those moments, I think he also needs to make the effort to hold onto the ball a little longer, to give us a bit more breathing room, to be more consistent defensively, at least by holding his position.\" Here's what the French press made of Greenwood's display.",
      "French outlet L'Equipe hailed Greenwood as part of a \"formidable\" Marseille attacking unit. Their match report noted the former United talent was \"imperious when facing the opposing goalkeeper\".",
      "Playing alongside Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Timothy Weah in attack, it was Greenwood who stole the headlines as Marseille took a \"significant step\" towards progressing to the next round. Summarising Greenwood's performance, the match report described him as \"dynamic, mobile, and decisive\".",
      "Yet the French outfit did struggle at times during the match. De Zerbi's men fell behind early and endured a tense finale after Union SG pulled it back to 3-2 with 20 minutes left on the clock.",
      "La Croix's match report emphasised the important nature of Marseille's triumph. Having won two of their three European fixtures at home, the 3-2 result in Belgium marked their first away victory.",
      "This vital breakthrough was reportedly \"led by the talent of Mason Grenwood\". However, the publication acknowledged that De Zerbi's squad had benefited from a \"fragile\" Union SG backline that \"crumbled quite quickly\".",
      "Assessing Marseille's performance, the match report concluded: \"Still inconsistent, still fragile, still difficult to read, De Zerbi's team is moving forward, at least.\"",
      "La Provence handed Greenwood an eight out of 10 in their player ratings - the top mark among all Marseille players. The publication highlighted the backheel that contributed to his team's equaliser from Paixao.",
      "Greenwood's first goal, which put Marseille ahead, was characterised as \"a fine run and a powerful finish\". However, the forward received his greatest acclaim in the publication's match report.",
      "The report stated that Greenwood was \"seen as a messiah by OM fans\" following his brace. His skill on the ball was described as leaving the Union SG \"defence dancing\".",

      "Marcus Rashford made a game-changing appearance from the bench for Barcelona on Tuesday night, helping his side secure a win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League. Frankfurt initially took a surprise lead at the Camp Nou against Hansi Flick's side, thanks to a goal from Ansgar Knauff.",
      "However, Rashford, who is currently on loan from Manchester United, turned the tide after being introduced at half-time. His cross was met by Jules Kounde, who scored to put Barcelona in front.",
      "Kounde then added another goal just three minutes later, securing Barcelona's victory. The win earned the five-time European champions three points, taking their total to 10 and putting them in a strong position to secure a top-eight spot that would guarantee progression to the last 16.",
      "Rashford's performance was lauded by Spanish media outlets. Here's what they had to say.",
      "Marca awarded Rashford two out of three stars for his performance. They wrote: \"Raphinha fired over the bar after a Rashford pass.",
      "\"The second half couldn't have started more excitingly, and things only got more intense when Koundé headed home a great Rashford cross to level the score. The goal completely changed the game. The crowd spurred their team on, while Eintracht began to feel vulnerable.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo hailed Rashford's performance as \"influential\". They said: \"He proved Flick right by immediately shaking up Barça's offensive method, generating two goal-scoring opportunities: one was not and the other was after an anthological cross for the 1-1.\"",
      "The publication added: \"A Barcelona side with plenty of possession but lacking ideas needed, yet again, a comeback. Raphinha, who in the first half had occasionally moved to the right, switching positions with Lamine Yamal, or through the middle, settled permanently inside, and Rashford came on, bringing a spark to shake things up.",
      "\"If Flick was looking to Rashford for a solution, he wasn't wrong. After an initial run down the wing and a cutback to Raphinha, when he could have finished himself, a beautiful and precise cross came into the box, where Koundé headed it in perfectly.\"",
      "SPORT were less than impressed with Barcelona's overall performance, but they did single out Rashford for praise. They said: \"Marcus Rashford deserves a special mention.",
      "\"He was signed for this purpose: to shake things up for games that are stuck in a rut, to offer something different. Flick saw that the team needed a different kind of attacking player to create danger and he responded perfectly.\"",
      "Post-match, Rashford shared his excitement at playing a Champions League match in the Camp Nou for the first time. He stated: \"I'm enjoying it very much and looking forward to playing as much as I can.",
      "\"We're in a position where it was important we got the points so this is a good day and now we rest and try to improve.",
      "\"The most important thing was to win and I'm very happy we managed to do that. I thought we played quite well and controlled the game. They scored at an unexpected time but we reacted well and managed to get the goals without changing too much.\"",

      "Paul Scholes has insisted Manchester United star Kobbie Mainoo \"will have to leave\" the club as his search for game time under Ruben Amorim endures. Mainoo came off the bench to make a 12-minute cameo in Monday's 4-1 demolition against Wolves but has still been largely discarded by his manager.",
      "Amorim has been defiant over the matter and insisted he'll be the one to decide whom is worthy of selection. However, there's a consensus around the club Mainoo is being severely underused, and Scholes would appear to concur.",
      "Amid the swell of support for Mainoo during his semi-exile, Scholes has joined the legions of fans insisting the player deserves more. And the Treble-winner can't wrap his head around why the academy graduate hasn't made more starts under the current administration.",
      "Mainoo, 20, was a regular starter under Amorim last term but has come off the bench in each of his 10 Premier League outings so far this season. And that's left Scholes under no illusion a player of his potential will therefore have to leave if he's to get a regular place and improve his odds of featuring at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has said Kobbie Mainoo is a starter... every appearance he’s made in the Premier League has been as a sub,\" said the United great on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast. \"Things like that wind me up.",
      "\"I wouldn’t mind if he was in a good team and they were winning every week and keeping possession but they’re rubbish. Kobbie is a 20-year-old kid and he’s not playing, he’s going to have to leave.",
      "\"Do you know what will happen now? Amorim will bring him into a game, and he won’t be great, but that’s because he needs regular games.\"",
      "Mainoo continues to be linked with a move to Napoli, who have already revived the career of two United outcasts in Scott McTominay and more recently Rasmus Hojlund. In the meantime, Mainoo's quest for consistency at Old Trafford lingers on.",
      "Despite scoring four goals at Molineux on Monday, there's a hunger to see Sesko back at the tip of United's spear. Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount have helped provide alternatives leading the line in different capacities, but Sesko's recent injury came at a time when he just looked to be hitting his stride.",
      "There was an initial panic when the Slovenia frontman went down with a knee injury against Tottenham prior to November's international window. However, the player's agent, Elvis Basanovic, has given some indication as to when fans might expect to see the striker return.",
      "\"Benjamin is feeling very well. His rehabilitation is progressing according to plan,\" he said during a recent appearance on Slovenian television. \"It's hard to say precisely when he will return.",
      "\"That will be up to the medical staff and the manager, but I think we'll see him back on the pitch very soon. Maybe even sooner than expected.\"",
      "Those comments don't give much away, though \"sooner than expected\" is the part many fans will hang onto. Sesko, 22, has only scored twice in 11 Premier League outings, though it's his wider work knitting together the forward line to help bring Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha to the fore that has been most valuable to date.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has joined Paul Scholes in criticising Ruben Amorim for the way he has treated Kobbie Mainoo – and urged the Manchester United academy graduate to leave the club.",
      "Mainoo has endured a difficult campaign at United, where he has been stuck on the substitutes’ bench under Amorim. The United boss has played Casemiro alongside captain Bruno Fernandes in midfield, with Mainoo making just 10 appearances as a substitute in the Premier League.",
      "The 20-year-old midfielder came close to leaving in the summer and is keen to join Napoli on loan in January in order to get more minutes and potentially challenge for a place in the England squad for the World Cup.",
      "Mainoo got just 12 minutes off the bench in the 4-1 away win over Wolves on Monday night. Nevertheless, Amorim said he sees Mainoo as a “starter like the other players” – prompting ex-United defender Ferdinand to call out the manager for his mistreatment of the youngster.",
      "He said on his YouTube channel: “I saw [Nicky] Butty and [Paul] Scholesy talking about it on their podcast and I totally agree with them. If I think about it and put myself in Kobbie Mainoo’s shoes I’m out of there, I’ve got to.",
      "“He was playing for England and [was] one of the best players in the tournament. Not many people can say they’ve done that. He has just wasted 18 months of his career now at Manchester United.",
      "“He’s probably been there six months longer than he should’ve been. He should’ve just gone and I think his agent and more importantly his family around him have to protect him.”",
      "He added: “He might be saying ‘I love Manchester United too much to go, I want to stay and fight’. But it is going to be two years in the summer. You can’t lose two years in your career. It’s a short career and you have to make decisions that are best for you.",
      "“If I was him I’d say the manager isn’t going to start playing me now. If you’ve not played me in all these matches that have gone before you aren’t going to play me now. Let’s just be honest with each other: I’m surplus to requirements. Get me out of here.”",
      "Ferdinand’s words follow those of his former team-mate Paul Scholes, who slammed Amorim’s approach with Mainoo. “Bulls***,” Scholes wrote on Instagram in response to Amorim calling the midfielder a starter. “The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can’t control a game of football. Hate seeing homegrown players leave but it’s probably best for him now, enough is enough.”",
      "He then added on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast: “Ruben Amorim has said Kobbie Mainoo is a starter… every appearance he’s made in the Premier League has been as a sub. Things like that wind me up.",
      "“I wouldn’t mind if he was in a good team and they were winning every week and keeping possession but they’re rubbish. Kobbie is a 20-year-old kid and he’s not playing. He’s going to have to leave.",
      "“Do you know what will happen now? Amorim will bring him into a game and he won’t be great but that’s because he needs regular games. Fair enough, as a manager sometimes you just don’t fancy a player. But look at what he’s already done – scored the winner in an FA Cup final, played every game in the Euros.",
      "“I bet he takes the p*** out of Casemiro every single day in training and is brilliant. I don’t know why the club are letting Amorim treat a homegrown talent like that.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The social media superstar and streamer made his name, in part, via his support of the Red Devils and made a trademark shout of 'Yanited' as his profile grew. The Salford-born jungle king, real name Morgan Burtwistle, beat off competition from Eastenders actor Shona McGarty and presenter Tom Read Wilson in the I'm A Celeb final.",

      "When Mason Mount joined Manchester United in the summer of 2023 he couldn't stop smiling. Mount sat on a stool in a room at the club's training ground to pose for a picture with his back to the photographer.",
      "On his shirt was the No.7. The most iconic number in United's long and storied history. One which used to belong to the likes of George Best, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. One which inspired greatness from this quartet - but proved nothing more thrilling than a burden to Mount.",
      "At the time of joining from Chelsea in a £60m deal, Mount could never have imagined the nightmare ahead of him.",
      "\"I couldn't be more excited for the season ahead and I'm ready for the hard work expected here,\" he said. \"I'm highly ambitious. I know how amazing it feels to win major trophies and what it takes to do it. I will be giving everything to experience that again at Manchester United.\"",
      "As it turned out, Mount would struggle to hold down a place in the United team, let alone get his hands on more silverware.",
      "Erik ten Hag, who signed Mount, knew all about the attacking midfielder, having watched him score a superb free kick during a loan spell with Vitesse Arnhem, to help them sink his Ajax side 3-2 in 2018.",
      "Ten Hag tried to sign him, but Chelsea refused. He finally got him after taking charge of United, when Ten Hag breezed into Old Trafford with a list of 80 principles he explained to staff and the squad.",
      "And Mount ticked most of the boxes. What Ten Hag hadn't catered for when it came to Mount, however, was bad luck.",
      "Mount hadn't made it to the end of August in his first season before suffering an injury which ruled him out for four games. In November, those four games turned into four months, when Mount broke down again. A pattern had been set - and Mount's struggles threatened to turn him into a laughing stock in the red half of Manchester.",
      "The one highlight was him being an 89th minute substitute in United's shock FA Cup final win over bitter rivals Manchester City at Wembley in 2024.",
      "In the meantime, Mount had to sit at home and watch best mate Declan Rice establish himself as one of the best midfielders in the world. Rice helped England reach back-to-back Euros finals, while securing a £100m move to Arsenal from West Ham.",
      "The difference in fortunes couldn't have been greater. But Mount never gave up hope of being a success himself at United.",
      "Mount might have witnessed a change in manager, with Ruben Amorim replacing the sacked Ten Hag, but United never experiences a change in the player's attitude.",
      "Despite all the dark times. Mount is now smiling again. His goal to help United thrash Wolves 4-1 at Moluneux was his second in three games.",
      "He is starting to resemble a new signing - the one United always wanted him to be. United put his recent success down to two things. He has remained fit for an extended period to get a run of games, while Amorim is utilising him in his preferred position of a more advanced role.",
      "A club source said: \"Mason's attitude has never changed. He's been hard working, friendly, personable, fun and mature. He's genuinely a nice and intelligent person.",
      "\"He's remained level-headed, even through the difficult times. And he won't get carried away now.\"",
      "United have never lost faith in Mount, while remaining fiercely protective of someone who is one of the most popular personalities in the dressing room.",
      "To such an extent that the club even issue a statement when Mount complained about professional autograph hunters harassing Mount on a regular basis for his signature.",
      "Senior figures were worried he could get hurt. Mount is now back and showing signs of the form which once made him one of the first names on Gareth Southgate's team sheet when England manager.",
      "And all Amorim & Co can do now is keep everything crossed Mount's better luck continues. Because no-one deserves it to more than the man himself.",

The 18-year-old was part of the away support that travelled up to the Midlands for the Premier League clash, which had plenty of goals in store for them.",
      "A Bruno Fernandes brace, followed by goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Mount, sealed an important three points for Ruben Amorim on the hunt for a European place this season. Littler's appearance in the crowd drew the eyes of the Sky cameras, who showed him amongst the other fans who made the trip to Molineux.",
      "There were some criticisms from quarters in the Man United fanbase, as many missed out on the ballot to land a ticket for the game. However, that won't have spoiled a first away day for the youngster, who took to social media to post about his thrilling day at the football.",
      "Taking to Instagram, he said: \"First away day. What a result, chill for few days now then onto the world championship Thursday.\" This was followed by some messages of support from those in the United squad.",
      "Mount was among those in the comments, with the star stating: \"Love it mate,\" while Harry Maguire also added a heart emoji with some raised hands. It was an eventful evening for Littler to witness, with the England international who sent him the message pulling the strings in the match.",
      "Mount was a standout in the game on Monday night, bagging a goal and knitting play together for the visiting side. It led to plenty of praise from his manager, Amorim, after the game.",
      "\"It’s not just the goal he scored, it’s the way he plays the game – how he attacks, he defends, he understands his technical qualities,\" the head coach told the official Manchester United website after the game. \"You don’t need to have many touches. He’s a really good player and works hard. He knows sometimes he needs to start on the bench.”",
      "It remains to be seen whether Mount or any of the other Man United players will be taking a break from their usual responsibilities to attend the darts and to cheer Littler on like he did for them. Thursday marks the start of the PDC World Darts Championship, as the 18-year-old looks to defend the crown that he won earlier this year.",
      "His first round match is in the evening session, as he takes on Lithuania's Darius Labanauskas. Littler beat Michael van Gerwen in the final of the 2025 tournament, marking his first win at the Worlds, one year on from bursting onto the scene and losing to Luke Humphries in the final.",
      "If the youngster manages to replicate the form he showed last time out, then he could be the first to win back-to-back World Championships for the first time in a decade. Gary Anderson is the last to do it, winning it in 2015 and 2016, while there have been seven different winners of it in the past ten years.",
      "Now the newly ranked number one in the world, Littler has spoken about his feelings surrounding his own game coming into the tournament. He told Sky News: \"I wouldn't say there's really any nerves, I just enjoy it. I love producing my best darts, I love walking on, seeing the fans and there's no need to put any pressure on yourself.",
      "\"If you win, you win; if you lose, you lose. Obviously, if you're losing, it's not a good feeling and you've gotta get yourself out of that situation, get yourself back into the game, and that's what I'm good at. I'm good at turning it up a notch or two, and I can get in front of my opponent and then go on and win the game.\"",
      "Having recently taken that number one spot, as well as the Grand Slam victory just a few weeks ago, Littler is the form player that everyone will need to beat.",

      "Former Manchester United star Paul Scholes tore into Ruben Amorim after their 1-1 Premier League draw against West Ham. Amorim's side delivered the perfect response, though, putting four goals past bottom-of-the-table Wolves to move within a point of the Champions League places.",
      "United are in better shape than in Amorim's first season, when the Portuguese coach led them to a first ever bottom-half finish in the Premier League after replacing Erik ten Hag about a third of the way into the season. With no European distractions, the Red Devils have already matched the seven league wins their current boss secured last term.",
      "Wolves were their latest victims, with captain Bruno Fernandes scoring twice in a 4-1 win at Molineux. However, things weren't looking quite as rosy on Thursday when West Ham midfielder Soungoutou Magassa denied United at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I don’t think this manager gets this club, full stop. I just don’t think he’s the right man,\" Scholes said on The Good, the Bad and the Football after the West Ham game. \"Man United is about risk and entertainment, more than anything. At home having fans on the edge of their seats ready to go, wingers who beat people, shots on goal, bits of skill. There’s nothing there.\"",
      "Scholes questioned those who hired Amorim, arguing his preferred three-at-the-back system is not what makes a United manager. \"Right away that’s a no,\" he continued. \"Man United never do that. They cant do that. It’s been proven over years and years and years.\"",
      "Scholes' latest comments come after reports that United players have drawn 'battle lines' over ex-players in the media. Scholes is one of a number of former United stars to take aim at the current crop, with Gary Neville and Roy Keane also particularly vocal.",
      "If they've been affected by the chatter, it didn't show at Molineux. Wolves might have gone in level at the break thanks to Jean-Ricner Bellegarde's effort, but United registered 27 shots - 10 of them on-target - en route to three points against their winless opponents.",
      "\"We played well most of the time. We should have a different score in the end,\" Amorim told BBC Sport. \"I'm pleased with the second half that we understood we had another opportunity.\"",
      "The Portugues was also asked about his half-time team-talk, adding: \"It wasn't tactical. It was so clear we are dominating the games but not finishing the plays as we should do.

      "JJ Gabriel became the youngest player to represent Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup on Tuesday. The forward started against Peterborough and scored the match winner in a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Gabriel started aged 15 years, two months and three days, which meant he broke the record previously held by United academy graduate Omari Forson (15 years and four months).",
      "The online records tracking United's Youth Cup appearance makers began from the 2006/2007 season.",
      "Gabriel recently trained with the first-team. It's unusual for a player so young to be given the opportunity to train with the first team, but Gabriel is one of the most highly-rated talents to come through the academy.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Amorim at Carrington.",
      "Amorim was given a closer look at the youngster when he took part in training. \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"You could see the Under-21s had a game and we had fewer players and tried to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow, but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",

      "JJ Gabriel celebrated with a knee slide in front of the Stretford End after finishing brilliantly to net his first Old Trafford goal. Manchester United fans will hope it's the first of many from Gabriel in a United shirt.",
      "Gabriel became the youngest player (15 years, two months and three days) to represent United in the FA Youth Cup on Tuesday night, breaking the record held by Omari Forson (15 yrs and four months). That is according to online records, which begin from the 2006/2007 season.",
      "There is a chance that Gabriel could become United's youngest-ever Premier League player at some point during next season. Angel Gomes (16 years, 263 days), Shola Shoretire (17 years, 19 days) and Chido Obi (17 years, 79 days) are currently the youngest players to make a debut for United.",
      "Gabriel cannot play in the Premier League this season because the rules state a player can only feature if they are 15 by August 31 of that campaign, but he could still break United's record next term.",
      "United have rich history in the Youth Cup - no club has won it more - and the Under-18s were heavy favourites to open their campaign with a win against Peterborough, so it was a shame that academy director Stephen Torpey appeared to be the only noteworthy face present in the directors' box.",
      "Jason Wilcox was not spotted, nor was a member of Ruben Amorim's coaching staff. Erik ten Hag popping down to Altrincham to watch the Under-21s in September 2022 was taken for granted at the time.",
      "Gabriel has been introduced to Amorim, and he recently took part in his first senior training session, leading Amorim to say in a press conference: \"I know he is a really talented guy.\"",
      "It didn't take long for the few hundred attendees at Old Trafford, most of whom were connections of each side's players, to see that talent when Gabriel demonstrated his agility down the left. The youngster idolises Neymar, and his dribbling is reminiscent of the Brazilian winger in his prime.",
      "Louis Bradbury missed the first chance of the game, dragging his shot wide of the post. Every young forward misses chances, but Gabriel is not an ordinary teenager and clinically put away his first opportunity.",
      "Before the game, Peterborough's manager joked that some of his players who were injured were suddenly fit to be involved at Old Trafford. The players who were selected to start will recall the day they played against Gabriel, provided the teenager scales to the heights that he's been tipped to reach.",
      "Gabriel is so highly rated that Omar Berrada and Wilcox were involved in an eleventh-hour meeting to keep him in the summer. Every giant European club wants to lure the teenager away.",
      "United have offered Gabriel a box at the new Old Trafford, which is planned to be completed by 2030, and staff believe he could become the face of the club if he stays in Manchester.",
      "Darren Fletcher was appointed as U18 manager in the summer, and a source has praised Fletcher's handling of Gabriel this season because he wants him on the ball as much as possible.",
      "That has been key in most matches - get the ball to Gabriel and he'll make something happen. The result is invariably that the youngster finds the back of the net in style. Gabriel scored his 11th goal of the season against Peterborough, in what was just his 12th appearance of the campaign.",
      "It was hard not to think of Alejandro Garnacho when watching Gabriel dance around Peterborough shirts under the floodlights. Garnacho was talismanic during a successful 2021/22 Youth Cup campaign, scoring seven goals in the competition, and Gabriel has the ability to better that haul this term.",
      "However, Gabriel will not be able to lead United to another Youth Cup on his own. Chido Obi was the talisman for the U18s in the competition last season, and fans expected the young striker to fire the team to glory, but they fell short on penalties in the semi-finals against the eventual winners, Aston Villa.",
      "It will be a team effort to win the Youth Cup. The good news is Fletcher has talented players such as Bendito Mantato, Jim Thwaites, Godwill Kukonki and Daniel Armer to spearhead the charge.",
      "United fans will at least be thoroughly entertained by watching the U18s bid for glory.",

      "Yet on the flip side, United under Amorim have struggled to build momentum and it's not easy to make a firm case that the campaign will end in European football as a result. So can United find a top six Premier League place come May and secure continental football? We asked our United team for their verdict.",
      "Wolves are shockingly bad, and they threatened to turn the game into a contest at the end of the first half. United won comfortably in the end, but a better team would have been out of sight by the interval.",
      "It's a strange season in the top-flight, with just six points separating fourth and 13th, but that must be seen as an opportunity, as a string of good results will put daylight between United and their rivals.",
      "Returning to Europe is the internal target, but United must qualify for the Champions League specifically, and they can achieve that aim if they stamp out their occasional dismal displays.",
      "Although I don't want to sit on the fence, December will tell us more about whether United can return to the Champions League. It feels like a make-or-break few weeks for Amorim.",
      "Predicting what might happen to Manchester United in the future has become a futile exercise. Because this United side under Ruben Amorim has become consistent for how inconsistent it is.",
      "A resounding win at Wolves is hardly the platform from which to start judging them. Because a pub team could probably give Wolves a game these days. United, however, are showing genuine signs of progress. The league table proves this, because United are joint fifth.",
      "But the fact United share this place alongside Chelsea, the official Club World Cup champions, speaks volumes for how ridiculous and unpredictable this domestic season is shaping up to be. Crystal Palace are fourth, Aston Vila third, while Sunderland, Everton and Brighton are challenging for the top four.",
      "United have the talent to secure Champions League football, let alone just a place in Europe. But the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes need to keep performing. United need to gain genuine momentum. Which recent history has taught us, is easier said than done.",
      "It is hard to judge Manchester United fairly off the back of the victory over Wolves on Monday night. The hosts were embarrassingly below par and clearly do not have the quality to compete in the Premier League this season. That being said, United can only beat what is in front of them.I was impressed by their reaction in the second half at Molinuex. Last season, conceding on the stroke of half-time to a team battling against relegation, away from home, could have resulted in a disastrous night and the momentum slipping away.Instead, they knuckled down and showed professionalism to overcome their opponents which they deserve credit for. Will United get back into Europe off the back of that result? Potentially, but I still feel the Champions League is a stretch at this moment in time.United have not shown the consistency needed this season to sustain a push for the Champions League spots. Results against the likes of West Ham and Everton are what will let the Reds down in their push for the top four. If United want to be seen as serious contenders for the Champions League, they need to be winning those games. One point from a possible six was not good enough.The festive period is now crucial for United. If they are still in around the top four by the end of it, they could well have a greater chance of the Champions League. Right now, Europa League is a safer bet.",
      "Thirteen, three, twelve, twenty, sixteen, nineteen. No, not my lottery numbers but the Premier League positions of Manchester United’s next six opponents. Ruben Amorim’s men are in an extended run of fixtures that should propel them into the top four and they have as pleasant a festive schedule as a manager of an elite club could wish for.",
      "There are three away matches in that run but the longest trip is the 88 miles to Villa Park. On paper, that looks to be United’s toughest game before the Manchester derby at the Etihad on January 17, but while there have been some disappointing draws recently, Amorim’s side has lost only once in nine games. Wolves, of course, are cannon fodder. They might well go down as the worst team in Premier League history but scoring four away from home is a confidence-booster.",
      "Amorim will miss Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui when they depart for duty at the African Cup of Nations but other managers are in a similar boat. And the United boss has Benjamin Sesko returning shortly, along with Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire.",
      "Out of the Carabao Cup and not involved in Europe, Amorim also has plenty of time on the training ground to fine-tune his plans. United are no world-beaters but this season’s Premier League does not have a three or four-strong group of powerhouse teams.",
      "The bookmakers currently have United down to finish sixth in the table but they can aim higher than that. Considering the momentum they should get from the next half-dozen matches, Amorim and the United hierarchy should be very, very disappointed if they do not make the top four.",

      "Manchester United returned to winning ways on Monday night as they thrashed Wolverhampton Wanderers 4-1 at Molineux. It ended up being a comfortable night for the Reds with Bryan Mbeumo getting back on the scoresheet alongside a Bruno Fernandes brace and Mason Mount.",
      "United also started Amad and Noussair Mazraoui in the victory which could be an issue for the Reds heading into Christmas and the New Year. Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui are all set to join up with their respective national teams for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) this month.",
      "The exact date of their departure is unknown but it is expected to be sooner rather than later. Following the victory over Wolves, Ruben Amorim remained hopeful the trio would be retained for the Bournemouth game next Monday. He said: \"The club is talking with the national teams. Let's wait for the middle of the week. I don't know for sure, but we are doing our job and the national teams are talking with us and that is a good sign.\"",
      "Mazraoui's Morocco begin their campaign on Sunday, December 21, the same day as the Reds travel to Aston Villa in the Premier League. As for Mbeumo's Cameroon and Amad's Ivory Coast, their AFCON starts a little later on Christmas Eve. As Amorim suggests, the departure dates of the trio shall become clear this week but the plan for what the team will look like after they leave needs to be made now.",
      "So with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a closer look at how the Reds could start without their African trio over the next few weeks. The first port of call is the defence where Mazraoui has been picked ahead of Leny Yoro in recent games. The Frenchman appeared to have the right centre-back position locked down until a tricky spell against Everton and Crystal Palace saw him lose his place in the starting XI.",
      "Yoro has been brought on as a substitute and you would expect with the Moroccan unavailable, he will slot back into the team there. When fully fit, Matthijs de Ligt would join the defence but after Amorim admitted he did not know when the Dutchman would return, in the meantime Ayden Heaven should fill in.",
      "Next is the right wing-back position occupied by Amad. The Ivorian has been the standout wing-back at the club this season, adapting to the position well. Diogo Dalot has shown signs of improvement in recent matches and the natural decision would be to move him over to his preferred right side with Patrick Dorgu recalled on the left.",
      "Dalot and Dorgu have shared responsibilities on the left but the former should look a lot more comfortable on the right in Amad's absence. Arguably the biggest miss will be Mbeumo. He was back on the scoresheet on Monday night and is the Reds' top goalscorer with six goals in the Premier League - ranking him joint fifth in the entirety of the top flight.",
      "Matheus Cunha's return from injury is a positive for United as he can slip into the No.10 role alongside Mason Mount who is enjoying his best stretch of form since moving to Old Trafford from Chelsea. This would mean either Joshua Zirkzee or Benjamin Sesko, when fit, would lead the line.",
      "Amorim said last month Sesko would return around the same time as the players leaving for AFCON would depart. His agent has insisted his return will be 'very soon' but it remains to be seen whether the Slovenian will be back for the first game without the trio.",
      "United starting XI without AFCON trio: Lammens; Yoro, Heaven, Shaw; Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mount, Cunha; Zirkzee",

Kobbie Mainoo is one United star that faces an uncertain future with an update from Napoli on their interest in the midfielder emerging.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is another that has been linked to a departure, but he looks set to remain at Old Trafford having received more minutes over the last few weeks.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee looks set to remain at Manchester United for the remainder of the 2025/26 despite transfer links over a return to Serie A.",
      "Injuries have seen Zirkzee handed more minutes over the last few weeks with that likely to continue as Bryan Mbeumo and Amad depart for AFCON.",
      "Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna has issued a Kobbie Mainoo transfer verdict, when speaking to Football Italia.",
      "He is a player who has been linked to Napoli since August, also for his age, his potential, and the transfer opportunity.",

      "United and Spurs were interested this past summer but he opted to sign a new deal with the Cherries and it seems as though he remains unconvinced on a switch to the latter. According to The Sun, he is 'hesitant' to join Tottenham and would much prefer a move to north London rivals Arsenal.",
      "As a boyhood Gunner, that stance is perhaps no surprise but it does provide a mixed update for United as it could result in one less team being in the race but a clear favourite for Semenyo if Mikel Arteta's side opt to make a play.",

      "Manchester United striker Joshua Zirkzee has reportedly made his intentions clear that he wishes to remain at Old Trafford and compete for his position, despite persistent speculation linking him with a move back to Serie A. The Netherlands international has netted only eight times in 58 outings for United since his transfer from Bologna during the summer of 2024.",
      "Under Ruben Amorim, he has slipped down the hierarchy following the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo at the club. Zirkzee has been continually linked with a potential return to Italy, with AS Roma among the latest clubs reportedly interested in securing his services.",
      "Recent injuries to Sesko and Cunha, however, have provided Zirkzee with an opportunity to feature in Amorim's first team. He started and scored in the dramatic victory at Crystal Palace, marking his first Premier League goal for United this term.",
      "Following that triumph, former Premier League forward Troy Deeney suggested he could outperform Zirkzee, despite having been retired for two years. Speaking on talkSPORT, he said: \"It's really poor again from Zirkzee.",
      "\"I've been retired for two years – Man United give me six weeks and a third of what he's doing and I'm probably sure I can do better.",
      "\"It is embarrassing watching him play at this moment in time. He just looks like a lost soul, an absolute lost soul.\"",
      "However, that strike at Palace caught Deeney off guard and he said: \"He's got no right to score that. I'm questioning the 'keeper, but it's a wonderful finish. We've been giving him grief, and rightly so, but that's a massive moment in his career.",
      "\"I'm flabbergasted that he's done that. It's not even the fact that he scored the goal, it's the fact he's shown you nothing in this game so far that you would even get a shot off.",
      "\"But to even have that level of self-assuredness to even take the shot. The confidence of it is frightening.\"",
      "The United manager was equally complimentary about how Zirkzee executed his goal against the Eagles. Amorim said: \"It's so important for the strikers to score goals. He's not playing many minutes but the way he responds in the second-half is so important.",
      "\"It is more important than just the goals. Again, the small details, win the first ball so we can win the second ball, the connection, that is so important for our game. And the goal is really important for us and for him.\"",
      "Zirkzee featured from the start in the subsequent fixture against West Ham United before appearing as a substitute in the victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers. He remains tied to United until 2029, with the option for a further year.",

      "Thomas Tuchel is not expected to name Mason Mount in his England squad for the World Cup with Ruben Amorim's action plan to get him to the United States failing. The Manchester United ace has had a challenging few years due to injuries, but his recent performances have been commendable.",
      "Mount has scored twice in his last three games and was superb in the 4-1 victory against Wolves this past Monday, earning him the title of player of the match. Just days before that, England learned their World Cup group stage opponents, with Tuchel's team set to face Croatia, Ghana, and Panama.",
      "Several positions in his squad are up for grabs, with the fiercest competition likely to be among the forwards. Mount is among those hoping to secure a spot, although it appears that Tuchel may not favour him for one key reason.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that the contrasting styles of Amorim and the Three Lions' head coach poses a problem in the latter's mind, with discussions between the two camps suggesting that a call-up for Mount is 'highly unlikely'. It's further suggested that regardless of his continued good form, Tuchel is not expected to consider Mount.",
      "Back in November, The Sun reported that the Manchester United head coach had a 'special plan' for the coming months, viewing Mount as England's most underrated player. At the time, it was also claimed that Mount is seen by Amorim as a 'super talent'.",
      "That view that was fully validated in his standout performance against Wolves earlier this week, arguably his best showing for United yet.",
      "More game time being awarded to the former Chelsea star was part of Amorim's action plan with that proven by the 84 minutes he was given against Wolves after a start and goal at Crystal Palace the previous week.",
      "Prior to that, he came on at half-time in United's dismal 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton. Tuchel was in attendance for that fixture and was captured in discussions with his former player in the tunnel after the game in a warm exchange.",
      "Though Amorim believes there's 'no other' England player who can offer what Mount can, Tuchel has seemingly not seen enough to consider him for selection.",
      "With that in mind, Amorim's strategy looks set to backfire, with Mount expected to be overlooked once again, having last represented his country at the 2022 World Cup.",
      "Even though Amorim may be up against it in his tussle with Tuchel, more game time for Mount seems highly likely, given the Portuguese manager's admiration for his display at Molineux.",
      "Amorim stated: \"He can defend, he can attack, the quality when he touches the ball is really good, so it's not a surprise for me.",
      "\"He's a different type of leader. It's not like Licha [Lisandro Martínez], for example. It's a guy that leads by the example.",
      "Bruno Fernandes (x2) and Bryan Mbeumo also found the net in the victory, propelling United up to sixth place thanks to those crucial three points.",

      "The social media sensation and content creator built his reputation, partly, through his support of United and coined his signature cry of 'Yanited' as his following expanded.",
      "The Salford-born jungle champion, whose real name is Morgan Burtwistle, defeated Eastenders star Shona McGarty and presenter Tom Read Wilson in the I'm A Celeb finale.",

      "They allegedly wish to provide him with the opportunity to be honoured for his reality television victory at the Theatre of Dreams. The 24-year-old hadn't always anticipated progressing so far in the jungle and nearly withdrew shortly after his arrival.",
      "He revealed: \"I was debating on the very first day, and I'd only been in there for a couple of hours.",

      "The move has sparked debate at a time when the club is tightening restrictions on season-ticket holders sharing their tickets with others.",
      "Demand for away tickets regularly exceeds supply by a ratio of four to one. United fans must also hold a season ticket for a minimum of four years before becoming eligible to apply for away matches. Littler fails to meet these requirements.",
      "Kit supplier Adidas is understood to have provided complimentary tickets for Littler and his companions. The 18-yea- old world darts champion had taken to Instagram requesting 'three tickets' fewer than 24 hours before kick-off.",

      "Ruben Amorim has confirmed Manchester United remain in talks about keeping Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui to face Bournemouth before they report to the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui started in United's 4-1 victory against Wolves on Monday night, but there is uncertainty surrounding their availability to face Bournemouth next week.",
      "Amorim had previously revealed United were in discussions with the players' respective nations to defer their call ups, and he was asked to clarify the situation after beating Wolves.",
      "The United boss was unable to give a definitive answer again. \"The club is talking with the national teams,\" he explained. \"Let's wait for the middle of the week. I don't know for sure, but we are doing our job and the national teams are talking with us and that is a good sign.\"",
      "Mbeumo scored at the start of the second half against Wolves to restore United's lead. Amorim was pleased with the team's reaction after conceding on the stroke of half-time, saying: \"Once again, after we scored a goal, we were a little bit sloppy on the ball, and that gave a little bit of hope to the opponent, but we created a lot of chances in the first half also.",
      "\"We should have finished that half in the different way. And then in the half-time, they understood that we have everything to win the game, to win three points. And they did that. I think the pace, the quality that we showed in the second half, understanding that the moment of Wolves is really hard as a team, as a club. So we took advantage of that. \"",
      "\"Then this is a specific case we face a team that is really, really struggling and you can sense in every situation of the game. So the next game is going to be completely different.",
      "\"So we need to to know that, but in our club, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter the run that you have, the moment, if you play quite well the last game, what matters is the way we are going to play the next one.",
      "\"Let's focus on that. We need to to improve the way we play. I think we need to find a different way to play sometimes. So we are thinking about that. We are working on that. And Bournemouth is going to be a different world.\"",

      "Ayden Heaven believes \"nobody can stop\" Manchester United if they play as they did against Wolves. United won 4-1 at Molineux in the Premier League on Monday thanks to a second-half rout. It was 1-1 at half-time after an equaliser from Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. Wolves had not scored for five successive Premier League games but broke their duck to get back into the contest.",
      "United responded well to surrendering their advantage and came out swinging in the second half, with Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount getting on the scoresheet to make it 3-1. United captain Bruno Fernandes put the icing on the cake when he converted a penalty to complete his brace.",
      "Heaven retained his starting role at Molineux, despite being hooked against West Ham at the interval last week, and the youngster delivered a significantly improved performance. Speaking in the mixed zone after the game, Heaven said: \"We dropped points in the last game and this was the chance to go and redeem ourselves and get more points. I feel like we did that, especially in the second half. We knew it wasn't good enough that we conceded. He [Amorim] just told us to do what we can do and we did that, as you saw.\"",
      "Heaven believes Amorim showed faith in him by keeping him in the XI. \"There's so many great defenders at this club that he's trusting you to be at the middle of that defence. He’s trusting me a lot,\" he said. \"I feel like I’m working hard every day in training and I’m showing he can trust me in the games that I’m playing. I wouldn’t say it was rust. I felt confident. West Ham are a good team and they started well.",
      "\"I thought I was a good player. I knew that I first had to gain the trust of the manager and slowly I know I’m doing that. I feel like I’m doing well at the moment, but I’ve just got to keep working.\"",
      "The 19-year-old is relishing the chance to work with experienced defensive colleagues. \"I’m enjoying it because knowing you have that experience around you,\" he added. \"You are not scared to go on the front foot and not scared of what you leave behind either. They’re always there when I need them.\"",
      "\"We’ve just got to do what we did today in every game. I don’t think anyone can stop us when we play like this. Of course, playing at Old Trafford [in three of the next four games], you can’t say no to that. It’s a real boost to us and it will work in our favour. We want to win as many games as possible.",
      "\"Hopefully we can be in Europe next season, which I think we'll do. That's where Manchester United belong, so feel like we can just continue how we did today and we’ll be back when we belong.\"",

However, it is understood that German sports manufacturer Adidas, who are tied into a 10-year partnership with the Reds worth £900m, gifted the ticket to Littler.",
      "Adidas receives four tickets for every away game through their partnership with United. In total, a small section of the away allocation, believed to be in the low double digits, are given to commercial partners of the club.",
      "United sources say the vast majority of supporters attending away matches are either season ticket holders or executive club members. Most fans seemed happy to see darts star Littler in the away end.",
      "United captain Bruno Fernandes, who scored twice in United’s biggest win of the season, replied to Littler’s tweet about enjoying his “first away day” with a darts emoji.",
      "Littler and his fellow United fans were treated to a brilliant away trip as the Reds eased to a 4-1 victory against their lowly opponents. Bruno Fernandes opened the scoring in the 25th minute as he scrambled the ball past Sam Johnstone despite losing his footing.",
      "On the stroke of half-time, Wolves scored their first goal since October to level the game when Jean-Ricner Bellegarde fired into the bottom corner. Any United concerns were put to bed early in the second half as Bryan Mbeumo slotted into an open goal after Diogo Dalot broke the offside trap six minutes after the interval.",
      "Mason Mount then fired home from close range to end the game as a contest. Fernandes bagged his second of the game from the penalty spot to seal the three points. The victory moves United up to sixth in the Premier League, just one point outside the top four.",

      "Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have both backed Kobbie Mainoo as the young midfielder continues to be left out of Ruben Amorim’s squad. Mainoo has played just 183 Premier League minutes this season, all coming from the bench, with Amorim yet to start the 20-year-old.",
      "Mainoo has been at United since joining the academy at nine years old, rising through the ranks before breaking into the first team during the 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag. But since Amorim took charge last November, the midfielder has struggled to secure a regular starting role.",
      "Amorim has been firm in his vision for the squad, exiling several first-team players into what became known as the “bomb squad” - Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Tyrell Malacia.",
      "While Mainoo was not part of that group, his limited minutes are starting to raise concern. Across United’s last three matches, he has played just 13 minutes in total. The midfielders situation is starting to get on Scholes' nerves, with the United icon claiming he's so good he's probably 'embarrassing' Casemiro regularly in training.",
      "He told The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast: \"Ruben Amorim has said Kobbie Mainoo is a starter… every appearance he’s made in the Premier League has been as a sub. Things like that wind me up.",
      "\"I wouldn’t mind if he was in a good team and they were winning every week and keeping possession but they’re rubbish. Kobbie is a 20-year-old kid and he’s not playing, he’s going to have to leave. Do you know what will happen now? Amorim will bring him into a game and he won’t be great but that’s because he needs regular games.",
      "\"Fair enough, as a manger sometimes you just don’t fancy a player. But look at what he’s already done – scored the winner in an FA Cup final, played every game in the Euros.",
      "\"I bet he takes the p*** out of Casemiro every single day in training and is brilliant. I don’t know why the club are letting Amorim treat a homegrown talent like that.\"",
      "Casemiro, despite previous criticism, has largely impressed this season and appears to be someone Amorim trusts. But at 33, and with his contract expiring next summer, the Brazilian is not seen as a long-term solution.",
      "Butt is also infuriated with Mainoo's treatment and has hinted at where the midfielder could move to. He said: \"The Kobbie one is an absolute joke. I went to the West Ham game [a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford] and it was an absolute s***show. It was a terrible, boring game\"",
      "\"The player to bring on to change the game, in my opinion, was Kobbie Mainoo – but he didn’t get on the pitch. He’ll be another homegrown player who leaves and is a superstar somewhere else.",
      "\"If Mainoo was playing for another Premier League club, United go and buy him for £70m or £80m. Now we’re going to sell him and he’ll be a superstar elsewhere like McTominay, Elanga, Henderson – we can mention loads of them.",
      "\"We’re getting rid of players who love the football club, it’s mind-boggling. I get the Garnacho one because his attitude and behaviour was terrible but you don’t hear that about Kobbie.",
      "\"He’s a top, top, top player that we are f****** up. Kobbie has got to go. If I’m looking after him I’m telling him “we’re getting you out of that football club”.",
      "\"For his football career he has to leave United, he’s lost 18 months of development. I hope he goes abroad because it’s embarrassing if he goes to Chelsea, which could happen.",
      "\"They might go and get him because they are putting together a very good, young squad and keep buying young players. He could quite easily end up at Chelsea next season.",
      "\"I’ve known Kobbie since he was eight but you wouldn’t be doing him justice if you told him to stay and not to take that move. That’s such a sad thing for me to say.\"",
      "Scholes agreed, saying: \"Do you know what? You’d have to advise him to go [to Chelsea], wouldn’t you? If he rang me and said 'look, Chelsea are interested, what do you think?' I’d say go all day long.\"",

      "\"What the f****** hell was that,\" Wolves fans chanted after Bruno Fernandes' opening goal for Manchester United on Monday night. That was followed by “you’re not fit to wear the shirt.”",
      "United will not play against such a dysfunctional club again this season. Wolves are on course to be the worst team in Premier League history. They had amassed two points from 14 games before Monday and have a strong chance of taking Derby County's record of just 11 points in 2007/08.",
      "It was a non-negotiable for United to leave Molineux with three points, and it was comfortable in the end, despite the visitors' best efforts to give the worst team in the Premier League a chance of getting a result.",
      "United's draw against West Ham meant they have dropped eight points from winning positions in the league this season, the joint third highest in the top flight. Amorim was furious when he spoke after that match, and he still looked agitated on the touchline against Wolves.",
      "\"He'll turn the Reds around,\" was sung just once at Old Trafford last week. The chant was missing from the catalogue in Wolverhampton and '12 Days of Cantona' was aired instead.",
      "United were one of three clubs in the Premier League to have no goals from substitutes so far this season, which must be put down to Amorim's tendency to make conservative changes.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo was named on the bench again. Mainoo scored a special 97th-minute match-winner against Wolves at Molineux in February 2024, when he was still considered an integral part of the team. On this occasion, there was a huge cheer for the youngster when he was introduced near the end.",
      "Cunha returned to Molineux for the first time since joining United and he mistakenly headed for the home team dressing room when he exited the team coach. Cunha milled about, speaking to Wolves staff and former teammates, and looked comfortable at the venue where his career took off.",
      "Ayden Heaven retained his starting role, despite a hellish 45 minutes against West Ham. The defender was hooked at the interval and was bound to be tested again by a physical Jorgen Strand Larsen.",
      "There were hundreds of seats vacant in the Sir Jack Hayward Stand and Stan Cullis Stand. Wolves fans protested against their owners by delaying their entry into the ground, but there were still plenty of gold seats when the demonstration was over and the disenchanted trickled in.",
      "Heaven apologised for a mix-up in communication with Senne Lammens. \"We want Fosun out, we want Fosun out,\" the Wolves protestors chanted. The United fans responded with a vitriolic chant about Joel Glazer.",
      "There was mutiny in the air and Wolves fans could not believe what they had seen when Fernandes fired United into the lead. Cunha under-hit his pass to the skipper and the chance seemed to have gone, but the United captain squirmed the ball in at the front post. It was like a sketch from Benny Hill.",
      "Some fans speculated in the build-up to the game that Wolves had the potential to be Amorim's equivalent of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's visit to Vicarage Road in 2021. Solskjaer was finally put out of his misery after losing against Watford, and a defeat to Wolves would have been a similar nadir for Amorim.",
      "The home side had gone five successive league games without a goal, so United couldn't have had a better opportunity to record just their second clean sheet of the campaign. And they should have put the game to bed once they had taken the lead.",
      "This United side never does anything easily, though. The home side were level on the stroke of half-time thanks to a goal from Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. Amad and Bryan Mbeumo enjoyed a brilliant October, but they regressed at the end of November and both were at the scene of the crime.",
      "The in-game management after taking the lead was dismal. United had experienced international players on the pitch and couldn't control the contest. There is little wonder that the conversation about Amorim's system has resurfaced, but United were able to carve through Wolves like a hot knife through butter when play resumed for the second half, in part because Wolves are shockingly bad.",
      "Not even United could mess up a visit to the league's worst team. Mbeumo slotted into an empty net after a square pass from Diogo Dalot, and Mason Mount scored to gain a two-goal cushion.",
      "Wolves' defending for both goals left plenty to be desired. United got the job done, but there should be concerns that Wolves threatened to make it a contest. The target is to return to the Champions League this season, and a Champions League team would have won with a cricket score.",
      "Fernandes converted a penalty to seal a captain's performance. The Portugal international has not been at his best in recent weeks, but it will be a huge boost if he peaks in the middle of the campaign.",
      "Amorim is hoping to emerge from the winter period without being bowled out and greater tests await in the coming weeks. Thankfully for United, they play Wolves again in just 21 days.",

      "That's without mentioning Chido Obi, who could play in the competition again. Obi is currently recovering from a small injury, but he could feature in the Youth Cup for United for a second season in a row.",

      "The U18s will begin their Youth Cup campaign against Peterborough at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. There should be a reasonable crowd, but it's a shame to see tickets priced at £10 for adults and £5 for children.",
      "Some may argue that Gabriel is worth paying the turnstile fee for. The 15-year-old is regarded as one of the most exciting talents to have ever come through the academy, and United did all they could to keep him in the summer, with Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada involved in a meeting at Carrington.",
      "The 15-year-old has trained with the first team already. It's unusual for a player so young to be given that opportunity, but United believe he could eventually become the face of the club.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Ruben Amorim at Carrington.",
      "During their exchange, Amorim spent time discussing his philosophy and stressed the importance of working hard, even recalling an anecdote about Cristiano Ronaldo as an example.",
      "Kai Rooney has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right [wing]. Left-footed, coming in off the right.\"",

      "There are story lines galore with the U18s this season and they are playing entertaining football, impressively beating Liverpool 7-0 at the end of November (Gabriel scored a hat-trick).",

      "However, Wolves were level at the interval thanks to Jean-Ricner Bellegarde. The home side had not scored for five games, but they broke their duck after a strike from Bellegarde. Wolves were unable to build on that in the second half. United were gifted space in the final third and took advantage, scoring three more goals through Mount, Bryan Mbeumo and a Fernandes penalty.",
      "Amorim was asked whether Mount was now delivering consistently strong performances and here's what he had to say.",
      "\"What the f****** hell was that,\" Wolves fans chanted after Bruno Fernandes' opening goal for Manchester United on Monday night. That was followed by “you’re not fit to wear the shirt.”",
      "United will not play against such a dysfunctional club again this season. Wolves are on course to be the worst team in Premier League history. They had amassed two points from 14 games before Monday and have a strong chance of taking Derby County's record of just 11 points in 2007/08.",
      "It was a non-negotiable for United to leave Molineux with three points, and it was comfortable in the end, despite the visitors' best efforts to give the worst team in the Premier League a chance of getting a result.",
      "Read more here",
      "United are up to sixth with what turned out to be a comfortable win at Wolves.",
      "Here's the player ratings from Molineux with two 8/10s and Bruno Fernandes excellent",
      "There were boos at the full-time whistle, but most Wolves fans had already left Molineux to get home early, and you can't blame them. Wolves are the worst team in the Premier League by some stretch and not even this United side could slip up tonight. Fernandes and Mount were excellent. There will be stiffer tests ahead for United in the coming weeks, but the good news is they play Wolves again at Old Trafford before New Year.",
      "There's the whistle. Ultimately a comfortable evening for United and Ruben Amorim's men are up to sixth and level on points with Chelsea in fifth.",
      "Stay with us for the analysis and reaction and our player ratings will be along shortly",
      "Nine added minutes! Wolves fans and players do not like that!",
      "United can probably find a fifth or maybe a sixth if they really want it.",
      "The Reds are happy playing keep ball at the moment",
      "United take off Mount and Dalot with Zirkzee and Dorgu coming on.",
      "Very good penalty from the skipper as he buries it into the bottom corner",
      "United are worth this lead, they have dominated the second half and aside from a 15 minute spell at the end of the first half, they have outclassed a Wolves side who are going to start this season with no win from 15 league games and surely relegation beckons",
      "Bruno Fernandes scores from the spot.",
      "VAR intervene to send the referee to the monitor for a handball check. It's a spot kick, and it is very similar to one in the first half that was checked and cleared.",
      "Either way the Reds have a spot kick",
      "Here comes Kobbie. He's getting about 12 minutes plus added time.",
      "This is his 10th appearance off the bench for United in the league but his minutes have been sparse.",
      "He's got a chance to impress with the game all but won.",
      "Wolves have made a triple change to try and get back into this but they don't really have the quality to do so.",
      "If United defend properly there is a comfortable win to be had and potentially more goals as well.",
      "Yoro and Martinez replace Mazrouri and Heaven as Amorim, as he often does, changes his backline.",
      "Martinez return to the team being carefully managed after such a lengthy absence",
      "That third goal has knocked a bit of stuffing out of Wolves and United look like scoring with every attack - and there are plenty of them at the moment.",
      "Cunha has had three or four chances on his return to Molineux but hasn't found his radar.",
      "United about to make a double change at the back with Yoro and Martinez ready to come on",
      "Fernandes was denied with an effort but he clips in a lovely pass to Mount who made a fine run into space and finished with aplomb. Lovely volleyed goal from Mount and a super pass from the skipper.",
      "Bit of breathing space for the visitors now. 3-1 should really be enough for three points",
      "Lovely goal, lovely, lovely goal",
      "Wolves cause a bit of panic with a long throw which United just about scramble away.",
      "The home side then put the ball in the mixer again and again United look hesitant and uncertain at the back.",
      "United do not look secure defensively. In fact neither of these teams is doing much for the art of defending",
      "I have no idea where Johnstone was going there.",
      "Dalot was sent through and the keeper opted to come for the ball but was never going to get there allowing the United wing back to square for Mbeumo to tap into an empty net.",
      "United rewarded for a bright start to the second half but dear oh dear that was very poor play from the home side",
      "United are back in front as Mbuemo taps home with Dalot squaring for the frontman with Johnstone miles out of his net",
      "United make the first running of the second period and Cunha does well to fashion himself a yard of space just outside the box but his effort is over the top",
      "Johnstone is then out quickly to smother the ball at Cunha and the ball breaks to Mbeumo with the keeper stranded but Wolves had three or bodies back between player and goal and manage to scramble it away",
      "We are back under way at Molineux",
      "United need to switch back on after conceding right on the stroke of half time",
      "There's the half time whistle. And here are the half time ratings.",
      "Lammens",
      "Couldn’t do much for the goal. 5",
      "Mazraoui",
      "Steady. 5",
      "Heaven",
      "Alright. 5",
      "Shaw",
      "Good again. 6",
      "Amad",
      "Lost his man for the goal. 5",
      "Dalot",
      "Should have scored. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Ok. 5",
      "Fernandes",
      "Scored a comical goal. 6",
      "Mbeumo",
      "Not much quality. 6",
      "Mount",
      "Pressing well. 6",
      "Cunha",
      "Needs to do more. 5",
      "The home side are level in added time. Bellegarde scores and it is very sloppy play from United.",
      "First goal under Rob Edwards for Wolves",
      "United's draw against West Ham meant they have dropped eight points from winning positions in the league this season, the joint third highest in the league. They cannot drop further points tonight. They need a second goal to kill off the game and that will be discussed during half-time.",
      "Home side having their best spell of the game and sending a warning to United that they cannot rest on their laurels.",
      "Lammens hasn't really been forced into a save but there is still a bit of nervousness in that United backline.",
      "Whether Wolves have the quality to exploit it remains to be seen and at the other end, United are a threat every time they attack",
      "Wolves have finally realised they are playing a football match and start to get stuck into a few tackles which in turn rallies the crowd a bit.",
      "But United are carrying the greater threat. Dalot delivers a wonderful ball in which is turned behind for a corner.",
      "Then Amad gets a shot away which is deflected behind",
      "Mbeumo races clear in between two defenders and his poked effort is kept out by Johnstone.",
      "Ball falls to Cunha and his effort is hacked off the line and Amad turns the rebound wide.",
      "United can put this game to bed before the break if they go for the juggular here",
      "That was a comical goal. The chance looked to have been wasted, but Fernandes found a way to squirm the ball in at the front post.",
      "\"What the f****** hell was that,\" the home fans chant, which is followed by “you’re not fit to wear the shirt.”",
      "The Wolves fans are raging and rightly so. That was the kind of goal you expect a child’s grassroots football team to concede.",
      "Amorim was unhappy minutes before, screaming at the attack to press with more energy, but he should have a smile on his face now United have taken the lead.",
      "Well how do you explain that. Wolves hold onto the ball for an age, get the pocket picked and then Fernandes, in the box, falls over and still somehow gets up and scuffs a shot goalwards which somehow gets past Johnstone at his near post and dribbles in.",
      "Bruno Fernandes opens the scoring. Possibly the scrapiest goal you will ever see but United won't care. They lead"

      "Manchester United have confirmed Jonny Evans has stepped down from his role as head of loans and pathways. Evans took up the position in June following his retirement as a player, but he has left after six months. He was responsible for arranging loans for youngsters and worked closely with Jason Wilcox to 'enhance processes which maximise individual player development and prepare young talent to perform in the first-team'.",
      "When Evans was appointed, he said in a statement: “I am looking forward to working with the next generation of talented players to support them to reach their potential.\" However, the 37-year-old has decided to leave to spend more time with his family, and it's understood he will now take time away from the game before deciding what to do next.",
      "United sources have said the departure is amicable and Evans leaves with the best wishes of everyone at the club. Evans' transition into the role had confirmed the end of his playing career. The defender enjoyed two stints at United after coming through the club's academy and made 241 appearances for the Reds.",
      "The Northern Irishman won the Champions League, three Premier League titles, the FA Cup and two League Cups with United, while he made a total of 536 career appearances. Evans earned 107 caps for Northern Ireland and was awarded an MBE in 2023 for his services to football.",

      "James Maddison has backed Kobbie Mainoo to get back to his best and return to a \"really high level\", despite Ruben Amorim's latest Manchester United snub. Tottenham midfielder Maddison was speaking about Mainoo after Amorim once again left the England international on the bench for United's trip to Wolves on Monday night.",
      "Mainoo, 20, hasn't started a single Premier League match for United in 2025/26. He has played just 171 minutes in the top flight and was left as an unused substitute during Thursday's 1-1 draw against West Ham at Old Trafford.",
      "In his pre-Wolves press conference, Amorim defended his decision to give Mainoo limited game time this season. Asked if he understood why Mainoo's status as a homegrown English player made him of specific interest, Amorim said: \"Of course I understand, and my job is to answer. But you always ask me the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in]. It's my decision.\"",
      "Maddison responded: \"Yeah, definitely. It wasn't that long ago he was starting in the Euros for England. I remember Kobbie's first start for England was a game I came on as a sub in and I was very impressed with how composed he was and the occasion just didn't get to him at all.",
      "\"He is good on the ball and calm. A player with that much quality and assurance on the ball, I don't see any way how he doesn't get back to a really high level.\"",
      "Meanwhile, after Mainoo was snubbed against West Ham, a furious Paul Scholes took to Instagram to vent his frustration at Amorim. \"Bulls***,\" Scholes posted in response to Amorim, who said last week he views Mainoo as a starter. \"The kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football. Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "Mainoo was named on a nine-man United bench to face Wolves, with the midfielder alongside fellow academy graduate Shea Lacey. Altay Bayindir, Patrick Dorgu, Tyrell Malacia, Lisandro Martinez, Leny Yoro, Manuel Ugarte and Joshua Zirkzee made up the Reds substitutes.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Manchester United will sign a central midfielder and Antoine Semenyo should replace Mohamed Salah at Liverpool. It’s going to be an eventful January.",
      "We’re also expecting moves for Real Madrid wonderkid Endrick and Red Devils outcast Kobbie Mainoo, while there’s an outside chance Spurs lose one of their best players.",
      "In order of least to most likely to come off, we have predicted the 10 biggest transfers in the January transfer window.",
      "",
      "Very unlikely, isn’t it? But not completely out of the question. That’s good enough for us.",
      "Real Madrid need a new centre-back and Van de Ven is reportedly one of their top targets. The major issue is that he’d cost a fortune, and Los Blancos have plenty of cheaper options like Marc Guehi, Dayot Upamecano and Ibrahima Konate, though the latter is reportedly no longer an option because he is actually a bit s**t.",
      "If it weren’t for those three future free agents, Spurs would be in serious danger of losing Van de Ven to their least favourite customer.",
      "",
      "Arsenal are definitely keen on signing Elche youngster Mendoza, but there’s plenty of competition. Juventus are in the race. Manchester United are also there.",
      "He’s really established himself as one of Elche’s most important players and has a release clause worth a measly £17.5million, triggering Sambi Lokonga flashbacks. Just like the Belgian, he’s a young midfielder with sky-high potential who has broken into a decent team’s starting XI and is available for between £15m-20m.",
      "There’s a decent chance this transfer comes off… but an even bigger chance it happens at the end of the season, not in January.",
      "",
      "Chelsea need a goalkeeper. They also, somehow, still need a striker. But they probably need a goalkeeper more. You can’t change Robert Sanchez’s position or style, but Enzo Maresca can try lots of things to bring the best out of Joao Pedro.",
      "For some completely bizarre and unknown reason, Chelsea were stingy in their pursuit of Maignan last summer. It was blatantly obvious he would be an upgrade on Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen, yet they didn’t want to pay more than £13m. Milan wanting closer to £20m is completely reasonable; he’s an elite goalkeeper, but because he’s 30 years old and out of contract next summer, the Blues said no to a clear upgrade.",
      "They could right their wrongs in January, and we really think they should. But because Chelsea are a silly and unpredictable club, they probably won’t bother.",
      "",
      "Toney might actually be good enough to break West Ham’s striker curse. But with every Ivan Toney transfer link, Spurs must get a mention.",
      "Spurs could do with another No.9 if Dominic Solanke remains crocked, but if he can get back and compete with an in-form Richarlison, who has scored 17 goals in his last 24 Premier League starts, then Toney would be a waste of money.",

Niclas Fullkrug is likely returning to Germany, and Toney would be a significant upgrade, capable of being the target man West Ham thought Fullkrug was, and the hard-working fox in the box Wilson was in his pomp.",
      "The rumours are there. Toney returning to the Premier League in January is a big possibility.",
      "",
      "Unfortunately for Manchester United fans, Mainoo doesn’t have a future under Ruben Amorim. It’s nothing to do with his conduct or even performances, but purely because he’s competing with club captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot.",

      "Arne Slot should not risk waiting until the end of 2025/26 to try and sign the Eagles captain on a free transfer with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich among the clubs circling. They should be ruthless in January to ensure they get their man. And we actually think they will.",

      "Despite Mainoo’s lack of minutes, it’s quite likely United will offload him and sign Gallagher, potentially on loan, despite Gallagher arguably being a worse player.",
      "Gallagher has a bigger engine and is much more versatile than young Mainoo. He definitely suits Amorim’s system more and is capable of playing with Fernandes rather than fighting a battle that’s impossible to win.",
      "There’s definitely no smoke without fire here, yet it’s unclear if United and Atletico will negotiate a loan or permanent transfer. A loan probably suits the former, while the latter will prefer to sell. Ideal, then.",
      "Amorim needs a new central midfielder and is also targeting Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba. Gallagher represents a much cheaper alternative, and someone whose true transfer value won’t be massively inflated in January.",

      "Liverpool are the favourites but won’t like that Manchester City are interested. Spurs are as well, but that’s far less intimidating. Apparently Semenyo likes Arsenal, but Arsenal have too many forwards right now, so that makes little sense.",
      "So yes, it’s going to be Liverpool.",
      "After spending over £400m in the summer, the Reds are oddly light in attack and, after an incredible Mohamed Salah meltdown, now need to sign a starting right-winger. Not a back-up to the Egyptian. An actual replacement.",
      "There are more appealing options than Semenyo, like Michael Olise, but the Bayern Munich star is never leaving in January. So Semenyo for his £65m release clause will have to do, taking Liverpool’s season expenditure to the £500m mark. They can’t finish outside the Champions League spots after that, FFS.",

      "Endrick has a gargantuan 11 minutes played for Real Madrid this season despite being available for selection. Xabi Alonso clearly doesn’t fancy him and a loan exit in January is guaranteed.",

      "",
      "There is a chance Salah is reintegrated into the Liverpool team after losing his mind following three consecutive Premier League starts on the bench. It was such a reasonable reaction to such disgusting treatment, wasn’t it?",
      "After the Africa Cup of Nations, Salah is off. He’s gone. His Liverpool career will reach a very sad conclusion.",
      "Saudi Arabia has been trying to sign him for years, and they’ll surely finally get their man. Salah’s inflated ego might get in the way. Maybe he fancies staying in Europe, but who will take a punt on him? It’s all very Cristiano Ronaldo in 2022.",
      "And the result of that Ronaldo drama was a pride-swallowing, albeit very lucrative, transfer to Saudi Arabia.",

      "Manchester United could become the perfect destination for young talents at major clubs who are struggling to break into the first team.",
      "Players like Ethan Nwaneri and Endrick simply aren’t playing enough, and for all of United’s issues in recent years, they would still represent an ambitious and exciting move for any prospect.",
      "A recent report – believe it or not – claims Ruben Amorim is a big admirer of Arsenal wonderkid Nwaneri and wants to take advantage of the Gunners’ need to sell a valuable player after spending over £850million across the last five summer transfer windows.",
      "Nwaneri is one of five young players at big clubs who could be vulnerable to a Manchester United approach – including another Hale End graduate and a Real Madrid starlet.",
      "",
      "Manchester United’s top transfer priority is signing a new central midfielder, but if a player with Nwaneri’s potential becomes available and is open to a transfer, you absolutely have to be all over it.",
      "Right now, Nwaneri’s pathway into the Arsenal starting XI is blocked by some outstanding players. He signed a new contract earlier this year and will have been briefed on the club’s transfer plans, but there’s no doubt he would have been promised more than one start across 21 Champions League and Premier League games.",
      "The 18-year-old has certainly taken his Carabao Cup chances, playing every minute as Arsenal knocked out Port Vale and Brighton, scoring against the latter in a 2-0 win.",
      "But he has played only 20 minutes across Arsenal’s last eight league matches and has been an unused substitute eight times. Yes, he’s young, and yes, he has still logged significant minutes for someone his age in a team as strong as Mikel Arteta’s, but there comes a point where you wonder whether your long-term future lies in a squad containing Ebere Eze and Martin Odegaard. He’s not starting ahead of either of them if they’re fit.",
      "Nwaneri has played most of his minutes on the right wing, but it appears one of the promises made to him was the chance to feature more centrally, with Noni Madueke’s arrival all but confirming that.",
      "Nwaneri would fit very nicely as one of Ruben Amorim’s wide 10s, which is a hybrid between a right winger and an attacking midfielder: the two roles that best suit him. It’s almost a position made for him. We’re not sure he has the work rate or defensive instincts to play as a wing-back, and that Arjen Robben-style cut-in onto his left foot is irresistible.",
      "United would need to cough up a significant fee to sign one of Hale End’s most exciting recent graduates, and if he does leave Arsenal, they’ve got his younger brother ready to break through, because of course they do.",
      "",
      "From one Hale End prodigy to another, could Lewis-Skelly boost his England chances by switching to Manchester United?",
      "Naturally a central midfielder, the 18-year-old has played all his senior football at left-back, and he’s actually very good there. Good enough to break quickly into the England team and keep an injury-prone Riccardo Calafiori out of the XI for most of last season in both the Premier League and Champions League.",
      "Those minutes and performances in 2024/25 are leaving people baffled by his reduced playing time this term, but they should actually be the reason everyone calms down. He’s only 19 and has already played the workload of a 21-year-old. It’s hardly a disaster that he hasn’t started as much now Calafiori is fit and flying, though the Italian’s poor outing at Aston Villa could open the door again.",
      "Lewis-Skelly loves being at Arsenal, and a lack of minutes this season won’t change that. What could change that is genuine interest from Manchester United.",
      "He could use his left-back experience to become a very useful midfield option in Amorim’s 3-4-2-1. He has the engine, the technical ability, and the defensive grounding, albeit from a different role and against different types of players. Left-wing-back is also viable, and there’s no doubt he would be an upgrade on Patrick Dorgu, even if the Dane is an Amorim signing and only 21 himself.",
      "It’s a long shot, but what a signing he would be for United.",
      "",
      "We move away from Arsenal but stay in London as we assess George’s chances of leaving Stamford Bridge for Old Trafford.",
      "An out-and-out winger who can also play as a centre-forward, that versatility makes the 19-year-old an intriguing option in one of Amorim’s wide 10 roles.",
      "Most of George’s minutes last season came in the Europa Conference League, and that pattern has continued, making four appearances in Chelsea’s six Champions League matches, including starts against Benfica and Qarabag. But as the competition progresses and Chelsea raise the stakes, it’s unlikely he’ll continue playing significant European minutes. He didn’t get off the bench in Tuesday’s 2-1 defeat at Atalanta – Chelsea’s biggest Champions League game of the season.",
      "He hasn’t made any of Enzo Maresca’s last six Premier League matchday squads and was almost sold to Fulham in the summer. A departure in 2026 feels inevitable.",
      "George is less of a sure thing than Lewis-Skelly or Nwaneri, but the talent and ceiling are obvious. His ability to play across the frontline makes him valuable, and he could operate effectively on either flank under Amorim.",
      "A January move makes less sense given United have no European football to help integrate him, but they should be back in continental action in 2026/27.",
      "There’s no doubt Old Trafford would be a far better environment for his development than Chelsea, who literally tried to sell him a few months ago.",
      "",
      "When Levi Colwill returns from injury, there’s a chance Acheampong becomes a forgotten man at Stamford Bridge. Again. There were discussions about selling him last summer, but Colwill’s ACL injury changed everything.",
      "As a defender capable of playing right, left, and centre-back, Acheampong is someone who could thrive in a back three. He has wing-back potential but could easily become an elite wide centre-back in a system like Amorim’s… if it only looked slightly more functional.",
      "The 19-year-old is highly rated at Chelsea and would likely cost a significant fee, but there’s a good chance he’d be worth every penny. Considering his potential, Chelsea would likely want at least £30million. But with the size of their squad, they may feel inclined to accept a semi-reasonable offer.",
      "United already have a few good young centre-backs in Leny Yoro, Ayden Heaven and Tyler Fredricson, though the latter feels more like an emergency option. Acheampong would come in as the second-best of the group behind Yoro, or debatably first, ahead of the Frenchman.",
      "Fredricson is a promising 20-year-old who played in the latter stages of last season, which only underlines the need for more defensive depth.",
      "Harry Maguire is out of contract at the end of the season, though reports suggest Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Amorim want to keep him longer, so there’s a strong chance United invest in a new central defender next summer. Why shouldn’t it be Acheampong?",
      "",
      "And why shouldn’t Manchester United throw their hat into the ring for Brazil and Real Madrid wonderkid Endrick?",
      "It’s a transfer that makes a lot of sense. Endrick’s idol is Sir Bobby Charlton. He is struggling to break into the first team at the world’s biggest club, and there is clear interest from one of the world’s top three most iconic clubs.",
      "Amorim has some stellar attacking options now; Mason Mount is impressing, Benjamin Sesko will return from injury, and Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are settling in well, but the Portuguese head coach could still do with more attacking depth, even if signing a central midfielder is the top priority.",
      "There is reportedly interest from Lyon, with Madrid understandably preferring a loan for the 19-year-old. But United could throw a cat among the pigeons by making a cheeky enquiry.",
      "Endrick wants to become Brazil’s main man, and that’s impossible when he has played just 11 minutes for Real Madrid this season. He has been an unused substitute 15 times!",
      "A loan move in January seems the most likely outcome, but of all the players mentioned here, Endrick will have the shortest patience and is surely the most fed up…by a country mile.",

      "Much like Aston Villa probably didn’t consider the prospect of making sure to not even accidentally use Harvey Elliott in five more of their possible 41 games in all competitions for fear of Liverpool coming calling for a £35m bill, Unai Emery likely didn’t intend to lie to the player’s face on what was presumably their first meeting.",
      "“All the best,” said the Spaniard in a video posted to the club’s social channels after the summer transfer window closed. “All the best for you, because then all the best is for us as well.”",
      "Their “all the best” has been the worst-case scenario for a 22-year-old who has not featured since October 2 or even made a Premier League matchday squad since October 19.",
      "If anyone would be forgiven for ranting to the media about their perceived poor treatment, it’s the player who left Liverpool in search of more game time and has somehow contrived to find even less. Elliott has been thrown under the open-top bus parade Villa are presumably planning for their upcoming Treble.",
      "But he would ultimately have no leg to stand on with his complaints. While it is curious that Villa committed to such a deal for a player they have almost immediately discarded, any questioning of Emery’s decisions or methods can be counteracted by the results, the performances and the ongoing transformation of a mess he inherited three years ago.",
      "The manager’s fundamental argument, before contemplating the tactical intricacies and other specifics, is that “there are other players performing very well”.",
      "Emiliano Buendia has, in a nutshell, completely f**ked everyone over this season. There is even a Ross Barkley-shaped spanner in the works that few might have foreseen.",
      "But also ahead of Elliott in the pecking order for the positions behind Ollie Watkins is another Big Six loan cast-off who is quietly proving his worth.",
      "Jadon Sancho still has not started a Premier League game for Villa. He was a substituted substitute in his longest top-flight appearance for them so far, and sits uncomfortably between Marco Bizot and Victor Lindelof in terms of minutes played for the club in all competitions this season.",
      "Just a fortnight ago it was written on the BBC that borrowing Sancho and Elliott was ‘looking like expensive mistakes for everyone’. But their situations are not even close to comparable. The former has maximised his scant opportunities in a way the latter has been unable to do.",
      "There was inevitable social media mockery over the original 007 reprising his role with another cameo in which he neither scored nor assisted against Arsenal. But his impact was clear: in the quickly-taken throw-in which maintained Villa pressure before the goal; in his nimble footwork and pass in the build up; in his back-post header which prompted a scramble and ultimately forced the winner.",
      "In the 133 minutes Sancho has spent on a Premier League pitch this season – against Arsenal, Manchester City, Sunderland, Liverpool and Bournemouth, as well as Leeds and Wolves, Aston Villa have scored four times and not conceded once.",
      "Only Ethan Nwaneri – with eight goals for and zero against during his on-field time for Arsenal this season – has a better such record.",
      "It is humble progress for one of the worst Manchester United signings who actual Chelsea spent £5m specifically not to make their problem, but Emery is using Sancho to form some of his Villa solutions.",
      "The same cannot currently be said of Elliott, whose reserve-rotting remains a strange sub-plot in this remarkable campaign.",
      "Villa took a burden off Manchester United with no strings attached beyond this season, and might have already seen enough to make him their own in the summer. They stole a potential jewel from Liverpool with an obligation to buy and are – much like Chelsea did with Sancho – desperately checking the fine print for a way out.",
      "At least Elliott knows now that “all the best” is not actually a binding commitment for a prosperous life together.",
      "Man United have been linked with Ethan Nwaneri, and they could be an ideal destination for these out-of-favour wonderkids, including two Arsenal stars.",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Roma have taken pole position in the race for Joshua Zirkzee, with direct negotiations now underway between the Italian club and Manchester United, as TEAMtalk reveals the latest on his future amid rival interest from the Premier League.",
      "Sources in Rome and Manchester confirm contact between the clubs as the Serie A side accelerate plans to terminate Evan Ferguson’s loan from Brighton and install the Dutch striker as their new focal point in January.",
      "Zirkzee, 24, has started only three Premier League games this season and, despite Ruben Amorim’s public praise for his versatility, finds himself behind the injured Benjamin Sesko in the pecking order.",
      "United’s hierarchy, keen to streamline the attack around Sesko long-term and raise funds for a supporting forward, remain open to offers around €35-40m (£30.6-£35m, $40.7-$46.5m), or a loan with a mandatory purchase clause.",
      "Roma’s sporting director, Frederic Massara, views Zirkzee as the final piece of an attacking overhaul. Artem Dovbyk has failed to hit expected heights, and Ferguson has struggled, prompting the Giallorossi to potentially pull the trigger early on the Irishman’s loan from Brighton.",
      "Zirkzee, who exploded onto the scene with 11 goals for Bologna in 2023/24, before his £36.5m switch to United, has already signalled his willingness to return to Serie A and reunite with the league that showcased his elegant hold-up play and eye for goal.",
      "While Roma push hardest, they are not alone, facing competition from other Italian giants and four Premier League sides…",
      "READ NEXT 🤔 Who will leave Man Utd first: Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo or Manuel Ugarte?",
      "AC Milan continue to monitor Zirkzee, while Juventus and Inter retain interest in a cut-price deal.",
      "West Ham lead a pack of Premier League sides – joined by Brighton, Aston Villa, and Everton in the race – ready to pounce if United lower their demands.",
      "Sevilla and PSV Eindhoven complete the chasing pack, though momentum currently lies firmly with Roma.",
      "With Ferguson’s exit all but confirmed and personal terms unlikely to be an obstacle, the next fortnight will decide whether Zirkzee boards a flight to Rome or remains at Carrington.",
      "One thing is certain: after a difficult six months in Manchester, regular football – and with it a realistic shot playing for the Netherlands at the 2026 World Cup – is now within touching distance.",
      "Meanwhile, TEAMtalk transfer insider Graeme Bailey has revealed that Manchester City are favourites ahead of United to sign Bahia striker Dell, who has drawn comparisons with Erling Haaland.",
      "The 17-year-old has emerged as one of the stories of the Under-17 World Cup, where he finished as the third top-scorer in Qatar, clinching the Bronze boot, and United scouts were impressed with his performances.",
      "However, with Bahia being a City Group side, the Cityzens have an ace card as they consider bringing him to the Etihad.",
      "In other news, TEAMtalk correspondent Dean Jones has reported that United sources are confident they have the capability to match Antoine Semenyo’s £65m release clause in January.",

      "Man Utd will need to beat Bournemouth next Monday to convince supporters that it wasn’t a flash in the pan after recent inconsistent form.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS backed Ruben Amorim with over £200m worth of new signings over the summer and they are set to support the Portuguese head coach again in January.",
      "A midfielder is top of their list with a number of players linked to fill that void but Man Utd could have to look for low-cost options and save money for the summer.",
      "And that could apply to potentially bringing in a new defender too with Spanish website Fichajes insisting that INEOS will ‘go all out’ for Ramos, who has recently left Mexican outfit Monterrey after they were eliminated in the Mexican Apertura semi-finals.",
      "READ: Worst Premier League player at every club in 25/26: Liverpool’s £125m flop, Man Utd target…",
      "Three days after their exit, Ramos announced his departure from the club with his contract coming to an end, the Spaniard said: “It’s never easy to say goodbye. A stage of my career that began with so much excitement in February has come to an end.",
      "“It has allowed me to discover a new country, a new city, a new style of football and has left me with so many new experiences and, more importantly, new friends.”",
      "Ramos continued: “I have left everything on the pitch and off it to be able to give my very best. I’ll always look back fondly on this stage of my career.”",
      "Fichajes adds that Real Madrid legend Ramos ‘will not continue playing in Mexico and everything indicates that he will head to the Premier League with Manchester United’.",
      "On Ramos, the report continues: ‘Among the options he’s considering, Manchester United has emerged as the most likely destination. The Old Trafford club has been working for weeks on an offer capable of enticing the veteran defender, who is keen on the possibility of joining a historic team that needs to bolster its defence. With a young squad in the midst of a rebuilding process, Sergio Ramos’s arrival would be seen as a move of enormous impact both on and off the pitch.’",
      "Man Utd will ‘offer him a short-term contract with attractive terms, including a competitive salary and a key role in the decisive stretch of the Premier League season’."

      "Courtesy of WhoScored’s average match ratings, here is the worst player at each Premier League club in 2025/26.",
      "We can’t be saying some bench fodder is a club’s worst player, so you can only qualify if you’ve started at least six games this season.",
      "Liverpool’s is a summer signing, Arsenal’s is a surprise, and Brighton’s is still reeling after not getting his big move. Here goes…",
      "",
      "Premier League leaders Arsenal can’t look at a single player and say: ‘You must improve.’ Maybe Ebere Eze? When he isn’t soaked in North London Derby narrative, he’s not really been that great.",
      "But he’s not Arsenal’s player. Raya is Arsenal’s player. This is despite him leading the Premier League Golden Glove race. Maybe you lose points for slamming the ground like a child. Who knows how the algorithm works?",
      "",
      "Signed from Nice for £26million in the summer, Guessand has zero goals and one assist in 11 Premier League appearances for Villa.",
      "",
      "Smith was Bournemouth’s representative throughout most of last season. We said they had to sign a new right-back, but then they had to sign a new centre-back. And then a left-back. And then another centre-back. So then a new right-back became an afterthought.",
      "Andoni Iraola did sign Alex Jimenez, but he’s only 20 years old, so Smith has been called upon frequently this campaign. Sharing the right-back load is probably the way to go.",
      "",
      "With only one goal contribution in 15 games, Yarmoliuk has not done enough offensively but looks like a tidy player.",
      "",
      "His failed transfer to Manchester United has clearly had a detrimental effect on Baleba’s form, and he is playing his way out of his dream move.",
      "There’s no doubt that Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are now favoured by the United hierarchy. It’s time to get your s**t together, son.",
      "",
      "After looking like they’d be competitive all season, Burnley have just gone off the boil a bit. We’re suddenly fearful that the Clarets and Wolves will continue to fade away and the relegation battle will be a lot less exciting than initially expected.",
      "",
      "In exactly six Premier League starts, Delap hasn’t registered a goal or assist for Chelsea. He’s now out for around six weeks and won’t be the Blues’ representative here much longer, because six starts soon won’t be enough to merit an inclusion.",
      "",
      "This feels harsh. But a 6.70 average rating doesn’t feel wrong for Pino. Palace have just been that good this season. The Spaniard has one goal and one assist in 13 appearances.",
      "",
      "It’s hardly surprising that Barry – who didn’t register a shot on target until his 14th Everton appearance and only scored his first goal on matchday 15 – is Everton’s ‘worst’ player in 2025/26.",
      "",
      "King’s average rating might be a bit pants but he’s still shown plenty of promise this season.",
      "",
      "After joining last summer, Perri didn’t get off to the best start, nor the worst. Then he got injured. And because his start to life at Leeds was so meh, Daniel Farke felt no need to rush him back, putting his faith in Karl Darlow. And now Perri is playing again, but conceding a whole heap of ghoals.",
      "",
      "Almost any player would’ve been funny, but Isak might be the funniest option of all. The Mo Salah narrative is already so strong that we are fine with it not being him. Florian Wirtz has been awful, Alisson is conceding goals for fun, and Milos Kerkez is really struggling. But the floppiest flop in Premier League flopsville is a beauty, really.",
      "The most expensive player in Premier League history has one goal and one assist (which was an accident) in eight league appearances for Liverpool. He’s looked off the pace since minute one. All after the biggest saga of the summer transfer window and burning all of his bridges with Newcastle United. It isn’t easy to have any sympathy.",
      "",
      "City legend Silva is still someone Pep Guardiola heavily relies on, starting 11 times in the Premier League and featuring in all 15 matches. He’s not been amazing by any stretch, but a 6.62 isn’t that bad.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim enjoys changing his centre-backs in every game, which can be detrimental to one’s match rating. Yoro has played in all 15 of United’s league matches this term, starting nine times.",
      "",
      "We’re hardly surprised by Elanga’s inclusion. For £55million, his output has been nowhere near good enough. His end product has lacked all season, and Jacob Murphy might have already usurped him in Eddie Howe’s pecking order.",
      "",
      "Wood hasn’t played since October 18 but was pretty rubbish up to that point. He scored a brace against Brentford on matchday one but those are his only two goals in eight Premier League matches. At this point last season, he had 10 goals and Forest were fifth in the table.",
      "",
      "Sunderland have been the Premier League’s surprise package this season, making the inclusion of any player feel harsh, but it has to be someone. And that someone is young Belgian attacker Talbi.",
      "",
      "Kolo Muani is yet to score or assist in six Premier League starts for Spurs and is their worst-rated player with and without an appearance restriction. Their best, if you’re wondering, is Mohammed Kudus.",
      "",
      "It was anyone’s guess who West Ham’s player would be, and as Niclas Fullkrug (6.17) only has five starts, it’s Soucek.",
      "",
      "Jeez. Only one player? Wolves, as a collective, have been an abomination this season.",
      "Relegation is pretty much guaranteed for a club with two points from 15 Premier League games. And they’re being let down by two of their better players, with Andre and Jorgen Strand Larsen (6.27) massively underperforming.",
      "Andre’s error for Manchester United’s opening goal at Molineux on Monday was both calamitous and hilarious, contributing to one of the worst goals of all time.",
      "Not one Wolves player can hold their head up right now. It’s been pathetic all across the board. Though there is an argument that they’ve been massively let down by the ownership, who didn’t have a good summer transfer window. And now Andre and Strand Larsen are tanking their value. Ideal."

      "Amorim announced publicly that Mainoo would be competing with captain Bruno Fernandes for a starting berth this season, leading to the Man Utd midfielder looking for a way out before the summer transfer deadline.",

      "READ: Rio Ferdinand tells Man Utd to make extraordinary ‘public’ offer for Liverpool star",

      "“For his football career he has to leave Man United. He has lost 18 months of development.",
      "“I hope he goes abroad, it is embarrassing if he goes to Chelsea. They might go and get him, as they are putting together a very good young squad. They keep buying young players and the right good young players.",
      "“You think he could quite easily end up at Chelsea next season.”",
      "Scholes responded: “You would have to advise him to go. If he rang me and said ‘I think Chelsea are in for me what do you think’, I’d say ‘all day long’.”",
      "He added: “He is a 20 year old kid, he is going to have to leave. What will happen know is he’ll bring him into a game and he won’t be great, because he needs five, six, seven, eight games. He’ll throw him into the team and say ‘I told you so’.",
      "“No-one [in the hierarchy] gets the club. You think of the treatment of Kobbie Mainoo. He’s not playing, fair enough, sometimes as a manager you don’t fancy a player.",

      "And now Arena Napoli claim that ‘progress’ has been made with Mainoo from the Serie A side over a potential January deal with the website also bringing an update from Sky Sport journalist Luca Marchetti.",
      "On the current state of negotiations over the Man Utd midfielder, Marchetti said: “Regarding the midfielder, Napoli is considering the timing of Anguissa’s return, before taking action. They’ll try to make changes in midfield, as Manna recently reiterated. As for the various deals, they’ll need to figure out what exits there will be: for roster reasons or purely financial reasons.",
      "‘Napoli needs to figure out how to proceed quickly, because they need reinforcements numerically. If they were to sign someone at the end of the transfer window, then they’d be closer to Anguissa’s return, and the matter would be less urgent. If you want someone on January 2nd, you have to move now. This also applies to the Englishman.”",
      "As well as his comments on Mainoo, Scholes added that he doesn’t think Man Utd boss Amorim “gets” the club, he said: “I don’t think the manager gets this club, full stop. I just don’t think he’s the right man.",
      "“Man United is about risk and entertainment more than anything, at home having fans on their seat f***ing ready to go, wingers who beat people, shots on goal. There is nothing there.",
      "“That’s from the club, we talk about how it is a different club. They’ve got Omar Berrada, Jason Wilcox, who are probably brilliant at what they do, but they are not Man United, they don’t have a clue what it is like to buy a Man United player and bring a Man United manager in.",
      "“If you go to Sporting Lisbon and watch, they play three at the back, right away that is a no as Man United never do that. You can’t do that, it has been proven over years and years. I am talking even before Sir Alex Ferguson. It was always about 4-4-1-1 or 4-4-2 and entertaining people.",
      "“He has not got that in him. That’s why I’m saying Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, they have probably gone out and watched Sporting Lisbon. How can they think that is a Man United manager?",
      "“He brought four defenders on against West Ham. If we go 1-0 up, the manager always said 2, 3, 4. He just doesn’t get it, I don’t think anyone at the club gets Man United.",

      "A perfect Champions League record would land clubs a minimum of £115m this season, with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City due more with TV payments.",
      "There is a reason that eight of Europe’s biggest spenders in the 2025 transfer window came from the Premier League, including all six Champions League qualifiers: prize money.",
      "The levels of money on offer in numerous competitions are preposterous and perhaps no more so than in the Champions League, in which clubs can earn well in excess of nine figures.",
      "",
      "As part of the revamped formats for their three main competitions, UEFA have announced a revenue distribution system for how the total prize money of around £2.88billion would be allocated each season up to 2026/27.",
      "Just over £2.1bn (74.38%) will be distributed to clubs competing in the Champions League and Super Cup, £490.7m (17.02%) to teams participating in the Europa League, and £247.5m (8.6%) split between those in the Europa Conference League.",

      "2) Performance-related fixed amounts (£793.6m/37.5%) – £1.8m per each league phase win, £608,000 per each league phase draw and £238,000 per each league phase position, going up in increments from the team in 36th receiving £238,000 and the team in 1st receiving £8.57m.",
      "Undistributed amounts from each league phase draw – £608,000 – are also allocated proportionately to these ranking payments at the end of the league phase, so the prize money for positions will be higher.",
      "There is also extra money on offer for finishing in the top eight and for coming between 9th and 16th. This is how Liverpool made a fortune despite being knocked out in the last 16.",
      "3) The ‘value pillar’ (£740.6m/35%) – a combination of payments based on club coefficient rankings and the TV pool. This can be harder to accurately calculate but will naturally reward the ‘bigger’ clubs and traditional elite.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and the Premier League’s four regular European qualifiers in Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal would be the biggest winners here, with Qarabag, Pafos and Kairat due more modest sums.",
      "A rough estimation of all 36 participating clubs’ value pillar payments will be factored into the final prize money total, which for a few clubs should far exceed £100m.",
      "There is also a fixed fee of £3.73m for all clubs eliminated in the qualification play-offs before the commencement of the league phase. That is for the Celtics and Rangers’ of this world.",

      "Arsenal ‘need to sell a valuable player’ due to financial rules, and Manchester United are ready to capitalise by signing one of their best youngsters, according to reports.",
      "Mikel Arteta’s side spent over £250million last summer and are reportedly walking a financial tightrope, much like Manchester United have been for a while.",
      "They couldn’t have done much worse than last season’s 15th-place finish, and Amorim was backed with over £200million in new signings as his attack was completely transformed.",
      "Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were all bought for big money, but the Red Devils are expected to be active in the winter transfer window, with a new central midfielder at the top of Amorim’s wishlist.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his transfer team are already planning for January, with Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson among Amorim’s midfield targets.",
      "However, a report from an insider on X with a ‘team of five elite reporters’ says United are ‘circling like sharks’ to sign Arsenal wonderkid Ethan Nwaneri.",
      "It’s claimed that the Gunners ‘need to sell a valuable player to fund future targets due to financial rules’, and Nwaneri could be the one sacrificed.",
      "If the ‘unthinkable’ happens and United sign Nwaneri, they are likely to sell or loan out academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Nwaneri signed a new contract earlier this year but has found minutes very difficult to come by in 2025/26, leaving him ‘fed up’ as he is ‘barely getting a kick’ and his career is ‘stalling hard’.",
      "Amorim is a ‘big admirer’ of the 18-year-old and ‘would love to manage him’, it’s added.",
      "It’s clear that United’s priority should be signing a new midfielder, but Brighton and Forest will want an absolute fortune for Baleba and Anderson, respectively.",
      "Surprisingly, Casemiro has been very good this season, which has lessened the need to spend big on a central midfielder. But we’ve seen in the past that his form can nosedive easily, and an injury to the Brazilian could spark a midfield crisis.",
      "Amorim is reluctant to play Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo together, meaning an injury to Casemiro would force the United head coach to start Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Ugarte has massively underperformed since joining United from Paris Saint-Germain, and whenever he comes onto the pitch, they seem to play much worse.",
      "Furthermore, if United receive a sufficient offer for Casemiro from Saudi Arabia, they will definitely consider it. Despite his form, he is 33 years old, one of the club’s highest earners on £300,000 a week, and is out of contract at the end of the season, though there is a club option to extend to 2027.",
      "Nwaneri isn’t an out-and-out central midfielder and would be out of place in that position in a 3-4-2-1, but he’d be outstanding as one of Amorim’s wide 10s behind the striker.",
      "It is important to note that there is very little chance this transfer happens.",
      "READ NEXT: Are Man Utd ‘moving in the right direction’? Or did win ‘highlight’ biggest problem ahead of Amorim?",
      "Man United have been linked with Ethan Nwaneri, and they could be an ideal destination for these out-of-favour wonderkids, including two Arsenal stars.",
      "Arsenal have suffered another injury blow, though this surely ruins any hope of Manchester United pulling off an ‘unthinkable’ January transfer…",
      "Mikel Arteta has confirmed he has no intention of letting two squad players leave Arsenal in January, so their biggest Premier League title fear is clear…",
      "Arsenal are ‘open’ to the bit-part player leaving on loan in January if the right opportunity arises.",
      "England will be aware of the similar situations involving Liverpool forward Rio Ngumoha and Ethan Nwaneri of Arsenal in the ongoing eligibility battle.",
      "Former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere insists Ethan Nwaneri has “stepped up his game another level this year” with the Gunners top of the league."

      "With champions Liverpool struggling and all the top teams dropping points, Parker believes anything less than qualification for the Champions League may be seen as failure for manager Ruben Amorim, as he compared table toppers Arsenal to the kind of team they had when George Graham was their manager in the late 1980s and early 1990s.",
      "“If the manager doesn’t have the expectations to get into the top four or five this season, then he needs to get out of the job,” added Parker.",

      "We are 15 games in and Manchester United are currently 6th in the league, just outside CL places albeit at the head of the very bunched mid table. We could easily drop back to 10th or worse over the festive season given three of our best performers are off to AFCON shortly. We’ve been infuriatingly inconsistent and had some horror show performances and results.",
      "Our new signings all look promising in their own way. Mbeumo is a ready made premier league grade performer. Cunha feels like he should have done more by now, but you know the quality is there, as is the attitude (more on that later). Sesko offers more that he gets credit for and I’ve no doubt he will be a success for the long term whilst Lemmens provides a semblance of competency and calmness in goal which is more than we could have wished for in years.",
      "In parallel we’ve shipped out a lot of the dross and replaced players with disproportionate egos with players who at least look like they want to fight for the shirt all while lowering the wage bill as well as the average age of the squad (again – attitude, it’s everything in life).",
      "Our training facilities have been rebuilt and we are clearly doing “a lot of the right things” by installing the right people in the right roles. Apparently we’re evening taking data analysis seriously, just a decade or so late.",
      "Who knows what kind of a dumpster fire INEOS rook over when they first walked, but I’m willing to bet it was chaotic, shambolic and full of egos in the dressing room. Am I saying they’ve got every decision right? Hell no. But it takes time to turn a cruiseliner around. Did anyone think we’d seriously challenge for the league this year? If you did, you’re delusional. Have the Grimsby, Everton and West Ham setbacks been highly frustrating? F**k ya. But that’s no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater.",

      "A situation like that, where you have an opponent so demoralised and wretched comes around once every few seasons. It’s a golden chance to rack up some serious goal difference. One looks at the league table will tell you that goal difference will be critical this season.",
      "Instead, United got the game won and just coasted to the end. No urgency, no realisation of the opportunity that was still there. When the assistant signaled 9 minutes to go, you would expect a surge to try and really make the most of it but it just fizzled out.",
      "It’s this attitude that tells us United are not ready to actually go for it. They are coasting by default, and they have talented players so that will get you to a certain point. That internal switch has not flipped to activate the ruthlessness and determination needed to compete at the highest level. You need to relentlessly pursue every edge to succeed. At 4-1 against that Wolves team you should be furious that you conceded one and didn’t score more.  Until they figure that out, they will always remain an inconsistent nearly team.\nAkillies",

Amorim’s win percentage isn’t bad for a Manchester United manager – it’s bad for a relegation candidate manager. It should be utterly unimaginable that a club with United’s ambition would persist with someone this bad. And yet. Here we are, with many pundits saying no matter what Amorim has til the end of the season. My point is simply: why?",

      "Last I checked – the existence of Salah in a Liverpool shirt has brought the first ever and a second PL for Liverpool (after a 30 year wait that engulfs Carra’s career – but, yes, this is “his” club) and a Champions League (and multiple other opportunities to add more).  Other players were necessary for this to happen (list your VVDs, Manes, Hendos, Wijnaldums, Firminos, Trents, Robbos, and, yes, Origis here) but does this not begin and end with Salah?",
      "The rise of Liverpool predates Alisson and Van Dijk – it was Salah who began to uplift the club from also-ran, Gerrard-slipping bottlers to the status they have now with his insane 17-18 season. Without him the team that was built around him never happens. Klopp knew what he had and acted accordingly.",
      "But I somewhat digress – the point is this: what has Salah said that literally every supporter in the media, on Twitter, in this mailbox or in private hasn’t said?",
      "Slot is sh*tting the bed – why should Salah watch KONATE (????) and Gakpo and even MacAllister (who while still not playing well has finally stopped being completely sh*t, at least, fair f***s) play every week regardless yet he – who won both POTY awards *checks notes* 6 months ago – has to watch them? Because Slot thinks he knows what he’s doing when he hasn’t shown an inkling of how to arrest this slide? Why are the results – the same way they were happening before – stil happening when Salah’s off the pitch?",
      "Is it Salah’s fault that Slot won’t start Chiesa instead of Gakpo on the left? Or Rio. Or literally anyone else from time to time, at least?",
      "Is it Salah’s fault that the form of Konate and VVD leave you thinking they are angling for a step down to a Championship team?",
      "Is it Mo’s fault the midfield is as formidable as soggy bread?",
      "Is it Salah’s fault that Slot keeps benching Liverpools best player so far this season (Ekitike) to get in the more expensive guy who clearly isn’t up to match fitness?",
      "No, it’s not. And all Salah did – in not the best way, admittedly – was question why the clearly overall best and most impactful player in the squad (Salah, duh) was being benched by a manager who is failing to get the basics right.",
      "Don’t get side tracked by Mo talking about what he’s done for the club because he clearly wouldn’t care about being on the bench if Liverpool were, you know,  not continuing to play like shite while he is unable to do anything about it. Think about it – what did Salah say that Carragher wasn’t lamenting about on that candid CBS camera that caught him during the PSV match? Was Carra not saying to someone in the phone that Slot continuing to start Konate was a sackable offense?",
      "All Salah did was do what every other Liverpool supporter doesn’t have the power to do and put these issues – because they are issues – front and center in front of everyone but particularly the board of his club. And it’s not like he’s stupid enough to think his words wouldn’t cause a big deal – it’s obviously why he did what he did in the fashion that he did it in.",
      "Knowing he could get crucified – he stuck his neck out for what he thinks is best for the club. Which is moving on from this manager which, in turn, is something many, many Liverpool fans including Carra himself has suggested might be the way forward. For a large contingent of Liverpool supporters who don’t think this manager has what it takes – he spoke for them.",
      "And he’s getting slayed for it like this? It’s ridiculous and goes to show how players just sometimes can’t say anything without being judged to the highest of extremes.",
      "And he should give the finger to the board – they just spent 400 million to not improve the team! What is everyone on about?\nMAW, LA Gooner (Carra insinuating he was a nobody and Liverpool made him is absurd. He came in and promptly broke the PL single season goal record – how’s Isak for 80 million more doing in this regard, btw – and immediately made them contenders for a trophy they had yet to win going back 25 years. Absurd.)",

The breaks will take place regardless of the time the game is played and the temperature, so it definitely seems more like a chance to run more ads rather than player safety. After all, if player safety was a real driver, why not have it in a country where extreme temperatures isn’t a concern?",
      "This is all pretty much what we expected as FIFA marches more and more towards money over sporting endeavour. After the spectacle of the draw/peace prize giving, a lot of people on here wrote about boycotts and Infantino being the worst. I agree that he is the worst but I can’t ever see him being deposed from his current position as he has the overwhelming support of the majority of the federations. I remember back in the 90’s it was as easy for a European team to qualify for the World Cup as the Euros, such was the relative strength of the European countries and the way the competition was set up to favour the strongest teams qualification. As the years passed and competition numbers expanded the tournament became more inclusive but the standard probably dropped overall. This was probably unwelcome from a European and South American perspective, but very welcome in the rest of the world (where most of the people live).",

To play Devil’s Advocate, the watering down of the quality of the World Cup is good for football in general, as it will draw more and more people into the game from more and more countries. Seeing people who look like you play in the World Cup is a big deal.",
      "I agree that the price for it is hard to stomach, ad breaks in the middle, glad handing autocrats, dead rubber group games, Saturday evening ITV level entertainment for the draw, opening ceremony and pre-Final (can someone tell UEFA as well that no one wants to see the pre-Champions League Final ‘entertainment’), and venue selection made based on maximum revenue.

      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Manchester United and Newcastle were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to February 2 with three more games each.",
      "Arsenal were among seven teams to only have one more match chosen.",

      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good. Conceded seven goals in his last three Premier League games but nobody gives a f*** at Leeds.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa. But he was absolutely culpable v Forest and not great against former club Manchester United.",

There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence.

      "On Monday night, the Red Devils earned a much-needed victory against bottom-placed Wolves to return to winning ways in the Premier League.",
      "A brace from Fernandes and goals from Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo contributed to United’s resounding victory, which leaves Man Utd on the brink of the Champions League places in the Premier League.",
      "This season has been a rollercoaster for Man Utd as they have had plenty of highs and lows, while they had rough spells against Wolves as they looked at risk of throwing points away.",
      "Now, former United defender Paul Parker has explained why he thinks Fernandes “looked absolutely terrible” against Wolves.",
      "“He was really poor in the first half, Fernandes,” Parker told The Metro via Kasinohai.",
      "READ: Man Utd ‘schoolboy’ to anger Keane, Bellingham and everyone else by starting for England vs Croatia",
      "“I know he got himself a goal. I mean, his poor decisions sometimes, he was giving the ball away far, far too cheaply.",
      "“But he got away with it, because his reaction to when he gives the ball away, sometimes he has to accept that when other players do it, he’s got to accept them as well sometimes.",
      "“He looked absolutely terrible, but there you are.”",
      "He added: “I’ll tell you what I did notice as well, Martinez. He came on, he went into the middle, and you could see him ushering people. When he got on the ball, he was ushering them forward.",
      "“Step forward, he was telling them, he was organising them. He was getting around them, he was doing that when he came on. He’s been out there, he’s only had a few minutes of football, but he’s in his genes to do that. He is a leader.",
      "‘You don’t need an arm band to be a leader, just somebody who wants more from other people. And that’s what he’s done.",
      "‘Fernandes doesn’t do that, he doesn’t give you that. He’s an armband captain because he’s seen as United’s most important player.’",
      "However, Spurs star James Maddison has full of praise for Fernandes after the final whistle, claiming he is “underrated”.",
      "“He’s such a top player. I actually think Bruno’s underrated.",
      "“I know he gets his plaudits but I think he’s underrated for the consistency he shows regularly. Every time he is on the ball, he can just see it all.”",
      "Speaking to his friend Mount, Maddison added: “I haven’t got a question but I just wanted to say I thought you were brilliant tonight.",

      "Who are the Premier League players out there this season who actually might be able to complain about their lot without just sounding like a great big entitled baby?",
      "And then we decided it is exactly these 10 lads, no more and no less.",
      "",
      "The versatile defender was a key player in Arsenal’s transformation from top-four scrappers into genuine title contenders, making 32 Premier League appearances in 21/22 before missing only one game – through injury – in the two second-place finishes behind Man City that followed.",
      "But he has been overtaken by events, Arsenal’s elite recruitment drive reducing a player still only 28 to spare-part status. From 32, 38 and 37 Premier League appearances his numbers collapsed to 17 last season as a knee injury took him out of the side for three months. Although he did manage to force his way back in by the end of the season, further summer recruitment has left him fighting an even tougher battle for Premier League minutes in a squad so ludicrously deep that it can withstand any injury crisis apart from an Arsenal injury crisis. Arsenal injury crises, of course, being very much the M&S of injury crises.",
      "After picking up a minor injury in the opening game of the season at Man United, White has had to wait until this month for another chance, spending 10 games in a row getting splinters in his arse as an unused bench-warmer.",
      "When he did finally get another chance, against Brentford last week, he promptly turned in a man-of-the-match performance.",
      "",
      "Looks set to leave his boyhood club in January – on loan if nothing else – as the exasperation over his lack of Premier League game time grows. We’re not sure who’s more annoyed; Mainoo at his lack of chances, or Ruben Amorim at being asked about it in every press conference and delivering increasingly salty responses.",
      "In fairness, we’ve got kids and so we do understand how annoying it can be when you get asked the same question all the time over and over again no matter how often you give the same response.",
      "No, you can’t have a Kobbie Mainoo. We’ve got Casemiro at home.",
      "Mainoo, who burst onto the scene so spectacularly under Erik Ten Hag and was a key player for England at Euro 2024 has just 171 minutes of Premier League football under his belt this season.",
      "And do you know what’s even worse than Amorim’s treatment of Mainoo? The fact it’s upset Keysey. Hope you’re happy now, Ruben.",
      "",
      "Spurs’ flamboyant late capture of the seemingly Chelsea-bound Xavi might have been designed primarily to make people forget about the transfer-window embarrassments Spurs had suffered when trying to sign Morgan Gibbs-White and Eberechi Eze from Premier League rivals, but he was and remains an excellent player who provides a creative spark otherwise almost entirely lacking from the Spurs squad.",
      "The Dutchman didn’t exactly hit the ground running, it would be fair to say, but it’s become increasingly obvious – if it wasn’t already – that he simply wasn’t the man Thomas Frank wanted. And there has appeared a certain stubbornness in how long Frank kept him out of the team during a month when Spurs’ football was often moribund beyond belief and they won not one single game.",
      "It’s one thing to find yourself out of a team as a big-money signing because someone else is doing your job better than you’ve been doing it. It’s quite another to find yourself out of the Spurs team as a big-money signing because the manager has decided he’d rather have literally nobody doing your job than you.",
      "Frank finally relented for the home game with Brentford and was rewarded with a man-of-the-match display featuring a goal and an assist as tangible contributions to a more general vibe of watching Spurs not making you want to claw your own eyeballs out with a rusty spoon just so you don’t have to watch any more of it.",
      "Spurs’ first Premier League home win since August and first win of any kind in six games wasn’t entirely down to Xavi’s return to the staring line-up, but it wasn’t a coincidence either.",
      "",
      "Poor sod. Never had Elliott’s stock been higher than this summer after his swashbuckling starring role as England U21s defended their European title. Elliott scored four goals in the three knockout games against Spain, Netherlands and Germany and had never looked more ready to graduate from the bit-part Premier League player he had become at Liverpool to a proper show-runner.",
      "That always felt like it would need a move, but he made entirely the wrong one. Not because he went to a bad club – quite the opposite – but because he went to one where he just clearly wasn’t wanted by the manager.",
      "Easy to forget now they’re swanning around in a title race, but Aston Villa had a difficult summer on the back of failing to qualify for the Champions League. Bringing Elliott in on loan was one of the late moves designed more to appease restless fans than for any real football purpose.",
      "It became very clear very quickly that this certainly wasn’t a transfer Unai Emery sanctioned. His one Premier League start came back in September; he didn’t reappear for the second half, spent the next two games on the bench and hasn’t been in a matchday squad since.",
      "Given that when Elliott was last on the pitch for Villa it was their sixth game of the season, they were drawing 1-1 with Fulham and hadn’t won a game all season and in his absence they have gone on to win that game and eight of the subsequent nine, he can’t really complain that Emery has got this badly wrong.",
      "But he can be forgiven for wondering quite how what should have been a breakthrough season now looks sure to be a complete waste at the worst possible time for his career. And the real salt in the wound is that having played one poxy Premier League minute for Liverpool before joining Villa there isn’t even the prospect of trying again somewhere else in January.",
      "",
      "Perhaps the most justified fume of the lot, this one. Trafford left City in pursuit of first-team football, found it at Burnley and did brilliantly well in a team that cruised back into the Premier League on the back of a miserly defence.",
      "He appeared set to join Newcastle in the summer, before Man City exercised a matching clause from the deal that took him to Turf Moor to bring him home. This appeared initially to be a right result for Trafford, turning his Burnley move into a de facto loan before heading back to his parent club to become first-choice.",
      "And he was, for a couple of games. He wasn’t, in fairness, flawless in those games and played a memorable part in extending Man City’s bafflingly poor record against Tottenham. But to see City respond to that by signing possibly the best goalkeeper in the world is a bit of a kick in the teeth.",
      "Trafford is now thought to be eyeing up a January departure, and his ultimate punishment for having a slightly bad game against Spurs could yet end up being having to go and play for Spurs. Just seems really harsh.",
      "There is one ray of light for Trafford at City, though. One possible and unexpected route back into the starting XI for a game at least, with Gianluigi Donnarumma quite magnificently on course to become the first Premier League goalkeeper ever to get suspended for accumulated bookings after somehow managing to collect four of the buggers in his first 12 Premier League appearances.",
      "",
      "If there is a Liverpool player to have played a vital role in so much of their recent success who has a legitimate reason to grumble at the manner in which he’s found himself sidelined, then it’s surely Robertson given the way Milos Kerkez has been stinking up the left-back spot for so much of the season.",
      "Robertson has had only three starts for Liverpool this season and it’s fair to say they’re a mixed bag because in there we’ve got the desperate 3-0 surrender at Man City and the p*ss-poor 1-1 draw against Sunderland.",
      "But the only Premier League game all season in which Robertson has played a full 90 minutes? Last month’s 2-0 win over Aston Villa, a result which can compellingly be described as Liverpool’s only actually impressive one against a proper side in the Premier League since September.",
      "Just don’t look too closely at who scored Liverpool’s opening goal that day, because otherwise the whole premise of this feature might start to crumble, and that wouldn’t do at all.",
      "",
      "Missed the opening game of the season against Newcastle while still a Villa player through suspension, and had to wait until November to make his first start in a Newcastle midfield that is tough to break into.",
      "Pro tip: if you have to wait four months for your first Premier League start at a new club, we strongly advise not making that start a limp 3-1 defeat at Brentford. Especially when that costs you your place for the next couple of games where your team beat Man City and Everton.",
      "Watching the chaos of the 2-2 draw against Spurs from the bench having failed to get a start even with Bruno Guimaraes rested from the starting XI probably worked out for the best, and he did at last complete a full 90 minutes for his new club in what became an unnecessarily fraught 2-1 win over 10-man Burnley, mainly because of his own late handball. A win’s a win, we suppose.",
      "",
      "If we’re honest, we’d clean forgotten he was even still at Everton. But he was a regular starter last season before and after a knee injury that sidelined him for four months, and barely missed a Premier League game for the Toffees in the two seasons before that.",
      "But the problem for McNeil is really that one of memorability. It took only a few months of being reduced to brief substitute cameos for us to forget about him almost entirely. Do you know who you don’t forget about quite so easily? Jack Grealish.",
      "",
      "Merely the latest recipient of the West Ham big-money striker curse, and it would be entirely fair to say he has pulled up only the tiniest imaginable number of trees since arriving at the London Stadium last summer.",
      "But given how sh*tbone awful West Ham have so often been this season, any established Germany international striker – even one as misfiring as Fullkrug – is entitled to feel a little bit aggrieved to find himself discarded to the bench.",
      "Fullkrug is one of many on this list where, sure, a large slice of personal responsibility is necessary, but so is a lot of time spent on a lot of substitute benches wondering just how it’s come to this.",
      "",
      "Imagine not being able to get a game for f*cking Wolves, for goodness’ sake. Guess it might be a blessing, in a way.",
      "Man United have been linked with Ethan Nwaneri, and they could be an ideal destination for these out-of-favour wonderkids, including two Arsenal stars.",

      "By Rob Dorsett and Kaveh Solhekol",
      "Wednesday 10 December 2025 16:29, UK",
      "Joshua Zirkzee wants to stay at Manchester United to fight for his place in the squad amid interest from Roma.",
      "United are aware of the interest but are not thought to be actively looking to sell Zirkzee when the transfer window opens - and he has recently made an impact in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "He started up front against West Ham on December 14 and was a late substitute in the 4-1 win at Wolves four days later.",
      "Amorim is short of forward options given a recent injury to Benjamin Sesko, although Matheus Cunha has returned from a spell on the sidelines.",
      "United are set to lose Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations in the coming week, with the tournament starting on December 21. The final takes place on January 18.",
      "The United forward has a contract at Old Trafford until the summer of 2029, with the option of another 12 months.",
      "Zirkzee has made three starts in the Premier League this term and named in Amorim's first XI in three of United's last four games. He has played a total of 345 minutes, scoring once.",
      "A glance at Joshua Zirkzee's numbers this season, or indeed since he arrived at Old Trafford in the summer of 2024, would suggest that allowing him to leave in January would be no great loss to Manchester United.",
      "Clearly, the forward has not managed to do much to impress Ruben Amorim. United's elaborate £207m spend on three new forwards in this most recent transfer window tells you as much. In total, Zirkzee has scored eight goals in all competitions across a fairly underwhelming 18 months in United colours. Physicality has been an issue, and productivity under pressure hard to come by.",
      "But, and this is important, United at this juncture cannot spare him. His smart equaliser from a tight angle in last month's 2-1 win at Crystal Palace showed glimpses of what he's about and why United signed him in the first place. Amorim singled him out for praise after that performance.",
      "Besides, options are few. The loss of Bryan Mbeumo surely necessitates he stays beyond January, even if he's only used from the bench. United do not have the same bounty of forwards with Mbeumo gone and Sesko injured as many of their closest rivals, and that alone is perhaps argument enough for Zirkzee to stay put.",

      "Diogo Dalot wasted a one-on-one, while Sam Johnstone also saved from Mbeumo before Casemiro robbed a dallying Andre and the ball was worked to Fernandes who had time to slip over and still get to his feet to sneak the ball past the goalkeeper.",
      "Toti Gomes had to clear off the line from Matheus Cunha, returning to face his former club, and at that stage Wolves looked there for the taking. But as has often been the case under Amorim, United surrendered the initiative, allowing the bottom club back in.",
      "The home side sensed it, Ki-Jana Hoever's cross finding David Moller Wolfe who put the ball back into the box for Bellegarde, Wolves' best player before going off injured, to force home smartly. The first goal of Edwards' reign coming in his fourth game in charge.",
      "But more hapless defending from Wolves allowed United to restore their lead early in the second half, Dalot again racing through down the left channel before squaring for Mbeumo to slot into the net with Johnstone stranded for his first goal in exactly a month.",
      "A moment of quality from Fernandes saw him dink the ball into the path of Mount for the third goal before Yerson Mosquera was adjudged to have handballed in the area, allowing Fernandes to smash in his second from the spot. Wolves were well beaten.",
      "Their fate appears sealed already even in December.",
      "What lies ahead for Amorim's United this season remains a mystery.",
      "Wolves equalled their longest-ever losing streak in league history, also losing eight in a row between December 1981 and February 1982.\n\n\nWolves’ haul of only two points in the Premier League this season is the joint-lowest tally after 15 games of a campaign in the history of the top four tiers, level with Sheffield United in the Premier League in 2020-21, Southport in 1975-76 in the Fourth Division and Barrow and Newport County in 1970-71 in the Fourth Division.",
      "Fellow playmaker James Maddison praised Fernandes in the Monday Night Football studio. \"Bruno Fernandes is underrated for the consistency he shows regularly,\" said the Tottenham player. \"Every time he is on the ball, he can just see it all.\"",
      "Fernandes showed that with his assist for Mount's goal. He punished Wolves and now has 15 goal involvements in his last 14 Premier League games for Manchester United against sides starting the day in the relegation zone - six goals and nine assists.",
      "\"I thought some of the combinations going forward were crisp, were sharp and that's what we can do.",
      "\"We know we can do that. It's about us creating as many chances as we can as forward players and trying to get on the scoresheet. I thought going forward we were solid, and as a defence it's about defending as a team and not letting them have any chances to get back into the game.\"",
      "\"We scored four but had a lot of shots. I cannot make that connection with being more clinical. We improved a lot.",
      "\"If you compare last season and this season, we are creating so much more chances and scoring more goals and having more real situations of danger. I am really pleased with that.\"",
      "Manchester United mustered 27 shots in the game, their most in the Premier League under Ruben Amorim.",
      "\"I get the anger and the frustration completely. They haven't seen their side win in ages.",
      "\"If I was a supporter I'd be angry myself because we all want to see our team competing, and at the moment, we aren't doing that.",
      "\"I can't control that [about whether the protests will continue]. I can only look after the team and try to help build some confidence and belief.",
      "\"They are the only things I can concentrate on.\"",
      "\"I think Wolves are going down. I thought they would do at the start of the season but I thought they'd be a lot more competitive than this. They've made a managerial change as well and it hasn't had the desired effect.",
      "\"They were maybe green shoots against Aston Villa where they had a really good performance. I thought if they replicated that they could give Man Utd a game but when you see some of the defending against an average Man Utd team. Wolves are going down - it's just how much of a fight they put up between now and the end of the season.\"",

      "After Kobbie Mainoo, without a Premier League start all season, was left on the bench against West Ham, Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faced questions about his continued omission of the 20-year-old England midfielder...",
      "Friday 5 December 2025 15:03, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim robustly defended his decision to continually omit Kobbie Mainoo during a spiky press conference ahead of Manchester United's game against Wolves on Monday Night Football.",
      "Mainoo, 20, is yet to start a Premier League game this season and remained an unused substitute throughout the 1-1 draw with West Ham on Thursday evening. Amorim was asked repeatedly about the player during the press conference at Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if he could see there was a risk of Mainoo becoming demoralised after another game in which he was left on the bench, Amorim said: \"I see it. I just want to win, I try to put the players, I don't look who it is, I don't care about that, I'm just trying to put the best players on the pitch.\"",
      "He added: \"You have [Manuel] Ugarte that played two games. One of them, Case[miro], was out, Bruno [Fernandes], he's always fit, he's the guy that is doing his position, so maybe it has to do with that.\"",
      "Asked if players departing for AFCON could present a chance for the England midfielder, Amorim replied: \"I don't know, I don't know. It's the same question, I don't know what is going to happen, it depends, I've seen the training, if it's the best thing for the team, I will put [him in], that is the only way I know how to respond to that.\"",
      "Pressed further on whether he understood the questions about Mainoo, Amorim said: \"Of course, I understand, and my job is to answer, but I'm trying to answer always the same thing, and you ask me always the same thing.",
      "\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie, he starts for England. But that doesn't mean that I need to put Kobbie [in] when I feel that I shouldn't put Kobbie [in], so it's my decision.\"",
      "Amorim also hit back when his support for Manchester United's academy was questioned - it being put to him that not playing Mainoo reflected a lack of trust in any of the club's young players.",
      "In response to the claim that he did not play any academy players, Amorim said: \"Any players? We have Kobbie Mainoo…\"",
      "When the name of 18-year-old winger Shea Lacey came up, he said: \"But Lacey… in difficult situations? Sometimes when Bryan [Mbeumo] is not there, I put Amad, because I have other wing-backs to play, and sometimes it's hard.",
      "\"So, you are asking me, why I don't put Lacey to play, when I have other guys that are international, and also they are on the bench, so I try to put the best guys, the prepared guys, for this moment of the club, in trying to win the game. That's the only thing.\"",
      "United boast a proud record of having named at least one academy graduate in every matchday squad since 1937.",
      "United legend Paul Scholes offered his own frustrations about the treatment of Mainoo after he was an unused sub on Thursday night.",
      "In a since-deleted post on Instagram, Scholes reacted to Amorim's recent comments that he considers Mainoo a starter:",
      "\"Bull****, the kid is being ruined, not being played in a team that can't control a game of football.",
      "\"Hate seeing homegrown players leave, but it's probably best for him now, enough is enough.\"",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team. We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason, it's not quite up. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with. I think he's dealt with it quite well at this moment, but at some point, he will get frustrated.\"",
      "Questions about Mainoo have been a running theme during Amorim's time at Manchester United and understandably so given that the talented young midfielder had been seen as someone to build the team around when the Portuguese first came in.",
      "Mainoo, remember, scored what proved to be the winner in United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City in May of last year. The team's other scorer that day, Alejandro Garnacho, has already left in acrimonious circumstances. There are fears Mainoo is next.",
      "While Garnacho was a winger who did not quite fit what Amorim wanted, Mainoo finds his path blocked by captain Bruno Fernandes given that United operate with only two midfielders and the coach does not trust him enough defensively to deputise for Casemiro.",
      "Given Fernandes' robustness, coupled with Amorim's refusal to tweak his structure in any circumstances, that leaves Mainoo struggling for minutes let alone starts. And there is no sign of a solution. Amorim has always stressed he will do this his way.",
      "It is a problem for Mainoo, of course. But it is awkward for Amorim too. His focus, he argues, is on winning games rather than any bigger purpose - such as the club's proud academy tradition. If he is not winning those games, it puts him firmly under the spotlight.",
