      "Manchester United's midfield could scupper Ruben Amorim's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League, according to Paul Scholes. The Red Devils have attacked the transfer window again this season by bringing in Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Nearly £200million has been forked out so far, but the United boss has pumped the majority of his transfer kitty into bolstering his attacking options. Finding the back of the net proved a massive headache for United last term, but doubts still remain over the midfield.",
      "The Red Devils had shown interest in Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba, but have since cooled their pursuit after it became apparent the Seagulls won't be parting with him. Considering United's spending spree and the standard across the Premier League, Scholes confessed the engine room could prove to be Amorim's biggest headache.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, Scholes, when pressed on what he believes success would look like for United, said: \"It's a tricky one after being so bad last year. Now seasons can change.",
      "\"We saw last year with Nottingham Forest, it doesn't have to take five to 10 years to get back where you want to be. Although it is looking better, I still think there are issues with the team. The midfield, I know we don't want to go through it again. But, top six. I think top six would be more than acceptable.",
      "\"As much as you don't want to say that, I always think Manchester United should aim for the very best and aim for the highest. I am just not sure. I think there are too many good teams now.",
      "\"I think Liverpool, Chelsea and City are all on the up. Arsenal [as well], I did not even mention Aston Villa, Newcastle. I think there is a lot of competition now to get top six.\"",
      "According to talkSPORT, England and Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton has surfaced as a potential transfer target instead of Baleba. Nevertheless, Palace have previously suggested the former Blackburn Rovers ace carries a £100m valuation.",
      "Currently, United are expected to enter the season with Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro as their primary central midfield choices. Ugarte failed to make a significant impact during his first season at Old Trafford, whilst Mainoo also struggled when deployed as one of two defensive midfielders.",
      "Furthermore, doubts remained over Casemiro's pace considering he has now reached 33 years of age, whilst Fernandes' assets lie in his creativity and finishing ability.",
      "Nevertheless, should any of the midfielders manage to take command of United's engine room, Scholes would prefer it to be Mainoo. He added: \"I think we spoke last year about, what they lack in the midfield is that controlling midfield player.",
      "\"I thought that was going to be him (Mainoo). It seems like it's a little bit confused now. Can he be that midfielder again? Can he be that midfielder who can play in a two? He'll obviously need a lot of legs around him. Or is he now one of the No. 10s? I'm just confused.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund is expected to be left out of Manchester United's squad to face Arsenal in a brutal decision by Ruben Amorim. Hojlund, 22, faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford after the Red Devils signed fellow striker Benjamin Sesko for £74million.",
      "The Dane has interest from several clubs across Europe, including AC Milan, but has said that he wants to stay and fight for his place at United. That's despite them sticking a £30m price tag on him and with Hojlund having been an unused substitute during the Red Devils' final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina last Saturday.",
      "Amorim's decision, as first reported by the Athletic, will undoubtedly increase speculation over Hojlund's future, having joined the Red Devils for £72m just two years ago. During his pre-match press conference, the United manager skirted around a question about whether the 22-year-old was still part of his long-term plans.",
      "\"He's one more option, we will see,\" Amorim replied ahead of Sunday's 4:30pm kick-off. \"We are focused on this game and Rasmus is still our player.\"",
      "The Red Devils boss also confirmed that Joshua Zirkzee, another option up front, is now ready to return after working his way back to full fitness during pre-season. New signing Sesko is set to be involved against Arsenal in some capacity, having only had a week to work with his new team-mates following his big-money move from RB Leipzig.",
      "Privately, Hojlund has maintained his professionalism and has so far given no indication that he wants to leave. While Old Trafford chiefs were negotiating for Sesko, Hojlund insisted that he wanted to stay and fight for his place, insisting that he's 'more than ready' for competition.",
      "\"The most important [thing] for me is to keep working hard and stay focused and then we'll see what happens,\" the Denmark international told reporters during the Red Devils' tour of the USA.",
      "\"My plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot. Competition is fine with me, it sharpens me. I'm more than ready.\"",
      "Also in pre-season, Amorim hailed: \"I'm really happy with Rasmus, but I don't know what is going to happen until the end of the market,\" he said.",
      "\"The important thing is that Rasmus is scoring goals. He's connecting really well with the team. He's improving. I don’t know what is going to happen until the market is closed. We suffered a lot because of the lack of goals last season.\"",
      "Hojlund has scored 26 goals in 95 games for United since joining from Italian side Atalanta in August 2023. If he were to leave, the Red Devils would prefer a permanent sale as opposed to a loan deal.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Goncalo Ramos has been linked with a move to Newcastle United, where his arrival could help put an end to Alexander Isak's dramatic transfer saga. The Swede has reportedly claimed he will never play for the Magpies again, regardless of whether he secures a move away from Tyneside before deadline day.",
      "Liverpool remain the only likely destination for the 25-year-old at present, but are yet to re-enter talks with Newcastle after seeing their initial bid of £110million plus add-ons rebuffed. And with less than two weeks to go before the summer window shuts, all parties involved will hope for a swift resolution for the striker one way or the other.",
      "As a result of Isak's absence, Anthony Gordon was deployed as a makeshift striker during Newcastle's goalless draw with a 10-man Aston Villa away from home in their Premier League opener on Saturday. And without a proven No. 9 in their ranks for their clash with Liverpool a week on Monday, Eddie Howe will be eager to recruit himself a new frontman before then.",
      "The Magpies have been quoted £40m for Brentford's Yoane Wissa, who scored 19 goals in 35 outings for the Bees last term. And with the 28-year-old seemingly favouring a move to St James' Park, it could only be a matter of time before a deal between the two clubs is brokered.",
      "However, it's former Manchester United and Liverpool target, Ramos, who Newcastle have recently been linked with which could prove incredibly fruitful in finding a new home for Isak in the coming weeks. The 24-year-old has impressed with Paris Saint-Germain since joining the Ligue 1 giants in 2023, with 34 goals to his name across all competitions thus far.",
      "The Red Devils were reportedly in talks with PSG to bring the centre-forward to Old Trafford this summer before swooping for the trio of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo, while it is said that Liverpool are currently assessing the suitability of Ramos at Anfield in the event that they are unable to secure Isak.",
      "It wouldn't be the first time that the Reds have taken one of Newcastle's targets this summer, hijacking the Magpies chase of Eintracht Frankfurt star Hugo Ekitike and welcoming him in a £79m move. However, holding off on Ramos to allow Newcastle to sign him could prove incredibly beneficial for Liverpool in their pursuit for Isak.",
      "With two strikers in Wissa and Ramos in their ranks, it may spur Newcastle to provide a little wiggle room on their firm £150m valuation of Isak at present, which could see the Reds meet them in the middle to take him off their hands.",
      "It's a big ask for the Magpies, however, who have struggled to recruit top-tier talent in the current window. Not only did Newcastle miss out on Ekitike, Mbeumo and Sesko, but they also saw Liam Delap and Joao Pedro favour moves to Chelsea, Dean Huijsen join Real Madrid, and James Trafford return to Manchester City from Burnley.",
      "It's thought that Ramos is settled in the French capital and that he's not overly keen on a move to the Premier League, despite interest. Meanwhile, with expected wages reported to be in the region of £200,000 per-week, and with a valuation of around £68m at present, it may turn out to be yet another fruitless endeavour for Newcastle.",

      "He has been backed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe in the transfer market with close to £200million in new signings after buying Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko this summer. The Gunners have also spent heavily with the signing of Viktor Gyokeres proving to be one of the biggest transfer sagas of the summer.",

      "He was expected to complete a £25m move to Chelsea following his loan spell last season but the Blues backed out of that agreement. Italian giants Roma had emerged as suitors over recent days.",
      "As per reports in Italy, the Serie A side have agreed a €23million (£19.8m) deal for Sancho and while United are happy with that fee, Sancho’s own demands are holding up a deal, as per Mail Online.",

      "Speaking out recently, Roma boss Gian Piero Gasperini has urged more additions but admitted that the club are limited by financial constraints. He said: “This is a team that has quality and we must try to improve it along with the club. There is great clarity with the club and we share ideas on what needs to be done.",

      "A notorious former hooligan who has twice been banned from football games has named the most dangerous firms he has come up against while following Manchester City.",
      "And despite opening up about his “hatred” for Manchester United, Anthony Phythian named smaller clubs when asked about the “toughest” fans. Anthony, who famously stormed Ewood Park in a boiler suit in 2007, said: “Do you know what, it was never teams you think, like the big clubs, it was always teams like Barnsley or tough towns like Middlesbrough.",
      "“Middlesbrough would bring 50 lads and they weren’t a big firm but f***ing hell, just every one of them was just f***ing at it. Just a close knit firm.”",
      "He added: “Just small teams like that, Huddersfield as well. Smaller teams like that and smaller Yorkshire clubs as well. Barnsley, Rotherham, just rough little towns.”",
      "Anthony grew up in Miles Platting, Manchester, where he would fight in the streets and in school – with football arguments often being the catalyst.",
      "He eventually became a hooligan and he told The Content Cast YouTube channel how he always got nervous before scraps, and said you would be a \"psychopath\" if you didn’t.",
      "And asked about the “tastiest” fixture for a City hooligan, his answer was far from a surprise this time.",
      "“It has always been United for us,” he said. “Always. The rivalry runs deep, do you know what I mean? There was a real hatred. Well, there is still a real hatred.”",
      "However, while Anthony won’t be cheering on the Red Devils when they take on Arsenal at Old Trafford in their opening Premier League game today (August 17), he did say he has friends who support his rival club.",
      "And giving a unique insight into what that was like during his hooligan days, he said: “Yeah, the mad thing is, any time when we are not playing, I spoke to lads, United’s firm, who would speak to each other on the phone and arrange where we are going and where we are going to meet.",
      "“We would go and have a pint with each other and we would shake hands and everything else and then the day of the game they are f***ing bottling each other.",
      "“It is mad when you say it like that, but, that was it. That is what we were all there for.”",
      "Anthony is now a family man with two daughters and a son and he has left his days fighting on the terraces behind him.",
      "Instead, he went on to become a professional boxer at the age of 37, and before retiring, he had a record of four wins and three defeats.",
      "And referring to his past on a previous podcast with Dodge Woodall, he said: “My eldest, my lad, knows a lot of my past and now I try to advise him where not to go wrong as I did.",
      "“To be the person I am today and be able to have the relationship I have with my kids is amazing. I thank God every day and know I am totally blessed with this second chance in life.”",

      "United have been busy and, on paper, far more dangerous. A £200m trio of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbuemo brings pace, pressing and variety. The blend should trouble most back lines, even if the combinations and timing will take a few weeks to settle. Expect United to play more front foot football, look to turn Arsenal’s full backs, and draw midfielders out of shape to create space between the lines",
      "Arsenal arrive with the league’s best defensive record from last season, conceding only 34 goals. That platform remains their edge in big matches. Martin Zubimendi’s arrival adds a top class controller to a midfield already comfortable dictating tempo. Up front, Viktor Gyokeres has been recruited to supply the penalty box punch that sometimes eluded them. With those pieces, Arsenal can mix patience with directness, switching from methodical build up to quick surges when the gap appears",

      "Gary Neville was left speechless after Ian Wright pointed out one potential negative scenario involving Manchester United summer signing Benjamin Sesko. The Slovenian arrived from RB Leipzig for £66.4million up front with add-ons of around £7.6m.",
      "For many years, Sesko, 22, has been considered one of the most exciting young strikers in Europe. However, considering he is still learning his trade and joining a United team that only scored 44 Premier League goals last year, there are still question marks as to how he will fare.",
      "Instead of solely focusing on Sesko, Neville also addressed fellow summer signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, giving the trio a target of 35 goals between them. Wright took issue with this comment, as earlier in their podcast, Neville said Viktor Gyokeres' debut campaign with Arsenal would be a disappointment if he only scored 10 Premier League goals.",
      "On the Stick to Football podcast, Neville opened up the conversation by asking: \"Sesko, we know less about him. Obviously, we’ve seen bits about him. We’ve seen centre-forwards come to United over the last six, seven or eight seasons and it’s not been easy. There is going to be pressure on him, obviously [Rasmus] Hojlund is still there.\"",
      "Wright then replied: \"The thing as well with him is that he scored 13 goals in 33 Bundesliga appearances last season. [Omar] Marmoush left in December and had 15.",
      "\"That says to me as a striker he should be scoring more at that level. I think like Gyokeres, he has got such great ability and physicality, I think he will get 15 goals.”",
      "Neville then went on to say a tally of between \"10 or 13\" goals would be a success for Sesko, providing Mbeumo and Cunha make up the other 25 goals between them. However, Wright again called out the ex-United captain's verdict, comparing it with the much higher bar he set for Gyokeres.",
      "He said: \"What if Sesko only scored 10? Seriously, what if he only got 10. You just turned your nose up when I mentioned Gyokeres potentially only getting 10 and now you’re thinking about Sesko only getting 10.”",
      "As Neville pointed out Gyokeres is older than Sesko, Wright refused to let him off the hook. The ex-England defender then tried to form a point by saying: \"I think 10…” and then found himself silenced by his own internal thoughts.",
      "As Wright turned around to Jamie Carragher, Jill Scott and Roy Keane, Neville said: \"The reason I am stuttering is because I’m wondering how Cunha and Mbeumo are going to do. If he scores 10 and the others can chip in with 12 a piece, I would still say 35 from the three of them is massive.”",
      "When Wright further interrogated him about suggesting 10 goals for Gyyokeres would be nowhere near enough, Neville replied: \"The reason I said that is because I think Arsenal will create so many more chances. They will have so much more play.",
      "\"They are a much better team. He (Gyokeres) is going to be in a better team. He’s going to get more chances. Sesko is not going to get as many chances as Gyokeres. That is where I would be at with it.\"",

      "However, Amorim left Sporting last year to take over at Old Trafford and Arsenal have now forked out around £64million to bring Gyokeres to the Emirates. The Swedish striker had been heavily linked with a potential reunion with Amorim at United, but that did not materialise.",
      "And according to a new report from the Daily Mail, United did not even make an approach for Gyokeres as they believed the 27-year-old had his heart set on a move to Arsenal. The report notes that United did not want to lose another transfer battle after missing out on Liam Delap to Chelsea.",
      "Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is also said to have been convinced after just one phone call with Gyokeres that the player only wanted to join the Gunners and United ended up spending £74million to bring in Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig instead.",
      "\"That is a question for Mikel,\" Amorim said when asked about Gyokeres ahead of Sunday's clash. \"Viktor is in a different league, the physicality is different.",
      "\"In Sporting, they have a very good group of scouting, because we get from that the players that they can buy and then sell to survive. I think he's a very good player, he's going to give different characteristics.",
      "\"It's going to be different if we face in the beginning of the game if we face Viktor or Havertz, for example. So, we need to be prepared for that, but it's not a surprise to watch Viktor in a big club in England.\"",

      "\"They are fighting for the places. I'm really happy. I think he has great potential. In everything he does. He can play different types of football.",
      "\"He's going to feel that the Premier League is really aggressive, he's going to learn, but he has a great potential and I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years. That's why we paid so much money to have a striker that will have his history in our club.\"",

      "For better or for worse, Alexander Isak has shown he's not afraid to back his corner - as evidenced by his defiant response to former Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag. The Liverpool dressing room know exactly the sort of character they'll be getting if they do smash the British transfer record to sign him this summer.",
      "The Newcastle United striker has drawn plenty of flak in recent weeks amid his push for a blockbuster move to Anfield - but he's proved he can give as good as he gets when challenged. A prime example came after Ten Hag accused Newcastle of time-wasting during the 2023 Carabao Cup final. \"We know they delay,\" the then-Manchester United manager complained. \"It's something referees don't want.\"",
      "Isak was quick to fire back when asked about those comments following Newcastle's 2-0 Premier League win over United a few weeks later. \"I don't really agree,\" he said firmly. \"We worked with intensity, and we were the team that wanted to win - the team bringing the game forward.\"",
      "He didn't stop there, either. Turning the criticism back on United, Isak added: \"They wasted more time than us. I don't put too much focus on that. I think we put in a great performance.\"",
      "The remarks showcase Isak's feisty nature and willingness to stand his ground - qualities mirrored in his ongoing attempts to engineer a move to Liverpool this summer. The Reds could add the 25-year-old to a star-studded revamped front line featuring Mohamed Salah, Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz.",
      "They're weighing up whether to smash the British transfer record for the second time this summer to secure his signature after doing so for Wirtz in a deal totalling £116m. Newcastle, however, are standing firm and demanding £150million - a figure Liverpool would naturally aim to drive down.",
      "That standoff may soon come to a head. Growing pressure could force Newcastle's hand, with reports claiming Isak is ready to down tools and refuse to play for the club even if his transfer demands are not met.",
      "Conversely, Liverpool's urgency may be already be fading thanks to Ekitike's blistering start to life on Merseyside. The Frenchman, signed for £69m from Eintracht Frankfurt, has wasted no time making his mark, scoring in the Community Shield defeat to Crystal Palace before finding the net again in Friday's victory over Bournemouth.",
      "A potential deal for Isak remains up in the air and with Newcastle yet to sign a replacement, there's no guarantee their stance will soften. He skipped the club's pre-season tour of Asia and even threatened to go on strike.",
      "His absence was felt on Saturday as he was left out of Newcastle's opening-day trip to Aston Villa, with Anthony Gordon deployed as a makeshift No. 9. The match finished goalless, with Newcastle failing to capitalise despite Ezri Konsa's red card in the 66th minute.",
      "Eddie Howe's side dominated possession and registered 16 shots, but only three were on target - a statistic that underlined just how much they missed Isak's cutting edge. As well as calling the wantaway striker \"greedy\", the travelling support even came up with a new song for their once beloved frontman.",
      "\"We don't care about Isak, he don't care about me,\" they roared as they left the stadium. \"All we care about is NUFC.\" When asked about the chant, Howe refused to condemn it.",
      "\"Whatever happens, I think the supporters acted really well today because they supported the team,\" he said. \"Not everything has been plain sailing but they've always been with the team. And then if afterwards they want to say something, I think they're very free to do that.\"",

      "Rooney was reportedly offered an £800,000 contract by the BBC for his new role. And his first opportunity to impress came on Saturday as the new season returned.",
      "Rooney was alongside fellow pundit Alan Shearer, while Mark Chapman hosted the programme for the first time since his appointment as the permanent lead. Not every viewer was a big fan of Rooney’s debut though.",
      "Taking to Twitter, one football fan said: “I’m going to say this now as it will be said all season; I mean no offence to him personally, but having Wayne Rooney on match of the day is a big mistake.”",
      "One fan replied: “Why???? He's an ex player who's won the tot at the top level why not have in on instead of people who know nothing about football???, “while another hit back: “He's no worse than 90% of footballer pundits. At least he's done it at the top level.”",
      "A further viewer then said: “He was an amazing footballer that has played and won at the top. But just because you have done something, does not automatically make you good to talk/explain and teach others well.”",
      "And while response to Rooney’s debut was mixed, one fan had a particularly amusing reaction to the broadcast, brutally echoing Tom Brady’s criticism of the legendary striker during his time with Birmingham City. They wrote: “I’m a little concerned about our new @BBCMOTD pundit’s work ethic…\"",
      "Rooney has been out of work since a number of difficult years as a manager. He was sacked by Birmingham after just 15 games in charge, with the Blues then falling into League One shortly after.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly weighing up a shock move for former goalkeeper David de Gea. The Spaniard spent 12 years at Old Trafford and made a total of 545 appearances across all competitions, helping them win the Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup and two League Cups.",
      "De Gea left United in 2023 after his contract expired, with Erik ten Hag deciding to replace him with Andre Onana. After spending a season as a free agent, De Gea joined Fiorentina in 2024 and the 34-year-old has impressed in Italy.",
      "After helping Fiorentina finish sixth last season and qualify for the Conference League, De Gea signed a new contract that runs until 2028. However, the Sun are reporting that his new deal includes a release clause that will let him leave for a 'relatively small sum'.",
      "The report states that United are considering a potential return for De Gea after being 'tipped off' about the clause. De Gea recently returned to Old Trafford with Fiorentina for a pre-season friendly and teased that their \"paths may cross again\".",
      "After being presented with a framed picture by United captain Bruno Fernandes, De Gea wrote on social media: \"A magical moment for me and my family to come back to Old Trafford — my home.",
      "\"From the bottom of my heart — I want to say thank you for the reception — for all the love you showed me. To the supporters that never stopped being with me throughout my time at this club. Our paths may cross again.\"",
      "Onana has failed to convince since joining United from Inter Milan and Ruben Amorim recently warned the goalkeeper that his place as the No.1 is under threat. \"Andre is like the other players,\" Amorim said ahead of United's opening game against Arsenal.",
      "\"They all have to win their place, so I'm not going to say if one player is No.1. He's ready to go to the game, so let's wait. Me as a coach and the players can do better than last year - and I have full confidence in that.\"",
      "Onana has conceded 148 goals in his two seasons at United and the Red Devils have been linked with a number of potential replacements so far this summer. However, they have primarily focused on strengthening their attack.",
      "More than £200million has been spent on forwards Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while teenage left-back Diego Leon has also joined from Cerro Porteno.",

      "Manchester United host Arsenal at Old Trafford in a match with multiple narratives unfolding. One of the most significant stories will be the reunion of Red Devils manager Ruben Amorim and the Gunners' star striker signing Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "The pair wreaked havoc together at Sporting Lisbon. Following Gyokeres' stunning hat-trick against Manchester City in the Champions League - Amorim's farewell home match as Sporting boss - it seemed inevitable he would follow him to Old Trafford.",
      "United were ready to go toe-to-toe with Arsenal in the battle for Gyokeres' signature, but the former Coventry City ace had his heart set on a move to the Emirates Stadium. He made his intentions crystal clear when questioned about his choice shortly after the official announcement.",
      "He said: \"There were other clubs, of course, but this wasn't a hard choice. I chose Arsenal. When I was playing against Arsenal last season [in the Champions League], I could really feel it was a very strong team and very difficult to play against.",
      "\"That made me choose Arsenal, and of course all the history the club has and the massive fanbase. It's been amazing to see all the support that they have already given me before I even arrived. That's what it's all about. It's going to be very nice to see them in the stadiums as well.\"",
      "Reports from Portuguese outlet Record claimed Gyokeres' agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, was left \"hurt\" by the United boss. As well as representing the Arsenal striker, he also looks after former United defender Victor Lindelof.",
      "Following eight years at Old Trafford, the Red Devils decided against offering the ex-Benfica centre-back fresh terms, leading to his departure on a free transfer. It's understood Lindelof was keen to remain and battle for his position, but Amorim chose to release the 31-year-old.",
      "This move reportedly left Cetinkaya \"upset\". At the time, it was claimed the door has been closed for a potential switch to Old Trafford for Gyokeres following Lindelof's departure.",
      "It proved irrelevant as it became clear the striker favoured Arsenal. United had also already dismissed themselves from pursuing him before securing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Gyokeres started making a name for himself at Coventry City, but his time under Amorim is what saw him become one of the most talked-about players in world football. Despite his admiration for the United manager, he confessed he was left stunned by his exit.",
      "He has previously said: \"It was a shock. It's never happened to me to see a manager leave in the middle of the season when everything was going well. It was surprising, but I totally understand his decision.\"",
      "Amorim also delivered some frank remarks about Gyokeres when quizzed about speculation surrounding the striker back in April. He appeared to hint the forward would not have fancied a switch to United unless they secured Champions League football.",
      "The Red Devils boss said: \"I didn't talk to Viktor. But if a player only wants to join Manchester United to play Champions League then that player will not come to Manchester United. We want players who want to represent United and not players who want to play only certain competitions.\"",
      "For better or worse, Amorim has relentlessly attempted to drill his tactical blueprint into United. Whilst there were occasions when it appeared the Portuguese manager was creating unnecessary difficulties by persisting with his 3-4-3 system, he's remained committed to the approach which delivered silverware at Sporting.",
      "If anyone flourished and thrived under Amorim's methods, it was Gyokeres. Previously, the striker acknowledged this himself in another interview.",
      "He said: \"We won two championships in a row, for the first time in 71 years. It's an incredible achievement, and of course, Ruben Amorim played a big role in that. I can't thank him enough. The style of play we had under his orders suited me perfectly.\"",
      "If Gyokeres had opted for United, his remarks about his ex-manager's playing style hint that he would have been optimistic about making a name for himself at Old Trafford. But a different story will now unfold, beginning with their reunion.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Viktor Gyokeres insisted there were “no hard feelings” when Ruben Amorim decided to abandon Sporting CP midway through last season. Amorim made the switch from the Jose Alvalade Stadium to Old Trafford in November last year while Sporting were still top of the Portuguese Primeira Liga.",
      "Gyokeres was left to spearhead the team without the manager that brought him to the club and, despite a rocky initial period, helped the side defend their league title and won the Taca de Portugal. Last month, Gyokeres followed his former boss to the Premier League, but opted to join rivals Arsenal over Amorim’s Manchester United.",
      "The Swedish striker’s £64million fee means he arrives with huge expectations to perform under Mikel Arteta as the Gunners look to go one better than their second-placed finishes over the past three seasons. As if Gyokeres’ debut coming on Sunday against United at Old Trafford wasn’t enough pressure, all eyes will be on his performance against the team and manager he effectively rejected.",
      "Amorim will know all too well of the threat the 27-year-old poses, as Gyokeres scored his first goal in an Arsenal shirt during the pre-season win over Athletic Club last weekend. And to make the two English giants’ 2025/26 Premier League opener even more interesting, United have since signed former Arsenal target Benjamin Sesko.",
      "There is likely to be a warm embrace between Amorim and Gyokeres despite some Sporting players being upset by the manner of his departure last autumn. After United forked out £11m to release him from his contract, the 40-year-old tactician did not officially start at Old Trafford until 11 days later, remaining with the Portuguese side to oversee clashes against Estrela, Manchester City in the Champions League, and Braga.",
      "After a 4-2 comeback win in his farewell against Braga, wing-back Geny Catamo told Bar Da Liga the players were distraught that their manager was leaving after such a momentous victory, saying: \"We were all celebrating in the locker room when he came in and announced he was indeed going to Manchester United. We were sad and cried. Most players cried. I believe I was one of those who cried the most that day.\"",
      "Gyokeres, though admitting his sadness upon hearing the news, made it clear that he didn’t harbour any resentment towards the young manager leaving in an interview with SIC earlier this year.",
      "The striker said: \"Of course, it was something that we, as a group of players, didn't want. Obviously, like you said, we were flying and winning every game in the league and doing well in the Champions League, too.",
      "\"It was a sad moment, but we totally understood his decision and there were no hard feelings. We spoke to him. Everything was very clear and there were no hard feelings.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment, but I think we all played a lot of games over a long period and then that kind of thing can happen. We've also changed coaches twice, we've had three different coaches.",
      "\"Then you can change the way you train or the amount of training and of course that can affect the body. Yes, we tried to take the best out of the situation, it was a hard period, but we got through it and still finished top of the league.\"",
      "Gyokeres’ comments came despite his agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, previously stating Amorim was the main reason his client joined Sporting two summers ago. Cetinkaya also revealed that a number of Premier League clubs were interested in signing the Sweden international last summer following his outstanding breakthrough season, but Gyokeres opted to stay due to Amorim remaining in charge.",
      "His soft stance on Amorim's exit may have also been a subtle indication that he was already planning his own exit, while his more distraught team-mates knew they'd be staying put. That, along with his agent's comments, mean it comes as no surprise that he too decided to leave this summer. Sunday’s clash provides the perfect chance for both Amorim and Gyokeres to prove a point to one another.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Arsenal need this season to be their season, while Manchester United just need theirs to not be a mess.",
      "Both sides collide in the headline act on the opening weekend of the 2025-26 Premier League, with new signings on both sides desperate to impress. Ruben Amorim has remodelled the United attack by adding Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta hopes he's finally landed the No.9 the club have craved in the shape of Viktor Gyokeres.",
      "It may be just the first game of the season but there already feels like there is a lot on the line for both, so we asked our team how they see the game going.",
      "Mikel Arteta may have been wrong about Arsenal having more Premier League points than anyone else in the past three seasons, but one thing the Spaniard isn't mistaken about is that it's win or bust for the Gunners this season.",
      "The Spaniard has been backed to strengthen again in the summer and now has the No.9 he wants in Viktor Gyokeres. Where Arsenal are concerned, there is no more building. They simply have to win the title now.",
      "Of course, that doesn't mean they will. Liverpool and Manchester City, perhaps even Chelsea, will have a major say. But anything other than the trophy for Arteta isn't quite enough. Whether they live up to that pressure, we'll have to wait and see.",
      "United have made major changes over the summer. Those new signings will be looking to gel quickly for Ruben Amorim, himself under pressure to ensure that last season's 'free hit' doesn't extend into 2025-26.",
      "But on opening day, expect Arsenal to look to lay down a marker and do just that. I'd expect them to be too strong at Old Trafford and issue a statement of intent. Prediction: Man Utd 1 Arsenal 3",
      "Arsenal have been dealt a tough start to the season, and as well as Old Trafford they'll also go to Anfield and St James' Park before September is out, while they'll host Manchester City as well",
      "For Mikel Arteta it could come to represent an uncomfortable flashback to last season, and the pressure really is on the Gunners to start well and look as though this year could finally be the year.",
      "There's pressure on Ruben Amorim as well of course, there always is when you manage Manchester United, but its isn't quite the same. United fans are desperate to see progress, and so they'll be cheering on anything and everything positive that they see on Sunday. The atmosphere will be quite intense.",
      "There have been some truly woeful United teams in recent years, but Arsenal have still only won twice at Old Trafford since 2006. They don't like going there, and this will be a difficult day for them. Prediction: Man Utd 1 Arsenal 1",
      "Rarely do United start the Premier League season with a defeat and I don’t think we’ll see one today. Ruben Amorim’s team have had an injection of attacking talent and they’ll surely be more used to his system after a summer on the training ground.",
      "United’s new front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha - if they all start - will be difficult to handle for Arsenal, who won’t have been able to study them as a trio. I of course have to balance that with the fact that the Gunners are the best team in the country when it comes to defending, so I can’t seem them getting blown away.",
      "I’m going for a draw which will have the home side feeling optimistic for the season ahead and puts early pressure on Mikel Arteta. 1-1 with goals from Bruno Fernandes and Gabriel Martinelli. Prediction: Man Utd 1 Arsenal 1",
      "Let’s not forget, Manchester United were truly awful last season. Arsenal were far from that. While they’ve not managed to get to where they want to be just yet, the Gunners simply know what they are doing under Mikel Arteta. And they’ve now got the missing link that they’ve been needing for some time: Viktor Gyokeres. It’s really hard to envisage a situation where United manage to stop Arsenal from scoring given the amount of talent they have in their attack. And that will immediately put the hosts on the backfoot. Fans will point to United’s outlay on their attack as reason for optimism - and that should certainly make them better this season. But it won’t come right away, it might take time for all of their big name new signings to gel. That’s something they can’t afford if they’re to get a result against the Gunners. So, it’s tough to see past a relatively straight-forward Arsenal win at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. Prediction: Man Utd 0 Arsenal 2",
      "After the seemingly never-ending striker transfer sagas both Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim have got their men - actually they got each other's top targets. And if narrative has taught us anything it will be down to Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko to send the other club a message. Other tired cliches are available.",
      "Arsenal are currently the more cohesive unit, however Old Trafford has not been a happy hunting ground for the Gunners having won just two of their last 18 Premier League games there. Manchester United have added £200m worth of talent to their squad and have looked good throughout pre-season. But it may not be quite enough to take all three points.",
      "United and Arsenal have drawn each other in each of their last two meetings and I expect them to repeat that again. Prediction: Man Utd 2 Arsenal 2",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Eyes will be firmly on Benjamin Sesko when Manchester United host Arsenal in their Premier League curtain-raiser. The Slovenian is set for his Red Devils debut against the Gunners, who themselves chased his signature for months.",
      "This season, the 22-year-old will be leading Ruben Amorim's frontline with the heavy burden of a price tag worth £66.4million with potential add-ons of up to £7.6m on his shoulders. The precocious forward is widely considered to be one of the most exciting young players in Europe.",
      "Now the pressure is as high as it possibly can be, particularly with United in dire need of improvement after a woeful campaign last season. However, if the comments of his former team-mates are anything to go by, the striker certainly has the temperament to succeed.",
      "Sesko was not the only new forward to arrive at Old Trafford. Former Brentford striker Bryan Mbeumo joined in a deal worth £71m. In one of his first interviews at United, Mbeumo gave his thoughts on Sesko's early contributions to the group, saying: \"He looks like a cool guy.",
      "\"We’re just being normal, just having normal conversations. He’s a good guy. I think it’s important [to help people settle], especially when you come from another league and you don’t really know [things here].",
      "\"I think it’s important to make them feel at home already. I think everyone is doing this naturally, we don’t really calculate anything, but I think this is really important.\"",
      "Sesko and Erling Haaland both made their breakthroughs while playing for RB Salzburg, so comparisons between the two were inevitable. Interestingly, he once claimed many of his former colleagues told him he is a better player than the Manchester City hitman, saying: \"My team-mates at the club tell me that Haaland and I are very similar, especially in terms of speed. Most of them even tell me that I'm better than him!\"",
      "He was reminded of that particular comment during an interview with the The Telegraph. Instead of backing it up, Sesko rowed back on the quote, perhaps with a view of trying to appear more humble. He said: \"What should I say? This is comparing me to someone who is one of the best players in the world.",
      "\"So, it’s not easy to compare. I would not like to compare myself to anyone. I would just love to be myself and be the best myself.”",
      "United fans will be encouraged by his comments, as it shows he is not looking to get ahead of himself and put himself above other top players, before he has even kicked a ball in the Premier League.",
      "Of course, the performances Sesko will be measured by will be his displays at Old Trafford and the rest of the Premier League grounds. However, one comment from his former colleague Ridle Baku will be a huge green flag for United fans.",
      "Many great players such as Eden Hazard were often considered as terrible and lazy trainers, but made up for it with their performances in games. While the latter remains to be seen in the Premier League, many of Sesko's past colleagues have said they've been impressed by his performances and attitude in training sessions.",
      "Baku told FourFourTwo: \"Our striker Sesko, I was really impressed, to be honest. The first training session, I knew already that he's a good player.",
      "\"But I'm speaking about potential, probably he's not [currently at] potential he could be, but right now, what I saw already, very impressive. He has everything to be a world-class player.\"",
      "Throughout his time at RB Leipzig, Sesko mostly played with experienced Danish forward Yussuf Poulsen. Despite playing with the likes of Christopher Nkunku, Timo Werner and Alexander Sorloth, who all have impressive goalscoring records, Poulsen placed Sesko above all of those.",
      "However, he also admitted the forward is a great player to play alongside, suggesting Sesko is not a selfish player who could grate against his team-mates. Speaking to TNT in December, Poulsen said: \"As a striker, he's the best I've played with. If you look at his abilities, he has everything a top number 9 needs.",
      "\"He's still young, he still needs to learn, not the technical things about being a striker but maybe more the finesse side. He has everything, strength shooting, technique, everything.",
      "\"I like working with him and I'm trying to get him there – he'll go on and score a lot of goals for us and some point go to the club he'll love to play for.\"",
      "There was plenty of attention on Sesko's transfer saga, but he made few headlines in comparison to fellow strikers Viktor Gyokeres and Alexander Isak. Gyokeres went on strike to force through a move to Arsenal, while Isak has told Newcastle United he will not play for them again, in order to try and secure a move to Liverpool.",
      "However, Sesko did not go out of his way to barrage his way out of Leipzig. While the Bundesliga side did make him train on his own, the Slovenian never went on strike or threatened to take firm action against his side.",
      "\"We took a lot of time to get to know the players and talk with everybody before we brought players into our group. That is going to be a rule and will be massive in our decision to sign a player.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United’s long wait for the new season is nearly over. There’s just a few hours to go until the Red Devils take on Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim has been hard at work getting his squad prepared as he attempts to improve on the club’s rotten form from last season. One way he has gone about that is splashing the cash in the transfer market.",
      "United have spent over £200m this summer in an effort to bolster the club’s attack - Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko all having signed. And despite that outlay, Amorim’s side might not be done there.",
      "They are still after a new midfielder amid links with Brighton star Carlos Baleba. There might also be exits to thrash out, with Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund all primed for the exit door.",
      "With that being said, take a look at the latest transfer news and rumours coming out of Old Trafford over the past 24 hours:",
      "Carlos Baleba is reportedly still keen to secure a move to Man United despite Brighton’s hard-line stance. The Seagulls have made it known over the past couple of days that they do not want to sell the midfielder under any circumstances.",
      "It is suggested that Baleba would be willing to bide his time as he is aware that he is still developing. But he is still keen to keep pushing over the next 12 months to secure a switch to Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking ahead of this weekend’s Premier League opener vs Fulham, Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler said: \"I didn't see any change [in Baleba]. He only changed his hair, so I think that was the only change he made the last two weeks. But overall, he seems to be in a really good place. He's enjoying it with his team-mates, he's enjoying being a Brighton player.",
      "\"He's very grateful to have the process he had in the last season, so I didn't see any big change. And he's an option to start for tomorrow.\"",
      "Man United icon Gary Neville has revealed his surprise at the club’s huge transfer outlay this summer - but still thinks there is one glaring weakness. He said: “Mbeumo, Cunha, Sesko – a lot of eyes on them at United I think Manchester United fans, including myself, are surprised they’ve gone and spent that level of money.",
      "“We thought that obviously after the Europa League final, that the money wouldn’t be there at that level. So to get those three players, who look like a really good profile – two of them have Premier League experience – we need them to do well, because the rest of the team…",
      "“We need a goalkeeper. There are definitely issues with the defence and midfield. But if the three strikers are a real handful and are scoring goals… last season United’s return in front of goal was really poor, so it’s really important that Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha get off to a really good start.”",
      "The agent of Benjamin Sesko has revealed that he was willing to give up his part of the fee in order to push through a move to Man United. Speaking on Slovenian outlet POP! TV's 24UR programme via GOAL Elvis Basanovic said: \"At one point the clubs (United and Leipzig) were far apart on the valuation.",
      "“United had reached the limit of their budget for the transfer. On the other side Leipzig had demands and expectations which were higher based on Benjamin's value. That created a gap that needed to be solved.",
      "\"At one point I decided to give up part of my own fee, to bridge the gap, because I felt it was the right thing to do. For me, a player's wishes and dreams should always come before the agent's interests.\"",

      "Jurrien Timber turned his summer holiday into a world tour - until Arsenal told him to stay at home. The Dutch full-back’s whistle-stop travel odyssey took him to Turkey, Curacao, Miami, Marbella and the Asian hinterlands and he grinned: “I have seen the whole world in two months.”",
      "But the Gunners, who sent a fitness trainer with Timber on some of his overseas trips, stepped in and asked him to stop getting his passport stamped. On Sunday he joins Arsenal’s latest crusade to go one better than runners-up in the last three seasons in an opening-day headline clash against Manchester United with his ankle problem healed and £200million of new team-mates to boost their charge.",
      "Timber explained: “I had surgery at the end of last season, an ankle operation to take something out that was bothering me for a long time towards the of the season, but I feel good now. I could not sit still during the summer to get fit, so I went to a lot of nice places. At the same time I was doing rehab. I have been to Turkey and Curacao, where my mum is from. I went with the family which was nice.",
      "“I went to Miami for a couple of days and also Marbella. It was good - and I went to Asia, of course. I have seen the whole world in two months. Someone was with me from the club and I had more places to go, but the club said, ‘That is too much!’",
      "“At the beginning I was on crutches so I could not do much, but when I was off crutches I had someone with me.”",
      "Timber’s mobility and versatility made him a vital component of the Premier League ’s meanest defence last season - just 34 goals shipped in 38 games, seven fewer than champions Liverpool.",
      "The Gunners will need to be miserly again over the next nine months and Timber admitted: “I did not realise that had the best record. We know we were defending well and doing well as a unit but we were focusing on ourselves. We have a lot of good defenders and we defend with the whole team. The amount of defenders we have at the back, the competition is amazing and it makes each other better.”",
      "Arsenal’s first six league games include dates with United, Liverpool, Manchester City and Newcastle - and there is a perception that their title challenge will be defined before the end of September.",
      "Timber said: “It is a tough beginning, isn’t it? But I think last season we also had a tough start last season and it can go both ways. If you start well, it can be amazing. That is the challenge. But I think we also need to have that approach of it being another game we need to win. That is the best way to approach it.",
      "\"Arsenal have shown the last couple of years already that we will always be fighting for the title. And every year they are trying to strengthen the squad, this summer as well. We have an amazing group and a group to do amazing things. You can tell we are close, it is just that last step.",
      "“There is nothing more you can do than just go for it and fight for it all the way. We have the manager for it, we have the team for it, we have the club for it. That is the reason why everyone is so excited to start again. Give it all because we know we have the chance.",
      "\"I think everyone's expecting a lot from them this season. Chelsea are looking amazing and there are so many good teams, it is going to be tough for sure.",
      "“That's why it is so important to focus on ourselves and believe in what we can do. We can't look at too many teams and what is happening around the league. I don't think that would be good for us or for anyone.”",

      "Ruben Amorim believes Manchester United’s route back to the top must be paved with Old Trafford victories. The Theatre of Dreams became the Theatre of Nightmares last season, with United losing nine of their 19 home games in the Premier League, conceding 28 goals and scoring just 23.",
      "Amorim knows his team must turn their stadium into a fortress if they are going to once again challenge at the top of the table - and he revealed that the club’s £210million spending spree to forge an attack that will consist of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo was driven by a desire to bring some thrills back to Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim said: “We’ve got to make it (Old Trafford) an enjoyable place for our fans. That is really important. We start with one game against Arsenal, a very good team. Everyone in this room thinks Arsenal are going to win. I know that. But we will be there on Sunday to change things.",
      "“It’s not a mental thing - but it’s not just the players, it’s also the fans. In the (friendly) game against Fiorentina you could feel it. The fans were a little bit nervous. This feeling, you cannot change it in one day or one game. It’s a feeling that we have to fight. Everyone together - the players, the coaches and the fans. Together we are going to change things.",
      "“If you want to win things and be a very strong team, then especially at home you have to win games.”",
      "United endured their worst top-flight season for 51 years, with Amorim unable to halt the slide after succeeding Erik ten Hag in November. Sesko has been signed from RB Leipzig for £73.6million - and the 22-year-old Slovakian’s arrival is likely to signal the departure of £72million flop Rasmus Hojlund to Inter Milan.",
      "Mbeumo arrived from Brentford in a £71million package after United started the summer by triggering Cunha’s £62.5million buy-out clause at Wolves. Amorim believes his terrific trio can conjure up the magic to win games even when his team are second best.",
      "He said: “I know that in some moments we are going to struggle because it’s a game against Arsenal. But we are more prepared and I feel we have more players who can help, in one moment, to change the momentum of the game.",
      "“That gives you confidence. We have more options. If things are not working well, we can change. That gives me more confidence in every game. It’s that feeling that even if we struggle here and there in the way we play, we can still score.",
      "“Cunha can catch the ball and do something. Bryan can make one run and be there to score a goal. These kinds of things can help us a lot.”",
      "Amorim feels he has been able to put his fingerprint on the United team, with disruptive influences like Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho either booted out of the club or banished from the first-team picture. But he insists that the levels of expectation remain unchanged.",
      "He added: “Since the first moment the team was my responsibility - and I feel the same. I am always under pressure to perform. It’s impossible to be here and not feel the pressure every day. I am just more confident that we can do it.",
      "“We are ready for the season. We prepared well in pre-season. Now we start, we are going to struggle, but whatever you see on Sunday, we are going to improve during the season.",
      "“We are prepared to win against Arsenal - and that’s the only thing that matters.”",

      "Manchester United's Premier League campaign begins today as they face Arsenal at Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side will be looking to put their miserable 2024/25 campaign behind them by starting with a win against the Gunners. Despite last season's struggles, there's optimism in the air at Old Trafford after an uplifting summer for the club. United went unbeaten in pre-season and have made some quality additions to their squad.",
      "There will be plenty of competitive debuts to watch out for today, with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko all in line to play this afternoon.",
      "In terms of the other team news, United will be without Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui, but Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee could both return.",
      "We'll bring you live build-up, updates and reaction in the blog below",
      "Berrada has penned a letter to fans in the match programme to face Arsenal, and said:",
      "\"Welcome back to Old Trafford for our first game of the new Premier League season where we host this aftenoon's opponents, Arsenal.",
      "\"We arrive back after a positive pre-season, starting in Sweden, before the Premier League Summer Series in the US and the Snapdragon Cup here at Old Trafford last weekend.",
      "\"It's always a pleasure to see our incredible fans all around the world. Manchester United's passionate and dedicated following never disappoints. Wherever we go, you are always out in force.",
      "\"It's been a summer of change, as we moved into our fully refurbished men's training complex at Carrington. It is truly best in class and reflects the significant investment which has been made in it.",
      "\"We have no doubt that it will create a high-performance environment for our coaches, players and staff. Jason Wilcox and the football department have been working hard over the summer to attract the best talent to help us improve the squad.",
      "\"We're delighted to have Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Diego Leon with us and we're confident about the impact they will have.\"",
      "According to The Athletic, Hojlund has been dropped from the squad for today's game. That would be a ruthless decision from Amorim, but it did feel like he was finished at Old Trafford last weekend when he was an unused substitute against Fiorentina and Mount started down the middle in the false nine role.",
      "Hojlund was awful last season and has nobody else except himself to blame for being forced out this summer. Some fans will feel for Hojlund, though. He allegedly supports the club and worked hard to secure his dream move from Atalanta, but it just hasn't worked out.",
      "There is a plaque up at Carrington quoting the late Kath Phipps: “Smile, you’re playing for Manchester United”. It was impossible not to smile upon seeing Leanne Bartram at the front desk downstairs. She ‘left’ United in the summer after 25 years and had a well-attended leaving do. But she is back. Supposedly for just one game. But as an invaluable colleague, her presence puts a spring in our step.",
      "Ruben Amorim has changed United's pre-match routine at Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking to MUTV about the decision, Amorim said: “I always had the feeling that we arrive at Old Trafford and Old Trafford must be the centre of the game, but we cannot spend four hours there waiting for the game.",
      "“And I feel with these facilities [at Carrington] we can be here, preparing for the game away from Old Trafford and when we arrive at Old Trafford, we have to feel the fans and then go directly to the game, not killing the momentum of the connection with our fans.",
      "“We know that we have a lot of people waiting there for us, to be with the players and to sign autographs. We will try to do the same.",
      "“So, it's going to be the same experience for the fans. But for us it's going to be better because we are going to feel, nearer the game, the momentum with the fans and we will spend less time in there.”",
      "Amorim admitted United supporters will still succumb to nerves during their home games this season.",
      "United won only seven of their Premier League matches at Old Trafford last term as they were beaten nine times, the most home league losses they have suffered since 1962-63.",
      "Amorim has changed United's pre-match routine for home games and they will no longer arrive at Old Trafford four hours before kick-off, a measure introduced by Erik ten Hag in 2022. The players will instead maximise the facilities at United's new £50million hub at Carrington that opened last week.",
      "Read what he said here >>>",
      "Amorim has overseen a positive pre-season and has been backed with a number of big signings.",
      "Sesko was unveiled before the final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina last weekend and could make his debut today.",
      "United will be without Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui, but Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee could return.",
      "See how our writers think United should line up here >>>",
      "Casemiro’s post would appear to confirm he is starting. That wouldn’t be a surprise as he started in three of the five friendlies. Someone mentioned on Friday that United also need to be mindful of Arsenal’s set-piece threat.",
      "But it’s a worry. United wanted rid of Casemiro last year and he is one of the main reasons they haven’t signed a midfielder. He is 33 and only cut it in European games last season. Ie. when the pace can sometimes be played at a walking football level.",
      "As for Ugarte, it is another galling day. He badly struggled against Everton in Atlanta and that seems to have made Amorim’s mind up. That United are trying to get in another defensive midfielder speaks volumes.",
      "Erik ten Hag, for all his flaws, was not sold on Ugarte. Neither was I. But a fanbase is bound to lap up a Latino recruit from Paris Saint-Germain. That United did PSG a favour said it all.",
      "An unbeaten pre-season campaign has been bolstered by the signings of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford and Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "And fans should get their first glimpse of their new front three when they take on the Gunners this afternoon as Amorim will likely unleash his new dream attack.",
      "Manchester United predicted XI vs Arsenal: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Maguire; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Sesko",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has refused to confirm who will start in goal for their opening Premier League fixture against Arsenal.",
      "\"It's like the other players,\" Amorim said when asked if Onana would start against Arsenal. \"Everyone has to win the place. So I'm not going to say if one player is number one. He's ready to go to the game. Let's wait. You will know Sunday.\"",
      "Read the full story, here.",
      "The former Newcastle and England captain has told Betfair he believes United and Arsenal will play out a draw at Old Trafford.",
      "It's wonderful for us to sit down on Sunday and watch two giants go head to head so early in the season. Tough one to call so I'll go for a draw.",
      "There's always a surprise result on the opening weekend. I don't know what a surprise result would be in this game. It's so tough to call with so many interesting moving parts. Gyokores on one side, Sesko on the other.",
      "Amorim and Gyokores know each other really well. Zubimendi may free up Declan Rice more, Man United have done really well in forward positions. It's a tough one to call so early in the season. There'll be needle at Old Trafford.",
      "Prediction: Draw.",
      "Amorim scrapping the extremely early arrival time is logical, as long as United don’t encounter bad traffic. That was an issue for them under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, whose tenures coincided with neverending roadworks in Manchester. The mayor, Andy Burnham, said he was glad when Mourinho was sacked as the Portuguese publicised how congested Manchester was. That was more Mayor Quimby than Mayor Burnham.",
      "It is logical for United to maximise their new £50m facilities at Carrington. It is a working environment you want to remain at for a longer period. I say that as a journalist who was the joint-last to leave on Friday.",
      "When Erik ten Hag scrapped the pre-match Lowry stays and insisted on United arriving at Old Trafford four hours before kick-off, there was general approval. That squad needed to be kept in check and the manager had to have total authority after a couple of substitute teachers. But the measures are only effective as long as the form is good. And the form was not good after the first season.",
      "Ideally, if or when Old Trafford is rebuilt, a hub would be installed that provides a pre-match base for the team so that they can get to the ground at a sensible time and have the right facilities. It felt telling that United never gave anyone a peek at the hospitality lounge that doubled as a players’ lounge after that was repurposed two years ago.",
      "United should be aiming to qualify for the Champions League this season. They have invested more than £200million to improve their attack, they have kept their best player, their central defence is settled, they will have ample rest between games and many clubs that finished above United last season have stood still. Looking at Villa’s XI yesterday is not cause for dread if you are of a United persuasion. Newcastle could end the window weaker, too.",
      "Clubs have gone from 10th and 15th one season to winning the league the next season in the past ten years. I cannot see United challenging for the title but, given fifth should secure Champions League qualification, that has to be a realistic aim. There are not five teams that are clearly and obviously better off than United.",
      "It’s understandable that United are settling on the target of qualifying for Europe. That could be through a number of routes and it is probably wise not to specify which competition.",
      "European football has left an indelible mark on United. The Munich clock, the Munich tunnel and the Munich memorial plaques are evidence of that. Playing in Europe has heavily defined United. Their worldwide popularity Is related to the Munich air disaster in 1958 and the remarkable recovery that culminated in their maiden European Cup victory at Wembley ten years later. That history has to elicit a response from this squad after the anaemic performance in Bilbao nearly three months ago.",
      "Build-up to the action will begin at approximately 4pm on Sunday afternoon, after the final whistle sounds in the 2pm kick-off between Chelsea and Crystal Palace.",
      "United vs Arsenal is set to kick-off at 4.30pm on Sunday, August 17 at Old Trafford in the Premier League.",
      "Hello and welcome to our live blog of United's clash with Arsenal.",
      "There's positivity in the air at Old Trafford after an uplifting few months for the club. The Europa League final defeat to Spurs has been followed by an encouraging pre-season and a some positive moves in the transfer window.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is expected to make his United debut, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo set to join him.",
      "It promises to be a great afternoon at Old Trafford and we'll bring you all the updates you need throughout the day."

      "Regarding the team news, United will be without Lisandro Martinez and Noussair Mazraoui, but Andre Onana and Joshua Zirkzee will be available for selection again this weekend.",
      "Here's how our writers think United should line up:",
      "United could be one player away from their strongest XI. Sesko has to go straight in. He's had plenty of training time and there is no point beating about the bush with a new No.9. There is not a realistic alternative, either, given Rasmus Hojlund could struggle to even make the bench today.",
      "Manuel Ugarte has to get up to speed. Casemiro could be redundant this season and pitting him against Arsenal is asking for trouble. So is Ugarte, possibly, but he was signed last year to offer longevity in midfield and United have to try and make it work.",
      "Luke Shaw seems likeliest to come in on the left of the back three but having him start for United at the start of his 12th season should not be entertained as a point of principle. So Ayden Heaven it is.",
      "The 'keeper is straightforward: Andre Onana is first choice and better than Altay Bayindir.",
      "Steven Railston",
      "Onana needs to be replaced, but he's the best option to start in between the sticks after recovering from a hamstring injury. Yoro, Maguire and De Ligt are the strongest back three at Amorim's disposal.",
      "There are concerns about the midfield for the season. Fernandes and Ugarte feels like the best partnership to start the campaign with, but a fresh face needs to be secured before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Amad has started every game in pre-season and should start at right wing-back, while it's a no-brainer to start the new signings, Mbeumo, Sesko and Cunha, across the attacking line.",
      "George Smith",
      "Onana needs to start between the posts and make his first appearance since the Europa League final. Yoro is a shoo-in as the right-sided centre-back after starting four of United's five friendlies, but there is less of a guarantee about who will start next to him.",
      "As difficult a call as it is, I would choose De Ligt in the middle and Heaven on the left. The latter has not put a foot wrong since joining the club and will be keen to make his mark against his old club.",
      "Amad and Dorgu should occupy the wing-back positions, and Ugarte should partner Fernandes in the middle. United need a new midfielder before the deadline, but Ugarte currently offers the best level of protection for Fernandes in midfield.",
      "Amorim should unleash his new-look forward line from the off, meaning Mbeumo and Cunha should support Sesko.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim might have dropped to his haunches before kick-off if he saw Viktor Gyokeres strolling around the centre circle and Manchester United did not have a new striker in their own half.",
      "But Benjamin Sesko is ready to start. Whether he does will be debated in the pubs around Old Trafford until the team news is published at 3.15pm on Sunday.",
      "Amorim trialled strikerless sides in Manchester United's last two friendlies against Everton and Fiorentina, seemingly preparing a plan B in case Sesko did not arrive in time. He did.",
      "Sesko's private jet touched down at Manchester Airport last Thursday. He was paraded by United on Saturday and trained with his new teammates last Sunday. He has already dined in Spinningfields and San Carlo.",
      "Logic would dictate the new £73.62million striker has to start. \"He (Sesko) has great potential,\" Amorim enthused, \"in everything he does.",
      "\"He can play different types of football. He’s going to feel that Premier League is really aggressive, he is going to learn but he has great potential. I can see Ben being a striker for Manchester United for a lot of years. That is why we paid so much money, to have a striker to have his history in our club.",
      "\"Of course, we didn’t have a lot of time but he’s ready. Physically, he’s ready, that is a big component in our league. Then he is really smart, every detail he asks, he is a guy who is always thinking. He spent all afternoon here working on his fitness, we will see if he is going to play, going to start.\"",
      "United want players to stay longer in their new £50m Carrington hub to maximise the facilities. Sesko dines in the canteen upstairs and then heads downstairs to the calming treatment room for additional stretches. Amorim raved about Sesko's inquisitiveness.",
      "\"I don’t need to tell Ben, 'Ben, this is Manchester United, a lot of pressure, you have to perform, you need to be ready for the physicality, we need to be ready for every game. It’s like do or die'. With that guy, I don’t have that concern. I have the opposite.\"",
      "It is rare that two of England's biggest clubs are pitted against each other on the opening weekend of a new campaign with new No.9s in their arsenal. The closest in recent memory was Manchester City and Liverpool in the 2022 Community Shield, when Darwin Nunez outshone Erling Haaland. Nunez started on the bench.",
      "Amorim is heavily responsible for Arsenal's £64m outlay on Gyokeres, a goalscorer who came to prominence at Sporting. In an era of exciting Scandinavian strikers, Gyokeres is at Arsenal, City have Haaland and Alexander Isak is burning bridges on the Tyne to get to Liverpool.",
      "Sesko has taken an identical career path to Haaland: from Red Bull Salzburg to Manchester, via budding Champions League qualifiers in the Bundesliga. Downplaying any more comparisons would be wise.",
      "Gyokeres, 27, is five years Sesko's senior but both will be similarly scrutinised. \"The physicality is different,\" Amorim noted. \"In Sporting, they have a very good group of scouting because they live from that, from the players that they can buy and then sell to survive.",
      "\"He’s a very good player. He’s going to give different characteristics. It’s going to be different if, in the beginning of the game, if we face Viktor or (Kai) Havertz, for example.",
      "\"We need to be prepared for that but it's not a surprise to watch Viktor in a big club in England.\"",
      "United discovered early in the window that Gyokeres was set on joining a Champions League club. His mask celebration is ostensibly inspired by Bane, Batman's antagonist in The Dark Knight Rises. One of the character's first lines in the film is, \"Now's not the time for fear, that comes later.\" United fans had enough fear last season.",
      "United do have a Scandinavian frontman, though it appears unlikely Rasmus Hojlund will get a kick for the club again. With Joshua Zirkzee back in team training, there is a chance Hojlund could be left out altogether from the matchday squad this weekend.",
      "Since Hojlund stopped in the mixed zone in Soldier Field, asked if anyone wanted to talk to him and outlined his intention to stay, Amorim has benched him in both of United's games. Hojlund had a cameo in Atlanta, where he kicked a post in anger. Then he did not get a kick as he warmed the bench against Fiorentina. Hojlund killed time by doing some ball juggling as he warmed up.",
      "Those close to Hojlund conceded he would have to leave now Sesko has come in. Hojlund is open to moving to AC Milan but the topic of his future was given short shrift by Amorim on Friday.",
      "\"He’s one more option. We will see. We are focused on this game and Rasmus is still our player.\"",
      "Zirkzee did not play for United throughout pre-season as he recovered from an injury and his only appearance in the past four months was his desperate emergence from the bench in the Europa League final. Hojlund was at least involved in training in midweek, having not been visible in their post-Fiorentina session.",
      "If Amorim is hesitant about whether to start Sesko, he may want to research how United's recent summer striker signings have fared on home debut. Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Zlatan Ibrahimovic each claimed two goals in wins.",
      "Sesko idolises Ibrahimovic. Emulating him on Sunday would lift Amorim from his haunches.",

      "The Premier League got back up and running Friday night with Liverpool beating Bournemouth in an eventful 4-2 victory. If that has whetted your appetite for the return of competitive football, strap yourself in, as you do not have long to wait until the Reds start their campaign against Arsenal.",
      "We shall be previewing the big match today, as well as keeping you up to date with the summer transfer window. MEN Sport understands the move for Carlos Baleba is unlikely to be completed before the deadline, but United are relaxed about the situation and are happy to delay the move until next year.",
      "In the meantime, thoughts turn to who could be United's alternative this summer. Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton is liked by manager Ruben Amorim and is thought to be on the radar.",
      "Murmurs of a return for former goalkeeper David De Gea have also been talked up, with the Spaniard having impressed in a pre-season clash with Fiorentina last weekend.

      "Sancho has attracted interest from both Besiktas and Roma.",

      "Man United-linked Baleba took to social media to share a message after featuring for Brighton in their 1-1 draw with Fulham.",
      "He wrote: \"Just me doing the thing I love most. Had fun playing at home with the boys. Nothing new here, just my number and a haircut.\"",
      "United had identified the youngster as a potential reinforcement, but Brighton’s £100m valuation, and their stance that he is not for sale, has forced United to wait at least another year.",
      "Patrick Dorgu has hinted that he could be in-line for a start on Sunday afternoon when the Premier League returns.",
      "United enter the new season tomorrow, at home to Arsenal, with expectations high. They struggled desperately in the Premier League last campaign after practically giving up on their domestic form to focus on the Europa League.",
      "Ahead of the match, posting on his story, Dorgu shared a custom match graphic for tomorrow afternoon's opener. While not a sure fire sign that he will be starting against the Gunners, players often share these posts on social media when they are all set to feature in some capacity.",
      "It is seen as a subtle nod to family and friends to tune in for the fixture. 2025 has been a break-out year for Dorgu after he was signed from Lecce in January.",
      "Manchester United and Jadon Sancho's working relationship looks all-set to come to an end this summer after a tumultuous couple of years.",
      "Sancho was banished from the first-team under the club's previous manager, Erik ten Hag, after claiming he was a scapegoat for the Dutchman. He joined Borussia Dortmund on loan in January and when he eventually returned to Old Trafford, Ten Hag claimed he had patched things up with the winger.",
      "After a loan spell with Chelsea last season, Sancho informed the club that he wanted to leave this summer and now it is a race against the clock to get that deal done.",
      "Football Italia understand that Hjulmand is one of the midfielders Juventus are interested in signing this summer.",
      "The Danish international has reportedly been on Juventus’ radar since his time at Lecce, before his move to Portugal. The report adds that while Sporting CP are keen to keep their captain until next summer, they may consider selling if a 'suitable offer' comes in.",
      "Having decided against pursuing a deal for Carlos Baleba, United have shifted their focus to Hjulmand, alongside Adam Wharton.",
      "As per Football Insider, former Man United chief scout Mick Brown has confirmed that Maguire will not leave the club this summer.",
      "He claims United have turned down multiple offers from interested parties. \"Man United aren’t going to let Maguire leave,\" he said. \"A few clubs have been interested and had made contact to check whether he would be available, but those talks have not been allowed to develop.",
      "\"They see Maguire as a very important part of the squad, both on the pitch and off it.He’s played consistently with all sorts of pressure, speculation and issues around him, and he’s come through that and proved himself. From what I hear, Ruben Amorim is a fan of him and he doesn’t want to see him go.",
      "\"He’s a leader and an experienced head in the dressing room for the younger players, but he’s also one of their better centre-backs every time he plays. He’s an integral part of what Amorim is looking to do, and there are no plans to let him go. As long as he’s fit, he’s an important part of the squad.\"",
      "According to Caught Offside, Man United are considering a summer move for Lee Kang-in from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "The winger is reportedly free to leave due to competition for places in France and has already been in direct contact with Arsenal.",
      "The report claims that it seems the South Korean could also depart alongside Gianluigi Donnarumma, as he is reportedly 'seriously' considering a move before the summer deadline.",
      "It's said that if Chelsea only manage to sell one member of that unwanted trio, Maresca may have to make do with the attacking options currently available to him.",
      "Reports from Portugal (via the Daily Mail) suggest that Gyokeres' representatives were left 'hurt' by the lack of a formal approach from Man United, which came as a surprise at Old Trafford.",
      "From United's perspective, Gyokeres' appearance at the stadium this season was always expected to be in an Arsenal shirt. Mikel Arteta also believed that Gyokeres' preference was clear after just one phone call.",
      "Behind the scenes, it's said that United had no interest in publicly losing a race they were never truly in.",
      "Fabrizio Romano claims Roma are 'still waiting' for Sancho's final decision after putting forward a contract proposal.",
      "Taking to X, Romano added: \"United are ready to accept £20m fee on loan + obligation, they want to get it done ASAP. Final green light now up to Jadon.\"",
      "Betis' No.7 shirt, worn by Antony during his loan from Man United in the second half of last season, is currently unassigned.",
      "Spanish newspaper Marca reports that it will remain so, with no current first-team player expected to take the number. Betis also still have an available non-EU spot, meaning Antony could return easily if a transfer is agreed.",
      "Betis porting director Manu Fajardo has confirmed the Spanish club is not giving up on re-signing the Brazilian. \"Both parties want him to be here this season,\" said Fajardo.",
      "\"Every day that passes allows us to dream of him being here. If Antony is here, it's because the numbers add up. The most important thing is the club's sustainability; we can't do anything crazy. It's okay to think big, but you also have to keep your feet on the ground.",
      "\"If he doesn't sign with a club, there are still options, but the deal would take place within the parameters we have budgeted at the club.\"",
      "According to reports in Italy, Sancho's salary demands is a problem for AS Roma.",
      "Italian media believe that the deal is likely to be structured as a loan with an obligation to buy, for a total fee of around €23m. However, Sancho's hefty salary is said to be beyond Roma's means, and the club are proposing a five-year contract to spread the salary over a longer period.",
      "It remains unclear whether he will accept the offer or hold out for more, with interest also coming from Juventus and Besiktas.",
      "Man United are not planning to proceed with a move for Baleba this summer despite being an admirer of the Brighton midfielder.",
      "United first held discussions with Brighton through intermediaries before the two clubs later spoke directly. But the Seagulls made it clear they do not intend to sell Baleba in this transfer window.",
      "The 21-year-old has started for Brighton against Fulham this afternoon.",
      "Both Morten Hjulmand and Adam Wharton have emerged as potential options.",
      "Man United face strong competiton for goalkeeper Senne Lammens.",
      "Providing an update, Fabrizio Romano said on YouTube: \"In case they go for a goalkeeper don’t forget the name I gave you in July. Lammens, the young goalkeeper of Royal Antwerp.",
      "\"United still like the player, they still have him on their shortlist. They still have to decide whether they want to go for a goalkeeper or not. It will also depend on the budget and the [new] midfielder. So there is a kind of puzzle for Man Utd in these final two weeks of the window, also including Senne Lammens at the moment.\"",
      "Meanwhile, The Telegraph suggests United must now choose whether to persist with their pursuit of Lammens or change course, as Inter Milan are said to have entered the race 'strongly.'",
      "Reports from Belgium suggested that Antwerp would demand an upfront fee in the region of €15m-€20m (£13m-£17.3m).",
      "According to reports in Portugal, Sporting CP have no intention of selling any more of their key players this summer.",
      "It’s noted that Hjulmand’s €80m (£69m) release clause was only valid until June 15, meaning there is currently no fixed price for the midfielder. As a result, Sporting would now be free to demand whatever fee they see fit.",
      "With Manchester United also exploring alternatives to Carlos Baleba, both Hjulmand and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton are believed to be under consideration.",
      "Sporting boss Rui Borges has already issued a warning to interested clubs. Speaking in his press conference this week, he said: \"They know the club's plans for potential departures. They [players] have [release] clauses; whoever wants to [sign them] has to trigger those clauses, of course.\"",
      "Ex-United captain Keane has warned that the price for Baleba's potential may be too high to pay. Speaking to the Stick to Football podcast, Keane said: \"I'd be surprised if it happened.",
      "\"Because I still think that kid... he's got to do a bit more. You're talking about £100m, but I still think it's potential with a lot of these players. You can't pay £100m for a player where you don't know which way he's going to go.\"",
      "More here.",
      "Brighton have named Manchester United-linked midfielder Carlos Baleba in the starting XI for this afternoon's Premier League clash against Fulham.",
      "The Seagulls value the midfielder at £115m.",
      "Manchester United reporter Steven Railston has looked at some alternative targets to Carlos Baleba this summer.",
      "Read the full story, here.",
      "After Liverpool and Bournemouth kicked off the new Premier League season last night, there are a further nine games across the next three days.",
      "Here is a full run-down of the fixtures across Saturday, Sunday and Monday:",
      "Aston Villa vs Newcastle",
      "Brighton vs Fulham",

      "United vs Arsenal",
      "Leeds vs Everton",
      "After being linked with a move to United, it appears the La Liga giants are wanting to snap up another English gem in the form of Crystal Palace's Wharton.",
      "The Daily Mail understands scouts from Madrid have watched Wharton in action and like what they see.",
      "Manchester City are also thought to be looking at Wharton with the Reds believed to be keen too.",
      "Speaking to BetVictor Casino, former Premier League manager Harry Redknapp has urged United to complete sales before the transfer window closes at the beginning of September.",
      "A successful season for Manchester United would be obviously a trophy of some sort but a top six finish would be a massive improvement. Ruben Amorim has got a hard job on his hands but they have brought some decent players in, I think that the recruitment looks like it's okay and they're not finished yet they're gonna bring a few more in so it all depends who they bring in. Really the team needs rebuilding and he needs to get a few out. He's got a few there that he doesn't fancy who are not probably good around the place attitude wise and you know you only need a few bad apples at your club and they can absolutely destroy your football club and it seems to me that he has got one or two there that he feels are bad apples and until he gets them out he's always going to have a problem. He's obviously pushed them to one side. He's not taking players on the trip that he didn't feel were part of what he's looking to do. It's been bold and I like the manager. I think he comes over great, full of enthusiasm and he knows what he wants. But good players are the most important thing. To be a great manager, the most important ingredient is to have great players. Manchester United certainly didn't have great players last year. They were a very, very poor group. Hopefully they are improving this year. I'd love to see them do better.",
      "According to Caught Offside, United are among the clubs looking at PSG midfielder Lee Kang-in.",
      "The attacking midfielder has a contract until 2028 at the French giants and therefore would not be considered an easy or cheap acquisition.",
      "Napoli and Arsenal are also thought to be keen on the 24-year-old with the latter claimed to have made direct contact for the South Korean."

      "The Spaniard is said to be happy to be either first pick or to provide competition in the goalkeeping department, which is another positive for a move.",
      "However, if a deal is a cheap one to do, and De Gea is available at a low price, then it could be something that United consider with the Spaniard providing competition to Onana, who is only just returning from injury just in time for their season to start.",
      "A return would be an emotional on for the club and the player, with De Gea admitting that he wouldn't play for any other English team.",
      "United have identified Crystal Palace and England midfielder Adam Wharton as a possible transfer alternative to Carlos Baleba this summer, according to talkSPORT.",
      "The report says that United are now \"weighing up\" whether to try and test Palace's resolve by making a bid.",
      "United have, effectively, walked away from a potential deal for Baleba this summer - after being told by Brighton that he's not for sale. But hope remains on his signature moving forward.",
      "United are said to be long-term admirers of Wharton, who's helped Palace win both the FA Cup and Community Shield in the last few months.",
      "Both Eberechi Eze and Marc Guehi have been heavily linked with exits to Tottenham and Liverpool, respectively. United could, therefore, have their work cut out if they are to convince Palace to sell.",

      "Gary Neville was rendered speechless when Ian Wright highlighted a concerning scenario regarding Manchester United signing Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The Slovenia international joined from RB Leipzig for an initial £66.4million with additional fees totalling approximately £7.6m. Sesko is an exciting prospect, but his youthful inexperience and United's poor return of scoring 44 Premier League goals last term means doubts are persisting over his potential impact.",
      "Rather than concentrating purely on Sesko, Neville also discussed fellow summer arrivals Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, setting the trio a collective target of 35 goals. Wright challenged this observation, noting how earlier in their discussion, Neville had suggested Viktor Gyokeres' inaugural Arsenal campaign would prove disappointing should he net merely 10 Premier League goals.",
      "During the latest Stick to Football podcast, Neville initiated the debate by saying: \"Sesko, we know less about him. Obviously, we've seen bits about him.",
      "\"We've seen centre-forwards come to United over the last six, seven or eight seasons and it's not been easy. There is going to be pressure on him, obviously [Rasmus] Hojlund is still there.\"",
      "Wright subsequently responded: \"The thing as well with him is that he scored 13 goals in 33 Bundesliga appearances last season. [Omar] Marmoush left in December and had 15.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"That says to me as a striker he should be scoring more at that level. I think like Gyokeres, he has got such great ability and physicality, I think he will get 15 goals.\"",
      "Neville subsequently claimed a haul of between \"10 or 13\" goals would represent success for Sesko, assuming Mbeumo and Cunha contribute the remaining 25 goals between them.",
      "Yet Wright challenged the former United skipper's assessment, drawing comparisons with the significantly higher expectations he'd established for Gyokeres. The Arsenal legend said: \"What if Sesko only scored 10?",
      "\"Seriously, what if he only got 10. You just turned your nose up when I mentioned Gyokeres potentially only getting 10 and now you're thinking about Sesko only getting 10.\"",
      "Despite Neville highlighting Gyokeres is more experienced than Sesko, Wright wouldn't allow him to escape scrutiny. The former England defender then attempted to construct an argument by saying: \"I think 10...\" before finding himself rendered speechless by his own contemplations.",
      "Whilst Wright turned towards Jamie Carragher, Jill Scott and Roy Keane, Neville said: \"The reason I am stuttering is because I'm wondering how Cunha and Mbeumo are going to do. If he scores 10 and the others can chip in with 12 a piece, I would still say 35 from the three of them is massive.\"",
      "When Wright pressed him further regarding his suggestion 10 goals for Gyokeres would fall well short, Neville replied: \"The reason I said that is because I think Arsenal will create so many more chances. They will have so much more play.",
      "\"They are a much better team. He (Gyokeres) is going to be in a better team. He's going to get more chances. Sesko is not going to get as many chances as Gyokeres. That is where I would be at with it.\"",

      "Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has thrown down a challenge for new signing Benjamin Sesko - to score on his debut, which could potentially be against Arsenal this afternoon.",
      "Ruben Amorim's first starting XI will be announced before kick-off against the Gunners at Old Trafford and the name supporters are hopeful of seeing is Sesko's. The 22-year-old striker completed a transfer from RB Leipzig last weekend and Sunday will be his first opportunity to play.",
      "He followed Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha through the entrance as United have reshaped their attack force for a total £207.5m over the summer.",
      "Now the challenge will be score more than the 44 goals United's players collectively managed in the Premier League last season.",
      "\"The biggest problem they had all last season despite chatting about the goalkeeper, the defence, they didn’t score enough goals. When you’re not scoring enough goals, particularly when Manchester United invested so much money, you’re constantly under so much pressure.\"",
      "The United legend-turned-pundit began to have his say on the club's summer business, suggesting he is largely impressed with what he has seen. He added: \"Obviously tried to fix that this summer and the new signings, looking at them in pre-season I know it’s still early but yeah, the signs are good.",
      "\"They’ve obviously brought two players in who know the Premiership, they’re robust enough to deal with the challenge. Obviously they needed a goalscorer, they were constantly under pressure. Looking at it, I like the look of it.\"",
      "Keane lay down his challenge for Sesko, to get up and running as soon as possible and hopefully score against old foes Arsenal on the opening weekend of the season.",
      "The 54-year-old added: \"This is a big start. We saw players already putting a marker down this weekend so for any striker, Sesko, who goes to a new club, if he’s starting can he get up and running? Score a goal? Get that trust and belief not only from supporters of the club but from his teammates.\"",

Ruben Amorim's side take on last season's top-flight runners-up in the fixture of the weekend ahead of an important campaign.",
      "The Gunners targeted Sesko before they turned their attention to Viktor Gyokeres, and the 22-year-old could come back to haunt Mikel Arteta after completing his move from RB Leipzig last week. However, United landed their target after beating Newcastle United to his signature.",
      "Following last season's poor performance in the Premier League, there will be an added focus on United's showing in the top-flight as they look to bounce back from the 15th-place finish.",

      "Ruben Amorim will be hoping for an opening-weekend scalp as Manchester United host Arsenal at Old Trafford. United's summer clearout has proved positive thus far, despite only Marcus Rashford having completed an exit at present.",
      "Antony, Jadon Sancho, Tyrell Malacia and Alejandro Garnacho are still on the hunt for new clubs, with the latter said to have accepted a proposal from Chelsea. Sancho and Malacia are both liked by AS Roma, with the quartet set to play no part in today's clash with the Gunners.",
      "Despite that, the mood at Carrington has been lifted, with Amorim having installed a better culture over the summer. Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha are all in line to make their respective Premier League debuts for the Red Devils, with intrigue surrounding the Red Devils' team selection.",
      "Multiple players have already taken to social media with the 4:30pm kick-off closing in, dropping hints about their possible inclusiong in the starting XI.",
      "Diogo Dalot and Leny Yoro are among those to share graphics on their social media ahead of the game. Of course, this does not mean they'll start the game, but it does offer a big hint that they'll be in the matchday squad.",
      "Yoro will likely start in a back three alongside Matthijs de Ligt, although it is still unknown whether Luke Shaw or Ayden Heaven will accompany the pair.",
      "Casemiro is in line to partner Bruno Fernandes in midfield, with the Brazilian also posting a matchday graphic on Instagram, which could provide another clue.",
      "Patrick Dorgu is another to have done so, with the Danish international a likely option over on the left-hand side of Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Finally, Bryan Mbeumo is surely a shoo-in over in the right number 10 spot, with Cunha and Sesko the most likely pair to accompany him in attack.",

      "MEN Sport says: This is the first time that Lee has been linked with United, and it remains to be seen if there's any truth to the rumour. If United were to sign Lee, who plays as a winger or in a No.10 position for PSG, it would be interesting to see what fee the Ligue 1 club would demand for his signature.",

      "Forest claim the owner had actually entered the field of play to check on the wellbeing of forward Taiwo Awoniyi who picked up a serious injury. In a bid to stir the pot on Friday night, Jamie Carragher asked Neville if he would be in the East Midlands this weekend as Sky cover Forest's opener against Brentford.",

      "According to reports, a ‘remarkable return’ to Manchester United is on the cards after the Premier League giants were given a ‘tip-off’.",
      "So far this summer, Man Utd have made four summer signings as they have landed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.",
      "Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha are upgrades on last season’s options and should significantly improve their forward line after they were toothless in attack following the arrival of head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Still, Man Utd remain in the market for further signings before this summer transfer window closes.",
      "Recent reports have indicated that their priorities are to sign a defensive midfielder and a goalkeeper, though exits are likely required to raise funds.",
      "READ: Five reasons why Man Utd away is a nightmare first game for Arteta and Arsenal",
      "Man Utd have plotted an audacious move for Carlos Baleba, though this deal is currently off as Brighton are unwilling to open the door to his exit in this window as they demand over £100m for their prized asset.",
      "This means Man Utd are scouring the market for an alternative midfielder, while they are also linked with several goalkeepers as they consider replacing Andre Onana.",
      "Their current No.1 suffered a dramatic fall from grace last season as he made mistakes at embarrassing regularity and his position is in doubt at the start of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Onana was signed to replace David De Gea, who has enjoyed a late-career resurgence since joining Serie A outfit Fiorentina on a free transfer.",
      "De Gea’s impressive form for Fiorentina has fuelled reports linking the veteran goalkeeper with a potential return to the Premier League and The Sun have claimed that the Red Devils are ‘exploring his remarkable return’.",
      "Man Utd are said to have made ‘hush hush checks’ on De Gea’s status and have been ‘tipped off’ on a clause in his current contract.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘The Red Devils have been tipped off that the Spaniard, 34, has a clause in his deal at Fiorentina — allowing him to leave for a relatively small sum.",
      "‘Now discreet background calls are being made after De Gea made a good impression on his return to Old Trafford for a friendly last weekend and told fans their “paths may cross again”.’",
      "Amorim has also remained coy when asked whether Onana will be his No.1 goalkeeper this season.",
      "Ahead of Man Utd’s Premier League opener against Arsenal on Sunday, Amorim said: “It is like the other players. They all have to win their place. I am not going to say if one guy is number one.”",
      "United are also working on exits and Jadon Sancho could be the next member of their so-called bomb squad to leave amid interest from AS Roma.",
      "Journalist Nicolo Schira said on X: ‘#ASRoma are waiting for Jadon #Sancho’s answer to their bid for a contract until 2030 (€5M/year).",
      "‘Meanwhile, #Roma have received the green light from #ManchesterUnited to sign the winger for €22M. #transfers #MUFC #mutd.’",
      "Former Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag “will not be absolved” for one choice that is still impacting new head coach Ruben Amorim, according to one journalist.",
      "With Andre Onana under the spotlight, we’ve ranked the 13 regular keepers to guard Man Utd’s goal since Sir Alex Ferguson was appointed…",
      "It seems to have been made clear to Manchester United that they’ll not be able to re-sign a former star, with his new club revealing their “intention” and that now ...",
      "Amid reports that Manchester United are ‘considering’ a summer re-signing, we’ve identified five ex-Red Devils for INEOS to target in the next window…",
      "Man Utd are ‘seriously considering’ making a move to bring David de Gea back to Old Trafford in the summer transfer window, according to reports."

      "New strikers, check. Familiar faces, check. A rivalry that goes back years, check.",
      "Undoubtedly the highlight of the opening weekend is Manchester United’s home fixture against Arsenal on Sunday.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s start at Manchester United was the stuff of nightmares, with a 15th-placed finish and a disappointing defeat to Spurs in the Europa League compounding a miserable time for the Old Trafford faithful.",
      "However, a triple swoop for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha has many predicting a better season for the Red Devils.",
      "There are also rumours surrounding a potential move for Carlos Baleba, so it’s clear to see that Amorim has been backed from the boardroom, but the real question is whether he can succeed where many predecessors have failed and transfer that on to the pitch.",
      "The start to the season hasn’t been kind to them, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Man City in their first five, so it’ll be a big test for this new-look Man United team.",
      "Arsenal will be a tough test and they have also had a transformative summer in terms of recruitment.",
      "Mikel Arteta has finally filled the void in front of goal by capturing Amorim’s former player Viktor Gyokeres, while they have also brought in Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad and Chelsea winger Noni Madueke.",
      "Fans from other teams have ridiculed Arsenal for coming second over the last three seasons, but it’s clear to see the solid foundations are there and their very own Swedish marksman could bridge the gap to Liverpool.",
      "As always this fixture promises to be a fascinating prospect and you can follow it on our live score centre.",
      "",
      "Sesko will likely make his debut after signing from RB Leipzig last week, while Mbeumo and Cunha will likely start for Amorim’s side.",
      "They are currently without Lisandro Martinez at the back as he is unavailable with a knee injury, while Noussair Mazraoui is ruled out with a thigh injury.",
      "There are also doubts over Joshua Zirkzee and Andre Onana.",

      "Goals are normally a given in this one, as both teams have scored in seven of the last nine clashes between these two.",

      "“Even last season when he played as a midfielder, he had more shots near the box.",
      "“I think it is a good thing for Bruno to stay in one position. Then he is winning a lot of things. I want Bruno near the ball and that is really important for our team, but sometimes we need Bruno near the goal. We will try to arrange game by game the best players in the best positions.”",
      "",
      "On Viktor Gyokeres:",
      "“I can just talk about Viktor and how happy we are to have him. He is going to have a tremendous impact in the team and his adaptation has been really, really good and we are happy to have him.",

      "Last season was ultimately disappointing for Arteta’s team finishing 10 points behind Liverpool, but they pushed Manchester City close in the previous two campaigns, so they are still a very good team.",
      "Gyokeres has been added to their squad and he’s raring to go according to Arteta, so a goal from the Swede is a worthwhile bet.",
      "Despite their woes in recent years, Man United have a good attack on paper and usually find the back of the net in this fixture, so both teams to score is a decent shout as it has happened in seven of the last nine meetings between the two."

      "We get the sense that Ruben Amorim will be looking forward to Manchester United’s opening-day clash with Arsenal far more than Mikel Arteta, for whom anything other than a win at Old Trafford will result in some gloriously early sack chat.",
      "Here are five reasons why a trip to Old Trafford is a nightmare first fixture for Arteta…",
      "",
      "Polar expectations\nEven a couple of seasons ago, Mikel Arteta would have been praised to the hilt for beating Manchester United on their own patch on the opening day of a season; even a draw would have been commendable.",
      "But this is the worst Manchester United team in living memory, or at least it was last season, when the 1-1 draw in the same fixture saw Arsenal described as ‘utter toss’, with Arteta condemned for his ‘Tony Pulis tribute act’. It’s no longer acceptable for Arsenal to do anything but beat Manchester United.",
      "Only one of us reckons Arsenal will win the Premier League, which is as much to do with our burgeoning lack of faith in Arteta to get the job done as much as anything, but they were in all of our top fours, while the only shred of positivity for United to be found in our pre-season predictions came from our resident Red Devils fan Ian Watson, who believes ‘they will be a lot less sh*te if they get a midfielder with legs and a competent goalkeeper’.",
      "",
      "Viktor Gyokeres vs Ruben Amorim\nWe’re bracing ourselves ahead of a fixture featuring a new £70m striker per club, both of whom were heavily linked with the other before making their moves to grant us the delicious prospect of immediate knee-jerking into labelling one a genius and the other a flop amid gloating and gnashing of teeth depending on your red allegiance, for Arsenal and Manchester United to start with Kai Havertz and Rasmus Hojlund up front. We beg you – give the people what they want.",
      "At this stage we would be picking one over the other through a flip of a coin, which doesn’t appear to be far off Arsenal’s strategy. But we do predict Gyokeres will have the tougher time on Sunday.",
      "That’s again partly down to expectation – Gyokeres is ‘the final piece of the puzzle’ for Arsenal, who needs to drive them to the title, whereas Benjamin Sesko has a laughably low bar to clear in order to be a dramatic improvement up front for United.",
      "But there’s also no manager who knows what Gyokeres is capable of – and therefore in an excellent position to stop him –  better than Ruben Amorim, without whom the Sweden international would not have got his dream move to Arsenal. Whether the United defenders are able to carry out Amorim’s orders is another matter.",
      "",
      "Manchester United might actually be quite good\nThe defence looks pretty good though. They’ve conceded just five goals in five pre-season games and that area of the pitch was rarely picked out as a problem under Amorim last season. Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Maguire, Lisandro Martinez, Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven looks to be a nice mix of experience and youth to rotate in the three centre-back positions.",
      "There have been good signs from Patrick Dorgu and Diego Leon on the left in pre-season, while Amad Diallo and Diogo Dalot provide very different but decent options on the right. The midfield is the obvious concern as Manuel Ugarte hasn’t got near to proving himself capable of granting United enough stability alongside Bruno Fernandes, hence the interest in Carlos Baleba as a ‘perfect’ fit for that role, at odds with the imperfect Kobbie Mainoo and the formerly perfect Casemiro. And sure, we’re also far from convinced by Andre Onana.",
      "That front three could be a real handful though. It’s about as good a trio as Amorim could have hoped for now that United aren’t able to fish in that top pool of talent. The dynamism and hunger to succeed feels like the big thing among all three of Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with the deep-seated love of Manchester United (or at least greater love for them than Newcastle) key to Amorim’s desire to sign them.",
      "And while an entirely new forward line could be a problem for United, with the relationship between them not yet embedded, it also makes it very difficult for Arteta to prepare his team as he has no idea what to expect from them.",
      "",
      "Ruben Amorim might actually be quite good\nIt became easy to forget as Amorim lost game after to game to drum up the worst record of any Manchester United manager in the Premier League era last season that he didn’t want to be Manchester United manager last season.",
      "He made it very clear to Omar Berrada when he approached Sporting that his preference was to stay in Portugal and take over at Old Trafford this summer, and said the same again when he was unveiled as the new Red Devils boss, revealing he was forced into a corner by Berrada’s “now or never” ultimatum.",
      "He made a compelling case for not arriving mid-season being the right course of action, admitting on several occasions last term amid some quite extraordinary sack pressure that he may not be the man for the job while many of us queried his unwavering belief in his principles and style of football.",
      "But he’s still here, with his reputation largely intact, after a pre-season he craved to bed in ideas which worked so brilliantly at Sporting and now at least have a serviceable chance of proving successful at United.",
      "There’s a sense of no harm done about Amorim at United. He’s got rid of or sidelined the ‘bad apples’, got a few of his players in and has had time to work with a squad which crucially (hopefully) knows what the end goal is. Could we about to see a ‘new manager bounce’ from someone who’s already been in the job for nine months?",
      "",
      "Or Arsenal might be a bit sh*t?\nWe’re thinking more about the post-match reaction here. We don’t think Arsenal are sh*t, nor do we think they will be sh*t in this game. But, because we will have no barometer for how good Manchester United are, no other games to provide context for their quality, we suspect most fans and pundits will see a United victory as proof that Arsenal have no chance of winning the title rather than say, proving Ruben Amorim’s side could qualify for Europe.",
      "If in doubt, football stakeholders take the path of pessimism, and it’s far more fun to suggest Arteta’s set for the sack than Amorim might be an alright manager, actually.",
      "Halfway through the first weekend of the new Premier League season and we already have a brand new favourite in the Sack Race. It’s a brutal game.",
      "With the 2025/2026 season upon us, the opening day of the 2024/2025 season provides proof if it were needed that a year is a long time in football.",
      "The actions of the Big Six are angering Newcastle, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace fans as the Alexander Isak saga drags on.",
      "Arne Slot is expected to walk Liverpool to a second Premier League title with a squad with a helluva lot of holes in it. We might just be about to ...",
      "Nothing has actually changed in the Alexander Isak to Liverpool saga but don’t let that stop anybody trumpeting ‘decisions’ and ‘twists’.",
      "Are Newcastle fans deluded if they think they can keep Alexander Isak? And without him, have Liverpool actually strengthened at all?"

      "The first weekend of the season has massively exposed Graham Potter; he looks vulnerable.",
      "And here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "20) Arne Slot (Liverpool)\nThere is a small yet increasingly confident part of our brain that remains stubbornly convinced Liverpool are going to completely f*ck it this season. The only real tangible thing to build this doom-laden scenario upon is a lack of depth at centre-back, but still we keep coming back to the question: what if all those exciting new attacking players turn out to be massive disaster-flops?",
      "Most of our brain thinks they probably won’t f*ck it and might even be better than last season, but even that tiny idiot part convinced of pending disaster doesn’t think it could possibly materialise quickly or dramatically enough for Slot to be in any kind of danger before at least one other poor sod has been given the hook elsewhere.",
      "Even if they were really quite shambolic defensively in the Community Shield and didn’t entirely assuage those doubts against Bournemouth either.",
      "",
      "17=) Mikel Arteta (Arsenal)\nProbably the hardest manager of all to place as he prepares to lead The Best Team In Europe™ through their Nightmare Start.",
      "While we have no desire to get remotely involved in any of the daft conspiracy-based bumwash spewing forth from the more chronically online corners of the Arsenal fanbase, there is no denying there are teams with easier starts out there.",
      "Not many with easier run-ins, like, but the thing with an easier run-in is that unless we experience a very strange season indeed, that is not a particularly relevant piece of information from a Sack Race stance.",
      "Do we really think Arteta could or should be the first manager out the door once the season begins? No. But it’s unavoidably true that if that Nightmare Start goes they way it might then the title could already look out of reach by October and that will generate inevitable noise and hot air at a club where these things are loudier and… airier than most.",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine largely unscathed from their nightmare horrors, which reflects Arteta’s status with the bookies as near-untouchable. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "17=) Unai Emery (Aston Villa)\nMissing out on the Champions League in the manner they did was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, but hard to see how they could possibly translate to Emery being in anything like the sort of bother that put him at risk of being out on his ear in the early months of next season. The latter months of next season? Could be a different tale there.",
      "",
      "17=) Pep Guardiola (Man City)\nA sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking First Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Especially after the way his new-look side kicked things off against Wolves.",
      "",
      "14=) David Moyes (Everton)\nThings would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Not hard to imagine a world in which Everton don’t make a flying start, but pretty hard to picture one in which that leads to a brutal early axe-wielding.",
      "",
      "14=) Enzo Maresca (Chelsea)\nOne of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 is just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup has on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Does the fact they’ve got plenty of (semi-)competitive games in their legs give them an early boost? Or will they just be knackered and given the runaround by fresher legs?",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A slow start and whispers will begin but again, deeply unlikely that leads to ‘victory’ in this particular race given the head-start so many other managers ‘enjoy’.",
      "",
      "14=) Thomas Frank (Tottenham)\nCould it go very wrong very quickly? Absolutely yes. Thomas Frank is a good coach and seems a decent chap, but none of us really know how he’ll operate outside the very specific environment he had at Brentford.",
      "Spurs’ environment is… not like that one. He’s going to have a big job on to sort out an awful lot of mess at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers.",
      "But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "That surely buys Frank a bit of time even if things do get hairy. Enough at least for someone else to get canned before he does. Probably.",
      "The fact the squad has not (yet) had anything like the summer renovations it required also cuts both ways here, we fancy. Spurs might well be alarmingly sh*t, but Frank might not be first in line when fans start dishing out blame. That is likely to once again be Gary Neville’s new best mate.",
      "",
      "11=) Fabian Hurzeler (Brighton)\nFine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "And Brighton don’t make awful starts. They are the Anti-Wolves: they start really well and then fade a bit. Which can be annoying, but is definitely the right way round to do it if you’re a manager trying not to get sacked. Pre-season at both clubs has set the pattern to an almost sarcastic degree at both Brighton and Wolves.",
      "",
      "11=) Oliver Glasner (Crystal Palace)\nWon’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the first Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "",
      "11=) Marco Silva (Fulham)\nJust a slightly less clear-cut version of Glasner really. Not about to be sacked, but could be in the frame for a poaching. And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of etc. and so forth.",
      "",
      "10) Andoni Iraola (Bournemouth)\nAmong the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It’s been a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola has masses of credit in the bank and it’s hard to see how much blame for any on-field struggles they may endure early in the campaign land at his door.",
      "",
      "9) Eddie Howe (Newcastle)\nAt various points we’ve expended daft amounts of energy attempting to manifest a ‘Howe Sack’ crisis because we’re messy bitches who live for drama. But we’ve never managed to make it stick even a tiny bit and we started the summer thinking there was little imminent prospect of going for it again with Howe the hero of the Geordie Nation for delivering silverware and more lovely, lovely Champions League football.",
      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",
      "",
      "8) Regis Le Bris (Sunderland)\nWest Ham at home was a kind start for Sunderland and Le Bris, but boy did they cash in. And there’s every chance now for them to rumble on into the next couple of games against Burnley and Brentford with some vital early-season momentum. How far that might eventually take them is anyone’s guess, but it would certainly take Le Bris a very long way away from Sack Race contention.",
      "",
      "7) Ruben Amorim (Manchester United)\nFeels like one could, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being top of these odds but also bottom.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that even if they remain staggeringly and at times unwatchably awful they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager if Ruben Amorim is sacked?",
      "",
      "5=) Vitor Pereira (Wolves)\nWolves absolutely love a sh*tbone awful start and enforced managerial change around November. The loss of key players and a disappointingly limp finish to last season after that thrilling run of wins through March and April mean those old doubts were nagging away even before a woeful pre-season and opening-day paddling from new-look, old-destructiveness Man City.",
      "Pereira should be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season, but making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",
      "",
      "5=) Scott Parker (Burnley)\nFixture-list doom-mongery is a fool’s errand. One never truly knows before things get properly under way just who’s going to be good and who’s not. But Burnley really do have a horrible start under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and have already been given a clear reminder of how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic is going to be to deliver in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs have already given them a pummelling.",
      "To make matters worse for Burnley, even the upcoming home clash with Sunderland no longer offers the promise of respite it once did among a nightmarish crop of early games that also features Manchester United, Liverpool, Forest, Manchester City and Aston Villa before the first weekend of October is out. And Parker may well be too, ideally after a 9-0 defeat against Liverpool that he regards as unavoidable.",
      "",
      "4) Nuno Espirito Santo (Nottingham Forest)\nNot remotely as safe as he should be, really. The harsh reality of just how high Forest flew for much of last season meant the way it ended with ‘only’ Europa Conference qualification (since promoted to the Europa League) has to be classed as a disappointment, and there was more than one reminder along the way that for all that has gone well for Forest over the last couple of years their owner remains very loose indeed and absolutely capable of doing a madness if Forest start next season as they ended this one.",
      "We’re not joking, either. If Forest have eight points after eight games – which feels entirely possible – Nuno could absolutely be in deep doo-doo.",
      "",
      "3) Daniel Farke (Leeds)\nIt would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke has a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds do look far better prepared than most for attempting the now fiendishly difficult first-season survival at this time, but Farke lasted 11 games of the 21/22 season with Norwich and something similar absolutely cannot be ruled out this time.",
      "",
      "2) Keith Andrews (Brentford)\nThe continuity candidate, but how much continuity can there be at Brentford given they’ve sold Bryan Mbeumo and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It’s a very Brentford move to promote from within but will they be forced into the very un-Brentford move of sacking him in October when the Bees are in a relegation battle?",
      "Pre-season has been encouraging, at least, and an opening run of games against Forest, Villa and Sunderland offers a realistic shot at an acceptable start given those clubs all have issues of their own, but things look (potentially) far choppier between the September and October international breaks with games against Chelsea, Fulham and both Manchester clubs.",
      "",
      "1) Graham Potter (West Ham)\nThat’s what a 3-0 defeat to a newly-promoted club will do to you after a summer where little has gone right for West Ham. Sunderland were mightily impressive, but the Hammers were honking and the perfectly rational view that Potter could not and should not be judged until he’d had the chance to get a pre-season’s worth of ideas across to his players are already floundering.",
      "Hard to think of many teams who’ve more thoroughly propelled themselves into full ‘You fear for them’ territory on an opening day than West Ham have here, and the very obvious extension of that fear is a similar one for Potter.",
      "Really is wild now to think of just how high his standing was during his Brighton days. If he can’t turn things round at West Ham, it’s really hard to see what the next step on this career path will be.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Jamie O’Hara believes Arsenal will sack Mikel Arteta if the Gunners don’t win a trophy this season.",
      "Arsenal legend Tony Adams has told Mikel Arteta to strip Martin Odegaard of the captaincy and give it to Declan Rice if he wants to be a winner.",
      "There are three Italians at the top of the betting to be the next Arsenal manager after Mikel Arteta. It’s an intriguing list.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned whether Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta wanted to sign Viktor Gyokeres this summer."

      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",

Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts.

That being true, it seems Liverpool would be content to sit tight until next summer, and Guehi is probably fine with that too.

We expect a move will happen because it’s in neither the player nor Newcastle’s interest to stay together, but the Toon need something they can present as a win, like a British transfer record fee up front.

Of course, it won’t reach that stage because United want rid as much as the winger wants out. All of which Chelsea know and they will take their sweet time to get the best possible terms. Right now, it seems United want £50million (all the best, lads) while Chelsea value Garnacho at £30million.

Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. An improved offer was expected this week but it seems Newcastle might be waiting for Brentford to get Dango Outtara in first. Then, Wissa might get the move he’s wanted all summer. The forward will sit out the Bees’ Premier League opener against Forest.",

      "",
      "3) 🔼 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nIt turns out that Ouattara has been an unhappy bunny on the south coast, and Brentford are prepared to make him happy with a key role in their attack. More of a Bryan Mbeumo replacement than one for Wissa, this deal could still help Newcastle finally land the 28-year-old.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 James McAtee – Manchester City to Nottingham Forest\nForest have won the race for McAtee, who had attracted interest from Germany. They will pay £30m and City have managed to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on clause. They are terrified of a Cole Palmer repeat.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Jacob Ramsey – Aston Villa to Newcastle\nAnother one who seems to want to join Newcastle… perhaps this species isn’t as rare as it was previously thought. A deal worth £39million plus another £4million in add-ons was agreed and Ramsey flew to Tyneside for a medical on Thursday evening."

      "With the 2025/2026 season upon us, the opening day of the 2024/2025 season provides proof if it were needed that a year is a long time in football.",
      "Here are five things we can’t believe happened only a year ago…",
      "",
      "Scott McTominay replacing Kobbie Mainoo\nMainoo wasn’t quite ‘untouchable’ as he started at the base of Manchester United’s midfield in their opener against Fulham last season. Amid interest from Chelsea and financial constraints which were resulting in mass redundancies under Sir Jim Ratcliffe, no-one was. But he was The Future to a greater degree than the other two members of the trident of hope: Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "He still is in so far as Garnacho is the living, breathing antithesis of what Ruben Amorim wants to create at Old Trafford as the most unwelcome member of the current bomb squad, while Hojlund remains the ghost of the feast. But Mainoo, having been a beacon of light under Erik ten Hag after scoring in the FA Cup final and playing a major role for England at the Euros, now enters a season knowing any football he plays will be out of position under Amorim, who is currently desperate to source a new midfield destroyer who we suspect will limit Mainoo’s game time to such a degree that he will be pushing for the exit come January.",
      "McTominay meanwhile, having been either the midfield bridesmaid at United – as illustrated by his six-minute cameo against Fulham a year ago – or one half of the widely deplored McFred axis, heads into his second season with Napoli as the Scudetto winner and Serie A’s Most Valuable Player, given the freedom of a city in which the love bestowed upon him has rarely, if ever, been trumped since the deification of the arguably the greatest footballer to ever play the game, Diego Maradona.",
      "",
      "Alejandro Garnacho assist for Joshua Zirkzee winner\n“What a big moment for Joshua Zirkzee,” said Gary Neville on commentary, after the £36.5m summer signing came off the bench to score the winner two minutes from time at Old Trafford. We all assumed that was the first of many after that introduction to Premier League football.",
      "There was discussion after that game as to whether it was a “smart finish” or something closer to a lucky scuff, and there’s little doubt that the thousands of Manchester United fans who jeered Zirkzee off against Newcastle just over four months later plumped for the latter in hindsight.",
      "He scored just two further goals in the remaining 31 games of his debut Premier League season, combining with Hojlund’s goalscoring woes to force United into spending £74m on a Benjamin Sesko this summer, with Zirkzee’s game time surely set to be further limited by the arrivals of Matheus Cuha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "It was Garnacho who came off the bench to provide the assist, having done his typical busy dribbling thing to get Ten Hag’s side back into the game and give the cartel of United pundits plenty of ammo to claim ‘this will be his season’, while the hackneyed insistence that Marcus Rashford ‘isn’t a kid anymore and needs to lead this team’ was also rolled out.",
      "",
      "Matheus Cunha on the bench\nIt says a fair bit about the management of Gary O’Neil that he opted for a three of Hwang Hee-chan, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Rodrigo Gomes – a right-back he fielded on the left wing – to operate behind Jorgen Strand-Larsen against Arsenal while Cunha sat on the bench for the first hour.",
      "The Brazilian who would go on to smash their club-record departure by moving to Manchester United for £62.5m at the end of a season in which he would score 15 Premier League goals. Hwang, Bellegarde and Gomes got six between them. It would make more sense if Cunha has been a bit sh*t the season before, but he also finished that campaign as top scorer with 12.",
      "",
      "Oleksandr Zinchenko starts\nHaving been one of Arsenal’s key players in his first season after arriving from Manchester City, Zinchenko should perhaps have seen the writing on the wall by the time his third season rolled around after the second ended with Mikel Arteta preferring to field Takehiro Tomiyasu out of position at left-back over the Ukrainian.",
      "The £42m spent on Calafiori and the return to fitness of Jurrien Timber will only have added to those fears, though those concerns will have been assuaged greatly by him being named in the starting XI to face Wolves on the opening day. But that was just one of five Premier League starts, and three of those were at the back end of the season when Premier League title hopes were lost and focus had shifted to the Champions League, with the stratospheric rise of young upstart Myles Lewis-Skelly doing nothing to improve his standing and mood at the club.",
      "And you get the sense that he doesn’t really know why he’s been sidelined – like he’s been ghosted by a lover whom he talked to about building a life together – as indicated by quite the harrowing excerpt from his recent autobiography.",
      "“In pure personal terms, it was easily the worst season I ever experienced as a professional. A player who doesn’t play is nothing. Imagine this little boy who’s dedicated his entire existence to becoming good at one particular thing and then finds at 28 that he’s essentially no longer needed, that there are others who can do the job for him. It’s not a nice feeling.”",
      "",
      "Jarell Quansah as Virgil van Dijk’s partner\nQuansah must have wondered while sitting on the bench for all but three of Liverpool’s remaining 37 Premier League games after the curtain-raiser at Ipswich just what Arne Slot had seen from him in that opening 45 minutes before he was hooked for Ibrahima Konate that caused the Liverpool boss to strip him of his badge as Van Dijk’s centre-back partner and hand it to the Frenchman.",
      "Liam Delap had made life difficult for him, but that proved to be a theme for Ipswich’s opponents throughout the season. They hadn’t conceded. It felt almost cruel at the time, but then, Slot will point to the title and the excellent defensive partnership which was crucial to that and shrug his shoulders.",
      "We would suggest that the thought of Quansah playing under Ten Hag in a year’s time as he walked out at Portman Road would have been met with open mouths and giggles, but then there can’t have been more than a dozen people thinking the Dutch manager would still be in charge of Manchester United at the start of this season.",
      "Manchester United at Old Trafford may just be the worst possible opening day fixture for Mikel Arteta and Arsenal. We can feel the sack chat in our bones already.",
      "The actions of the Big Six are angering Newcastle, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace fans as the Alexander Isak saga drags on.",
      "Arne Slot is expected to walk Liverpool to a second Premier League title with a squad with a helluva lot of holes in it. We might just be about to ...",
      "Nothing has actually changed in the Alexander Isak to Liverpool saga but don’t let that stop anybody trumpeting ‘decisions’ and ‘twists’.",
      "Are Newcastle fans deluded if they think they can keep Alexander Isak? And without him, have Liverpool actually strengthened at all?",
      "Carlos Baleba may be out of reach for Man Utd but if Amorim sees the Brighton star as his ‘perfect’ midfielder then he should be considering these ten alternatives."

      "",
      "19) West Ham\nGraham Potter’s a top coach, but his first few months have been flat. Jarrod Bowen, an in-form Lucas Paqueta, and the occasional James Ward-Prowse free-kick are the only real reasons to tune in this campaign.",
      "",
      "18) Burnley\nTheir 100-point promotion was built on defence, and Scott Parker looks set to keep it that way. It might be smart, but it won’t be fun.",
      "",
      "17) Wolves\nMatheus Cunha was the one player worth watching. He’s gone. Unless Jhon Arias takes the league by storm, expect some dull viewing.",
      "",
      "16) Brentford\nThomas Frank, Bryan Mbeumo, Christian Norgaard and (pretty much) Yoane Wissa have all gone. There’s still some talent here, but with rookie boss Keith Andrews in charge, survival looks tougher than entertainment.",
      "But the tough season people are expecting makes them one of the biggest talking points going into the opening weekend.",
      "",
      "15) Aston Villa\nMinimal changes this summer. Yawn. Unai Emery’s still brilliant, but the squad feels a bit samey compared to last year.",
      "",
      "14) Nottingham Forest\nLots of new signings, all attack-minded. Big fees for James McAtee and Omari Hutchinson add intrigue. I’m excited to see them, just less so than the teams above.",
      "",
      "13) Crystal Palace\nWithout Eberechi Eze, they lose some sparkle. Oliver Glasner’s style should keep them watchable, but the drop-off in quality will be obvious if he leaves.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth\nDefence has been gutted, attack remains strong. Andoni Iraola should still serve up entertaining football, though perhaps in the same way that Blackpool did under Ian Holloway in 2010/11.",
      "",
      "11) Leeds United\nLeeds are back, and that’s always fun. They’re back where they belong, people.",
      "Their signings haven’t necessarily been exciting, but they’ve been very smart and point to a more controlled, well-rounded Whites team this time around. We could get some delicious managerial drama as well, with Leeds reportedly considering sacking Daniel Farke at the end of 2024/25, despite leading them to the Championship title. A poor start could see the Elland Road bosses act…",
      "",
      "10) Newcastle United\nA grim summer in the transfer market, but still a squad full of players worth watching — Anthony Gordon, Harvey Barnes, Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali, Lewis Hall. Results might dip, but entertainment shouldn’t. Even without Alexander Isak, Newcastle are a good team.",
      "",
      "9) Everton\nDavid Moyes with Jack Grealish and Iliman Ndiaye could be box-office. Throw in Tyler Dibling and I’m becoming a fully-fledged Evertonian.",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland\nA proper Barclays club returns, with a new face for the top flight in Regis Le Bris and a busy summer. Granit Xhaka might provide us with a lovely meltdown if Sunderland struggle. And lots of young players from foreign leagues are in, which is becoming the norm for a promoted club’s summer window. Not necessarily to great success.",
      "",
      "7) Arsenal\nBig summer signings, big expectations. Viktor Gyokeres could be a hit or a disaster. Martin Zubimendi looks superb. Just hope Arsenal don’t go full set-piece robots again, otherwise they’ll plummet down to 20th here.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham Hotspur\nIf the Super Cup is any clue, they’ll attack big games the right way by not being completely gung-ho, while finally looking dangerous from set-pieces. Ange Postecoglou refused to work on the latter and was too proud to move away from the former.",
      "",
      "5) Brighton\nTalented squad, promising coach, attractive football. They should be right in the mix for a top-five finish. Yes, that’s right. I’m going big on Brighton this season.",
      "",
      "4) Chelsea\nCole Palmer is reason enough to watch, but there’s quality and flair all over the pitch. Estevao might make us forget Neymar never played in the Premier League. Joao Pedro looks f***ing brilliant. And as always, there are plenty of new faces around the place. The Blues are expected to challenge for the title this time around…",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United\nUnpredictable and capable of glorious chaos. Could be great, could be a mess, often in the same match. That’s why we love them. Kind of.",
      "Bring on a front three of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, though, with Bruno Fernandes pulling the strings behind them. Yum.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester City\nRayan Ait-Nouri and Tijjani Reijnders are exciting additions. Pep Guardiola’s side already play some of the best football in the world, and these signings should make them even more entertaining. You’ve got to love a flying, skillful full-back, and Ait-Nouri is just that, while his arrival hints towards a change in style from natural centre-backs in left-back. And with natural midfielder Matheus Nunes on the other side? City should be attack, attack, attack, with Erling Haaland and Omar Marmoush up front to combine for 50 league goals.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool\nChampions last season, and now even stronger. Florian Wirtz, Hugo Ekitike, two attacking full-backs (one of which is pretty much a winger), and a top young centre-back — the Slot machine is built for another year of high-tempo, high-quality football.",
      "If that opener against Bournemouth is anything to go by, Liverpool will provide us with a chaotic and very entertaining season.",

      "The two Premier League clubs then held talks, but there has been no breakthrough as Brighton want around £100million for the Cameroonian.",
      "Baleba would be an outstanding signing for the Red Devils, but a deal appears dead in the water, for now, anyway.",

      "Antony has recently been given an ultimatum by Manchester United, but is now said to be open to a shock new commitment which could help all parties.",
      "Antony spent the second half of last season out on loan with Real Betis. He immediately looked at home, and finished his spell there with nine goals and five assists in all competitions.",
      "It’s known that both he and the Spanish club want to reunite if possible, but so far, Betis have looked unable to drum up the required funds for the move for the United man.",
      "That issue could be taken off the table soon, though. According to Estadio Deportivo, one of the options being considered to ‘unblock the situation’ is a new deal being offered to the winger at Old Trafford.",
      "That is an option Antony is said to view ‘more favourably’ than in recent weeks.",
      "That is as it could open the door for a loan move which would be good for all parties. Antony will not want to be tied down to then sit on the bench, but this avenue should be good for him.",
      "If he was to go on loan in his current circumstances, with his contract ending in 2027, he’d have just a year left on his deal at the end of that, and United would either get a small fee, or Antony could see out the final year and leave for free.",
      "If he extends his deal, the Red Devils will surely be happier allowing him to go out on loan again, knowing there’s still a good chance of them receiving a fee in the future, particularly if Antony plays well.",
      "For Betis, a loan seems the best course of action as they don’t have to drum up cash for the winger, but they’ll be able to get him back on a short-term deal, potentially to pick up where he left off last term.",
      "It was suggested earlier in the week that Antony had been told he needs to accept an exit by the end of the week or the threat of him being sidelined until January looms.",
      "That would have been a huge shame for the forward in relation to his World Cup chances. He was in the latest Brazil squad off the back of his Betis performances, getting back into international contention for the first time since 2023.",
      "Continuing to play well at Betis would have given him the chance to stay in contention for Brazil and potentially to play in the World Cup.",
      "That gives the forward another reason to accept a contract offer, if he’s allowed a loan beyond that.",
      "Antony is angling for a return to Real Betis but his actions have reportedly not pleased the Man Utd hierarchy.",
      "According to reports, a ‘new suitor’ has emerged in the race to sign Manchester United star Antony amid interest from a Premier League club.",

      "Saturday 16 August 2025 23:16, UK",
      "“We struggled without a reference as a striker.” That was Ruben Amorim’s verdict on Manchester United’s final pre-season game against Fiorentina. “We have a new player, so we will see.” The hope is that Benjamin Sesko can make the difference.",
      "The raw potential is obvious. This is a player who stands at 6ft 5in tall but has pace too. He can head the ball and fire off fierce shots from distance. And there is belief that his hold-up play will improve, dropping off too but providing Amorim with his reference.",
      "But the modern United has become, perhaps, the ultimate test of that theory. At £73.7m, taking the summer spending on their new forward trio to over £200m, Ruben Amorim has certainly been backed. That brings pressure to make it work - and quickly.",
      "Amorim has been open about the fact that he is fortunate still to be in the job, reliant on the support of those above him after a miserable run of results that led to United's worst league finish in over 50 years. The consensus is that the mood has now changed.",
      "Luke Shaw recently admitted that the environment inside the club could be \"extremely negative\" and \"quite toxic\" before going on to claim that it is different now. Unhappy players have moved on. New ones have arrived with a point to prove. A cultural reset.",
      "Time on the training ground has helped too and the absence of European football means that there will be more of that throughout the campaign. Amorim will have the opportunity to demonstrate why he was regarded as a top young coach in the first place.",
      "The summer spending raises expectations, however. United are already fifth favourites for the title. Fail to secure European qualification and they will be out of Europe for back-to-back seasons for the first time since the ban on English clubs was lifted.",
      "The challenge is that Sesko is not the finished article. For now, at least, United are not in that market. And their opening Premier League game of the season offers an intriguing contrast. Opponents Arsenal tracked Sesko for a long time, a move seeming imminent.",
      "In the end, they opted for Viktor Gyokeres. The Sweden international has plundered well over 100 goals for club and country over the past two seasons at Sporting - more than Sesko has yet managed in his career. But he is 27. A signing for the here and the now.",
      "Maybe that reflects Arsenal's sense of urgency, a side that has been so close to major silverware in recent seasons, one that is seeking the final piece of their own puzzle. United are earlier in the process, betting on Sesko to develop into the superior player.",
      "His goal output might not be as immediately impressive as that of Gyokeres, but his 39 goals for RB Leipzig in all competitions over the past two seasons means that he has scored more than anyone else aged under 23 in Europe's five major leagues in that time.",
      "It puts him top of an illustrious list, although the presence of another name a little further down it is a reminder that, as former United coach Rene Meulensteen puts it, they are doing \"basically exactly what they did with Rasmus Hojlund\" with this signing.",
      "That is to say, United are spending big hoping to develop their own elite forward. Hojlund scored nine for Atalanta in Serie A prior to his arrival. Joshua Zirkzee managed 11 for Bologna before signing the following summer. For Sesko, it was 13 at Leipzig.",
      "That might temper the expectations a little. But speak to others and they will tell you that Sesko has better instincts. He is a player capable of finding space in the penalty box, someone who can get his shots away unusually quickly for a player of his size.",
      "He is not yet Alexander Isak and that is reflected in the price tag. But Isak was 22 years old, as Sesko is now, when he arrived in the Premier League after a season in which he scored six times in 32 games for Real Sociedad in LaLiga. That is the trajectory to target.",
      "Making it happen is the difficult part and it is now Amorim's job to help Sesko succeed where so many in a United shirt have struggled in recent years and fulfil his potential. Flanked by Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, there is at least creativity around him.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha are strong ball carriers who draw others towards them, creating space. \"It is going to be special,\" said Amorim of his two new wide forwards after the Fiorentina game. \"I think that they are maybe at 50, 60 per cent of what they can do.\"",
      "Another word of caution, though. There is some risk that the opposite is true. There were only three players in the Premier League who outperformed their expected goals by six or more last season. One was Chris Wood. The other two were Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free.",
      "Of the 10 previous players to have done that over the past eight years, only Heung-Min Son has scored more goals in the following season - and he dipped dramatically the year after. The vast majority of players have seen their goal output regress to the mean.",
      "One of the reasons cited for Liverpool's signing of Hugo Ekitike is that he actually underperformed his expected goals - they recognised the potential for his numbers to explode. United appear to have gone the opposite route, trying to sign elite finishers.",
      "Sesko could fall into that category having scored 27 Bundesliga goals over the past two seasons from chances with an expected-goals value of just 17.6. Could he be another Son, another Harry Kane, who consistently finishes better than the metrics suggest?",
      "If so, it could define United's season and with it Amorim's reign. There are other factors, of course. The balance in midfield is a concern and the wing-backs will be key. But it is this new forward line that will probably dictate how the rebuild is perceived.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have Premier League pedigree which will buy them some time. Rather unfairly, the referendum on young Sesko may come sooner than that. A swift impact against Arsenal, with Gyokeres among the opposition, would be most helpful."

      "The Premier League's elite clubs are rebuilding.",
      "This summer has seen the so-called Big Six spend in excess of £1bn between them on new signings. With several weeks of the transfer window still to go, the numbers will continue to rise.",
      "Liverpool are leading the way as they aim to consolidate their Premier League title win but Chelsea are close to their total for money spent, with Arsenal, Manchester City, and Manchester United next on the list respectively, and Spurs not far behind them.",
      "There is particular intrigue around the Manchester clubs.",
      "City recorded their lowest points total under Pep Guardiola in a trophyless campaign last term. United plumbed far greater depths as they finished 15th and also failed to win silverware.",
      "So, are they on track to bounce back and enjoy the success their fans crave in the new season? Or is the road to the top longer? Much will depend on whether they can master the art of the rebuild, a process Sir Alex Ferguson once said he believed could take up to four years.",
      "Pep Guardiola and Manchester City have of course been here before.",
      "How they would love a repeat of the successful rebuild overseen early in his tenure following his arrival from Bayern Munich, when City recovered from a difficult first campaign, like the one they have just had, to win the first of many titles in 2017/18.",
      "\"They are one of the exceptions to that four-year rule,\" says Neville.",
      "\"Jose Mourinho came into Chelsea and won their first league title in a long, long time in his first season, creating a kind of unity straight away. Pep Guardiola got a great side that won the title in the space of two years at Manchester City.\"",
      "Neville also mentions Arne Slot's achievement in winning the Premier League straight after succeeding the legendary Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool. \"I would say it was a very different team than under Klopp, with different components and ingredients.\"",
      "What they all have in common, and something key to a successful rebuild in Neville's eyes, is that they inherited the right type of characters in the dressing room.",
      "\"You think of what Slot was handed last season: [Virgil] Van Dijk, Alisson, [Mohamed] Salah, [Andrew] Robertson, [Alexis] Mac Allister, Trent [Alexander-Arnold].",
      "\"They are five or six proven winners at the highest level and they have been around the block. They've got pride and ego and they are not going to sit there and use the fact there's a new manager coming in as an excuse not to perform well.",
      "\"Players can hide behind managers. But if you've got good characters and leaders, people who have standards in their personal lives, you're going to get a better outcome.",
      "\"Slot harnessed that. He did a good job with those leaders. But he is not the one in the dressing room. People may or may not know this, but managers might not go in the dressing room at the training ground even for one minute during the week.",
      "\"For all those hours, it is policed by the senior players.\"",
      "Heavy investment was of course vital to the success of those previous Chelsea and Manchester City's rebuilds. But both Mourinho and Guardiola also inherited senior players to build around.",
      "For Mourinho at Chelsea, it was John Terry and Frank Lampard. Guardiola could call on Fernandinho, Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and David Silva at City.",
      "Guardiola has some similar characters now in Ruben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Ederson, among others. At United, though, Amorim inherited very different personnel to the dressing room Neville experienced there in his playing days.",
      "\"For us it was Roy Keane, Bryan Robson, Mark Hughes, Steve Bruce. Then when me, [Paul] Scholesy and others got older, it was us. When we left, others took over,\" he explains.",
      "\"You're asking those players in the dressing room to set the standards, to make sure negativity doesn't creep in. The people who sap energy, close them off straight away. Don't let them drain you, the people who constantly whinge in a negative way\"",
      "Amorim is still in the process of overhauling his dressing room as he aims to reverse a years-long slide from their success under Ferguson. Manchester United have signed three new attackers in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko but are still struggling to shift numerous unwanted players.",
      "\"This is a really unique situation,\" says Neville. \"I said before that you don't get three or four years to build a team, but because of Manchester United's relentless poor form over two, three, four or five years, it will take quite a bit to unwind that.",
      "\"Amorim has got players he quite clearly doesn't want and doesn't like, players on huge money, some of whom have cost huge money. And even if you do get them out, some of their wages will probably have to be subsidised by the club.",
      "\"So, I think he has a minimum of a two-and-a-half-year build to get to the point he wants with his unique system and buying the players he wants to fit that, just because of what has gone on there previously, but he's going to have to demonstrate progress.",
      "\"The problem he has is that you've got a top five now who like they are getting into the Champions League and the penalty for not being in the Champions League is big now because all these clubs - United, Villa, Newcastle, Chelsea - are on the edge on PSR.",
      "\"It's big for them if they drop out of those Champions League places. So Amorim has got to be relatively successful, which means finishing in the top four or top five, all while building a new team and recruiting the players he wants.\"",
      "Circumstances matter too when it comes to rebuilding efficiently. Guardiola knows that well given the importance of expiring contracts to his first Manchester City overhaul. A long list of departures in 2017 gave him space to reshape his squad.",
      "The list of players who reached the ends of their deals after Guardiola's first season included Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, Willy Caballero, Bacary Sagna and Jesus Navas. This summer, by contrast, the only one feels like a significant loss in Kevin De Bruyne.",
      "Guardiola points out there was a significant loss back in 2017 too. \"In that moment, we made one big mistake which was to not keep Jesus Navas with us,\" he says.",
      "\"I think he would have helped us a lot for the next years because he was a player who could play as a full-back, as a full-back inside, as a right-winger. He was incredible.",
      "\"For the rest, the club decided they needed new, fresh energy, so that's why we rebuilt. They bought some unbelievable players like Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva; top-class players who helped us start to do what we have done.\"",
      "Manchester City are having to work harder to shift players this time around. Their signings so far this summer have left them with a squad of 33 as things stand.",
      "Their plight last season shows the importance of forward planning. Could City's drop-off have been avoided if they had acted sooner to refresh their personnel?",
      "\"It's bloody hard when you've got a team that's won the treble, and a group of players who have been so good,\" says Neville. \"But they do tend to grow a little bit old together.",
      "\"It's about how you change it and when you change it when you have been as successful as they have been. To do it after a treble is the most difficult time.\"",
      "Neville sees some parallels between the plight of City's treble-winning team and that of United's in 1998/99.",
      "\"It felt like we only signed one or two players in the two years after the treble. We won the league in those years but then we saw a sharp decline and we only won one of the next four.",
      "\"You get this euphoric moment winning a treble, where you've built an unbelievable team, but within a couple of years they grow a little bit old together and you've got a situation where you can fall off the edge of a cliff and end up having to make big changes.\"",
      "Neville describes Manchester City's current rebuild as Guardiola's \"toughest job\" in management. \"You get to the point where you think, 'will he win it next season, or will it take two or three years?'\" he says. But the man himself sees it differently.",
      "\"The most challenging summer was when I was chosen to be the manager of the second team at Barcelona and prove myself to the board,\" he says with a smile.",
      "\"Then the challenge was to take over the Barcelona first team and prove myself, and after that go to Germany after the legend Jupp Heynckes had won the treble, when my German language was a disaster, to convince the players to keep going and winning.",
      "\"Then it was arriving here and in the first press conference they said, 'the club have brought you here to win the Champions League', and I said, 'wait a minute, please!' After that I was 'Fraudiola' and it was a disaster in the seasons we didn't win it.\"",
      "Guardiola is eager to point out that he saw progress even in his fraught first season, when he was assisted by now Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Manchester City finished 15 points behind eventual Premier League champions Chelsea.",
      "\"In the first season we played really, really well in moments,\" he says. \"Always with Mikel we talk about that, that in that first season we started to build something. This season is not the most difficult one because we did it. We proved we could do it.\"",
      "Guardiola is encouraged by how his side finished last season too, even if it ended in the disappointment of a second consecutive FA Cup final loss at Wembley, this time to Crystal Palace.",
      "\"I didn't like the way we lost against Man Utd in the [previous] FA Cup final. I was grumpy. This season, I was sad because we played really, really well. They know it. They knew we were there, the spirit was there, the chances were there.",
      "\"We missed something we have to recover next season. That belongs to me, it belongs to the players, it belongs to all of us. And after that we will create a team which can compete game by game and start in a better position in the Premier League.\"",
      "Guardiola stresses that pain forms part of every rebuild.",
      "That was true even for Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, who mastered the art during his historic Old Trafford tenure, creating a series of trophy-winning teams.",
      "\"Each transition came with a bit of turbulence,\" says Neville.",
      "\"We then lost the first game of the next season and Alan Hansen said you can't win anything with kids. So, it was a lot of pressure at that time, changing and transitioning, and that is something you have to manage in a rebuild.",
      "\"We didn't win the league for three years between 2003 and 2006. That's the longest I ever went in my career. That was a point where Mourinho was absolutely on his game and [Arsene] Wenger's football was sensational. They were brilliant teams.",
      "\"Our recruitment wasn't the best. It took a while for Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo to come through, for Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra to settle in.",
      "\"That was the time where I thought, 'will we win the league again?' We did it in 2006 and that set us up for another five or six years of winning titles because that team was amazing. But the key was the foresight and bravery Sir Alex had to let players go.\"",
      "The principles behind that ruthlessness remain crucial in today's game. It is about lowering the age of the squad and striking a balance between youth and experience while ensuring there is room for long-term growth and development.",
      "\"I used to think of it as a conveyer belt,\" says Neville. \"We came in in '92, '93, '94. We were the young ones at the start of the conveyor belt and we had the older ones falling off. We eventually moved on to the end of the conveyor belt and fell off ourselves.",
      "\"I always thought you needed a group of players that were young, a group of players in their peak, and then a few, four or five, who were in their 30s and set the standards. I think that was the sort of age profile Sir Alex considered when building teams, but there was always some turbulence.\"",
      "As their respective rebuilds continue, Manchester United and City will hope the turbulence eases for them in the new campaign.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Our football betting expert and top tipster Jones Knows is back in the Premier League predictions chair to provide his insight and best bets.",
      "Trimmed from 20/1 to 8/1 in the summer to win the Premier League, there is a chance Enzo Maresca just might be building something extremely exciting at Chelsea.",
      "And why should we be taking them seriously? Moises Caicedo and Cole Palmer - they are Chelsea's assassins and quite possibly the core of what could be a title-winning side.",
      "Since Caicedo has found rhythm in the Chelsea midfield, he has owned so many games, including the Club World Cup final against PSG. If Chelsea are going to suffocate opponents and dominate the ball in big games - which they will need to do to win a title - it all starts with Caicedo.",
      "And Palmer is the stardust. When the spotlight is on, when the stage is at it's highest, Palmer performs. He can go to Eden Hazard's levels of domination at Chelsea this season.",
      "This axis puts Chelsea in the title mix, no question. It's a four-way fight. And they can start with a home win.",
      "Nottingham Forest played some unsustainable football last season and it's very hard to see how they're going to improve on what they achieved.",
      "Top goalscorer Chris Wood converted 30 per cent of his overall attempts in the Premier League last term, while goalkeeper Matz Sels enjoyed the season of his life, boasting the best save percentage in the league. They can't be expected to keep those numbers up.",
      "And Forest return to Europe this season which is bound to influence the side's performance. If you exclude Conference League participants, non-big-six teams who qualify for Europe win around 14 points fewer in the campaign immediately following qualification.",
      "That isn't too relevant for this devilishly difficult fixture to analyse from a betting perspective, but something to note when the fixtures start to pile up. This clash looks one where the draw is a huge runner at 12/5 with Sky Bet.",
      "This is going to a very watchable fixture, steeped in Premier League narrative - but one where goals could be lacking.",
      "I'm firmly in the under 2.5 goals camp - and at the prices on offer at 10/11 with Sky Bet I'm happy to endorse it as one of the best bets of the weekend.",
      "Arsenal are traditionally a very reliable team to back under goals away from home, albeit also a risky favourite to back in these spots.",
      "When assessing the last nine games where they've gone off 11/10 or bigger on the road, they have won just once and the average goals per game sits at just 1.89 per 90 with seven of those nine going under 2.5 goals.",
      "Additionally, seven of those games finished all-square while four of the five meetings between Mikel Arteta and Ruben Amorim have also ended level.",
      "Lots of the focus and pre-match narrative will be about Leeds, but I'm excited to see what Everton can do this season.",
      "I think we need to start putting some serious respect on what David Moyes is doing in the Premier League - I for one haven't given him enough credit. Since taking over at West Ham, he has recorded a 37 per cent win ratio in the Premier League - that's higher than Sean Dyche, Andoni Iraola, Marco Silva and Graham Potter.",
      "And when Jarrad Branthwaite was fit last season (he started 28 games), Everton conceded just 28 goals in those matches - that's one goal per game, which would equate to being the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season.",
      "With Branthwaite tied down to a new deal and money to spend, Moyes just may have the tools to overachieve on expectations. I like their chances at Elland Road, too, as Moyes has an exceptional record against newly-promoted teams, recording a 67-per-cent win rate from the last 16 fixtures. The away win looks big at 19/10 with Sky Bet.",

      "Liverpool have gone again from a position of strength, signing potentially the most exciting creative talent on the planet in Florian Wirtz, Man City have rolled the dice in the market to try and start their new legacy, Arsenal have got their centre forward and Chelsea, who were 20/1 shots before the Club World Cup, have shown in the summer against Paris Saint-Germain they have the talent and mettle to compete with the best.",
      "Rest assured, the 12 fixtures involving both of those teams will be ones to savour and already look to have six-pointer vibes about them. Box-office stuff.",
      "Centre-forwards are back in fashion. And the best in the world are strutting their stuff down the Premier League catwalk.",
      "This should have a positive impact on the league's goals output.",
      "Chances were being created last season but not taken. The 2024/25 season saw more \"big chances\" missed than any other Premier League season. That figure was at 1201 in total as the average goals per game dropped from 3.28 in the 2023/24 campaign to 2.93 last season.",
      "Spending on new players by Premier League clubs is approaching £2bn with still a couple of weeks left on what has been a meaty summer transfer window of action.",
      "Manchester United secured their man to spearhead Ruben Amorim's system by splashing the cash to lure striker Benjamin Sesko. He is full of power, can receive and hold up the ball to an elite level, loves a shot and is a nuisance for defences with constant runs in behind. Viktor Gyokeres did all of these things and more at Sporting under Amorim and he now has the pressurised task of being the missing piece of the puzzle for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal.",
      "There's also the excitement about Hugo Ekitike at Liverpool, who without question has the ceiling to go to another level in the Premier League. Already quick and skilful, he showed in the Community Shield his finishing and all-round game has already developed. Throw Alexander Isak, Matheus Cunha, Erling Haaland, Omar Marmoush, Cole Palmer and Mohamed Salah into the mix and you've got yourself a league that guarantees goals.",
      "Blink and you'll miss it. Taking your eyes off a Premier League game at any point isn't recommended as this league is now the place to watch intense, counter-attacking tactics. Teams are happy without the ball and springing into devastating transitions.",
      "This switch of style has been a trend taking over the Premier League in recent seasons. In the 2018/19 season there were 389 fast breaks (OPTA term for counter-attack) recorded. That figure rose to 775 last season. It's almost doubled.",
      "Of those 775 fast breaks, 112 of those ended with a goal being scored - that's 31 more than was scored in the 2023/24 season.",
      "The best team at it? Champions Liverpool, who with Salah to the fore recorded 52 shots and 14 goals scored from fast breaks. The best numbers by a team in any Premier League season over the past seven years.",
      "Pep Guardiola has seen close up how his Manchester City team have fallen behind in this stylistic change. His possession-based game, centred around control and luring the opposition into making rash pressing decisions has become easier for teams to crack the code.",
      "Chaos is now embraced.",
      "The rise of quick and powerful wingers along with intense midfield play has played a huge role in City's recruitment. They are heading down that avenue with the likes of Jeremy Doku and Rayan Cherki.",
      "Seeing whether Guardiola can completely rebrand this Manchester City team and embrace such chaotic football is one of the most intriguing strands to this season where the counter-attack will surely be king again.",
      "The last two Premier League seasons have uncovered a worrying theme of the three promoted clubs being relegated straight back down to the Championship.",
      "So, it's unsurprising to see Burnley, Sunderland and Leeds head the relegation betting markets but things just could be different this year and anyhow is a sample size of two seasons really enough to make such a sweeping statement that the gap between the Championship and Premier League is impossible to bridge?",
      "You only have to go back three years or so to show that Brentford, Bournemouth, Nottingham Forest and Fulham have recently shown it can be done.",
      "And all these three teams coming up have something in common: they can build their home ground to be a fortress, something Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester failed to do, winning just six games between them.",
      "Turf Moor, Elland Road and the Stadium of Light are ferocious places for away teams when rocking. That could just be the difference this year and lead to a much more competitive relegation scrap as teams feeling safe in mid-table could be dragged into a serious scrap.",
      "The inability of Liverpool's closest title challengers to keep key members of their squad last season certainly played a part in Arne Slot's team running away with the Premier League.",
      "Tottenham, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all ranked in the top five when it came to value of players that missed minutes due to injuries last season. It's going to be unlikely that Liverpool will have such an advantage this season despite Slot being a master of rotating his squad and keeping his players relatively injury-free.",
      "An absence of a major tournament last summer has to bode well for players being fresher and more robust in terms of the avoidance of injuries. Just look at the form and injury record of Declan Rice, Phil Foden, Ollie Watkins, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka at various stages last season. All went through various degrees of form wobbles following their prolonged summer helping to guide England to the European Championships.",
      "The elite clubs should be able to get their big guns out in the pitch more this season which should mean Liverpool's advantage form last season in that regard is diminished.",
      "Carragher said: \"The Premier League is on completely different level to anything else in world football.\"",
      "And that is why an epic title battle awaits.",
      "See you all on Friday.",

      "By Nick Wright and Adam Smith",
      "Saturday 16 August 2025 21:22, UK",
      "Are Liverpool destined to retain the title? Could Manchester United really finish in the bottom half of the table again?",
      "Liverpool are out to retain their crown. The champions are the Premier League's biggest spenders in this summer's transfer window as they look to build on the success of last season under Arne Slot.",
      "But will they see off the competition? Runners-up Arsenal have also strengthened. Manchester City have undergone a rebuild. Could Club World Cup winners Chelsea roar into contention?",
      "Opta predict Liverpool will retain the Premier League title following last season's success under Arne Slot, with Arsenal coming second again, albeit by a much narrower margin than last term.",
      "Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle and Aston Villa are third, fourth, fifth and sixth respectively, meaning Opta's predicted top six mirrors the final top six last season.",
      "Opta's supercomputer is far from convinced when it comes to Manchester United and Spurs. They are predicted to come 12th and 14th respectively, only three places higher than last term.",
      "FA Cup and Community Shield winners Crystal Palace are predicted to clinch a seventh-placed finish, with Brighton, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest complete the top 10.",
      "At the other end of the table, Opta expect the promoted teams to go straight back down for the third season running, with Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland finishing 18th, 19th and 20th respectively, a long way off 17th-placed Wolves for expected points.",
      "Spurs, now under the management of Thomas Frank, and beaten on penalties by Paris Saint-Germain in Wednesday's UEFA Super Cup final, are predicted to come eighth.",
      "Liverpool, again, come out on top over Arsenal as champions, with Manchester City in third. But, as in Opta's table, the top two are only separated by a slender expected points margin.",
      "A key difference at the bottom of the table is that newly-promoted Leeds are predicted to survive at the expense of Wolves.",
      "The two tables feature key similarities, most notably in the make-up of their predicted top fours. But there are huge differences too.",
      "Crystal Palace, Brentford and Brighton are also given considerably lower predicted finishes, contrary to Opta's optimism.",
      "So why the differences? Both supercomputers are based on averages from 10,000 simulations, using bookmaker odds, historical and recent team performances, and transfer spending.",
      "But the intricacies of the algorithms are different, placing weight on varying factors, which helps to explain some of the disparities seen between the two predicted tables.",
      "The summer transfer window is of course a key factor in predicting how teams will fare. A high spend does not guarantee success. Far from it. But it can be vital to a team's capacity to improve.",
      "Their total spend is already close to £300m following the arrival of Florian Wirtz for a record fee along with the signings of Hugo Ekitike, Milos Kerkez, Jeremie Frimpong and Giorgi Mamardashvili.",
      "They are not the only ones to have strengthened at considerable expense. The so-called Big Six have spent over £1bn between them this summer. And in fact, Liverpool's net spend is much lower than most of their rivals thanks to some big sales, including those of Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.",
      "Arsenal and Manchester City have work to do to shift their unwanted players but their high net spends help to explain why they are predicted to push Liverpool closer this term.",
      "Manchester United have overhauled their attack, making a trio of high-profile additions in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. So why the 12th-placed prediction from Opta?",
      "They are of course coming from a far lower starting point than Liverpool, having finished 15th last term, but it might also have something to do with how they have so far allocated their funds.",
      "Cunha, Mbeumo and Sesko all have plenty to offer offensively to a side that finished last season as the Premier League's biggest underperformers relative to their expected goals. The lack of firepower and cutting edge needed to be addressed.",
      "But have they overlooked other areas of their squad? Manchester United have invested nearly twice as much in forwards as any other club have invested in any position this summer, but there has been no turnover in goal or in midfield, and only £7m spent on defenders.",
      "This looks problematic given their issues last season were not limited to their attack. Ruben Amorim's side were far from solid in midfield or defence. Only nine Premier League sides conceded more goals. Only eight allowed more expected goals against.",
      "And yet, despite those issues, Manchester United look set to start the new Premier League season with roughly the same personnel as last season in goal, in defence and in midfield.",
      "Both predicted tables have Enzo Maresca's side in fourth place, and with near-identical points totals too, ensuring Champions League qualification for a second successive season, but falling a long way short of a push for Premier League glory.",
      "Chelsea, like their Big Six rivals, have invested heavily in new recruits this summer. There is excitement around Estevao, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap in particular. They also start the campaign with a relatively favourable run of fixtures.",
      "But they haven't finished higher than third since their last title triumph in 2016/17. Could a tough run-in, when they face all of Arsenal, Aston Villa, Newcastle, Manchester City, Manchester United, Brighton, Liverpool and Tottenham in the final 11 fixtures, and the exertions of an epic 2024/25 campaign, also bite them?",
      "Spurs finished last season on a Europa League-winning high but a 17th-placed Premier League finish did for Ange Postecoglou.",
      "Frank has arrived from Brentford as his successor and the club have so far added six new players, including Mohammed Kudus from West Ham and Joao Palhinha on loan from Bayern Munich, both of whom impressed in their UEFA Super Cup loss to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Daniel Farke's side, who pipped Burnley to the Championship title on goal difference last season, are predicted to finish 17th, fractionally ahead of Wolves, who have lost key players this summer in Cunha to Manchester United and Rayan Ait-Nouri to Manchester City.",
      "The West Midlands club have so far spent modestly this summer, their outlay totalling just £48.4m, which ensures a healthy profit from the £103.7m received in sales, but raises questions about the quality and depth available to head coach Vitor Pereira.",
      "We asked our journalists to come up with their predicted tables too.",
      "As an average, Liverpool came out as champions, with Manchester United and Spurs in sixth and seventh respectively.",
      "Leeds, Sunderland and Burnley are tipped for the drop.",

      "Read on to see our top 25 Premier League players - and then join the debate yourself in our live blog, where we want you to list your favourite footballers and debate and discuss our selections!",
      "Arsenal's defence was the meanest in the Premier League last season and Gabriel gets the recognition from our journalists and reporters - no doubt also impressed by his repeated threat from set-pieces at the other end of the pitch.",
      "Where would Man Utd be without Bruno Fernandes? That was a recurring question last season. Amid all of his team's travails, the Portugal midfielder's quality remains respected.",
      "Another driving force of Arsenal's title prospects, Declan Rice is becoming the complete midfielder in the centre of the park for the Gunners. If the football world is increasingly being filled by specialists, the England man can seemingly do it all.",

      "We love a maverick and Chelsea's Cole Palmer is one of the Premier League's top entertainers. He delivers in the big moments too - whether that's a Euros final with England or when Chelsea are in major finals.",
      "When you score 22 Premier League goals but are deemed to have had a disappointing season, you know you're a decent striker. Erling Haaland's goal-getting prowess continues to demand respect.",
