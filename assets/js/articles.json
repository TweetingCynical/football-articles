      "Scott McTominay is keeping a close eye on former club Man Utd.(Image: SSC NAPOLI, SSC NAPOLI via Getty Images)",
      "Former Manchester United midfielder Scott McTominay has expressed his joy at the current transformation at Old Trafford under Michael Carrick's stewardship - and reckons he saw it coming. The ex-midfielder served as first-team coach during McTominay's time with the Red Devils.",
      "Carrick has now stepped up as head coach until the campaign concludes, with his opening two matches in the dugout restoring optimism at the club. A 2-0 triumph over neighbours Manchester City was backed up by a 3-2 away success against table-toppers Arsenal.",
      "Discussing United, during a Napoli press conference, McTominay said: \"Michael Carrick is such a great guy. I've got so much love and respect for him.",
      "\"Those two results vs Man City and Arsenal have been amazing, especially for me to watch. So I'm very, very proud of all the players and long may it continue.\"",
      "McTominay added: \"It doesn't surprise me. I wish him [Carrick] all the best. The first matches have been great. Let's hope it continues like that.\"",
      "The remarks reveal just how keenly the Scotland international monitors his former side and arrive mere days after the club were urged to pursue his return to Old Trafford by their ex-striker Giuseppe Rossi. \"It's all up to the coach,\" he said. \"I feel that's all up in the air.",
      "\"You can't really go out and start buying players if you don't know the coaching situation. I always say McTominay because he would actually be a good player for Manchester United at this moment.\"",

      "McTominay departed United during the summer of 2024, sealing a £25million move to Serie A outfit Napoli. He has subsequently flourished, receiving widespread acclaim for his displays in Italy.",
      "Such was his contribution last campaign in helping the club clinch the Serie A crown, he was positioned at number 18 in the running for the 2025 Ballon d'Or. He also won Serie A's Player of the Year award.",
      "This season, he has featured in 31 matches in all competitions, netting nine goals while adding a further four assists. Four of those have come in seven Champions League outings.",

      "Ben Foster reckons Manchester United will have little option but to hand Michael Carrick the permanent manager's job if he wins 10 of his next 15 matches. The former United midfielder has made a strong start to his managerial stint since the club axed Ruben Amorim, clinching victories against Manchester City and Arsenal in his opening two games.",
      "The ex-Middlesbrough boss currently has a contract that expires at the end of the season, with speculation already surfacing that he might be offered the full-time role if he continues producing results. While many have been struck by United's revival under Carrick, club icon Paul Scholes has suggested officials might be wary about prolonging his appointment.",
      "It follows the club's previous choice to grant Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the permanent post after his impressive caretaker spell. However, former United shot-stopper Foster thinks Carrick would be a certainty for the position if he secures victory in at least two thirds of his remaining fixtures.",
      "His remarks followed his praise of Carrick for helping to ease the burden on his players' shoulders in recent weeks. Foster's backing also came despite him recognising worries about a repeat of the Solskjaer scenario.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"The weight of the badge is phenomenal for Manchester United, but then a new manager comes in, somebody that they know, somebody that they trust and they get on with as a friend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",

      "Man Utd could be wary of a repeat of the Ole Gunnar Solskjaer if they appoint Michael Carrick as their permanent manager(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"What a start and he's got 15 games left for Manchester United now. If he wins ten of those 15 games, you've got to give him the job.\"",
      "Whether Carrick ultimately becomes a candidate for the permanent position is yet to be determined. However, Scholes believes United will be left \"scarred\" by their previous choice concerning Solskjaer.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, the ex-United midfielder said: \"He's come into the job now and it's been that bad for a year that it couldn't really get any worse, so the pressure isn't really on you while you're interim manager.",
      "\"Once you take ‎that job full-time, at the start of the season next year, let's say, all of a sudden you've got to be winning games straightaway.",

      "Manchester United could offer the ideal transfer present to Cole Palmer, with his favoured shirt number, should he pull off a sensational switch to the club - as has been mooted in bombshell reports.",
      "The England attacking midfielder, 23, has emerged as one of the Premier League's most impressive performers over the past two campaigns, following his transfer from Manchester City to Chelsea in summer 2023. During his spell at Stamford Bridge, he has netted 48 goals and contributed a further 29 assists across 110 outings.",
      "This campaign has, nevertheless, been impacted by a persistent groin problem. Throughout the past week, stories have surfaced connecting Palmer with a remarkable switch to United. It's claimed that the England international is restless in London and is experiencing homesickness.",
      "The 23-year-old was raised as a boyhood United supporter, but progressed through the academy at rivals City. He established himself in the senior squad under Pep Guardiola during the 2021/22 campaign, before then securing his switch to Chelsea just over a year afterwards.",
      "The Blues are unlikely to surrender their prized asset without strong resistance with reports indicating Palmer is regarded as one of the 'untouchables' whom the club have no intention of offloading. That position could in turn shift, if Palmer genuinely demands a transfer away - back to Manchester or elsewhere.",
      "Should United pursue a deal, then the perfect welcoming gesture could arrive in the squad number he receives. Currently, the club's No.20 jersey is vacant for any fresh arrivals.",
      "That was the number that Palmer wore in his first two seasons at Chelsea. He now wears the No.10 jersey there, however, after switching things around before the current season.",

      "That number at United is currently taken up by summer signing Matheus Cunha, who is unlikely to relinquish the shirt without a fight. But the No.20 has been free since the end of last season, when Diogo Dalot vacated it.",
      "Discussing the speculation around Palmer last week, Chelsea's manager Liam Rosenior appeared to dismiss the homesickness claims. \"I've had numerous conversations with Cole and he seems very happy to be here,\" he said.",
      "\"He's a huge part in our long-term plans here. My job and the club's job is to get him into a situation where he can consistently perform to the level he wants to.",

      "Former Dutch international Stam has now told Van Dijk that he needs to sharpen up or he could continue costing Liverpool. Speaking to Covers.com World Cup betting, the former United star said: “When you watch Virgil van Dijk play, he seems to be doubting himself.",

      "Patrick Dorgu has been ruled out for 10 weeks with an injury(Image: Nigel French/Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick has been thrown the first major curveball of his tenure as Manchester United interim head coach with the unwelcome news that Patrick Dorgu will miss 10 weeks with a hamstring injury.",
      "Dorgu has been the stand-out performer since Carrick took over from Ruben Amorim, scoring in both the 2-0 win over Manchester City and the 3-2 away win at Arsenal. Converted from a left wingback in Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system to a left winger in Carrick's 4-2-3-1 formation, he has been a revelation.",
      "United will now be deprived of his services for around 10 weeks after his exertions against Arsenal saw the Denmark international pick up a hamstring injury. He is likely to miss eight Premier League games, with a potential return coming against Leeds on April 11.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Carrick does not have the luxury of using Jadon Sancho or Marcus Rashford, who are both away playing the position on loan with Aston Villa and Barcelona respectively, or Alejandro Garnacho, who was sold to Chelsea for £40million in the summer after falling out with Amorim.",
      "The most obvious replacement for Dorgu is therefore Mason Mount. The United midfielder has played off the left side as one of the attacking midfielders under Amorim's management and is comfortable cutting inside onto his stronger right foot.",
      "Mount was an unused substitute against Arsenal after replacing Bruno Fernandes in the Manchester Derby. The 27-year-old works hard and has the positional discipline that has made him liked by previous United bosses, despite a lacklustre return of seven goals and two assists in 66 appearances for the club.",
      "If Carrick did opt to start Mount in the next match against Fulham, he would likely ask more from Luke Shaw going forwards on the overlap, with Mount happiest going inside.",
      "Mason Mount is the obvious beneficiary after Patrick Dorgu's injury(Image: Ash Donelon/Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The other most likely option is to shuffle the pack up front. Carrick has played Bryan Mbeumo as a lone striker in both of his matches so far to great effect, with the Cameroon international scoring against City and Arsenal. But the impact of Matheus Cunha off the bench in both games cannot be ignored - and the Brazilian admitted he is desperate to start.",
      "Cunha scored a fabulous winner at Arsenal after coming off the bench for Mbeumo in the 69th minute, linking up with Kobbie Mainoo before curling into the bottom corner from outside the box. He is at his best in the middle of the pitch, ideally playing behind another striker, but has the ability to start on the left and drift inside onto his dangerous right foot.",
      "Matheus Cunha is pushing Michael Carrick to start him(Image: Getty Images)",
      "United do have a left-footer in their starting line-up: Amad. The Ivory Coast international prefers to play on the right side and cut inside, but could be repositioned on the opposite side to resemble a traditional winger. If that were the case, then Mbeumo could be moved back to the right, where he played under Amorim, with Cunha up front and Bruno Fernandes in the No.10 role.",
      "Amad has shown positional flexibility, having been fielded as a right wingback by Amorim. However, Carrick may not want to avoid putting too many square pegs into round holes, given his early success at United has been built around simplifying things and putting players in their strongest positions.",
      "Amad could switch wings (Image: Getty Images)",
      "Carrick has repeatedly spoken about his belief in the United academy, whose reputation took a beating during the Amorim era. The ex-United midfielder has close links with the young players at the club and will be well aware of Shea Lacey's talents.",
      "The 18-year-old winger has made two substitute appearances in the Premier League this season, while he was sent off in the 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Brighton earlier this month. Like Amad, he is more comfortable on the right wing, cutting inside onto his left, but could be handed more opportunities in the coming weeks.",

      "The 3-2 loss was the Gunners' third successive league match without a victory and saw their advantage at the summit reduced to four points after a weekend where Manchester City and Aston Villa both secured wins. Gabriel and Saliba have been cornerstones of the Gunners' backline in recent campaigns.",

      "\"They weren't poor by any stretch but they looked fragile and a bit weak at times. It is the most fractious I have seen those two. You can sense that fear and desperation of wanting it so much, it is almost infectious. When United equalised, it ran through the team.\"",

Mikel Arteta seemingly shared this view, making four substitutions just shy of the hour mark, including withdrawing captain Martin Odegaard and fellow midfielder Martin Zubimendi, whose mistake had handed United their first-half leveller.",

      "Angel Di Maria left Real Madrid for Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Former flop Angel Di Maria has hit out at ‘lies’ about his infamous move to Manchester United. The Argentina international signed for the Red Devils back in 2014 in a £59.7m move from Spanish giants Real Madrid.",
      "But Di Maria lasted just a single season at Old Trafford before being sold at a loss to French side Paris Saint-Germain. Di Maria has regularly claimed since that he never wanted to leave Real Madrid.",
      "In a fresh interview with Spanish outlet AS, Di Maria has taken aim at suggestions that he was moved on because he wanted a pay packet on par with Cristiano Ronaldo.",
      "He said: “Yes [I was sad], because I didn’t want to leave. It was said that I wanted to earn the same as Cristiano, but that was a lie. How could I expect to earn the same as someone who has won several Ballon d’Or awards?",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“I was very happy, I had won the Champions League and Ancelotti didn’t want me to leave either, but James [Rodriguez] had arrived and I was the one on the market to leave.”",
      "Di Maria has since confirmed that he was determined to stay in Spain even up until he signed the contract for United.",
      "He added: “I tried to stay until the last day. I wanted to keep training. I played in the first leg of the Super Cup against Atleti, and in the second leg they didn’t even call me up because they had already reached an agreement with Manchester United, something I didn’t know about. My family and I were very happy, but sometimes these things happen, and it happened to me.”",
      "Di Maria signed for Man United back in 2014(Image: Getty Images)",
      "After leaving United in 2015, he ended up spending seven seasons with PSG, scoring 92 goals in 295 appearances, winning five league titles, five French Cups and four French League Cups.",
      "He departed in 2022 to join Italian side Juventus but spent just a season in Serie A before signing for former side Benfica. Di Maria then returned to another of his former employers last year as he moved back to Argentina with a move to Rosario Central.",
      "Di Maria was not the only one dissatisfied with life in Manchester. His wife Jorgelina Cardoso was also not a big fan of the move.",
      "Speaking in 2020, she said: \"It was horrible. Manchester is the worst. It is all horrible in Manchester. In fact, I fought a lot with Angel about it. We lived in Madrid, Angel played in the best team in the world which for me is Real Madrid.",
      "“We were perfect, the weather was perfect, the food was perfect. And suddenly he said that there was a proposal to go to Manchester. I told him, 'Not a chance. You are going alone. 'No, come on. Let's go', he replied.”",

      "After interim manager Michael Carrick continued his fast start at Manchester United on Sunday, another contender for the job has a different task at hand. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was linked with an Old Trafford return a little over four years since his sacking but the club ultimately opted for Carrick.",
      "That decision has immediately borne fruit with Carrick overseeing Premier League wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. Solskjaer remains without a managerial job since leaving Besiktas earlier this season but will be keeping a close eye on one of his former club's rivals this week.",
      "The Norwegian has taken on a new role this season, serving as a UEFA technical observer for the Champions League. The role will take him back to England this week, with Solskjaer in position for Liverpool's match at home to Qarabag.",
      "He'll be watching another under-pressure manager, with Arne Slot feeling the heat after Liverpool's weekend defeat at Bournemouth saw them end the gameweek out of the top four. Things are more promising for the Merseyside club in Europe, though, where a win would ensure they avoid an extra play-off round by finishing in the top eight in the Champions League table.",
      "Solskjaer is one of more than 20 current and former players and coaches entrusted by UEFA for the technical observer role, Others include former Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou, ex-England boss Gareth Southgate and current Portugal manager Roberto Martinez.",
      "\"Instead of just watching the game for a specific reason – in my capacity as a national-team coach – you are watching it in a more holistic way and appreciating the development of the game and the competition itself,\" Martinez said of the role. \"It could be different types of performance – from young players, for example – or the way the competition is getting tougher physically and cuter tactically with the new trends within the competition.\"",
      "Roberto Martinez is another of UEFA's technical observers(Image: PA)",
      "Per UEFA's description: \"During each game, the designated UEFA Technical Observer collaborates with UEFA's Performance Analysis team to gather video and data. The UEFA Technical Observers receive footage from various angles, including broadcast, tactical and high-behind views, which they can review either live at the stadium or remotely.\"",
      "Each observer is also tasked with selecting the player of the match for each game they are assigned to, while the group will come together to determine the player, young player, team and goal of the season. Paris Saint-Germain star Ousmane Dembele was named player of the season in 2024/25, with Manchester City midfielder Rodri - in 2022/23 - the last player to win the award while playing for an English club.",

Dorgu's spectacular strike even prompted a message from Jamie Redknapp, while Dalot - frequently a target for criticism in the past - earned recognition for a much-improved display.",
      "Speaking on his 'The Gary Neville podcast', Neville said of Dorgu: \"Look, I mean, to be fair, I just thought, you can't really say anything bad about him because he's a willing runner. He's always worked hard under Ruben Amorim but you thought, what is he? How is he going to get Manchester United back to where they need to be?",
      "\"I think actually, the first time we saw a glimpse of what Patrick Dorgu could be was actually under Ruben Amorim, when he played him as a wide right and I can't remember the game now because I watched that many games with them, it might have been Newcastle, may have been Newcastle, may have been Bournemouth - one of those two I think.",
      "\"Oh, playing a bit higher up with a full-back behind him, getting supported, he can play a little bit. He can actually be a good wide player, who can do a bit and cause problems for defending and getting crosses in.",
      "\"And then you just think, I think the week after, he put him back to wing back, I thought; 'Oh no'.",
      "\"I think where he's been used now, he's obviously a winger. I mean today, his goal was absolutely brilliant.\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Neville then went on to reveal the message he received from one-time Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp after Dorgu's goal. \"He's actually just text me and I should have seen it during the game, and he said it was like Yeboah's goal - the one that comes off the bar and sort of and he's right, it was a brilliant,\" Neville continued.",
      "\"Dorgu absolutely does, I think, typify what's happened in the last week.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dalot operated as a more traditional full‑back rather than his previous wing-back role, and delivered a solid performance. His inconsistent form at Old Trafford has led some to call for him to be replaced, but Neville has argued it would be a mistake to sell a player Jose Mourinho originally brought to the club.",
      "Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot were praised for their performances against Arsenal.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"But another player I want to mention actually, is [Diogo] Dalot,\" Neville said. \"Look, he gets a really harsh view at times from quite a few United fans, I actually think there's half a decent full-back so closely, I think at times maybe, he gets too involved, but I think he's good in the air, I think he's got a good athleticism about him.",
      "\"He's decent on the ball, I don't think he's a world-class full-back, neither was I but I think he does a lot of things. I think if he simplified his game a little bit, [just] feed people.",
      "\"He made a great header at the end against Gabriel where he flicked it on, he can defend his back post if he wants to. He starts to be more aggressive in getting out to players and then getting back in.\"",

      "Manchester United have been handed a significant blow after discovering that Patrick Dorgu had suffered a hamstring injury. Dorgu was outstanding in the 3-2 win over Arsenal on Sunday but will now be unavailable for around 10 weeks.",
      "He scored United's second goal at the Emirates Stadium with a powerful long-range strike. But he was shown holding his hamstring in the closing stages and Michael Carrick's hope that it was just cramp has not materialised.",
      "The Athletic report that, while assessments will continue, he is expected to be sidelined for around 10 weeks.",
      "“He obviously came off with, hopefully, a little bit of cramp, hopefully, it’s nothing worse,\" Carrick said post-match on Sunday. “At this stage, it’s hard to tell, so we’ll just have to wait and see. Hopefully it’s not too bad.”",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",

      "Dorgu has arguably been the biggest revelation since Carrick took charge as United's interim boss. Having been played as a left wing-back in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, he has played as a left winger under Carrick and scored in the 2-0 win over Manchester City and the victory over Arsenal.",
      "The Denmark international has featured 22 times in the Premier League this season, recording three goals and three assists. He joins Matthijs de Ligt on the sidelines, with the Netherlands international having missed the last 11 games with a back injury picked up in December.",
      "The injury comes at a cruel time for Dorgu, who earned praise from Carrick after his impact at Arsenal. \"Pat’s been a big player for us, obviously he’s scored two goals but in terms of the threat and athleticism and quality, he’s been immense down the side with Luke [Shaw] against two teams that ask a lot of questions,\" Carrick said.",

      "Having been one of the Premier League’s star performers since then, clubs in the English top flight will no doubt be sitting up and taking notice. Chief among those is United, who could yet make a sensational move for the playmaker.",
      "Palmer would also be open to a stunning switch to Old Trafford, having supported the Red Devils as a boy. In even better news for United, it is suggested that he would not even consider a return to Manchester City.",
      "And while Chelsea would likely resist any approach for Palmer from their Premier League rivals, there’s no doubt that he would represent a blockbuster signing for United. Here’s how they could potentially line-up should they seal his services:",

      "The Portuguese midfielder is set to consider his future at Old Trafford after the World Cup and with long-standing interest in him from Saudi Arabia, it would not be surprising to see him depart. That would of course be damaging for United but the signing of Palmer would help alleviate some of that pain.",
      "Having spent heavily on their attack in the most recent summer transfer window, the current Chelsea star could well be surrounded by a number of those signings. Benjamin Sesko would lead the line ahead of him, with Bryan Mbeumo and the weekend’s matchwinner Matheus Cunha on either flank.",

      "Ruben Amorim was accused of neglecting Man Utd's young players(Image: Getty)",
      "Wayne Rooney has admitted his frustration with Ruben Amorim's apparent disregard for the Manchester United academy. Much was debated about the contrast between Amorim and United's tradition of nurturing young talent throughout his 14-month spell as head coach, with detractors arguing he failed to grasp the club's heritage.",
      "Since the Portuguese coach was dismissed and club legend Michael Carrick took over as interim boss until the summer, many have been thrilled by his enthusiasm for the club's youth set-up, mirroring Sir Alex Ferguson's approach.",
      "Amorim seldom looked to homegrown stars, with Kobbie Mainoo among the players he sidelined. In contrast, Carrick already seems willing to depend on youngsters with 'club DNA', having watched the under-21s team last week.",
      "Carrick's own son plays for the under-16s and other young players' families feel their offspring will now have better opportunities, given the former midfielder's greater insight. This includes Carrick's ex-team-mate Rooney, whose sons Kai and Klay are also in United's youth ranks.",

      "Rooney said on his BBC podcast: \"It is great to see all the coaches taking a big interest in the academy. In the next few years, some of those players might get an opportunity for the first team, so it is important they have that interest.",
      "\"On Saturday, they were all at the under-16s game as well before they travelled to London. It is great to see that coming back into the club.",
      "\"I have been quite vocal on this. It used to be the norm but it has been missing in the last few years. With my two lads in the academy, I haven't seen that and it was a bit disappointing.",

      "Michael Carrick has enjoyed a dream start as Man United boss(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United’s new manager could oversee his first game in Helsinki as the club continues to put plans for next season together. The Red Devils remain on the hunt for a new permanent boss despite Michael Carrick’s excellent impact.",
      "The former midfielder replaced Ruben Amorim until the end of the season earlier this month and has impressed, having beaten Manchester City and Arsenal. However, the plan remains for Carrick to step aside ahead of the 2026/27 campaign.",
      "And despite having not yet found the man to take the reins, plans are already being put in place for next season. According to The Sun, United chiefs are set to organise pre-season games in both Helsinki and Gothenburg.",
      "Talks remain ongoing but plans are seemingly close to being finalised. United usually visit the USA for a lucrative pre-season tour, but with the World Cup being held in the country, as well as Mexico and Canada, it appears that the plan has been changed.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Should everything be organised as expected, the games may represent the first chance for the new United boss to run the rule over their side. Scandinavia is not an unfamiliar place to the Red Devils, having kicked off their pre-season calendar there against Leeds United last season, while they took on Turkish giants Galatasaray in Gothenburg in 2016.",
      "And while the pre-season calendar is taking shape, United will certainly be keen on finishing off the current campaign positively. The Red Devils currently sit fourth in the table ahead of this weekend’s clash with Fulham.",
      "Carrick has been told that a spot in the Champions League is a target for the club between now and May. Asked how he has found his spell in charge so far, he replied: \"I'm enjoying it. It's a fantastic position to be in. What happens next: I'm not going to be answering it every week. I'm enjoying it and I'll continue to do what I can.\"",
      "Man United have shelved plans for their traditional pre-season tour of the USA(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Meanwhile, defender Harry Maguire was full of praise for Carrick and the work he has done following the win against Arsenal. He said: “Michael’s come in, he’s been brilliant with us, he’s brought a fresh energy, the group’s really galvanised.”",
      "Despite Carrick’s impressive stint so far, a number of high-profile managers have been linked with the job. England boss Thomas Tuchel is on the club’s shortlist alongside Mauricio Pochettino and Carlo Ancelotti.",

      "However, they're yet to add to their ranks during the January transfer window and have just under a week left to bolster Carrick's options to make their Champions League dream a reality. United have been linked with several additions in different positions, though the majority of their business was done in the summer, bringing in the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Brazilian outlet Rádio Tupi claims Man Utd, Tottenham and Chelsea are all keeping an eye on Brazilian striker Vitor Roque. However, Palmeiras have slapped a huge £43m asking price, according to the report.",
      "The 20-year-old striker impressed at Cruzeiro and Athletico Paranaense earlier on in his career, scoring plenty of goals in Brazil's top-flight, which saw Barcelona come calling. However, the Brazilian striker struggled to make his mark in Spain.",
      "He's scored just twice in 16 appearances before a loan move to Real Betis.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",

The report claims none of the Premier League trio have made a formal approach for the striker, who is in just his fifth year of senior football.",

      "Barcelona president Joan Laporta has described Dro Fernandez's departure as 'unpleasant', after Hansi Flick highlighted Marcus Rashford's commitment as the perfect blueprint for what the club's youngsters should strive towards.",
      "Fernandez has sealed a switch to Paris Saint-Germain following his surprising decision to submit a transfer request. The 18-year-old reportedly activated his own £5.1million release clause in an attempt to push through a departure this month.",
      "The teenager joined Barcelona at 14, and made his Champions League debut in October, where he provided an assist as Barca thrashed Olympiacos 6-1. Now, Fernandez has penned a deal that will keep him in the French capital until 2030.",
      "Flick was left exasperated by the circumstances, and when questioned about it before the transfer, had to hold back his thoughts. \"Sometimes it's like that, that, yes, you do not agree with what they are doing, but they are 18, they are old enough to make decisions, they have people around them,\" he said.",
      "\"Of course, when I see like...no, no, I don't want to talk anymore, it's enough.\"",

      "\"We have to wait. We have months to go. For me, of course with Marcus we have a player on the top level, but also with our situation, and what I appreciate a lot from him [is his desire to be here].",
      "\"This is what I want to say to young players from La Masia: We are Barca and we are one of the best teams in the world. We give them the opportunity to train with us, to grow, to train with the best players in the world, the support and the confidence.",

      "Laporta has now voiced his thoughts regarding Fernandez's departure, though more details may yet emerge. \"We will talk when everything is finalised. It's been an unpleasant situation,\" Laporta told Catalunya Radio.",
      "\"We will be able to resolve this situation as planned, but it's been a surprise because we had agreed on a new solution with Dro when he turned 18, and surprisingly, his agent told us that he couldn't fulfil the agreement.\"",

      "Paul Scholes reckons Manchester United's previous experiences with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will make the club reluctant to install Michael Carrick as their long-term head coach despite his fine start to life in the hotseat.",
      "Carrick, who was previously a member of Solskjaer's coaching team, returned to Old Trafford earlier this month on a contract until the end of the season after Ruben Amorim was sacked by the Red Devils. The former Middlesbrough manager, who left the Championship side by mutual consent back in the summer, has made an instant impact in the role, beating Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games.",
      "United's impressive upturn in both performances and results under Carrick has already fuelled suggestions that he could be a genuine contender to land the head coach position on a longer contract.",
      "But Scholes believes United will be \"scarred\" by their previous experience of giving Solskjaer the job permanently off the back of a superb interim spell - and that is likely to affect Carrick's chances of following suit.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, the former United midfielder said of Carrick: \"He’s come into the job now and it’s been that bad for a year that it couldn’t really get any worse so the pressure isn’t really on you while you’re interim manager. Once you take that job full-time, at the start of the season next year, let’s say, all of a sudden you’ve got to be winning games straightaway.",

      "\"But if Michael has got to go up against, say, Thomas Tuchel in the summer then there’s only one winner if you’re looking at coaching big clubs and winning big prizes so you can’t really compete with that.\"",
      "Nicky Butt was in agreement and believes Carrick will know the score in that his chances of becoming Manchester United's long-term head coach are slim. \"I think Michael is that bright and intelligent, he’ll understand the job that he’s got,\" Butt added.",
      "\"I can’t ever imagine Michael going on the TV… maybe his last game if he’s third or something like that… but up until then, he knows he’s got a contract until the end of the season to get the club moving forward in the right direction for the next manager.",

      "Jonny Evans and Jonathan Woodgate.(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "Last weekend, Leeds fans' stomachs churned when they spotted Jonathan Woodgate celebrating against Arsenal. You could say Woodgate has 'done an Alan Smith' by switching allegiances to Manchester United.",
      "\"Seeing Jonny Woodgate celebrate a scum winner like that is grim,\" posted a Leeds fan on social media. They may have to get used to Michael Carrick's backroom staff celebrating on touchlines, though.",
      "Carrick has overseen brilliant wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. United sources continue to reiterate that nobody is getting carried away, but Carrick has made a perfect start, helping to restore optimism for the remainder of the season after inheriting a team out of all cup competitions.",
      "The backroom staff have been crucial in those wins. Steve Holland joined Carrick to serve as assistant manager, while Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion are first-team coaches.",
      "Holland and Woogate have been hands-on alongside Carrick during training sessions. Woodgate speaks Spanish, which has helped him find common ground with Spanish-speaking players in the squad.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "When Woodgate signed for Real Madrid in the summer of 2004, he attempted to speak Spanish at his initiation, while Michael Owen, who signed in the same window, chose to speak English. Woodgate immersed himself in Spanish culture and watched Spanish television to help pick up conversations more easily. He said it was \"vital\" to learn. Studying Spanish stood him in good stead when he coached Spanish players at Bournemouth, and it has helped him to endear himself at Carrington.",
      "\"Chuffed for Woody. Hope you get a chance to speak to him at some point. He’s good as gold, brilliant fella,\" was the message from a north-east contact after his arrival at United.",
      "A journalist who interviewed Woodgate during his time at Real Madrid was present in the mixed zone at the Emirates. Woodgate strolled over to have a small catch-up with that reporter.",
      "Woodgate and Zidane during Madrid training in 2004.(Image: 2004 AFP)",
      "Woodgate had the talent to be remembered as one of the finest English defenders of all time, but injuries ultimately curtailed his career. Unsurprisingly, the 46-year-old has passed on knowledge to United's defensive unit since his arrival, working individually with the defenders to help them improve.",
      "Woodgate's coaching career has been interesting. He was an assistant coach at Middlesbrough when they were relegated from the Premier League in 2017. He returned to Boro in the summer of 2019 to become their manager, but he was sacked near the end of his first season.",
      "In 2021, Woodgate joined Bournemouth. He oversaw the remainder of the campaign as interim, guiding the Cherries into the Championship play-offs, before being overlooked for the permanent job.",
      "Woodgate returned to Middlesbrough in 2022 to work as a first-team coach following Carrick's appointment as manager. He departed alongside Carrick when he was sacked by Boro. During their time at Middlesbrough, Carrick said: \"Woody has been massive ever since I’ve walked through the door. The impact on me and around the place is massive… his character, knowledge and love of the game. He sees things a little bit differently than me, having obviously played at the back.",
      "\"We feed off each other in a good, dynamic way. He’s constantly looking at different things to what I might see and helping the boys develop. Defence is one of the things we’ve really been conscious of and trying to focus on. Woody does a lot of work with the back four, and credit to him for that.\"",
      "Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick and Jonathan Woodgate the assistant head coach",
      "Evans, who retired from playing at the end of last season, has also been responsible for individual work with the defenders. Evans took up a role as head of loans and pathways last summer, but sources with knowledge of his decision to step away in December said it was not a position that suited him.",
      "The academy graduate is now within the thick of the action again, which is thought to be more suitable for this stage of his career, compared to the slow pace of his previous United role.",
      "Evans is hugely respected at Carrington. He is particularly good with young players, having experience of what it's like to come through the academy and what teenagers must do to consolidate.",
      "Respect for Holland is widespread in the coaching sphere. He worked with Jose Mourinho, Rafa Benitez and Antonio Conte, among others, during his time at Chelsea, and was credited with overseeing the bulk of coaching during his stint as Gareth Southgate's assistant manager for England.",
      "Holland is a boyhood United fan and would watch games from the Stretford End when he was a kid. Carrick had not worked with him before, but agreed with Jason Wilcox that his skillset would be helpful.",
      "Holland and Carrick pictured in discussion.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Binnion's official title at the academy was 'head of player development and coaching' before his first-team promotion. Binnion was U21 manager, but stepped up to help Darren Fletcher when he was caretaker.",
      "He was retained to coach within the senior set-up when Carrick was appointed. Binnion has long been a conduit between the first-team and the academy, advising which players are ready to participate in senior training sessions, but his role has evolved over the last few weeks. Although Binnion was on the bench during Fletcher's two games in charge, he has now moved into the stands to sit with the analysts and pass on information to the bench during matches.",
      "Woodgate was spotted wearing an earpiece during the Manchester derby. Binnion's aerial advantage means he can feed back nuggets of information that the coaches in the dug-out may not identify. Binnion has worked tirelessly behind the scenes in the academy over the last few years. Young players, parents and representatives have all benefited from his wise counsel.",
      "Craig Mawson was the only coach on Ruben Amorim's backroom staff to be retained after his exit. Mawson joined United in 2019, having worked his way up at Burnley in different goalkeeper coach positions.",
      "The first-team analyst staff continue to be important. Amorim namedropped Kaita Hasegawa as someone who deserved praise for improving set-pieces and helping to tactically prepare for the opponent. Hasegawa's position has not been described as senior, but he was recruited from Everton after seven years in Merseyside, and he is understood to play an important role in the background.",
      "Carrick has been lavished with praise, however, the mini-transformation over the fortnight has been a collective effort. United are heading in the right direction again thanks to their work at Carrington.",

      "Michael Carrick suggested Dorgu was brought off with cramp, but the 21-year-old appeared to hold his hamstring when he went down, and subsequently limped away from the stadium. When asked how the injury was as he departed, Dorgu responded: \"We'll see.\"",
      "Dorgu's injury is being assessed and United sources have insisted no timescale for his lay-off is clear at this stage, despite reports claiming he could be sidelined for around 10 weeks.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Dorgu played on the right wing against Newcastle on Boxing Day and scored the matchwinner. He built on that performance by scoring against Manchester City from the wing again.",
      "The Denmark international retained his starting role to face Arsenal at the Emirates, and he scored a stunning half-volley to fire United into a 2-1 lead in the second half of the game.",
      "Speaking after Arsenal, Carrick said: “Pat’s been a big player for us, obviously he’s scored two goals but in terms of the threat and athleticism and quality, he’s been immense down the side with Luke [Shaw] against two teams that ask a lot of questions.",
      "“I am delighted for him because the two goals he’s scored are very different goals. It's nice to see him smiling and happy. He obviously came off with, hopefully, a little bit of cramp, hopefully, it's nothing worse.",
      "“At this stage, it's hard to tell, so we'll just have to wait and see. Hopefully it's not too bad.”",
      "The MEN revealed this week that Dorgu \"does loads of extras\" in training, with a source crediting him for working \"really hard\". It's understood there has been a focus on improving Dorgu's crossing, with an emphasis on him perfecting his technique during training at Carrington.",
      "United believe Dorgu's hard work is paying off. The defender knew an opportunity to regain his starting role would emerge during the Africa Cup of Nations, and he's contributed three goals and two assists in seven games, representing his hottest run of form since his arrival from Lecce.",

      "Michael Carrick has handled Matheus Cunha superbly so far",
      "The pent-up frustration and disappointment that Matheus Cunha felt at finding his place in the Manchester United team under threat for the first time came pouring out during his celebration at the Emirates. The Brazilian celebrated wildly with the away end before directing his anger down a camera lens.",
      "It's been a strange week or so for the 26-year-old Brazilian, who has found himself on the bench for successive Premier League games for the first time since his move from Wolves in the summer, but has also managed to deliver two decisive moments.",
      "Cunha came on for the final 19 minutes against Manchester City last week and produced a lively cameo. His clever runs offered an outlet to United and he created the goal with which Patrick Dorgu killed the game off.",
      "That wasn't enough to get him back in the team at Arsenal. This time, he got the final 21 minutes and again looked up for the fight. His contribution was even bigger, striding forward and curling a stunning goal into the corner of David Raya's net to earn United a famous victory.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Cunha has taken his goal contributions to seven in 22 games with his efforts over the past week, and once again, it looks like his Old Trafford career is threatening to kick into gear. Despite being signed as a perfect fit for Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system, he only showed glimpses under the Portuguese head coach, and his best performances have come as a false nine.",
      "Speaking after the win at the Emirates, Michael Carrick massaged Cunha's ego, showering him with praise for the contribution he has made despite not starting either of his first two games in charge.",
      "\"Matheus coming on, a big impact again like he did last week,\" said Carrick. \"Creating a goal last week. I just fancied him to score when the ball came out of his feet.",
      "\"He kind of epitomises what we've been like this week. Matheus has not started both games, but he's had a real big impact. He's been disappointed not to start but he's used it in a really good way.",
      "\"Two huge moments and he totally deserves that winning goal for how he's applied himself, and I’m absolutely delighted.\"",
      "Carrick has made a bold call with leaving the £62.5million signing out so far, especially for Dorgu. As well as the young Dane has done, on stature and squad status, the safe decision would have been to start the big-money summer signing.",
      "These decisions are even harder for Carrick because of the lack of games to use his squad, which is now only missing Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee. In a normal season for United, Cunha could have started in Europe in midweek, but that isn't an option.",
      "There are only 15 games left this season and by the time of the Fulham game this weekend, Cunha will have played a little over 40 minutes in three weeks. That makes the challenge not only of rotation but also of keeping players happy all the more difficult for Carrick.",
      "So far, he has got it right with the Brazilian. Cunha has earned a start, although the problem is nobody deserves to be dropped either. Perhaps Dorgu's injury and the different game plan required to take on Fulham at Old Trafford will open a door.",
      "It certainly feels like Carrick needs to give him that. If he has kept him on side so far and managed to get him to channel his disappointment in the right way, that can quickly change if positive impacts off the bench only lead to more time on the bench.",
      "Cunha is doing the right things at Carrington. Like the rest of the squad, he has embraced the shorter, sharper sessions at Carrington and his form looks to be trending in the right direction again. He has done everything Carrick has asked of him in the past two weeks, and now it is time for that to be rewarded.",

      "Lacey scored from a free-kick.",
      "Manchester United youngster Shea Lacey scored a free-kick for the Under-21s against Brighton on Monday afternoon in front of the watching Michael Carrick. Lacey was absent from the first-team squad for Sunday's trip to face Arsenal in the Premier League because Carrick had an almost full-strength squad.",
      "Exciting prospect Lacey started for the U21s in their league game against the Seagulls at Carrington and opened the scoring in the 34th minute, converting a free-kick from the edge of the box. Brighton levelled in the second half to secure a point in Manchester.",
      "Carrick was in attendance to see Lacey find the net with a brilliant free-kick. The United boss was spotted observing from the sidelines alongside the head of United's academy, Stephen Torpey, and Under-18 manager, Darren Fletcher.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick and his backroom staff observed some of the Under-16s' game at Carrington on Saturday, before the first-team travelled to London to face Arsenal at the Emirates.",
      "United's interim head coach also attended the U21s' game against Sporting Lisbon, and the U18s' clash in the FA Youth Cup last week. Carrick believes it's important to show support for the academy.",
      "Lacey was included in first-team training in the build-up to the Arsenal fixture, but Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee are the only absentees due to injury, meaning the bench was full of senior players.",
      "The 18-year-old Lacey made two pleasing cameos from the bench during Fletcher's stint as caretaker manager, emerging with credit against Burnley in the Premier League and against Brighton in the FA Cup despite being sent off.",
      "Lacey was introduced to the game with 30 minutes to play. He was shown a yellow card in the 87th minute for a foul and picked up another minutes later for throwing the ball to the ground.",
      "Fletcher said: \"Shea Lacey's yellow card is ridiculous compared to the fouls that we had against us all game which ultimately then the lad makes a mistake and is sent off. For me, it is poor refereeing.\"",
      "When asked how Lacey was doing after being sent off, he said: \"He's disappointed because he cares and he understands and he knows he will learn from it. There is no doubt about his talent.",
      "\"And it was a steep learning curve today, but we believe in Shea. He's one of our most exciting young prospects, and I'm sure at Old Trafford he will have a chance to make amends for that in the future.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim handed Lacey his senior debut against Aston Villa in December.",

      "Hello and welcome to the MEN's Manchester United live blog on Tuesday, January 27.",
      "The feel-good factor is well and truly back at Old Trafford after back-to-back wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. Matheus Cunha's superb winner lifted Michael Carrick's men into the Premier League top four places.",
      "United are next in action on Sunday when they take on Fulham. Until then, attention returns to the January transfer window. The window closes next Monday and there could be a number of twists still to play out.",
      "A new midfielder is at the top of the list for United after it was confirmed that Casemiro would leave the club at the end of the season. However, Cole Palmer is the surprising big name to be linked following reports of his desire to return to Manchester.",
      "Palmer was a United fan growing up before coming through the Manchester City academy. After moving to Chelsea, the England international has established himself as one of the Premier League's best attackers.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "With that being said, we will bring you all the latest news throughout the day...",
      "The Daily Mail claims Andre Onana is in talks to secure a permanent move away from Manchester United and return to former club Inter Milan.",
      "The Cameroon goalkeeper's representatives are said to be in Milan this week to discuss a possible return to his former club, with his current loan at Trabzonspor set to expire this summer.",
      "As things stand, Onana is set to return to Old Trafford, but has fallen down the pecking order and struggled with form since his £47.2million move from the San Siro.",
      "Although Onana has not given up hope of resurrecting his United career, a return to Italy is said to be something under consideration.",
      "Manchester United has launched its latest collaboration with the Stone Roses. On Tuesday, the club unveiled a range of shirts, jackets and shorts as part of its new adidas x Man United x The Stone Roses collection.",
      "The centrepiece of the collection is the Man United x The Stone Roses Shirt (£90). This features an all-over graphic print of the band’s signature paint splatter artwork from the ‘I Wanna Be Adored’ single, designed by guitarist John Squire.",
      "It also features a unique Man United crest with Stone Roses lemon graphics and ‘I Wanna Be Adored’ text inside. Also available is the Man United x The Stone Roses Long Sleeve Shirt (£140).",
      "You can read more here.",
      "January is a notoriously difficult month in which to strike up transfer business and, as things stand, things look like being quiet at Old Trafford when it comes to incomings. Should there be any movement, though, there are a few decent shirt numbers up for grabs for potential signings;",
      "No.9 / No.14 / No.17 / No.20 / No.21 / No.24 / No.27 / No.28 / No.29 / No.34",
      "Cole Palmer to United is the exciting whisper doing the rounds right now. Time will tell if anything comes of that, while his current club Chelsea are naturally down-playing any potential exit. After two wins from two under Michael Carrick on the pitch, this is also really getting fans talking on social media, too, as fanciful as any deal might be at this stage.",
      "Check out the latest on Palmer here >>>",
      "A return move to United has been mooted - and hoped for - for a while. But will it ever happen? The former United midfielder was asked about all-things Old Trafford and has responded with some kind words indeed for Michael Carrick. Here's what Scott McTominay had to say;",
      "Michael Carrick is such a great guy. I've got so much love and respect for him. The two results vs Man City and Arsenal have been amazing, especially for me to watch. I'm very, very proud of all the players and long may it continue.",
      "Away from the first-team, there's some lunchtime action for United's next generation. One or two familiar names in the mix, not least a certain Kai Rooney on the bench;",
      "Former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was tipped for an Old Trafford comeback as interim manager, only to miss out to Michael Carrick. Now, as Carrick celebrates back-to-back wins, Solskjaer faces a different challenge entirely.",
      "United's managerial choice has already paid dividends, with Carrick securing Premier League victories over Manchester City and Arsenal. Solskjaer has remained unemployed since departing Besiktas earlier this campaign but will be monitoring one of his former club's Premier League rivals very closely this week.",
      "The Norwegian is a UEFA technical observer for the Champions League this season, one of more than 20 footballing figures to hold the responsibility. His role will bring him back to England this week, with Solskjaer set to attend Liverpool's home fixture against Qarabag in a professional capacity.",

      "Manchester United could reportedly be set to shell out £26million (€30m) to secure the signature of Stade Rennais striker Mohamed Kader Meite in the January transfer window, according to French media reports.",
      "At just 18 years old, Meite has quickly become one of the most sought-after talents in European football following his breakout season in Ligue 1. The young forward has netted three goals in 19 appearances across all competitions this term, building on a record of 14 goals in 32 matches at youth level.",
      "French publication Quest-France has reported that United have shown interest in the teenage sensation. This news follows earlier reports from Foot Mercato suggesting that United are planning to thwart Al-Hilal's bid to sign the France Under-21 international.",
      "While reports are linking Joshua Zirkzee with a move away from Old Trafford this month, TuttoSport claim United have made it clear they won't be selling the Dutch international this month.",
      "AS Roma have already been knocked back in their quest to sign the 24-year-old and now Juventus look set to suffer the same fate.",
      "Juve are reportedly growing desperate in their hunt for a new striker, with Dusan Vlahovic out injured. The Old Lady had been keen on a move for Jean Philippe Mateta, but Nottingham Forest look to be in pole position.",
      "The Italian club saw a move for Fenerbahce’s Youssef En-Nesyri collapse and attention has turned to Zirkzee.",
      "However, United are said to have made it clear he won't be leaving the club this month.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly preparing to battle with Barcelona to sign Marcus Rashford in the summer.",
      "According to Football Insider, PSG are ready to jump at the opportunity to bring the forward to Paris if Barcelona hesistate. Luis Enrique's men want to bring him to the club as part of a significant change to their forward line.",
      "Unfortunately, Patrick Dorgu could be ruled out with a hamstring injury after being substituted against Arsenal last weekend",
      "Michael Carrick suggested Dorgu was brought off with cramp, but the 21-year-old appeared to hold his hamstring when he went down, and subsequently limped away from the stadium. When asked how the injury was as he departed, Dorgu responded: \"We'll see.\"",
      "Dorgu's injury is being assessed and United sources have insisted no timescale for his lay-off is clear at this stage, despite reports claiming he could be sidelined for around 10 weeks.",
      "Teamtalk have reported that Premier League duo Crystal Palace and Tottenham are interested in signing Joshua Zirkzee from Man United this window.",
      "The report states that his representatives are hopeful that a deal can be completed before February.",
      "Juventus have added Joshua Zirkzee to their January transfer shortlist, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "The Serie A side are keen to sign a new attacker and recently had a request to sign Randal Kolo Muani on loan rebuffed. Zirkzee has now emerged as a potential alternative.",
      "Cole Palmer would supposedly be open to a move to Manchester United in the summer, according to reports.",
      "The Sun have reported that the 23-year-old would be keen on returning to Manchester, should United show any desire to bring him to Old Trafford. It's said that Palmer, who is contracted until 2033, misses his hometown of Wythenshawe.",
      "Talks between Manchester United and Galatasaray will commence today regarding Manuel Ugarte, according to Turkish journalist Suleyman Rodop.",
      "The Super Lig side want to loan the midfielder until the end of the season, with an option to purchase. “Galatasaray’s critical meeting on the transfer will be tomorrow. Galatasaray and Ugarte (the player’s camp) sit down at the table tomorrow and the expected meeting will take place,\" he said.",
      "\"If Manchester United accepts a purchase option on Ugarte and loans him, they will complete the transfer.\"",
      "Paul Scholes believes Michael Carrick would suit one of Man United's rivals after insisting the club won't make his stay a permanent one at the end of the season.",
      "Despite beating Manchester City and Arsenal, speculation has fuelled suggestions that he could become the permanent head coach. After claiming United will be 'scarred' by their previous experience of giving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the job on the back of an interim spell, Scholes then suggested he could return to Tottenham.",
      "\"It could be like a Tottenham manager from this [for Carrick]. It wouldn't surprise me,\" he said.",
      "TEAMtalk have reported that Man United are stepping up their interest to sign Adam Wharton from Crystal Palace this summer.",
      "The report states that United want to make the 21-year-old their marquee signing over rivals Liverpool. Manchester City and Newcastle United are also keen after holding preliminary discussions with his entourage.",
      "Good morning and welcome to today's live Manchester United transfer blog.",
      "Stay tuned and we will bring you the news from Monday and the latest rumours today.",
      "Manuel Ugarte's representatives will meet with Galatasaray tomorrow, according to the Turkish journalist Suleyman Rodop [via Habersarikirmizi and Sport Witness].",
      "They are reportedly hopeful that United will agree to include an option to make a potential loan move permanent. It is said that only then will Galatasaray sign the midfielder.",
      "TEAMtalk also report that United are increasing their interest in Adam Wharton by making informal approaches to ascertain the player's availability this summer.",
      "Liverpool, Manchester City and Newcastle United are three other clubs said to have held preliminary discussions with the player's representatives. The former are reportedly aggressive suitors.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told United about Wilfred Ndidi's potential availability this winter during discussions with the club about returning as their head coach until the end of this season, according to TEAMtalk.",
      "Despite appointing Michael Carrick instead of the Norwegian, the outlet claims United are making a move for the midfielder. Solskjaer coached Ndidi at Besiktas before being sacked by the Turkish club last summer.",
      "Emiliano Martinez could leave Aston Villa for as little as £30million, according to Pete O'Rourke, after United previously showed interest in the goalkeeper.",
      "O'Rourke said on the latest edition of Football Insider’s Transfer Insider podcast:",
      "It won't be an easy deal to do, due to probably the fee Villa would look for him would be pretty high. He's under contract until 2029 so you'd be looking around £30-40million plus probably for a player like Martinez, who is one of the big earners at Villa Park.",
      "Juventus are considering signing Joshua Zirkzee, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "They are reportedly weighing up their options after a delay in completing a deal to sign Youssef En-Nesyri from Fenerbahce. Jean-Philippe Mateta is said to be another striker on their shortlist should they not be able to sign the Morocco international.",
      "United are not currently proceeding with a move to sign Wilfred Ndidi, according to Fabrizio Romano, despite being offered the player.",
      "Romano said in a YouTube video uploaded over the weekend:",
      "Man United again have been offered the possibility to go for Ndidi, but at the moment still not proceeding.",
      "Cole Palmer would welcome interest from United after becoming unsettled in London, according to The Sun.",
      "A return to City, though, is reportedly something that the Chelsea player would not consider. Palmer is said to miss Wythenshawe, regularly visiting his hometown to spend time with family and friends who still live there.",
      "Crystal Palace are keen on bringing Andoni Iraola to Selhurst Park when Oliver Glasner leaves the club.",
      "Iraola has been linked with the Man United permanent job after impressing at Bournemouth. However, Pete O'Rourke has claimed that Palace are set to rival United for his signature in the summer.",
      "Former scout Mick Brown has revealed that West Ham are keen on signing Harry Maguire.",
      "Speaking to GiveMeSport, he said: “West Ham won’t be the only interested club because there are a few in the Premier League who could do with a player like that, but like I say, they’ve wanted him for years.",
      "“They’ll be keeping an eye on what happens with his contract at Man United and if he’s going to be available, yeah, I think it would be a good move.”",
      "Manchester United will have to break the bank to keep Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford this summer.",
      "The Portuguese midfielder has become disillusioned with how the club is run and the managerial changes. He came close to leaving United last summer, but rejected the chance to join the Saudi Pro League.",
      "United will stand a better chance of keeping Fernandes if they can offer him Champions League football. But club chiefs will still have to offer Fernandes a deal in the region of £400,000-a-week, making him the highest-paid player.",
      "This would be a significant increase on his current contract, which runs until 2027 and has the option of a 12-month extension.",
      "Man United have reportedly revived their interest in striker Vitor Roque. Radip Tupi (via Sport Witness) have claimed United want to sign him after he impressed in his first season in Brazil.",
      "Roque moved back to Palmeiras after a difficult spell with Barcelona. He scored 20 goals in 59 games last season. A January move is unlikely with the Brazilian side keen on retaining him until the summer.",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed Sir Jim Ratcliffe was delighted after Manchester United’s win over Arsenal. Carrick was summoned for talks with Ratcliffe in the Emirates Stadium tunnel after the Reds moved into the top four with a 3-2 victory over the Gunners.",
      "Asked what was said, he said: “No, not much as you would expect, I think. There’s a lot of happy bodies around the camp today and he’s delighted as well. So it was nice to see him.”"

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane made his feelings clear on Michael Carrick(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The change in United's outlook this season has been positive since Carrick took the reins, with his temporary time in charge due to end in the summer. Two wins against City and league leaders Arsenal have had some people calling for Carrick to be in the hat when it's time for the board to pick a new permanent head coach.",
      "\"I still think they need a bigger and better manager. But he's got the opportunity - what a chance it is for him, and do you know what, he's taking it so fair play to him.\"",
      "Some fans are much more open to the possibility. Reader Woz Rokka says: \"Mr Keane is sniping at Michael Carrick, why? Because he wasn't very good in his stints in management, was he? The coaching team are obviously doing things that are working with this team, that clearly wasn't happening under Ruben Amorim, beyond the odd win against Liverpool.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"If he continues to provide this team with the self esteem that is showing in these performances, then I would have him and his team in a heartbeat. His dignity and calmness is refreshing, and the results thus far are a breath of fresh air. If he goes on to get a tune out of Sesko, as with Cunha, then he is the right man for the job! We will see in the coming months, but a very good start, I'd say!\"",
      "Commenter Jungle Jerry writes: \"Carrick and his team have done well in beating the top 2 in the EPL. The next few games will be very different, against teams in the middle of the table. If they can still play well and beat these teams convincingly, United will have a chance in playing consistently and finishing the season in the top 4.",
      "\"Still early days but it certainly is exciting! I don't normally disagree with Keane but if Carrick and co. can bring this team into a top 4 finish, I wouldn't mind having them as the permanent coaches!\"",
      "Anhewitt66 says: \"I struggle to understand how Keane can consistently say it’s all about results and winning matches, but then contradict himself by saying if Carrick wins every game he still wouldn’t give him the job permanently?",
      "\"This talk of so-called bigger managers is also erroneous. Mourinho and Van Gaal were big time experienced managers but it didn’t work out. Just because it didn’t work with Ole doesn’t mean Carrick shouldn’t be given the job permanently if he is getting results.",

      "\"United have been crying out for someone who is steeped in the culture and DNA of the club, as a player who understands what MUFC is all about, and combines this with being a good coach of players because they have played at the highest level for the club. It is a shame that Keane, Neville and mates don’t want to put themselves up for consideration? Is it bottle or do they know it’s easier to sit on the sidelines, and pick up money for carping and criticising others who show some guts and have a go!\"",
      "Rick23 writes: \"Well deserved but unexpected win, reminds me of the start under Solskjaer. If Carrick can claim a CL spot then he has to be a serious contender for the manager job, despite what Neville and Keane are saying. Carrick and his team of coaches have brought a togetherness and purpose amongst the players that Amorim could not achieve. Equally the players respond to him which is often overlooked as a contributory factor to success on the pitch.\"",
      "FIM is more cautious: \"Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's 2 massive games, but it is only 2 games and Carrick needs to prove he can play in different ways when we're struggling to grind out a result.\"",
      "Jargonman adds: \"We have previous: Ole played counter attack after he took over and reaped the rewards. Di Matteo led Chelsea to a Champions League. In both cases, neither manager could build a team capable of challenging and competing over the long term. Too many fans are getting away with short term results. Tuchel is the obvious candidate if he is available after the World Cup.\"",

      "United secured a dramatic win against Arsenal.(Image: Steven Railston)",
      "Martin Odegaard emerged to speak to a handful of Arsenal correspondents after his side's defeat. The general line of questioning was about whether the Gunners would bottle the Premier League title again.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe appeared from a lift shortly after Odegaard had spoken. The United co-owner was beaming as he walked into the dressing room area alongside Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox.",
      "Ratcliffe spoke to Michael Carrick, and then he disappeared back up the lift with the Ineos delegation. When he emerged again to leave the stadium, he was asked if he could speak to reporters. \"No, no, no,\" he said before adding, \"just get the smile\" and gesturing that his lips were sealed.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The British billionaire was asked whether he was happy with the result, and he responded: \"Very, yeah.\" Lisandro Martinez was walking a few yards behind Ratcliffe, and was given a warm embrace by Josh Thompson, an Ineos staffer who has worked at United since their investment into the club.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro strolled through together. A Portuguese-speaking journalist pleaded with the pair to speak, and Fernandes explained why they had declined to do so in his mother tongue.",
      "Patrick Dorgu scored a stunning goal to fire United into a 2-1 lead at the Emirates. He came off in discomfort with nine minutes remaining, and Michael Carrick said in his press conference that Dorgu had suffered from cramp, but the in-form Denmark international left the stadium with a limp.",
      "When Dorgu was asked how his injury was, he said: \"We'll see.\" The 21-year-old's confidence is flowing after an impressive few weeks in a United shirt, and fans will be hoping he was substituted due to cramp, as Carrick suggested, not because he'd picked up a knock.",
      "Dorgu scored a screamer.(Image: 2026 Marc Atkins)",
      "Jonathan Woodgate chatted to a reporter who he recognised from his Real Madrid days, while Steve Holland took a minute to pause and check his phone before getting on the team bus.",
      "A few minutes earlier, Arsenal defender Ben White had left the Emirates. White has not played for the Three Lions since his withdrawal from the England squad at the 2022 Qatar World Cup, when Holland reportedly said that White, who does not watch football, wasn't interested enough in the game.",
      "Gareth Southgate insisted there had never been an issue, and White's withdrawal from the England squad was put down to \"personal reasons.\" It would have been interesting if their exits from the Emirates had coincided, though. It feels most likely that there would have been no acknowledgement.",
      "Holland lives and breathes football. He arrived at Carrington with bags of experience, and wins against Manchester City and Arsenal confirm he was a shrewd addition to Carrick's backroom staff.",
      "United's communications department has undergone a recent change, leaving the head of football communications overstretched on matchdays over the last month. A new staff member is set to arrive, but the head of football communications has essentially been left to deal with the media on their own.",
      "They were pushed for time to bring a player out to Manchester-correspondents in the mixed zone, to accompany players doing interviews with rights holders, and Michael Carrick at the press conference, but there is a 'proper' mixed zone at the Emirates, which means players must walk past journalists to leave.",
      "That means there is a chance a player will stop. Senne Lammens was happy to oblige, and he spoke for three minutes, reacting to the result and discussing the impact of Carrick so far.",
      "Lammens also took time to chat after the win at Anfield in October. He is mature beyond his years and speaks well. \"It's something I really look forward to - these big away games,\" he smiled.",
      "There was no comment from Gunnersaurus Rex, Arsenal's mascot, when asked whether he could front up about his team's performance. It's starting to feel like Arsenal last won the title when dinosaurs roamed the land.",
      "Gunnersaurus Rex was not in the mood to speak.(Image: Steven Railston)",
      "A disagreement erupted between two Arsenal fans beside the press box shortly after Dorgu's goal. The club's stewards were called to the incident, and the pair were prevented from exchanging blows.",
      "The pair began to argue again when Matheus Cunha scored the match-winner. There were further signs of discontent after the final whistle when fans huddled outside the stadium to record reaction for AFTV.",
      "AFTV is a well-known, fan-led Arsenal YouTube channel. The channel's popularity soared during the final years of Arsene Wenger's tenure, with personalities giving unfiltered - and often exaggerated - opinions.",
      "The Gunners were heavy favourites to win, but United caused an upset. The meltdown in the stands and outside the ground showed how much the defeat hurt their supporters.",
      "Arsenal fans held an inquest well after the final whistle.",
      "There were chants of \"he's Carrick, you know, you'll never believe he's not Scholes,\" when arriving at London King's Cross to begin the return journey to Manchester.",
      "United returned to Carrington by coach, and the four-hour drive up the M6 should have gone quickly thanks to the result. Amad passed the time by tweeting an Arsenal fan from his official X account. \"Your only hope are corners, be humble KID,\" he wrote alongside laughing faces.",
      "However, Carrick will not get carried away and he was back at Carrington on Monday, despite the players having been given a day off. The coaching staff's attention has already turned to Fulham this weekend.",

      "Meite, 18, has rapidly become one of Europe's most wanted talents after his emergence in Ligue 1. The striker has scored three goals in 19 appearances in all competitions this season after previously bagging 14 in 32 games at youth level.",
      "French outlet Quest-France have reported that United have registered an interest in the teenager. It comes after Foot Mercato suggested that United are preparing to ambush Al-Hilal's move to sign the France Under-21 international.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "However, the report from France claims United's interest is 'notable' and that a move could be triggered before the January window slams shut. However, it's understood that an exit will only be sanctioned if an offer of £26m comes in.",
      "Mohamed Meite (No.39) has scored three Ligue 1 goals for Rennes this season",
      "United are well stocked in attack after their summer outlay under Ruben Amorim. Over £200m was spent to bring in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, with the former pair hitting the ground running.",
      "Both players scored in Sunday's 3-2 win over Arsenal to make it two wins from two for Michael Carrick. Cunha has scored five Premier League goals since his move from Wolves, while Mbeumo has netted nine goals and is United's top scorer in the league.",
      "Sesko has scored four goals himself, with his first two coming in quick succession earlier this season and the other two coming in the 2-2 draw against Burnley earlier this month. The 22-year-old has adapted well to English football, but Carrick has preferred Mbeumo in his first two games.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have been key in Manchester United's performance this season(Image: PA)",
      "The other attacker in the United squad is Joshua Zirkzee. The Netherlands international seemed destined for a winter exit after struggling for game time under Amorim, but a move to Roma collapsed after the Portuguese was axed.",
      "Juventus, Aston Villa and Tottenham have all been mentioned as potential suitors in the final week of the January transfer window. However, an exit is only likely if United bring in another forward.",
      "Meite is the first centre-forward to be linked with a move to Old Trafford since Jean-Philippe Mateta. The Crystal Palace forward has requested to leave the club this window, with Nottingham Forest and Juventus pursuing a move.",
      "In the summer, Mateta was one of the strikers said to be on United's agenda before Sesko was brought in. Antoine Semenyo, Lassine Sinayoko and Dusan Vlahovic have also been mentioned in the past as potential targets.",
      "United aren't expected to do any major business this month, with the focus on bolstering their midfield in the summer for next season.",

      "He has now taken over at head coach until the end of the season, with his first two games in charge bringing back the feel good factor at the club. A 2-0 win against neighbours Manchester City was followed by a 3-2 away victory over table-toppers Arsenal on Sunday.",

      "The 23-year-old, who came through Manchester City's youth system and is now a key figure at Chelsea, grew up supporting the Red Devils. Across his opening two campaigns at Stamford Bridge, Palmer emerged as one of the Premier League's top players, netting 43 times and registering 29 assists over 97 outings.",
      "However, fitness issues have hampered his progress this season, limiting the England star to just 13 appearances. According to The Sun, Palmer could be receptive to a switch to United as he's reportedly unhappy living in the capital, although a move back to City would be off the table.",
      "Since arriving at Chelsea, the attacking midfielder hasn't hidden his allegiance to the club he idolised growing up. After netting a hat-trick against United at Stamford Bridge in April 2024, Palmer was put on the spot about his boyhood loyalties following the 4-3 victory.",

      "Manchester United celebrate Matheus Cunha's goal against Arsenal",
      "Manchester United continued their dream start under Michael Carrick as they secured back-to-back wins against the Premier League's top two with a famous victory at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "It felt like United had weathered the early storm from Arsenal when the hosts took the lead. It was a sloppy goal to concede and Lisandro Martinez got the final touch as he battled Jurrien Timber in his six-yard box.",
      "But United's response was excellent and they capitalised on an Arsenal defensive blunder to level. Martin Zubimendi's pass handed the chance to Bryan Mbeumo and he rounded David Raya to score.",
      "Carrick's side then took the lead with a stunning goal early in the second half. Dorgu teed the chance up for himself with some clever control and unleashed a stunning volley that hit the bar and went in. Mikel Merino looked like he had secured a draw for Arsenal only for Matheus Cunha to score almost immediately.",
      "Here's the MEN player ratings.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Senne Lammens: Good saves from Zubimendi and Saka and mostly dealt well with the aerial bombardment. Crowded out for the equaliser. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Dealt well with Trossard and looks a little more comfortable at right-back. The kind of solid and unfussy game he has needed. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Surely worth a new contract if this form continues. Looked the best centre-back on the pitch, which really is saying something. 9",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Should have been stronger against Timber for Arsenal's opening goal. One good block on Rice but Gyokeres troubled him. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended really well against Saka and stayed aware throughout. Arsenal used clever moment down that flank but Shaw was never exposed. 8",
      "Casemiro: Big contribution in his own box from set-pieces and used the ball well. Another reminder that he can still cut it at the highest level. 7",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Felt that United got a foothold in the game when they got the ball to Mainoo more often. Growing in confidence under Carrick and got the late assist. 8",
      "Amad: Took in-swinging corners and got his deliveries spot on. One poor choice on the break in the first half but kept at it. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Curious game. Sloppy with a couple of passes but also had moments where he looked really dangerous and led well when in front. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Weak defensive header in the build-up to the first goal but boy did he make amends. An incredible goal to put United ahead and maintain his own momentum. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Now scored against Liverpool, City and Arsenal. Took his goal really well and was a threat with his movement and clever runs. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Took up some good positions and again looked bright off the bench. Brilliant, brilliant goal. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Little time to make an impact. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Late sub. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Yoro, Heaven, Malacia, Ugarte, Mount",

      "Matheus Cunha celebrates scoring for Manchester United at Arsenal",
      "Michael Carrick stood motionless on the Emirates touchline. Hands behind his smart black jacket, dressed to kill like a Manchester United manager should be. Inside, his stomach must have been churning.",
      "He raised his left arm to try to wave his team forward, but his right arm never moved. He looked like the calmest man inside a stadium that had long since lost its head.",
      "A couple of minutes earlier, Casemiro had grabbed the back of Matheus Cunha's shirt and slammed him into the turf in sheer delight. That wasn't even to celebrate the forward's stunning goal, but to mark him winning a free-kick from an Arsenal corner. The emotions were everywhere, from a United side finding its mojo again to an Arsenal team that just can't take control of this title race.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Everywhere apart from the away technical area, that is. United's coaches poured out to appeal for a late free-kick as they defended another Arsenal cross. The unflappable Carrick barely flinched.",
      "When the full-time whistle blew, Carrick clenched his left fist and twice subtly punched the air next to him. There was a low-key embrace with his staff and a handshake with Mikel Arteta. For the 44-year-old Carrick, this is just what Manchester United do.",
      "As auditions go, this couldn't have got off to a better start. Carrick has guided United to wins against the Premier League's top two when a month ago they had looked like a team devoid of confidence and lacking enjoyment. This win against Arsenal was the kind of dramatic away-day success the very best United teams produce.",
      "They have had some moments to savour in the FA Cup here in recent years, but they hadn't won a league match at the Emirates since December 2017. That was the day of David de Gea's 14 saves and Jesse Lingard's double in a 3-1 victory under Jose Mourinho.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim had tried and failed to win a league fixture here. Carrick had at least some experience of success. He was among Solskjaer's staff for an FA Cup fourth-round win on a Friday night in January seven years ago.",
      "A lot had changed since then. Arsenal have gradually built to a point where their 22-year title drought could end in the next five months. United have cycled through a succession of failed managers and are back on another short-term appointment in Carrick. Short-term for now, at least.",
      "The feelings of de ja vu are pretty hard to escape right now. Carrick has delivered exactly the kind of uplift Solskjaer brought in December 2018, both in mood and performance. He has to be in the frame to get the job permanently after these victories. Any more of this and it may prove impossible to overlook him.",
      "This was a different kind of win, as well. They started the derby well last weekend and built the confidence that comes from seeing a game plan work on the pitch.",
      "At the Emirates, they began on the back foot. They faced a flurry of early set-pieces and Senne Lammens turned over a header from Martin Zubimendi at point-blank range. Set-pieces had seemed Arsenal's likeliest route to goal, but it felt like United had weathered the storm when they went behind.",
      "Patrick Dorgu failed to deal with Piero Hincapie's cross, Bukayo Saka found a pass to Martin Odegaard and his mis-hit shot was sliced into his own net by Lisandro Martinez. You feared for United at that point, but the response was exceptional before and after half-time.",
      "Bruno Fernandes almost capitalised on a defensive error from William Saliba before Bryan Mbeumo punished Zubimendi. The Spaniard's pass back towards his goal only succeeded in playing in United's false nine and he rounded David Raya before finishing.",
      "Arsenal had been shooting themselves in the foot, but they were powerless to stop the goal that gave United the lead. Dorgu manipulated a bouncing ball into a more promising position and then sent a 20-yard rocket fizzing past Raya, the ball hitting the underside of the bar and bouncing into the roof of the net to give the strike the kind of aesthetic it deserved.",
      "Dorgu's renaissance over the last five weeks has been one of the stories of United's season. He had struggled in the first half here, not only with Arsenal's goal but against Saka, who got far more joy against him than he did the excellent Luke Shaw. But Dorgu's future surely belongs further forward if his recent contributions in the final third are anything to go by.",
      "Arsenal piled the pressure on in search of an equaliser and looked to have rescued a point when Mikel Merino bundled a corner over the line, but United again responded almost immediately. Kobbie Mainoo poked a clever pass to Matheus Cunha, who bent a stunning shot from distance into the corner of the net.",
      "As the majority of the Emirates emptied, United's players gathered in front of a delirious away end at full-time. Casemiro handed his shirt to a fan, and Carrick was serenaded several times. By the time Cunha and the immense Harry Maguire finished their TV interviews, it was still full. There was time for one final flurry of fist pumps after a breathtaking victory.",

      "Michael Carrick has supported the academy.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC/Getty)",
      "Wayne Rooney has praised Michael Carrick and his staff for attending Manchester United academy games. Rooney believes that support for the club's youth system had been \"missing\" before Carrick's return.",
      "Carrick attended an Under-21 game at Leigh Sports Village last Tuesday and showed further support for the Under-18s at Old Trafford in the FA Youth Cup. He was joined by his staff and both occasions.",
      "Ruben Amorim once walked over to observe some of an academy match at Carrington, but he did not make the effort to properly watch a youth game during his one-and-a-half-year tenure.",
      "Rooney sat alongside Carrick in the directors' box at Old Trafford to watch the U18s because his son, Kai, made an appearance from the bench. And United's all-time top goalscorer believes it's important to have first-team representation at academy fixtures to show support to youngsters.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Rooney said: \"It is great to see all the coaches taking a big interest in the academy, which is important for that football club. I have a different focus watching my son.",
      "\"Potentially in the next few years, some of those players might get an opportunity for the first team, so it is important they have that interest. t was great to see them all.",
      "\"He [Kai] has upped the age group to play in the Youth Cup. He helped them get the win. It was a proud moment for me. Even on Saturday, they were all [first-team staff] at the Under-16 game as well before they travelled to London [to face Arsenal]. It has been missing. I have been quite vocal on this.",
      "\"It has been missing in the last few years. It is great to see that coming back into the club. When we had a Sunday game, after training, we used to finish training and go and watch the academy games.",
      "\"That was the norm. That is what I have known at Manchester United. With my two lads in the academy, I haven’t seen that. It was a bit disappointing. The lift it gives to the players, and the players’ parents, seeing the first team manager there. That is how the club should be run.\"",
      "Amorim's lack of support for the academy did not go unnoticed, and fans questioned his faith in young players. Toward the end of Amorim's tenure, he made headlines when he suggested Harry Amass was \"struggling\" on loan in the Championship and pointed to Chido Obi not starting every U21 game.",
      "When asked whether Kobbie Mainoo could change his manager's mind and earn a starting role, Amorim, without any prompting, said: \"[Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in U21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager.\"",
      "Amorim also mentioned Toby Collyer in the press conference, saying: \"He’s from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich, he’s not playing. He played for Manchester United.\"",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates after Manchester United's win over Arsenal(Image: (Marc Atkins/Getty Images))",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed Sir Jim Ratcliffe was delighted after Manchester United’s win over Arsenal. Carrick was summoned for talks with Ratcliffe in the Emirates Stadium tunnel after the Reds moved into the top four with a 3-2 victory over the Gunners.",
      "Mikel Arteta’s side took the lead just before the half-hour mark when Lisandro Martinez put the ball through his own net, but Bryan Mbeumo capitalised on a horror backpass by Martin Zubimendi to draw his side level before the break.",
      "Patrick Dorgu then fired United ahead, but Mikel Merino looked to have rescued a valuable point for the Gunners when he bundled the ball home from close-range.",
      "But Matheus Cunha had other ideas, as his stunner three minutes from time secured his side all three points. Following the game, Carrick held talks with Ratcliffe, but when put on the spot about what was discussed, he gave very little away except revealing his boss was a very happy man.",
      "“No, not much as you would expect, I think,” he told Viaplay. “There’s a lot of happy bodies around the camp today and he’s delighted as well. So it was nice to see him.”",
      "Peter Schmeichel then put the United boss on the spot by asking him if he had asked if he could come into his office today, to which a laughing Carrick replied: “No, not yet, Peter. I think it is nice when you can have that feeling with a big win like this, you know, coming away from home.",
      "“Last week was good for different reasons. This one is pretty special. Two good games – it’s about what’s next now and moving forward.”",
      "Reflecting on the win in the capital, Carrick said: \"We understood the start of the game was going to be like that, as much as we tried to turn the momentum in our favour.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "“I think we understood how the game was going to go and the flow of it. I thought we started to take the ball and connections through the pitch, had that composure and a few moments gaining a bit of confidence as well.”",
      "Before he continued: \"We were having a decent spell and seemed to be coming into the game when they scored, which was disappointing. Again, we showed the character to come back and there were stages in the game where you have to defend.",
      "“They make you defend the box really and it's challenging at times, but I thought we had enough in the game to keep believing in the confidence and I always fancied us to score.",
      "“The goals were fantastic goals, some of the football was good and we looked dangerous at certain times. There’s other times you have to defend. It was a performance with a bit of everything.”",

      "Chido Obi scored against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The definition of an embarrassment of riches: more options or resources than one knows what to do with. Darren Fletcher had that when Manchester United played in the FA Youth Cup on Friday night.",
      "It almost felt unfair for JJ Gabriel and Chido Obi to start together against Derby County. They are both special talents who can hold their own against senior professionals, never mind fellow teenagers.",
      "Kai Rooney was on the bench. Wayne Rooney's son is that prolific in front of goal that he scored 56 goals in one season when he was 11. His father was in the stands, sitting alongside Michael Carrick, to watch.",
      "Carrick attended to show further support for the academy after watching the Under-21s in action on Tuesday. Carrick spoke about the importance of the Youth Cup and said that he was \"excited\" to attend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Steve Holland and Jonny Evans were also spotted in the directors' box. Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is understood to have welcomed the presence of the first-team staff at youth games again. Ruben Amorim did not show a similar interest during his one-and-a-half tenure in Manchester.",
      "Rooney tried to avoid attention when he arrived at Old Trafford, but a hood did not succeed in disguising his identity from a few excited supporters outside the ground, who stopped him for photographs.",
      "It was a big story that Rooney's son was on the bench at Old Trafford, nine years after his final game at the ground. Kai has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right wing. Left-footed, coming in off the right side.\"",
      "The warning signs were there for Derby. Gabriel danced down the left side - his balance is impressive - and played a delightful cross into the box. The 16-year-old was soon down that flank again, cutting inside and getting a shot away, only to be denied by Derby goalkeeper Cristiano Dzialuk.",
      "Gabriel looked dangerous from the start.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "Obi didn't want his younger peer to steal the show and attempted a shot of his own from the edge of the box. A few minutes later, he was denied by the outstretched legs of Dzialuk.",
      "The striker made seven Premier League appearances last season and starred during the post-season tour, but he's exclusively played in academy fixtures because coaches felt he still needs to develop.",
      "It's bound to have been difficult for Obi to drop down after getting a taste of playing in front of a full-capacity Old Trafford, however, anyone who has watched him play for the U21s this season will agree with the decision to move him down, as he still has parts of his game to improve.",
      "Obi's final ball, decision-making and work rate out of possession could be better. Nonetheless, he is a lethal striker at youth level, particularly at U18 level. Obi has rarely played U18 football since his arrival, but United want to win the Youth Cup and his inclusion in the team was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "Fletcher has returned to manage the U18s after briefly serving as caretaker. The 41-year-old was offered a role in Carrick's backroom staff, but felt it was the best choice for his career to return to the U18s.",
      "Fletcher was just as enthusiastic as he was in games against Burnley in the Premier League and Brighton in the FA Cup, shouting instructions to Gabriel and reminding Bendito Mantato of his defensive duties. \"Bendi, come on!\" Fletcher screamed when Derby made a promising counter-attack.",
      "Mantato had a great game against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The word before the game was that Derby needed to be respected and that proved to be the case. Despite the talent on the pitch for United, the away side looked capable of landing a blow.",
      "United goalkeeper Cameron Bryne-Hughes became busier as the match progressed. Fletcher grew increasingly agitated on the touchline. The game wasn't going according to the script, which was perfectly summed up by Gabriel and Obi getting in each other's way around Derby's box.",
      "There was audible anticipation in the stands when Gabriel was sent over the top with 10 minutes remaining, but Derby captain Rio Canoville recovered brilliantly to thwart the danger. Then Mantato, the standout performer in a red shirt, missed a huge chance with seconds of normal time remaining.",
      "Fletcher may have said to continue to 'huff and puff and blow their house down' when he prepared his team for extra-time. James Overy and Kai Rooney were introduced from the bench. Overy had an immediate impact by playing a cross into the box that led to the dreadlock being broken in the 101st minute.",
      "A demoralised Derby conceded again two minutes later, their resolve finally giving way. Obi scored the goal he'd been desperate for, and celebrated with a knee slide in front of the 2,000 fans.",
      "There were chants of 'Rooney, Rooney' when Kai Rooney was brought on from the bench. Derby set up a nervy end to the game by scoring to make it 2-1 late in extra-time, but it was ultimately United's strength in depth, their embarrassment of riches, that proved to be the difference on the night.",

      "Solskjaer and Carrick contended for the interim job this season.(Image: 2021 Alex Livesey - Danehouse)",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed that he has spoken to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since beating him to the Manchester United interim job. Carrick, Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy were considered to take charge of United for the remainder of the campaign, but Carrick landed the role.",
      "United sources described Carrick as 'impressive' throughout the interview process, and he made a dream start to his interim role by overseeing a stunning victory against Manchester City last weekend.",
      "Solskjaer has been out of work since being sacked by Besiktas in August. The Norwegian was responsible for Besiktas crashing out of Europe and was axed after just seven months in charge.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick got a first taste of coaching as part of Jose Mourinho's backroom staff and he was retained when Solskjaer took over. Carrick has remained in touch with Solskjaer since working with him during that spell.",
      "When asked whether he'd spoken to Solskjaer, Carrick said: \"Yeah, I spoke to him. I'm close, we've been through a lot together, so he's been fully supportive and as you'd expect. He's some man and I respect him an awful lot. He wished us all the best and he was happy that we got the right result.\"",
      "Discussing whether he would pick Solskjaer's brains, he responded: \"I think friendships, you have conversations, I've got a lot of friends in places that I can kind of pick on if I need to be. I'm not one who bothers a lot of people, to be honest. But he's certainly there if ever I need him.\"",
      "Carrick served as United caretaker after Solskjaer was sacked in November 2021. He left the position with an undefeated record, which included a 3-2 victory against Arsenal, but he does not believe that previous encounter against Mikel Arteta is relevant ahead of this weekend's clash against the Gunners.",
      "Carrick after beating Arsenal in November 2021.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "\"I'll be honest with you, I think the confidence I'm taking going into the game is what we've seen since I've been here between me and my staff in terms of the game itself, training, how the boys have gone about it. Games from three or four years ago. It's done. It's in the past,\" he said.",
      "\"So as much as the experience kind of helps you in certain moments, I think it's a totally different game on Sunday and two teams going into it, looking forward to it in good shape.\"",
      "Speaking about United's game plan at the Emirates on Sunday, Carrick said: \"I think it's just playing to what we feel the game needs, really.",
      "\"It's never the same. Even if you come in half time and you've had a good performance for 45 minutes, I'm never one that likes to say same again because it's never, ever the same again. You've got to build on it. So it won't be kind of copy and paste.",
      "\"I think there's new elements that need to come into it. We need to be ready, we need to be at our best. And if we are our best and we're there, we feel we've got a good chance.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",

      "Chelsea will probably look at Cole Palmer’s personal PPG in an injury-hit season and think it is worth cashing in on interest from Man Utd while they can.",
      "Palmer is ‘open’ to the move, even if it remains a difficult one for Man Utd to pull off for a variety of reasons.",
      "But the mere fact he has the worst personal PPG of any player at Chelsea this season means it is probably being considered in the halls at Stamford Bridge.",
      "Here is every Premier League club’s worst player of the 2025/26 season so far based on their personal PPG, with a minimum of eight appearances required for inclusion.",
      "",
      "Perhaps those dissenting, “utter disgrace” Arsenal supporters were right all along. When they signed that petition against his signing in their droves, they likely sensed that after 23 games, Noni Madueke would have a PPG of just 1.79 for the league leaders.",
      "The England forward is a ‘nothing player’ with not a single Premier League goal in over a year. And it doesn’t reflect phenomenally on Arsenal’s summer transfer business that Eberechi Eze (1.88) is next.",
      "",
      "The brilliance of Unai Emery, the resurgence of Emi Buendia, the individualism of Morgan Rogers, the majesty of Boubacar Kamara, the fun of shooting from outside the box and the Marco Bizot of Marco Bizot have all been offered as explanations behind this absurd Aston Villa season.",
      "But the key factor has been overlooked. Tyrone Mings started each of the club’s first five winless games of the campaign, not missing a single minute until he went off injured in the 32nd minute at 1-0 down to Fulham. Villa would win that game 3-1 and jump-start their season without him.",
      "Mings (1.13) has played twice since, losing 2-0 on his return at Liverpool and coming back from injury again to finally taste victory against Newcastle at St James’ Park.",
      "",
      "It feels quite harsh to tar Eli Junior Kroupi (1.17) with any sort of negative brush. The 19-year-old has scored seven sodding goals in his debut Premier League season. But he was really quite present in that patented Andoni Iraola 11-game winless run, with Bournemouth actually unbeaten in the five matches he has missed.",
      "",
      "While Dango Ouattara (1.18) was on AFCON duty with Burkina Faso, Brentford won four games and drew one. With Dango unchained upon his return, the Bees have been beaten by Chelsea and Nottingham Forest.",
      "",
      "“We all know his big potential and he can really change the game for us. He’s still a young player,” said grizzled veteran Fabian Hurzeler, “and he’s still in a phase where he needs to develop and we try to help him.",
      "“He’s definitely pushing to start by performance, that’s for sure,” the Brighton manager added of Charalampos Kostoulas (1.08), who was then aided in his development by having to watch James Milner introduced before him in the late stages of a defeat to Fulham.",
      "The Greek teenager has racked up an impressive 183 minutes across 13 appearances, scoring twice. But Kostoulas suffers because he only gets chucked on in the dying minutes when Danny Welbeck eventually starts to disintegrate.",
      "",
      "Being injured for the August victory against Sunderland, then an unused substitute in both October wins over Leeds and Wolves, really does reflect unfortunately on £20m striker Armando Broja (0.29).",
      "The poor fella last played in a Premier League win so long ago that Abdoulaye Doucoure scored the winning goal against Nuno Espirito Santo’s Nottingham Forest.",
      "",
      "It puts a rather different sheen on the entire “transfer request” situation to consider that Chelsea pick up a single point on average whenever Cole Palmer has played this season.",
      "Palmer has featured in just two Premier League wins in 2025/26 – and scored in both – with the Blues proving they are actually just fine without the player many considered to be their irreplaceable talisman.",
      "It is definitely possible to envisage BlueCo cashing in, even if it would be the final straw for many Chelsea supporters.",
      "",
      "The oldest, most experienced and indeed most expensive of the “kids” Oliver Glasner hurled under the bus before calling what feels painfully like a temporary ceasefire between the outgoing manager and his paymasters, Christantus Uche (0.45) might point out that his longest Premier League appearance of 11 lasted just 24 minutes – and resulted in a win.",
      "",
      "It has been a difficult first year at Everton for Tyler Dibling (1), whose £42m move from Southampton has thus far heralded just four Premier League starts.",
      "Even when David Moyes had his attacking options limited by injuries and AFCON, Dibling struggled to establish himself as a reliable squad member. The opportunities have increased somewhat, but the wait for a goal or assist goes on.",
      "",
      "Marco Silva has already delightfully formally confirmed that Adama Traore “is likely to leave our football club, yes”. And his 1.2 PPG will be Nuno and West Ham’s problem then.",
      "",
      "When Daniel James (0.7) last kicked a ball for Leeds, they were 2-0 down at Manchester City and Daniel Farke was headed for the exit.",
      "Leeds staged a valiant but ultimately unsuccessful comeback at the Etihad once James was substituted at half time, with a record of P10 W3 D6 L1 while he has been sidelined through injury.",
      "It does not feel like there will be a natural place for him upon his return. It depends what the Premier League signing of the season says.",
      "",
      "That first appearance of the season made promises it could not keep for Rio Ngumoha, whose late heroics against Newcastle seemed to occur on an alternate and entirely nonsensical timeline.",
      "The teenager has played in just one other Premier League win this season: against Burnley three weeks later. The minutes he has been drip-fed by Arne Slot have tried and summarily failed to recapture that initial substitute cameo magic for a player averaging a single point per game.",
      "",
      "The holder of the longest ever unbeaten run in club football for any player, Rodri (1.45) has become a bad luck charm for Manchester City.",
      "After finally overcoming some quite severe knee-knack it was assumed that the former Ballon d’Or winner alone could address a great many of the problems Pep Guardiola encountered at the Etihad last season.",
      "Quite understandably, it has been the opposite for a player taking tentative first steps back into a crucial role. Rodri’s only wins when starting this season have come against Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United, Napoli, Exeter and Wolves.",
      "",
      "The secret to Michael Carrick’s emergence as the single greatest manager in football history? There are two steps: succeed Ruben Amorim; and forget Joshua Zirkzee (1.43) exists.",
      "Those wins over Manchester City and Arsenal were delivered with a great many changes to the line-up, but perhaps most pertinently they saw Zirkzee dropped from the matchday squad altogether, the Dutchman having previously never failed to make at least a Premier League bench under Erik ten Hag and Amorim.",
      "",
      "Anthony Elanga having a PPG of 1.29 is mental. Tino Livramento (1.69) ranking second behind Fabian Schar (1.75) is crazy. But this is Trippier (1.09), man.",
      "",
      "There is a reason Nottingham Forest were happy to offload a £26m summer signing who actually showed a decent level with a couple of goals in the Europa League.",
      "Poor Arnaud Kalimuendo (0.22) had more managers (three) than starts (two) for Forest this season, with nine substitute cameos not quite tipping him past the 90-minute mark.",
      "A loan to Eintracht Frankfurt has already unlocked a different side to Kalimuendo, with two goals in four Bundesliga games. And they obviously changed head coaches less than a fortnight after he joined. Forest that.",
      "",
      "The most overrated player at the Stadium of Light, it initially seemed as though £21m had been spent wisely on Simon Adingra (1.07) when the forward assisted a goal on his winning debut and featured in the club’s first three Premier League victories.",
      "But not since the Black Cats ransacked the City Ground and left with three points in September has Adingra played in any win beyond the FA Cup third-round shoot-out against Everton, in which he was substituted before the end.",
      "Sunderland do appear to have belatedly realised that for all the money invested, their wide forward options are a bit naff.",
      "",
      "It has been an absolute 2022 World Cup final of a season for Randal Kolo Muani (0.87), who likely accepted a Spurs loan on the pretence it would afford him enough game time to make the France squad for this year’s iteration of the tournament.",
      "He will not. Kolo Muani’s only goals in 23 appearances this campaign have come against the club who loaned him to Spurs in the first place, with PSG still hammering them 5-3 at the Parc des Princes despite that Kolo Muani double.",
      "Juventus are lurking with the 27-year-old said to be considering his immediate future already.",
      "",
      "There have been reports that West Ham might already be willing to sell Soungoutou Magassa (0.5), having barely platformed the £14.7m midfielder since his arrival.",
      "With that said, his most recent Premier League appearance ended at half time of the 3-0 thrashing by Wolves, since which West Ham have won two of their three games.",
      "Magassa has played in one Premier League win: for 19 minutes against Burnley in November.",
      "",
      "It isn’t difficult to see why Wolves loaned Ki-Jana Hoever (0.00) out as soon as humanly possible. All eight of his appearances for them ended in defeat before Sheffield United took the Dutchman on and promptly lost his first two games, including a shock FA Cup defeat at home to Mansfield.",
      "However, Hoever did finally get the monkey off his back in the victory against Ipswich, the Blades trusting him with just three minutes at the end of a 3-1 win.",
      "Beyond Hoever, Toti Gomes (0.08) is spared inclusion on a technicality. Twelve of his 13 appearances have been in defeats, with the exception coming in the Spurs draw in September, when he came on as a stoppage-time substitute two minutes before Thomas Frank’s side equalised.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea and England star Cole Palmer is ‘ready’ to complete a move to Manchester United in a potential ‘record’ transfer.",
      "Man Utd would need an “astronomical offer” to convince Chelsea to sell Cole Palmer with transfer rumblings “getting louder”, according to reports.",
      "Palace have lost or imminently will lose their best player, their best goalscorer, their captain, their manager, their Europa League place, their hopes, their dreams, their future.",
      "There’s lots more on Arsenal but attention now turns to Liverpool and the unlucky Arne Slot; nothing is going his way.",
      "Over £70m is a small price to pay for a young striker to come off the bench and take three touches against Arsenal.",
      "With a less cowardly format, the manic final matchday of the Champions League could be one of the great days. It isn’t, but it’s not a total lost cause."

      "And how does Ayden Heaven feel now about the Jason Wilcox big sell?",
      "",
      "Mediawatch is old enough to remember the Daily Telegraph stopping just short of their mystery Manchester United ‘source’ describing Jason Wilcox as a very selfless but powerful lover so we are unsurprised to see James Ducker leading the ‘haven’t Manchester United done some excellent transfer business, after all?’ charge.",
      "Wilcox Ducker reports that Wilcox ‘copped a lot of unfair criticism in the wake of Amorim’s sacking’, before noting that ‘last Sunday at the Emirates Stadium, five of the club’s six signings in 2025 played key roles in consigning Premier League leaders Arsenal to their first home defeat of the campaign’.",
      "That’s one hell of a spin on Benjamin Sesko’s three whole touches from the bench, one of which was the ball smashing him in the face from close range.",
      "But This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About so…",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s introduction for Dorgu, with United leading 2-1 and Carrick sending the signal to push for a third goal, was the kind of positive, attack-minded substitution in keeping with the club’s history and not witnessed enough under Amorim.",
      "Which makes him definitely worth £73.7m.",
      "United had also looked at Gyokeres – who had excelled under Amorim at Sporting Lisbon – but they were unsure how much more there was to come from the 27-year-old. By contrast, they felt Sesko – still only 22 – had a higher ceiling and his best years ahead and they eventually beat Newcastle United to sign him for £73.7m from RB Leipzig. As one source put it: “There are some No 9s that big clubs have signed where you’re wondering how much they have left in the tank.”",
      "Yes, thank f*** they didn’t waste money on that past-it Victor Osimhen (27). Dodged a bullet there. Far, far better to sign a 22-year-old to score four Premier League goals and then sit on the bench.",
      "If there was any doubt that Wilcox’s hands are all over this puff piece…",
      "When Wilcox discovered (Ayden) Heaven had met with Eintracht Frankfurt during the winter transfer window, United’s director of football arranged for the teenager to visit Old Trafford for the Europa League tie against Rangers.",
      "He watched the game from the directors’ box, was greeted by Ferguson and met with Amorim but it was Wilcox’s persuasive pitch about the pathway for the young defender that proved decisive in Heaven rejecting more lucrative offers from Premier League rivals to join United.",
      "Thanks to the Athletic, we have insight into that particular conversation; they reported (at length, obvs) last June: ‘Wilcox persuaded Heaven that if he joined United he would settle quickly into an environment well-suited to him and his ambitions, under a coach committed to playing a back three made up of defenders who are brave in possession, at a club with a long history of developing young talent.’",
      "How’s that working out, fellas?",

      "That is literally how transfers work. Bolton Wanderers are also only one transfer away from a sensational Cole Palmer deal.",
      "But it turns out that the Star actually believe that the ‘one transfer’ that is key to Cole Palmer joining Manchester United is not actually Cole Palmer joining Manchester United. Which immediately makes us think that Man Utd might actually be two transfers away.",
      "Should Fernandes opt to extend his tenure, it raises questions about Palmer’s role in the team. Although Palmer displays versatility in taking up wider roles – particularly on the right – his main prowess lies in the central position.",
      "Therefore, securing Palmer would primarily rely on whether Fernandes is enticed by an attractive deal in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Nope. It would rely on Manchester United making a bid, Chelsea accepting that bid, and then Palmer agreeing to move.",
      "As a United fan, Mediawatch suspects that Palmer would quite like to play with their best player of the last five years.",

      "Manchester United are expected to place Everton’s dazzling winger Iliman Ndiaye on their transfer shortlist for the summer, though it could take a mammoth fee to lure him from Merseyside and with the Toffees’ stance on his future coming to light.",
      "The 25-year-old is arguably the Toffees’ best player, and his displays this season, highlighting his brilliant skill, goalscoring and chance-creating ability, have put the Red Devils on alert.",
      "The fact that Ndiaye played a leading role in Senegal’s victorious Africa Cup of Nations campaign has also added to his pedigree.",
      "Sources have told TEAMtalk that Ndiaye has a growing number of admirers within the club, with his style of play and overall profile viewed as a strong fit for what United are looking to add in attack.",
      "United’s recruitment team have enjoyed recent success targeting players from lower Premier League sides, with the additions of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo seen internally as proof of concept, and that approach is set to continue.",
      "But there is still uncertainty over how United will approach the next transfer window due to the current managerial situation. Michael Carrick is in interim charge, but it is not yet clear whether he will remain in the role beyond the end of the season or if the club opts for a higher-profile appointment.",
      "Want more breaking transfer lines from original sources? Add TEAMtalk as a preferred source on Google to your favourites list for news you can trust.",
      "Despite the managerial situation, the internal admiration for Ndiaye is unlikely to go away and he will be a player to keep a close eye on in the summer.",
      "Barring any injury, he will be part of Senegal’s squad for the World Cup and if he performs well there then interest could ramp up further.",
      "A number of other clubs are understood to be tracking Ndiaye, both in the Premier League and abroad. Everton rejected a bid of £40million from Inter Milan last summer, and that is an indication of how highly the Toffees value him, which is no surprise given his contributions.",
      "Ndiaye is contracted until 2029, which puts Everton in a strong negotiating position. They have the backing of their owners, The Friedkin Group, who are prepared to spend in the summer market.",
      "With this in mind, United would need to stump up a big fee to lure Ndiaye away from Everton. No price tag has been set, as Everton insist he is not for sale, so it would take a lot for David Moyes’ side to change their minds.",
      "Everton’s record sale stands at the £75m United spent on Romelu Lukaku in July 2017 and any move would likely need to come close to matching that if they are to get the Toffees to the table.",
      "However, there is an expectation that United will operate with significant financial backing in the summer, particularly if they secure qualification for the Champions League.",
      "Ndiaye is a player to keep a close eye on, but for now, he is focused on playing well and helping Everton push for the European qualification places themselves.",
      "With additional reporting from TEAMtalk correspondent Harry Watkinson.",
      "Meanwhile, Joshua Zirkzee’s future at United still hangs in the balance and my colleague, Graeme Bailey, has revealed that Tottenham and Crystal Palace have both made enquiries about his availability.",
      "Zirkzee hasn’t featured yet under Carrick due to a minor muscle injury and the Red Devils are yet to make a final decision on whether to let him leave, though so far they’ve been reluctant to do so.",
      "In other news, reports suggest that United are growing in confidence in their attempts to sign long-term midfield target Carlos Baleba.",
      "It’s claimed that Brighton have reduced their price tag significantly. They had initially been demanding £100m, but now a summer move could materialise for closer to £75m.",

      "New information has emerged on Bruno Fernandes’ future at Manchester United, including a no-brainer decision and a ‘significant’ demand for a new contract.",
      "Fernandes’ future at Man Utd has been a constant topic throughout this season, with a move to the Saudi Pro League looking likely last summer before he ultimately decided to stay.",
      "At the time, there was a debate over whether selling Fernandes for £100m was a necessary sacrifice to fund Man Utd’s midfield rebuild, with this stance justified by mixed performances from a deeper position in Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation.",
      "And Fernandes recently added fuel to exit speculation, suggesting club chiefs wanted him gone in the summer amid reports that Amorim played a “crucial” role in keeping him.",
      "Fernandes’ bombshell interview and Amorim’s sacking left a 2026 exit looking pretty inevitable for Man Utd’s captain, but there has been another momentum swing over the past week.",
      "READ: Who will be Manchester United manager next season? Carrick at the wheel after stunning start",
      "The 31-year-old appeared to have a strong affinity for Amorim, but his performances have stepped up following the arrival of interim boss Michael Carrick.",
      "Carrick has had a remarkable start in his new role, but several obvious decisions contributed to the statement wins against Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "The change in formation and return of Kobbie Mainoo have helped, while Fernandes is now having a far greater impact on games after returning to an advanced role.",
      "Carrick is going the right way about trying to earn the permanent manager’s job at Man Utd, but there remains a lot of doubt about the club’s future heading into next season.",
      "This includes Fernandes’ situation, with a new report from The Mirror shedding light on his current stance regarding his next move.",
      "Fernandes’ current deal, which includes a one-year extension option, is due to expire in 2027, so Man Utd are running out of time to cash in on the midfielder if they opt to do so.",
      "Alternatively, Man Utd could make a concerted effort to retain Fernandes for the remainder of his career with a new long-term contract.",
      "However, there are hurdles to overcome if that’s to happen, with it noted that Fernandes ‘will wait until the end of this season before deciding his next move’ as he ‘wants to see who the next permanent boss will be’ even though he has been impressed with Carrick’s impact’.",
      "For Fernandes, this is a no-brainer move as he will know more than most how quickly things can change at Man Utd, with the next managerial appointment to have a significant impact on his future and the general trajectory of the club.",
      "And even if Fernandes is satisfied with Man Utd’s next appointment, a new deal is not certain as he has ‘become disillusioned with how the club is run and the managerial changes’, while he has made a ‘significant’ demand.",
      "The report claims:",
      "‘The 31-year-old knows his next deal will be the last major one of his career and that he needs to cash in. He also knows United bosses are desperate for him not to leave.",
      "‘United will stand a better chance of keeping Fernandes if they can offer him Champions League football. But club chiefs will still have to offer Fernandes a deal in the region of £400,000-a-week, making him the highest-paid player.’",
      "Man Utd would need an “astronomical offer” to convince Chelsea to sell Cole Palmer with transfer rumblings “getting louder”, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Man Utd in August gave a false perception of where each club was headed, so I have revisited ten of our conclusions from that game…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes could join Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal in the coming months via a ‘historic offer’.",
      "Chelsea fans won’t like it, but selling Cole Palmer to Man Utd might make sense for Clearlake and co with the England star one of few fit to replace Bruno ...",

This United team on paper is good, let them play what they are good at, quick 1 touch transitions and triangles, and they are a Champions League team.

      "I get that Arsenal are top of the league, but I don’t get the impression that anyone really thinks they’d beat the Man Utd team of ’08 or the Invincibles team, so why this attitude that they should be walking over teams pulling their pants down and scoring 5 of the best against a team that is, while in recovery from shite management at the very least expensively assembled and full of the talent that implies?",
      "That Carrick in 2 games has got us looking like a competent team that resembles the riches it cost to assemble them is more an indication of how much they were underperforming under Amorim and, as Ian Watson points out, playing players in their positions and in a system designed around their qualities rather than trying to force them into your system is not even GSCE level geometry let alone rocket science.",
      "I watched the game with my Arsenal supporting friend and I told him before the game I expected to lose but so long as we play ok and don’t just concede a sloppy goal or lose because players weren’t trying. If we lost because of a wonder goal, like the goal Henry scored against us that was the winner in 2000 then sometimes you just have to say “fair enough” and applaud the quality.",
      "And even if Dorgu never scores another goal that good, it was a great finish. Same with Cunha’s goal. Sometimes, there doesn’t need to be an inquest or an indictment of the coach, sometimes you have to just applaud the football, because that’s why we’re all here right? We don’t only watch and play because we want to win every week but because football is fun and exciting, because we appreciate the skill and the ability required, and we can wish that we had been able to score goals like that in the playground.\nDaniel (no to blind faith in Carrick, yes to a proper recruitment process) Cambridge",
      "",
      "…Nice to see the very measured reaction from the mailbox after another game where Arsenal dropped points. Let’s all calm down please. They are still 4 points ahead.",
      "United needed 2 worldies to win this game. Dorgu will never score a better goal in his career (now watch him score a rabona from the halfway line after beating 6 players next week) and Cunha can probably only do that once in 20 attempts.",
      "I’m a Chelsea fan and trust me, there are few things I want more than for Arsenal to bottle this league title. Unfortunately, I don’t think they won’t. Not because they’re this amazing team, but because I don’t think there’s any team that can catch them.",
      "Aston Villa are blowing super hot this season and the regression monster will catch up with them soon enough. You can’t keep depending on goals from outside the box and all your players finishing better than Lionel Messi for an entire season. Injuries, especially in midfield, will also play their part eventually. They’ll definitely finish in the top 4 though. The gap between them and the rest is quite big when you consider all the congestion in the league table.",
      "City have the best chance but I don’t think they’ll catch Arsenal either. This City team is just not good enough and the league is too strong for them to string their customary 10 straight wins.",
      "I really hope I’m wrong and one of those teams eventually overtake them. That will be the bottling to top all bottlings in history. I’m not holding my breath though.\nAbdulazeez (looks like Linkedin Liam is really a fine ager of men. Listening to his linkedinspeak is a price I’m willing to pay if he can make us good again. Gary O’Neil is doing fine with Strasbourg too. Win-win for all parties involved), Bristol",
      "",
      "As an Arsenal fan, watching the game at the Emirates was tough and the team deserves all the criticism it gets losing to Man U. It’s games like this, that cement my feeling that I don’t believe we will win the league.",
      "But one factor that is hardly being mentioned is that this was Arsenal’s 3rd game in the last 7 days whereas it was Man U’s first (they last played on 17th Jan).The Arsenal players were clearly knackered.",
      "Hopefully Arteta plays the U-21s (and Norgaard) in midweek and this can reset the main players in the team mentally and physically.",
      "Also we should have signed Semenyo to stimulate the attack, I’d been saying this to anyone who’d listen but obviously Arteta didn’t get the message!",
      "Hoping these last few results are the kick up the ass, the team needs to get out of this funk.\nIzzy",
      "",
      "I’ve already read multiple pieces explaining how Arsenal undid themselves after taking the lead against United. That their integrated ‘bottle job’ nature was to blame for the ensuing poor performance and whilst there is doubtless some truth to this it completely ignores the one really good thing Carrick did to manage the game.",
      "United had started very cautiously, staying compact and deep, no real press and very rigid positions. Though it’s understandable why Carrick setup this way it did allow Arsenal that precious field tilt that Arteta craves and United were completely hemmed in.",
      "Against City Carrick had used straight central passes from Martinez into Bruno to help break through but Arteta was ready for those. He had Saliba follow Bruno and get tight when he was set to receive the pass then dispossess him. It worked very well and Bruno was getting frustrated as the midfield was swamped making him completely ineffective.",
      "After Arsenal took the lead Carrick changed United’s tactic immediately, so quickly in fact that it must have been planned, ‘if we concede early we’re going to change to this so be ready’. Bruno and Mbeumo pressed the CBs high, Casemiro and Mainoo stepped up on their midfield, Dalot and Shaw started to jump on the wingers as soon as they received the ball. Caution was replaced with aggression and it unsettled Arsenal, forcing them to play under pressure and make passes across bigger spaces.",
      "United started to win the ball higher up the pitch which not only led to scoring chances but meant they could hold possession and bring the back line higher, robbing Arsenal of their territorial dominance. Having Maguire and Martinez that high was a risk given their relatively sedate pace, especially with Casemiro dropping in between them to create a back three, but Arsenal had virtually no threat behind so it never became an issue.",
      "Another well managed game from Carrick and another win against a historic rival. Same caveats as last week, let’s see where we are in 6-8 weeks before making any proper judgements.\nDave, Manchester",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick took 2 games to deliver back to back Premier League wins.",
      "Ruben Amorim took 11 months, and only did it once in his total 14 months in charge.",

      "In all seriousness, Fulham will be far harder as our tactic of sitting back won’t work there. Long road ahead, and if wenger introduced the 4th place trophy, I’m just hoping that maybe, against all odds, we might get some scissors/shears for a few of our fans. One can only dream…\nNiraj (Man Utd – okay but 4th or even 5th would have me over the moon) London",

      "I know everyone’s far more interested in laughing at Arsenal and Liverpool or celebrating the long awaited return of Man Utd, but I just have to quickly say how brilliant Villa were. Away at a ground we haven’t won at since Dyer and Bowyer inspired a young Jake Paul and shorn of McGinn and Kamara.",
      "Great team performance. Each and every player had an impact. Still, happy for the bulk of the chat to be about anyone and everyone but Villa.\nGary AVFC, Oxford (Not in the race for the top half)",
      "",
      "It might be churlish for me to even suggest to Man Utd than one (or even two) swallow(s) does not a summer make, but wins over City and Arsenal seem to have them hallucinating that the second coming is upon us.",
      "I for one look forward to more ‘routine’ games against opposition they can’t counter attack, and look forward to the continuing melt-down of their fanbase as the gift that keeps on giving (Yorkshire Man U fans, give me strength).",
      "I’m a York City fan but want Arsenal to win the league this year. Why? Because it’s not bloody Groundhog Day, and watching City or Liverpool (or even Chelsea) win most years makes football a bit too routine and kills me a little every time – will I ever see a team like Leicester win the league again? Is the closest we can get to that a team that finished 8th two years in a row and hasn’t won the league in my lifetime? I would be rooting for Villa, but I just can’t love a team that puts that much stock in Emi Martinez.",
      "So for the sake of variety, Arteta, drop Odegaard, play Merino up front and put Eze in there.\nBilly (York are going up ole ole!)",
      "",
      "…Maybe (definitely) it’s the bitter Gooner in me, but I am seriously over hearing how Carrick has transformed Man Utd in 2 games.",
      "Man Utd have been raising themselves for the big games for years (have people *Gary Neville* forgotten the FA Cup 3rd Round last season). Let’s see if he can get that lot up for a scrap against Burnley.",
      "Maybe start the talk about turning a corner then.\nKate",
      "",
      "Back in the mid 90s when I was at school, Leeds had signed an African by the name of Tony Yeboah. In 1995 he scored a number of brilliant goals, including an absolute beauty of a volley against (I think) Liverpool. At school the following week during lunch and later at PE, we all tried to recreate it with varying degrees of ineptitude (pretty sure I didn’t even hit the ball!). This was a continued theme during this period with us kids recreating solo goals and freekicks like they were Baddiel and Skinner doing phoenix from the flames.",
      "Do you know what we didn’t do during these kickabouts? Pass the ball around aimlessly trying to slow the game down and control it. Or some boring robotic passage of play that ends with a cutback and a tap in.",
      "Which was why I was glad to see Arteta getting called out for putting control over attack first. Or Rocastle7 commenting on the slight belittling of Man Utd winning a game of football with a couple of great outside the box goals. F365 were guilty of this during the Ole period, often downplaying a win because of some moment of individual brilliance from Bruno saying the club needed a coach like Pep who would coach patterns of play into the team. But, what was it that made us football fans? Slow, intricate passing triangles or a thunderbolt from a great player?",
      "So, stop worrying about XG, or control or patterns of play and lets go back to enjoying a playing having a go from 30 yards or a great player taking the game by the scruff of the neck to win the game.\nJohn Morgan (feeling old having just found out Tony Yeboah is 60 this year!)"

      "With Arsenal still four points clear at the top of the Premier League, sauntering through the Champions League with a 100% record and on course to reach the Carabao Cup final, we can’t stress enough the importance of clubs at home and abroad doing everything possible to deny them the quadruple. It doesn’t bear thinking about.",
      "With the January window still open, here are 10 transfers which could help thwart the Gunners on their seemingly inexorable path to glory.",
      "",
      "“We are not contenders to be in the top five,” Emery said after defeat to Everton, before falling awkwardly silent when asked why he feels his side cannot compete with the Premier League’s top clubs. He knows that everyone else knows it comes down to a lack of investment in his team, with Aston Villa’s net spend near zero since he arrived at the club in October 2022.",
      "Neither Tammy Abraham nor Jean-Philippe Mateta are going to move the contender dial to any great degree, but Ramos, who’s scored his 43 goals at a rate of one every 112 minutes for Paris Saint-Germain, could make a tangible difference.",
      "",
      "Pep Guardiola insisting he has “a thousand other priorities” ahead of long throws before signing arguably the face of the Premier League-wide campaign to bring it back into fashion would be lovely.",
      "We suspect Guardiola’s interest is more based upon Kayode’s almost unrivalled ability to dribble past opponents from right-back, along with his aerial ability and his addition would bring about the end of the Matheus Nunes experiment, which has gone on for far too long.",
      "But we’re not sure we would enjoy anything more than some pinball in the Arsenal box following a Kayode throw-in leading to a City victory, either in the Premier League in April, or should they meet in the knockout competitions.",
      "",
      "A penny for Xabi Alonso’s thoughts should Real Madrid sign Vitinha after he begged Florentino Perez for a midfield conductor, was denied, then sacked and would be forced to watch the presentation ceremony of the very best midfield conductor in world football rock up at the Bernabeu a couple of weeks later.",
      "We’re essentially suggesting here that Real Madrid have a better chance of winning the Champions League with Vitinha than PSG do, and do indeed sign up to that view given both Los Blancos’ astonishing ability to pull performances out of their proverbials when the tournament really kicks into gear and through what we reckon would be a monumental improvement in their team with the Portuguese star at the base of their midfield.",
      "",
      "The Saudi Pro League side are far more likely to give Arsenal’s coffers a tidy boost in the summer, but we could really do with them sticking a ludicrous figure on the table for Martinelli in January, which Andrea Berta and the Arsenal board believe is too good to turn down, preferably right at the very end, by which stage there’s no time to source a replacement for a guy who’s scored five goals in 305 Champions League minutes this season.",
      "",
      "This isn’t so much about how Alvarez would improve PSG as they’re already pretty well stocked up front and we strongly suspect the loss of Vitinha to Real Madrid will result in a typical and greatly missed implosion for the Ligue 1 giants which will see them dumped out of the Champions League in the not-too-distant future.",
      "What we absolutely cannot have is Arsenal signing someone to replace Viktor Gyokeres, who – bless him – is doing his level best to ensure the Gunners puzzle remains unfinished by being as dog-eared a final piece as possible.",
      "",
      "Michael Carrick made very clear the importance of taking advantage of the increased energy that comes with the arrival of a new manager as part of his Old Trafford revolution. The added motivation bore juicy fruit in the Manchester derby and they carried that momentum to the Emirates. What a bizarre feeling it was for Manchester United to be the lesser of two evils as neutrals across the country celebrated that Matheus Cunha stunner.",
      "A new player bounce to add to the leap courtesy of Carrick wouldn’t go amiss, even if Manchester United are indeed now firmly in the Premier League title race after *checks notes* two wins in two games without spending £100m on Anderson, who presumably no longer prefers a move to Manchester City as DNA will make short shrift of the eight-point gap between the two clubs.",
      "",
      "There are more than a few Chelsea-supporting Robert Sanchez apologists these days, and there has indeed been a significant improvement in his performances this season. But Liam Rosenior toying with the idea of second goalkeeper of 427 on the Chelsea books, Mr Jorgensen, isn’t the greatest of fillips for the Spaniard, nor are the rumours of the Blues reigniting their interest in Maignan, who is said to have reached a verbal but not written agreement with AC Milan over an extension.",

      "Yan Diomande? The 19-year-old, right-footed, 1.8m Ivorian, born in Abidjan, who moved to the US in 2022 and had an unsuccessful trial at Rangers in October 2023? Know him? Sounds like it doesn’t it.",
      "Bayern are keen along with most Premier League giants so he must be pretty good. Doesn’t feel like they particularly need him given Luis Diaz’s 25 goal contributions from the left, but any means of increasing the squad depth arguably Arsenal’s greatest Champions League challengers is a positive, and also means Arsenal themselves – who have been linked – can’t have him.",

      "Arsenal’s reward for finishing first in the Champions League table stands to be a two-legged last-16 tie against one of four teams: Galatasaray (17th), Qarabag (18th), Juventus (15th) or Borussia Dortmund (16th).",
      "We’re manifesting a meeting with Dortmund as – crushingly embarrassing defeat to Thomas Frank’s Tottenham aside – they’re probably our best bet of knocking Arsenal out; they’ve got good recent history in the competition and are currently second in the Bundesliga.",
      "They’ve been linked with Bobb and the 22-year-old feels like a prime candidate for being a hugely talented footballer who doesn’t quite make it at Manchester City, moves elsewhere and becomes a £100m star within two seasons.",

      "If, like Roy Keane, you believe Michael Carrick isn’t a long-term manager for Manchester United, then you’ve got to say who is and somehow prove it. He can’t. You can’t.",
      "Any facts or stats offered as proof are all irrelevant. It’s all been tried before and not worked. The only route they’ve not gone down is to appoint a high-achieving lower-league manager. They probably think too much of themselves to do that, even despite their litany of failures, though there’s nothing to suggest it would be a worse decision than any of the others, so perhaps Andy Woodman at Bromley, top of League Two, is the answer?",
      "It might sound mad but appointing proven multiple title winners didn’t work, did it? Appointing a rising star didn’t either, nor did appointing someone who had been an FA Cup runner-up in 2008/09. People who have won things, people who haven’t; they’ve all been tried in the last 13 years.",
      "The result against Arsenal (read 16 Conclusions here) is no indication of anything really, especially against such a somehow feeble division-leading side, beyond investing badly needed self-belief. Maybe that’s all they need? Roy says they need ‘a bigger, better manager’ but they’ve had plenty of them before. How’s that worked out?",
      "It’s virtually impossible to argue for or against any manager, Carrick or anyone else, because all the precedents have been exhausted. Talking sensibly about it isn’t possible. History mocks you at every turn. There is no logic to be obeyed, no sense to be applied. Guesswork will be dressed up as some sort of pretentious executive problem-solving but that will be the sort of bullsh*t middle-management rubbish adopted to pretend it isn’t just a guess.",
      "So how do they go about deciding? It can’t just be the results. It can’t even just be how the team plays, though both must be in the equation. They need someone who will represent the club well, not be a dogmatic nutter, be able to inspire players and fans and just look like they know what they’re doing. It’s all very nebulous and based on gut feeling as much as facts and stats. Michael has a nice beard; that may be enough. Being a serial winner across Europe wasn’t, so why not judge them by the quality of facial hair?",
      "At no point in the past 13 years has anybody who makes decisions at Old Trafford done anything at all that might suggest that they have the first clue about what to do. The current incumbents may be the most stupid yet, with a series of shudderingly crass decisions.",
      "“He knows the club” has always been one of those football cliches spouted by mind-in-neutral pundits, along with the senseless concept of being a ‘natural’ goalscorer, like it’s somehow innate to some human beings to be able to kick a ball between two sticks.",
      "But a man that fully comprehends the situation he is in – both literally and metaphysically – is probably a greater indicator than anything connected with tactics. Someone they’re all just comfortable with would likely be a relief after previous purveyors of rigid dogmas. Above all, they have to be able to ignore the slurry of bad advice from the owners and their lackeys because they are serial failures that embarrass themselves at every turn in return for a lot of money.",
      "The one advantage they have is that no-one expects anything of them. Having been average to poor for so long, there’s no pressure. And with no European or cup football to play, they have a great advantage over those who do. So in that sense Carrick has a great chance. That said, he could be undermined by Jim Ratcliffe’s unerring ability to make the wrong decision.",
      "But if things continue in the current vein, what arguments could you make against Carrick’s appointment? You can’t recommend anything that hasn’t already been proven not to work. Against Arsenal, they looked much more like the team that was hated so much 20 years ago. It was like seeing someone wake up from a coma.",
      "While there is easy criticism for appointing Carrick, there’s easy criticism of anyone you care to name. There’s no guarantee it’ll work and no proof it won’t. In Carrick’s favour, he’s got six points from six against the top two teams. Yes, he’ll need to prove himself against bottom-third teams, but they don’t need to be in a hurry about this. June will be early enough to decide.",
      "The remainder of the season will be their best illustration of Carrick’s talent or otherwise and they won’t get such a comprehensive trial period with anyone else, but if he continues to be successful, what would the point be in changing?",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s name is used as a warning for nostalgia appointments. But if he ‘fails’ as well as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who finished third and second in his two full seasons, while reaching semi-finals and one final, surely that would be a success, considering the depths to which they have sunk. It would be both deluded and entitled to think anything else.",
      "Chelsea will probably look at Cole Palmer’s personal PPG in an injury-hit season and think it is worth cashing in on interest from Man Utd while they can.",
      "Palace have lost or imminently will lose their best player, their best goalscorer, their captain, their manager, their Europa League place, their hopes, their dreams, their future.",

      "From signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to sacking Thomas Tuchel via re-hiring Frank Lampard and spending over £1bn on players and still not having a squad to mount a title challenge, the rap sheet is long and damning.",
      "The most recent contentious call saw them sack their fourth permanent manager Enzo Maresca, shortly after he led them to two major-ish trophies in a debut season in which he also secured Champions League football, and replace him with a coach of even less renown in Liam Rosenior.",
      "He’s off to a good start. Four wins from five, 10 goals, two clean sheets – not bad at all.",
      "And although we’re as tempted as anyone to mock a manager who claps far too loudly for comfort, is presumably now combing LinkedIn for pearls of motivational wisdom and is the last person you would want to find in the kitchen at a party, we wouldn’t be sticking to our woke lefty agenda if we didn’t hope for the success of a young, black British manager.",
      "But we doubt his appointment had anything to do with affirmative action. Like the vast majority of the decisions made by Todd Boehly/Behdad Eghbali/José E. Feliciano/Mark Walter/Hansjörg Wyss/Jonathan Goldstein/Barbara Charone/Lord Daniel Finkelstein/Paul Winstanley/Laurence Stewart/Joe Shields/Sam Jewell [delete as appropriate] it’s one that appears to have been made with a view to naysayers eventually hailing them as nonconformist geniuses.",
      "Keep academy graduates as they’re the soul of the football club? Nah, sell them for pure profit and use that money to sign other players and flip them for more profit, or indeed – more typically – for a loss.",
      "Sign footballers over the age of 25 for some experience? You’re having a laugh. No experience at all, please. Are the young signings good enough? Don’t know. Might be. Probably won’t be. Doesn’t matter. Ever heard of amortisation?",
      "You could almost feel co-sporting directors Winstanley and Stewart reach near climax when, as Reece James lifted the Club World Cup, critics of their atypical process began to question whether the obsession with signing young players on absurdly long contracts might actually work.",
      "The sh*t-eating we-told-you-so grins on their faces should Rosenior lead Chelsea to genuine, incontestable success after managerial stints at Hull City and Strasbourg makes us almost hope he doesn’t.",
      "Reports suggest Palmer is ‘open’ to a move to Manchester United and ‘welcomes interest’ from the Red Devils because he’s ‘homesick’, but the timing of these rumours raises suspicion, arriving so soon after the change of manager.",
      "Liam Rosenior has had “numerous conversations” with Palmer, which may indeed have been positive as the Blues boss suggests, but the England international wouldn’t be human if at least a part of him didn’t question how on earth the man looking to ease his mind over his future got this job over the world-class managers Chelsea used to attract and insist upon.",
      "He’s played under Mauricio Pochettino, Maresca and now Rosenior at Stamford Bridge. That downward trend means it’s reasonable for him to question which Jupiler Pro League manager will be in charge next year.",
      "If you were to ask Palmer if he would rather have Rosenior in charge or Xabi Alonso, Xavi or other available managers there’s only going to be one answer. He might turn out to be wrong – Rosenior may end up doing a better job than any alternative – but the problem Chelsea have in the short term is in convincing Palmer to stick around long enough to find out whether that’s the case. Rosenior simply doesn’t have the back-catalogue to prove it’s worth trusting in his process.",
      "And although a move to Manchester United may therefore seem like an odd choice as they’re set on an inexorable DNA-enforced path to Michael Carrick’s permanent appointment at the end of the season, Palmer can feel safe in the knowledge that if that doesn’t work then United will look to hire the manager they believe to be the best in class, as was the case with Ruben Amorim, poor decision though that turned out to be,",
      "Chelsea fans would begrudgingly accept Palmer moving to Real Madrid. They’re a bigger fish. But Chelsea have won two Premier Leagues and one Champions League since Manchester United won either of those trophies.

      "The Blues have missed Palmer for a large chunk of the season through injury with the England international playing just 13 times in all competitions.",

      "Bailey explained: “We understand from figures close to the player that while Palmer would ideally like to be based closer to the North West in the long term, given that he is a long-time United fan and has harboured ambitions of playing for them, but he is not pushing to leave Stamford Bridge and remains fully committed to the project under BlueCo.",

      "The Red Devils view Wharton as a key piece in their ongoing midfield rebuild, with sources close to the club indicating that informal approaches have already been made to gauge the player’s availability.",
      "We first revealed way back in October 2024 that United are huge admirers of the Palace midfielder, and he remains top of the club’s shortlist alongside the likes of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson.",
      "Despite United’s strong push for Wharton, competition remains fierce. Manchester City, Liverpool, and Newcastle United have all registered their interest, holding preliminary discussions with Wharton’s representatives.",
      "Liverpool, in particular, are understood to be aggressive suitors, with sources suggesting they have held fresh talks and that Wharton himself is open to a move to Merseyside. Some outlets even claim the Reds are frontrunners, potentially offering a long-term contract to secure his services.",
      "Newcastle’s involvement adds further intrigue, as Eddie Howe’s side seek to bolster their engine room amid ambitions to break into the top four consistently.",

      "The talented deep-lying playmaker, who has impressed since his £18million move from Blackburn Rovers in February 2024, has established himself as one of the Premier League’s most promising young midfielders.",
      "His composure on the ball, tactical intelligence, and ability to dictate tempo have drawn comparisons to top-class operators, have earned him three senior England caps and a place in Thomas Tuchel’s thinking ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",

      "Palace are set to demand a substantial fee – figures in the £65-80million range have been floated – to part with their prized asset, though some sources suggest they could hold out for closer to £100million total package given the bidding war potential.",
      "For United, landing Wharton would represent a statement of intent under their current regime, addressing long-standing deficiencies in central areas. However, with multiple elite clubs circling, negotiations promise to be protracted and costly. Landing a Champions League spot would help them massively as we’re told that, ideally, Wharton wants UCL football.",
      "As the January window nears its end, attention turns to the summer, where Wharton’s next destination could reshape several Premier League midfields.",

      "This could change the plans at Old Trafford, with the addition of a new left-back now described as a ‘priority.’",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",

      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

And even if they won it, Frank’s predecessor was sacked for masking rank domestic failure with European glory.",

Sami Hyypia was the last such case over a decade ago – although even he won a game in December before being axed later that month – so Fabian Hurzeler need not worry about his immediate future. But he might want to survey the summer vacancies; a friendly handshake and parting of the ways at the end of the season seems increasingly likely.",
      "If he does wish to expedite the process then making James Milner his first introduction from the bench at 1-1 in the 81st minute is probably the quickest way, in all fairness.",
      "",

      "There’s lots more on Arsenal but attention now turns to Liverpool and the unlucky Arne Slot; nothing is going his way.",
      "Over £70m is a small price to pay for a young striker to come off the bench and take three touches against Arsenal.",
      "With a less cowardly format, the manic final matchday of the Champions League could be one of the great days. It isn’t, but it’s not a total lost cause.",

      "Monday 26 January 2026 15:39, UK",
      "Gary Neville is \"blown away\" by Manchester United's transformation under the management of Michael Carrick.",
      "United backed up a derby win over Manchester City with a 3-2 success at Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday in Carrick's second game in charge.",
      "Those results have transformed the mood following Ruben Amorim's sacking and Neville is confident United - who are up to fourth in the table - will finish in the Champions League qualifying spots.",
      "\"There are a number of things that have changed, the intensity, the compactness, the aggression of the defending, their willingness to get behind the ball together and be difficult to beat and dig in when you're in difficult moments of the game. And there was more of that [at Arsenal] than there was against City.",
      "\"I thought they played better football against City, but they were always going to have to dig in [at the Emirates Stadium] more. In that first 25 minutes when they didn't have a lot of ball, they didn't really lose too many chances.",
      "\"They controlled the game without the ball. And then they just started to play a little bit.",
      "\"But the big thing for me is that they've got a threat up front. They've got a group of players who are talented up front, who are also getting back and helping their defenders, who are digging in.\"",
      "Neville believes United's system shift away from Amorim's back-three preference to a 4-2-3-1 has boosted the team. He says Carrick has restored the \"magic\" to the team - and they are able to realise their potential to achieve a high finish in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's definitely instilled a simplicity to it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, that I like about it,\" said Neville.",
      "\"It's my favourite system. We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. It's been a huge turn.",
      "\"It's still not a point to get carried away but certainly a point to suggest now that Manchester United have got an unbelievable opportunity, from where they were before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point. It's a remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"And Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's being said to them, and we don't know what's being said to them in that training ground, but they are responding like they weren't before.",
      "\"Why? We'll always speculate, Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking, 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused, as we all are in terms of the flip, but the magic has returned in the last week.",

      "\"But that's why a number of players that commentate on Manchester United have been so angry in this last five or six weeks, because of the likes of Everton, Wolves, West Ham, Bournemouth, Burnley and Leeds, six teams that have been really struggling apart from Leeds maybe, and only five points were picked up in those games again out of the 18.",
      "\"And in a lot of those games where Manchester United had opportunities to go into the top four. We're like, 'go on', and they didn't, and now they've done it because I genuinely believe there is a feeling that they are better than what they've shown.",
      "\"And they've proved it in these last two games, they have really proved that they can get compact, they can stay together, be aggressive in their shape, can spring out of that shape and play good football and counter-attack and hurt teams, and they can score great goals and get bodies in the box.",
      "\"It's been thrilling to watch these last two matches, it really has, and it's a remarkable turnaround.\"",

      "Gordon McQueen died aged 70 in June 2023 after contracting vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Coroner finds heading 'likely' contributed to brain injury behind death of former Scotland, Manchester United and Leeds defender",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 22:08, UK",
      "Heading a football \"likely\" contributed to the brain injury which was a factor in the death of former Scotland defender Gordon McQueen, a coroner has found.",
      "McQueen - who was capped for Scotland 30 times between 1974 and 1981, and played for both Manchester United and Leeds during a 16-year career - died at his home in North Yorkshire in June 2023, aged 70.",
      "The cause of death was pneumonia as he had become frail and bed-bound for months, the inquest in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, heard earlier this month.",
      "That frailty was due to a combination of vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), coroner Jon Heath said.",
      "The coroner gave a narrative conclusion on Monday, finding that McQueen died from pneumonia as a consequence of mixed vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "He said: \"It is likely that repetitive head impacts sustained by heading the ball while playing football contributed to the CTE.\"",
      "McQueen's TV presenter daughter Hayley McQueen was in court to hear the findings.",
      "When giving evidence at his inquest earlier this month, she was asked by her barrister Michael Rawlinson KC if her father had discussed whether anything in his past history was behind his dementia.",
      "She said: \"He said 'heading a football for all those years probably hasn't helped'.\"",
      "McQueen said her dad was relatively injury-free during his career but did suffer some concussions, adding: \"They would just head back out and play.\"",
      "She also recalled how, when she was young, he would come home from training with Manchester United and lie down in a darkened room with a headache.",
      "She described how her father was very healthy and active - both in sport and with his family - during his playing days and after he retired.",
      "But she said the family began to notice changes in his personality after his 60th birthday.",
      "McQueen said her father had always been very sociable and outgoing, but became more withdrawn.",
      "She said that although her father was a central defender, he was well known for scoring goals from set-pieces, usually with his head.",
      "He came to prominence in England following his move to Leeds from St Mirren in 1972, helping the Yorkshire club to league title success in 1973-74 and playing a key role in their run to the European Cup final in 1975.",
      "McQueen then joined Leeds's arch-rivals Manchester United in 1978 and went on to win the FA Cup in 1983.",
      "Injury robbed him of a World Cup appearance in 1978 after he had been included in Scotland's squad having made his senior debut in 1974 against Belgium.",
      "After retiring as a player, McQueen had a brief spell as Airdrie manager and coach at former club St Mirren, and spent five years as coach at Middlesbrough under Bryan Robson until 2001.",
      "The inquest heard how McQueen's family donated his brain, after his death, to Professor Willie Stewart - a consultant neuropathologist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, who has conducted extensive research into brain injury in footballers and rugby players.",
      "Prof Stewart told the inquest he found evidence of CTE - a brain disorder linked to repeated head impacts - and vascular dementia.",
      "Prof Stewart agreed with Mr Rawlinson, for the McQueen family, when he asked whether the CTE \"more than minimally, negligibly or trivially\" contributed to the death and that \"heading the ball\" contributed to the CTE.",
      "The professor said the only evidence available was McQueen's \"high exposure\" to heading a football."

      "Michael Carrick has got off to the dream start as head coach of Manchester United until the end of the season; But are wins against Man City and Premier League leaders Arsenal enough to justify a premature permanent appointment?",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 17:29, UK",
      "Manchester United fans should not get carried away with Michael Carrick. But why not?",
      "So far, Carrick has shown you do not need to \"suffer\" to win football matches; instead, he's proved football is a simple game.",
      "But the dilemma now is whether he merits the permanent role, or, despite an apparent turnaround at Old Trafford, United should still bite the bullet and stick to their original plan to appoint a different permanent Ruben Amorim successor.",
      "Some fans have made up their minds and the players are rejuvenated but Roy Keane and Gary Neville remain cautious.",
      "Keane says United need a manager \"who you feel can get them winning league titles\", while before the derby day win and the victory at league leaders Arsenal, Neville said there \"cannot be any consideration\" that Carrick takes the job.",
      "However, the football United fans have been exposed to against Man City and Arsenal, the two sides at the top of the Premier League, cannot be taken for granted.",
      "As Carrick celebrated Patrick Dorgu's zinger to make it 2-1 at Arsenal, Neville said the stand-in United boss had put his hands up like the \"messiah\". What United have been exposed to in just two games is what they have been waiting for and prophesied about for over a decade.",
      "The football taught by Carrick works because, rather than treating the game like an exact science, he has allowed it to become an art of self-expression.",
      "Players playing to their strengths with the added pinch of nostalgia has been the recipe for Carrick's early success, with the squad no longer demanded to follow an elaborate instruction manual that never really makes clear what the final product would be.",
      "Carrick's United are direct, front-foot and have thus far been the perfect advert of \"United DNA\", averaging more fast breaks than any other team in the league.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo leads the line because he's made the most runs in behind per 90 in the Premier League this season. Bruno Fernandes is back in his favoured No 10 position as he remains one of the league's most potent chance creators. Dorgu has remained as a wide player because of his consistent displays high up the pitch.",
      "With very little time on the training pitch after taking on his team mid-season, there have been very few complaints from Carrick about his current situation. Why would there be? He's been given a free hit at Old Trafford, just as he was given one in 2021, following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. As he did then, reinstalling fundamentals has become a stroke of genius.",
      "In truth, it's all the makings of what United would hope to see in the first two games of any new permanent manager. Perhaps if it wasn't Carrick, perhaps if it was someone new in the dugout, there'd be a unanimous acceptance that he should be the next man in charge. Unfortunately, United have been here before.",
      "In December 2018, a harrowing 3-1 defeat at Liverpool meant that Jose Mourinho's time at United was called to a close.",
      "United was described as toxic as Old Trafford soured under Mourinho, who grew grumpy in the role and was losing favour amongst the playing squad. Solskjaer came in and had an opportunity to stamp his mark and did so in style.",
      "A 5-1 victory at Cardiff set Solskjaer and United on a trail of 12 matches without defeat in the Premier League. With positivity flowing through the place, the change in style to something more akin to the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "As we've seen under Carrick, there's something about a side fearless in transition that United fans love to watch.",
      "After winning 14 of his 19 interim matches, including an incredible comeback win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, Solskjaer was named United's permanent manager in March 2019. Solskjaer's interim efforts propelled United's top-four chances at the time.",
      "However, after United appointed Solskjaer, everyone returned from the honeymoon and to a dose of realism that Solskjaer was an inexperienced manager whose positive energy outweighed his proficiency in the role. United quickly crashed and burned that season, winning just two of their last eight, missing out on the top four.",
      "Throughout Solskjaer's three years in charge, a similar pattern sustained. United would go on to finish third and second under Solskjaer, but notoriously couldn't get over the line to achieve material success.",
      "United fans look back at their time under Solskjaer, perhaps as fondly as any time since Ferguson's retirement in 2013, but there was ultimately nothing tangible gained under the manager who made United simply \"feel good\".",
      "Under Solskjaer, United were a nearly team, reaching multiple semi-finals in all the cup competitions before a Europa League final in 2021 ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Villarreal.",
      "David de Gea's missed penalty is viewed by many as the true sliding doors moment that led to Solskjaer's ultimate demise in the role but the reality was that United were serial losers when push came to shove.",
      "There's an underlying resistance to repeat the same mistake with Carrick. When United opted to appoint Solskjaer permanently, the regime at the time, in the same breath, lost the chance to appoint Zinedine Zidane and Mauricio Pochettino, who at that time were the outstanding rumoured candidates.",
      "Should United appoint Carrick permanently, they will miss out on tapping into the thriving economy of available managers to do what they have tried in the past.",
      "There's no reason to suggest Carrick would be the same or worse than Solskjaer, but after years of experimenting, the next decision on United manager feels like the most significant one yet.",
      "It could be the difference between returning to a side worthy of the name and reputation or remaining in a cycle of failure.",
      "On current evidence, Carrick would be an astute appointment. But if United want to do something new, however well Carrick does, he shouldn't be among the future candidates. Fans will get carried away, as fans are allowed to. INEOS, though, have another era-defining decision to make.",

      "",
      "Arsenal appeared in complete control of their meeting with Manchester United when Lisandro Martinez turned Martin Odegaard's cross-shot into his own net in the first half. But when cool heads were needed, they instead allowed chaos to take over.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo's equaliser came from a glaring error by Martin Zubimendi but it was the second time he had got in behind Arsenal's defence in the eight minutes after the opening goal. Bruno Fernandes had spurned an excellent chance moments earlier too. Arsenal cannot say they weren't warned, in other words.",
      "Their composure was shattered and they spent the rest of the game struggling to pick up the pieces, their edginess mirroring the mood among their fans. Arsenal are Premier League leaders but it does not feel that way inside the Emirates Stadium right now.",
      "Patrick Vieira questioned the side's mental strength afterwards but the most damning assessment came from a former Manchester United captain. \"They have to get back to basics and embrace this challenge instead of being frightened of it,\" said Roy Keane.",
      "The fear stems from the manner in which their previous title challenges have ended. Increasingly, it is seeping into their performances. Goalless draws with Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were not disastrous but alarm bells are starting to ring now.",
      "This was the first time since December 2023 that Arsenal have conceded three goals in a game but the manner in which they shot themselves in the foot felt familiar. They have developed a habit of making things more difficult than they need to be.",
      "They still have a four-point cushion. But this is a team and fanbase struggling to shake off the baggage of previous seasons.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester City - tick. Arsenal - tick. Michael Carrick couldn't have wished for a better start as Manchester United head coach - and it can keep getting better.",
      "Carrick has breathed new life into United, unleashing their forwards from Ruben Amorim's stale 3-4-3 formation and restoring the club's 'DNA' - fast wingers and attacking football against the two best sides in the Premier League.",
      "He boldly threw on Benjamin Sesko as the injured Patrick Dorgu's replacement late on at the Emirates with the score at 2-1, when it would have been easy to opt for the industrious Mason Mount to help Luke Shaw stifle Bukayo Saka.",
      "Sesko went down the middle and the attack-minded Matheus Cunha was shifted to the left, with his winning goal coming from when he was able to drift into space before curling in.",
      "\"We're not getting carried away,\" said Carrick, but some Man Utd fans left the Emirates singing \"we're going to win the league\". They now sit inside the top four and while a title challenge is most unlikely, securing a Champions League spot is much more achievable.",
      "And Man Utd's next five fixtures are inviting: Fulham, Tottenham, West Ham, Everton and Crystal Palace.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer didn't lose in his first 11 games, winning 10, when he took over on an interim basis in 2019. It was a run that earned him a three-year contract.",
      "With 15 matches remaining, another former Man Utd player can stake his claim for extending his time in charge.David Richardson",
      "Is Ezri Konsa the best English centre-back in the Premier League right now? It's hard to argue against it.",
      "Newcastle away is a ferocious fixture. Konsa, instead, made it look calm. That, more than anything, is the mark of top-level defending.",
      "What stood out wasn't crunching tackles or sliding blocks, it was his positioning. Konsa was always where Newcastle didn't want him to be. He read the game two or three seconds quicker than those around him.",
      "There's a maturity to his defending now that suggests a player who truly understands risk. When to step out, when to hold the line. It was a performance that oozed class and intelligence.",
      "This wasn't a one-off, either. Konsa's consistency has been quietly excellent for some time, which perhaps explains why he started six of England's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "Right now, Konsa is playing with authority, composure and a footballing brain that elevates those around him.",
      "If England are looking for a defender they can trust when the pressure rises this summer at the World Cup, Konsa is making a compelling case.Lewis Jones",
      "Crystal Palace have had six rough weeks.",
      "Marc Guehi has left for Man City, Oliver Glasner has announced he will leave the club at the end of the season and speculation about Jean-Philippe Mateta's future is rife - not to mention their embarrassing FA Cup exit at the hands of non-League Macclesfield.",
      "And now, if Tottenham are being mentioned in conversations about the battle against relegation, the Eagles - level on points with Spurs, but a place below in 15th - must be, too.",
      "Since the 2-1 win at Fulham on December 7, it's now eight without a win in the Premier League.",
      "Indeed, they have now failed to win any of their last 11 matches across all competitions (D4 L7), which is both the longest current winless run of any Premier League side and the Eagles' longest winless run since a run of 13 between January and March 2023.",
      "They've picked up two points in the league across that run and scored only three goals, while shipping 18.",
      "There were plenty of signs they can avoid being dragged into the mix-up as it takes shape in the coming weeks, but right now, they just need a win, and with tricky trips to Nottingham Forest and Brighton up next, it's hard to see where it is going to come from.Dan Long",
      "As Rob Green put it, Nottingham Forest were unspectacular but effective. But that was more than enough to blunt Brentford for only the second time on home soil this season.",
      "The hosts had two gilt-edged chances before half-time, attempted 35 crosses but only forced Matz Sels into one real save across 90 minutes at the Gtech. They faced a Forest side playing peak Sean Dyche football for much of the game, but one they played into the hands of.",
      "Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic will head and kick everything away all day. Brentford did not move Forest around enough, and on the rare occasion they did manufacture something from a clever pass they nearly scored.",
      "The timing of the visitors' two goals, book-ending the game as they did, could not have been much better and showed up a Brentford attack which laboured but had few ideas to combat the visitors' low block.",
      "Brentford will not face Dyche every week. But losing Mikkel Damsgaard to a suspected knee injury will not aid their cause given a lack of real creative alternatives in midfield. Keith Andrews himself said it had been a delight to watch the Danish midfielder play - and he will hope more than anyone that his diagnosis is not serious.Ron Walker",
      "Newcastle's summer recruitment in forward areas was meant to soften the blow of life without Alexander Isak. Instead, it's starting to underline just how hard he is to replace.",
      "The 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa felt like a case study in attacking shortfall. Plenty of effort, plenty of running but very little incision. When the game needed a spark, Eddie Howe turned to his bench and got no real lift.",
      "Jacob Ramsey, Anthony Elanga and Nick Woltemade - a combined cost of £175m - were all given opportunities but the game passed them by. Ramsey looked lost, Elanga's pace never translated into end product and Woltemade looked isolated against Villa's centre-backs.",
      "Meanwhile, Yoane Wissa, another summer recruit, couldn't find space to threaten from the start.",
      "This is where Isak's absence looms large. He doesn't just score goals, his movement and intelligence won Newcastle games. Without him, the attack looks flatter, easier to contain and more predictable.",
      "Recruitment is always judged over time, but right now the early evidence suggests Newcastle haven't found the right blend to cover for Isak's unique profile.Lewis Jones",
      "Joao Pedro was the player of the match at Crystal Palace but Estevao continues to excite. The 18-year-old Brazilian became the youngest Chelsea player to score and assist in the same Premier League match since Neil Shipperley in 1993. Different times.",
      "His goal in the 3-1 win was superb, showing not just pace but skill and strength to hold off a quality defender in Tyrick Mitchell. The finish was emphatic, ramming the ball beyond Dean Henderson. No wonder Chelsea supporters want to see more of him.",
      "This was Estevao's first goal since the win over Barcelona in November, although Chelsea as a whole have been a little out of sorts since then. This was a first Premier League away win since beating Burnley that month, ending a run of five without a win.",
      "There are a plethora of options for Liam Rosenior in the attacking positions at Chelsea. That, coupled with some fitness issues, has led to Estevao making more of his appearances off the bench than from the start since losing to Leeds in early December.",
      "But Estevao's potential far outstrips that of his peers in Chelsea blue - not just for the future but the here and now. No player has scored more goals for the club at the same age during the Premier League era. His impact at Selhurst Park feels like just the start.Adam Bate",
