      "Manchester United are pushing to secure a sensational £100million deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba. With his new-look £200m front three now in place, manager Ruben Amorim now wants a steely midfielder to shore things up in the centre of the park and protect the back line - and Baleba is top of the club's shortlist.",
      "The Cameroon international has been quietly, but consistently, turning heads since stepping into Moises Caicedo's sizable shoes following the Ecuadorian's mega-money move to Chelsea in 2023. As a result, Brighton have no intention of selling him amid reports it will take a nine-figure sum to simply bring them to the negotiating table.",
      "United know prising Baleba from Brighton will be no easy task, but have nonetheless opened talks with the Seagulls to test their resolve. Meeting the asking price would make the 21-year-old the most expensive signing in the club's history - and mark one of the costliest deals the sport has ever seen.",
      "But it won't be all sunshine and rainbows after that. In fact, Baleba will have to be on his best behaviour, with four strict rules - implemented by Amorim - to adhere to. The Portuguese boss has introduced these measures to raise standards at Old Trafford after a disappointing first season at the helm - one plagued by poor form and ill-discipline. Here's what the young midfielder would face:",
      "Players are prohibited from treating international breaks as vacation time. This rule came after incidents like Marcus Rashford and Casemiro jetting off to the US for leisure when not selected for national duty.",
      "Amorim emphasised setting club standards for rest, such as limiting travel or days off. \"We as a club have to set the standards and manage that,\" he said of the changes.",
      "\"It's my decision if they can have five days, or three days, or three days to rest and you cannot fly. This is something that us as a club have to decide. So this must be started in the club, with us and me being responsible in that area.\"",
      "To prioritise physical fitness, Amorim has outlawed food in the dressing room on matchdays. This is part of his broader push to maintain elite conditioning and uphold higher professional standards within the squad.",
      "News of the ban came after Amorim spoke of the importance of his team being in peak physical condition to \"run like mad dogs\" and compete with the very best in the Premier League.",
      "\"You can do a starting line-up with the best players on the planet, without running they also won't win,\" he said in December last year. \"We have to run like mad dogs, if not we won't win.\"",
      "In a bid to foster accountability and competition, the losing side in training sessions is now required to collect all the equipment used that day. This rule is designed to instil discipline and motivation ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "Speaking about the new rule, United youngster Toby Collyer told The Athletic: \"Everyone wants to be the team that wins. You don't have to get the gear in then. It's a jeopardy if you lose! All the other teams have to get the gear in.\"",
      "Diogo Dalot noted that pre-season standards have risen compared to last year, hinting earlier this month that the new rule may be achieving its intended impact. \"If you want to be in Manchester United, you need to match some standards. If you can't match them, it's not a place for you. The message is really clear,\" the Portugal defender said.",
      "One of Amorim's first major changes was banning coaches from delivering overly complicated instructions, insisting everything be simplified before reaching the players. The aim: to streamline communication and sharpen focus.",
      "Despite wanting to instil the same fluid, intricate, high-octane style his Sporting CP side mastered, the 40-year-old is taking a more refined approach to conveying messages. This is designed to ensure players act instinctively on the pitch, without being bogged down by overthinking.",
      "Amorim believes clarity breeds confidence - and that player who understands their roles implicitly will execute them with far greater precision under pressure.",

      "After a bitterly disappointing campaign, Ruben Amorim has been given ammunition to improve his forward line, with Cunha, £65m winger Bryan Mbeumo and now long-pursued striker Sesko all touching down.",
      "Cunha was the first to be snapped up, though, signing from Wolves at the beginning of June after his £62.5m release clause was activated. However, Cole, who starred in the Premier League for West Ham, Chelsea and Liverpool, believes the 26-year-old's attitude is a major worry.",
      "\"I wouldn't want to say he is a bad lad because I wouldn't want to say that, but he's a bit of a maverick and I've heard people talk about him being a bit of a maverick.",
      "\"The last thing that United dressing room needs is another maverick, there are mavericks everywhere putting stuff on social media and all that. You hear too much coming out of that dressing room so it's a gamble with Cunha.\"",
      "Cunha landed himself in hot water last season, twice being fined and banned by the Football Association for misconduct. The first incident came in December, when he was handed a two-game ban and hit with an £80,000 fine for an altercation against Ipswich Town in the Premier League.",
      "After the full-time whistle, a scuffle broke out between Wolves and the victorious Ipswich players, and Cunha appeared to strike a member of the opposition's coaching team. His suspension was confirmed in January.",
      "Later in March, Cunha was fined another £50k and suspended for an extra fourth game of a three-match ban after he was sent off for clashing with defender Milos Kerkez, now of Liverpool, in extra time of Wolves' FA Cup defeat by Bournemouth.",
      "The Brazilian will be joined at Old Trafford by Slovenian striker Sesko, who, after a tumultuous summer that also saw him linked with a move to Newcastle, was announced as a United player on Saturday.",
      "Speaking immediately after penning a five-year deal, Sesko shed light on his decision, stating: \"The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future.",
      "\"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions. I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.\"",

      "Paris Saint-Germain anticipate a possible flurry of bids for goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma after already signing his replacement — and the French champions believe Manchester United will be among the clubs queuing up. PSG have agreed a deal for Lille shotstopper Lucas Chevalier, who will join on a five-year contract after the Champions League winners decided to pay up €40million (£34.7m), with the potential for a further €15m (£13) in add-ons, for his services.",
      "Donnarumma has just one year remaining on his contract in Paris and the club are happy to part ways with the understanding they would still have two top goalkeepers at the Parc des Princes. The former AC Milan star is said to have been interested in extending his deal but an agreement was not reached.",
      "Donnarumma had wanted an increase in pay despite being among the team's highest earners. The Italian international is currently on €850,000-a-month (£736,000) and failed to come into line with the club's new salary structure focused on lower salary bases with greater incentives",
      "PSG expect to receive an offer from United, Chelsea or Inter Milan, according to ESPN. The trio of European giants are reported to have been in touch with Donnarumma's agent, Enzo Raiola.",
      "United have been widely linked to signing a goalkeeper in recent months, though not always of the same calibre as Donnarumma. The future of back-up option Altay Bayindir has been uncertain with greater competition for Andre Onana said to be wanted.",
      "Onana's injury in pre-season also added fuel to speculation in combination with his unconvincing United career. The ex-Ajax ace is expected to be fit in time for the start of the Premier League season however.",
      "United have already spent in excess of £200million this summer. The Red Devils ambitions have been on replenishing their forward line thus far in the transfer window.",
      "The arrival of Benjamin Sesko was confirmed by the club on a five-year deal after agreeing a fee worth up to £74m with Bundesliga side RB Leipzig. The Slovenia striker joins Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in Ruben Amorim's squad.",

      "United have so far been able to facilitate exits but the latter is the subject of interest from Chelsea. The Argentina winger has already agreed personal terms over a switch to Stamford Bridge but there remains a question of whether Chelsea will meet United’s £50m price-tag.",

      "Benjamin Sesko has made the leap from RB Leipzig to Manchester United in a £74million transfer – and there will be one familiar face at Old Trafford.",
      "Sesko has snubbed a move to Newcastle in favour of joining United, who have paid £66.4m up front plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons. The 22-year-old striker will slot into Ruben Amorim’s new-look front line, alongside fellow new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "United’s press release announcing the capture of Sesko makes it clear how delighted they are to land the Slovenia international in what they view as a coup, given their lack of European football this season.",
      "“The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United,” said director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "That may well be true, but Wilcox also has one of his colleagues to thank after landing Sesko from under Newcastle’s nose. Christopher Vivell was instrumental in getting the deal over the line, thanks in large part to his connections with Sesko and his agent Elvis Basanovic.",
      "Vivell only joined United last summer, initially as an interim director of recruitment, but by February he had secured the role permanently. Omar Berrada, who joined the club from Manchester City last summer to become chief executive, had pushed for Vivell’s arrival, having got on well with him in their previous roles.",
      "The 38-year-old German left Chelsea under a cloud in July 2023, just seven months after arriving as technical director. But Berrada and United were not fazed and brought him in. They are now seeing the fruits of that decision.",
      "Vivell has a good reputation in Germany, where he began at Hoffenheim before joining the Red Bull Group. That is where he encountered Sesko, signing him for Red Bull Salzburg initially before bringing him to sister club Leipzig in 2023.",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for Leipzig, attracting plenty of Premier League attention, including from Arsenal. And while he cited United’s history and the project laid out by Ruben Amorim as reasons for joining, he also was encouraged by Vivell’s presence, having had only good experiences in his previous two moves involving the German.",
      "Sesko isn’t the only highly rated young striker who Vivell has snapped up in his time, as United well know. Back in 2019, United wanted to sign Erling Haaland from Molde, having been given a recommendation by then-managed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "But they did not succeed in chasing the Norwegian superstar, who snubbed a succession of bigger clubs to join Salzburg, having been courted by Vivell. “The big clubs wanted him too,” he later explained. “But they wanted to do a loan programme, which neither his father nor Erling wanted. That’s why we managed to bring him to us.”",
      "Vivell worked with former United manager Ralf Rangnick at Red Bull and also tried to hire Erik ten Hag for Leipzig before he left Ajax for United. Those connections are incidental compared to those with Sesko, which helped land who United hope will be the answer to their goalscoring woes.",

      "David Bentley confesses he should have stayed at Arsenal but departed because he lacked faith in Arsene Wenger's vision. The Englishman went on to thrive at Blackburn Rovers before joining the Gunners' bitter rivals, Tottenham.",
      "Bentley joined Arsenal aged 13, and whilst he began life as a striker, he gradually retreated into midfield positions. He penned his first professional contract at 16 in 2001 and made his senior debut under Wenger two years later.",
      "Following a loan stint with Norwich City, his prospects at Highbury appeared grim. During the summer of 2005, Bentley handed in a transfer request and secured a permanent switch to Blackburn in January 2006 after a temporary loan spell there.",
      "Despite shining at Blackburn and ultimately securing a £15million transfer to Tottenham in 2008, where his career would falter, he acknowledges he probably should have stuck with the Gunners for longer but simply lacked confidence in Wenger.",
      "\"When we were playing, you were under much more pressure than players are nowadays. Much more pressure,\" began Bentley, appearing on Undr The Cosh podcast.",
      "\"Because, if you found yourself out the team, you were criticised more than you are now. Now, you're a squad player. Just having a rest, not in the squad today.",
      "\"[I left Arsenal because] I wanted to play. I signed a five-year deal and left after six months! Wenger was like, 'No, do this.' He had a plan, didn't he? But I couldn't see that plan. Didn't trust it.",

      "\"Absolutely unbelievable performance from him. We beat Wolves 5-1 at Highbury. He dominated the game at 15 years old. I was only like 17. Eighteen months older, or two years older than him.\"",
      "Bentley left Highbury in 2006 and quickly made his mark at Blackburn, netting a hat-trick against Manchester United in his first match after signing permanently, reports Football London.",
      "His contributions helped Blackburn in their UEFA Cup campaign that season, and he was honoured as the club's Player of the Year by fans in 2007 amidst rumours of a move to the Red Devils.",
      "In 2008, Bentley did complete a transfer, but to Tottenham, where he scored an unforgettable first league goal: a 43-yard volley in a thrilling 4-4 draw with his former team Arsenal. Bentley's time at Spurs was not fruitful, however, leading to a series of loan spells, including a stint at Russian outfit FC Rostov.",
      "The midfielder also played for Birmingham City and West Ham, and after a brief return to Blackburn in 2013, he was released by Tottenham that June. By the following year, at just 29, Bentley retired from professional football, unable to secure a new club.",

      "\"Nothing changed, surprisingly,\" he said in an explosive interview with Piers Morgan. \"Not only the pool, the jacuzzi, even the gym. Even the kitchen, the chefs, whom I appreciate – lovely people. They stopped in time. It surprised me a lot.",
      "\"I thought I would see other things, technologies and infrastructure. Unfortunately, we see a lot of what I used to see at 21, 22 and 23 years old. It really surprised me. Since [Sir Alex] Ferguson left, I haven't seen an evolution at the club. Progress is zero. You have to tear it down and rebuild it.\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo’s criticism, his Portugal team-mate Dalot said: \"I'm sure he would love it if he would be able to see it. But overall I think the message was clear that this club deserved even more and all credit to Sir Jim and his team.\"",
      "He added: \"I think finally we're getting to a level where this club deserves and now it's up to us, on the pitch, to also match that standard. If we're talking about a club like Man United, we should have the best facilities in the world. The big thing that I like the most is now there's going to be no excuses.\"",
      "United finished a lowly 15th in the Premier League last season before losing the Europa League final. They have splashed the cash this summer, signing Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, with a deal for Benjamin Sesko close, and will expect to see results on the pitch this season.",
      "“The club has to compete at the highest level that is appropriate to the size and history of the club,” Ratcliffe said. “While a world-class training facility won’t take us to that position alone, it is one of the key ingredients in the modern facility. Now we have one.",
      "“When I first came to Carrington two years ago, we had a presentation here. It was clear then. It is an excellent facility. It was [leading edge[ I am sure in 2000, but 25 years later it wasn’t at quite the level it needed to be for one of the top four or five clubs in the world.”",

      "The Premier League will have begun this time next week but several of the summer's major transfer sagas are likely to be in play with Alexander Isak among them.",
      "Newcastle face a major decision when it comes to their star player, who is currently not part of the first-team squad. He's expressed a desire to leave and Liverpool are circling. The Magpies though want £150million before they consider letting Isak leave for pastures new.",
      "It remains to be seen as to whether the Reds will pay that much. Arne Slot is open to more players heading to Anfield but has been outspoken about the idea Liverpool have spent huge sums - pointing to the amount of players to have left.",
      "Manchester United meanwhile have announced the signing of Benjamin Sesko - which is another blow to Newcastle who also eyed the Slovenian. The Red Devils are now being linked with Brighton's Carlos Baleba.",
      "Thomas Frank confirmed Tottenham remain active in the transfer market after James Maddison's injury.",
      "Frank told reporters: \"We are definitely in the market in general. Of course, when players get a long-term injury we need to look into that, but generally we are in the market, yes.”",
      "Raheem Sterling could yet find a club in the Premier League to play his trade at in the coming season. London clubs Fulham, Crystal Palace and West Ham are all interested in a move, according to the Daily Mail.",
      "Sterling and Chelsea will hope to part ways in the coming weeks.",
      "Slot is clearly frustrated that Liverpool ’s spending is being talked about more than the players they have lost or moved on in this window.",
      "He feels it is more replacing and rebuilding rather than adding to the side which won the Premier League title at a canter last season.",
      "“What I feel is not being talked about enough - although you have to make your own decision when you talk about it - [is that] I've lost four players that have started regularly,” said Slot. \"And one of them, I, we, his family, lost him. That's Diogo. Then Darwin might be on the verge of leaving. Luis Diaz was a definite starter, and Trent [Alexander-Arnold] was a definite starter.",
      "“So normally in the Premier League, teams only buy, and never sell. We do both. We lost players in a good phase of their career. I'm used to that, and it sometimes gives new energy as well.”",
      "Wrexham boss Phil Parkinson has refused to confirm whether his side are set to sign Liverpool starlet Lewis Koumas. The youngster has been linked with a season-long loan switch to the Championship side.",
      "Asked about those reports, Parkinson responded: “There’s such a list of players and we seem to get linked to it with everybody. At this stage I just don’t want to really comment on any individuals.”",
      "Man Utd were linked with a move to Benjamin Sesko when he was making his name at Red Bull Salzburg, before seeing him join RB Leipzig. They have now pounced to land the Slovenian with their hierarchy thrilled to have secured his signature.",
      "Jason Wilcox, director of football, said: “Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.",
      "“We have followed Benjamin’s career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.\"",
      "It is understood that, even if a new striker is signed by Newcastle, they will not u-turn on their firm stance regarding Isak's future. Howe has been aware of the hierarchy's stance has been left to smooth things out with the player.",
      "Newcastle's decision not to officially discipline the player has been a conscious decision. Isak didn't go on their pre-season tour of Asia but later was seen training at former club Real Sociedad. The club are aware that it will be easier to reintegrate him into the squad if they take a soft approach in that sense.",
      "Alexander Isak has been left fuming after Newcastle made it clear to him that he will not be sold this summer - ending his hopes of a move to Liverpool.",
      "The Swede was told of the club's decision with the Telegraph reporting he did not take it well and will continue training away from the first-team. Isak has been informed that, until he accepts that he will not be getting the move away he wanted, he will not play for Newcastle after being left out of their pre-season games.",
      "Eddie Howe has been the club's spokesperson and had been open and honest about the possibility that Isak could leave the club after three years, but their Saudi Arabian have taken a hard line regarding their refusal to sell.",
      "“The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future.",
      "“When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "Man United have officially won the race for Benjamin Sesko after hijacking Newcastle's move for the striker. Sesko, 22, arrives from German club RB Leipzig in a deal worth up to £74million.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side will pay £66.4m up front plus a further £7.6m in potential add-ons. Sesko has signed a five-year contract, keeping him at Old Trafford until June 2030.",
      "Jakub Kiwior is interested in leaving Arsenal for a club who'd guarantee him regular game time. Since joining the Gunners from Italian side Spezia in January 2023, Poland international Kiwior largely been a stopgap for his injured team-mates.",
      "The 25-year-old enjoyed a solid run of starts in the spring following Gabriel Magalhaes' season-ending injury and was the subject of interest from Porto, whose £26m bid was rejected by Arsenal. But that might not be the end of interest in Kiwior, as the Athletic report that he's keen to explore opportunities with clubs where he'd be considered a first-choice player.",
      "Liverpool boss Arne Slot claims he is ‘happy’ with his options at centre-back despite the Reds having been linked with a new defender. He said: \"They can definitely play there as well and you forget Joe Gomez.",
      "\"Unfortunately he [Gomez] has a minor injury at the moment but he will be back with the team soon. I'm really happy with the players we are having and we have numerous players who can play in the position.\"",
      "Jakub Kiwior is interested in leaving Arsenal for a club who'd guarantee him regular game time. Since joining the Gunners from Italian side Spezia in January 2023, Poland international Kiwior largely been a stopgap for his injured team-mates.",
      "The 25-year-old enjoyed a solid run of starts in the spring following Gabriel Magalhaes' season-ending injury and was the subject of interest from Porto, whose £26m bid was rejected by Arsenal. But that might not be the end of interest in Kiwior, as the Athletic report that he's keen to explore opportunities with clubs where he'd be considered a first-choice player.",
      "So, a summary of where we're at..",
      "Chelsea are currently looking to add Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig and Man United's Alejandro Garnacho - it remains to be seen if they will end up landing both.",
      "Nicolas Jackson's future may fund those moves but it could also be dependant on Newcastle's next move. They want a new striker and look to have missed out on Benjamin Sesko and are now weighing up their options.",
      "Chelsea are ready to accept around £50m after Nicolas Jackson told the club he wanted leave Stamford Bridge after two seasons at the Blues.",
      "Jackson has led the line for the club and been their first choice No 9 since joining from Villarreal but has seen two new strikers arrive this summer. The Senegal international was left out of Chelsea’s pre-season friendly against Bayer Leverkusen on Friday after it was agreed he could seek pastures new.",
      "It was understood that the west Londoners wanted around £80m before they let their striker leave, but that stance has since cooled. The Times now reports they would want a similar figure to the one they receive for Noni Madueke - which was £52m.",
      "Brighton star Carlos Baleba is understood to be Man Utd's top target, even if a deal will be difficult to complete this summer.",
      "The Seagulls have slapped a price tag north of £100m on the Cameroon international and are insistent they won’t sell before the start of this season. The player himself is also understood to be willing to wait another 12 months before becoming the latest big-money exit from The Amex.",
      "United will nevertheless try to get a deal done, but any proposal won’t include Toby Collyer. Reports had suggested the academy graduate could be used as a makeweight in a possible Baleba offer, but those appear wide of the mark.",
      "Eddie Howe admits that it is \"clear\" that he \"can't involve\" Alexander Isak at Newcastle whilst the noise around his future persists.",
      "Newcastle rejected a £110m bid from Liverpool last week after the striker told them he wanted to explore his options. Howe has not closed the door on Isak playing against but concedes, as things stand, he will remain on the outside.",
      "He said: \"We've had discussions and it's clear at the moment that we can't involve him with the group. I don't know how long that will be for, but that's the latest.\"",
      "We're back to keep you across all the latest transfer news and deals as we wait to see if some of the Premier League's biggest names will head for pastures new."

      "While Manchester United are weighing up a blockbuster approach for Carlos Baleba, some believe the club already have an even greater midfield prodigy in their midst. And these aren't just ordinary observers – we're talking about 10 Ballon d'Or winners.",
      "Earlier this week, it emerged that the Red Devils have set their sights on Brighton's Baleba, with manager Ruben Amorim keen to bring in a defensive midfielder after successfully strengthening his forward line. Brighton, however, are unwilling to part ways with the 21-year-old, who has effortlessly filled Moises Caicedo's sizeable shoes after the Ecuadorian left for Chelsea in 2023.",
      "Internally, United accept that signing Baleba this summer will be no easy task, as Brighton are expected to demand around £100million for the Cameroon star. Meeting that figure would push United's transfer outlay for the summer towards – and potentially beyond – the £300m mark with Benjamin Sesko also arriving at Old Trafford.",
      "Considering the hefty asking price and the club's precarious financial state, many question whether the pursuit is worth it, particularly as United already boast a gifted young midfielder in Kobbie Mainoo. The 20-year-old is seen as one of Europe's most exciting emerging players, underlined by his third-place finish in last year's Kopa Trophy – awarded to the best footballer under the age of 21 – trailing only Arda Guler and winner Lamine Yamal.",
      "The prize, introduced in 2018, is voted on by a panel of former Ballon d'Or winners – 10 of whom ranked Mainoo in their top three. That distinguished group features Michael Owen, Marco van Basten, Kaka, Andriy Shevchenko, Ruud Gullit, Pavel Nedved, Matthias Sammer, Jean-Pierre Papin, Igor Belanov and Gianni Rivera.",
      "Mainoo missed out on this year's shortlist after a stop-start season disrupted by injuries, yet optimism remains high within United that he can rediscover the consistency and spark that made him the academy's latest breakout star.",
      "His current deal runs until 2027, with negotiations for an extension ongoing but paused since last year. United do hold an option to prolong his contract by an additional year, though that hasn't prevented exit rumours from swirling in recent months.",
      "Should uncertainty over Mainoo's future persist, United's pursuit of Baleba could gather pace. That said, securing one isn't necessarily contingent on pinning down the other.",
      "While both operate in central midfield, Baleba is a more orthodox ball-winning No. 6, whereas Mainoo excels at advancing possession and adding creative thrust.",
      "If anything, they'd form an electrifying pairing, combining energy and tenacity off the ball with incisive passing and fast, fluid interplay on it – precisely the dynamic Amorim is eager to cultivate in midfield.",
      "For the moment, Brighton retain the upper hand in any negotiations over Baleba. The player is under contract for another three years, and the Seagulls have built a reputation for driving hard bargains – banking big sums for the likes of Caicedo, Marc Cucurella, Joao Pedro and Ben White.",
      "Whether United choose to seriously test Brighton's resolve remains to be seen, but if they do, prising Baleba away will likely be a drawn-out and fiercely contested battle.",

      "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Lee Sharpe was one of English football’s brightest young stars.",
      "Plucked from Torquay United by Sir Alex Ferguson at just 17, the talented winger quickly made his mark at Manchester United, becoming a key figure in the club’s resurgence in the early 1990s.",
      "Known for his skill on the pitch and photogenic good looks off it, Sharpe helped United secure three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and a League Cup during his eight‑year stay at Old Trafford.",
      "But his life at the top came with its challenges. Ferguson was famous for his “hairdryer treatment,” and Sharpe often found himself on the receiving end.",
      "Speaking to The Sun, he recalled one brutal halftime dressing‑down after a poor performance at Anfield: “He gave me the biggest rollicking of my life and told me to sell my house, move my girlfriend back home and get out there and play!”",
      "The player followed those instructions, later adding: “He asked me now and then after that if I had a girlfriend or if I was married, but I always told him I’d got rid of my girlfriend, wasn’t getting married and not to ask me again!”",
      "As United rose to dominate the newly formed Premier League, Sharpe embodied the image of the modern footballer - talented, well‑paid and living life in the fast lane.",
      "But injuries and a loss of form saw his Old Trafford career stall, leading to moves to Leeds United and Bradford City before he finally retired from professional football in 2004. And that’s when Sharpe’s post‑football life took an unexpected turn.",
      "In 2005, just a year after hanging up his boots, Sharpe became a household name all over again - this time on television. He joined the cast of Celebrity Love Island, an early version of the now‑famous ITV dating show.",
      "There, he struck up a romance with TV presenter Jayne Middlemiss, who told viewers she had “never felt like this about anyone before.” But their relationship didn’t survive the cameras - Sharpe famously dumped Middlemiss for fellow contestant Abi Titmuss before the series ended.",
      "The headlines didn’t stop there. Sharpe and Titmuss’ short‑lived romance soon fell apart amid allegations of cheating.",
      "In her memoir, Titmuss recalled the painful moment she discovered his alleged infidelity: “I feel like I’m being physically torn in half. I have my boyfriend looking me straight in the eye, telling me he loves me and totally denying it. And in my hand I have the front page of a national paper with a woman swearing he had slept with her.”",
      "It was the beginning of a tabloid storm. Over the following months, Sharpe was linked to promotions worker Kathryn Shaw - who described meeting him “on a little bridge near Rochdale” - and former Big Brother contestant Lisa Jeynes, who claimed they had a “marathon sex session that went on for hours.”",
      "Other rumoured relationships included actress Kym Marsh and singer Michelle Heaton, strengthening Sharpe’s reputation as one of football’s original playboys.",
      "But away from the gossip pages, Lee Sharpe's life was quietly beginning to change. By 2011, he had met Lucy Gardner, the woman who would become his wife.",
      "Six years later, he proposed at a Cheltenham Races fundraiser in front of more than 250 guests. “It was absolutely wonderful to witness,” said Cathryn Hage of the Pied Piper charity, which hosted the event.",
      "In 2019, the couple married on the Amalfi Coast and later relocated to Spain, where they now raise their three children. His Instagram bio reads: “Ex‑Manchester United, Leeds United and England Footballer, Golf Fanatic, Husband & Dad,” a nod to the family‑oriented life he now leads.",
      "Life on the Spanish coast has given Sharpe a chance to step away from his headline‑grabbing past and pursue a new passion - golf.",
      "“I’ve always loved golf,” he told the Express in 2023. “I started playing when I got to United when I was 17… The idea was that I was going to try and qualify for the British Open as an amateur.”",
      "Now, he’s working towards turning professional in Spain: “Over here, it’s a bit of a different regime… That’s what I’m trying to do at the moment: turn pro in Spain.”",
      "Despite building a life abroad, Sharpe still makes time for his roots. A recent Instagram post showed him enjoying time back in the UK, captioned: “A fantastic 2‑week trip back to the UK to see friends and family, North and South. There is no place like home, especially when the sun shines.”",

      "Former Manchester United ace Andreas Pereira has thrived since his move to Fulham in 2022. The Brazilian midfielder was sold at the start of Erik ten Hag's reign at Old Trafford.",
      "Pereira, who spent 11 years with the Red Devils, made his United debut as an 18-year-old. He clocked up 75 appearances for the first team, primarily under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, before being loaned out.",
      "The 29-year-old had stints at Lazio and Flamengo but his performances were not enough to stop new United boss Ten Hag from selling him three years ago. The academy product signed for newly-promoted Fulham and has flourished during his time at Craven Cottage.",
      "Transfermarkt estimates Pereira's worth at around £16m (€18m), which is double what Fulham initially paid. This is despite his recent dip in value as he enters the final year of his contract, though it's claimed that Fulham have the option to extend his deal for another year.",
      "In 2022, Pereira chose not to meet with Ten Hag, with whom he had a previous connection, as he was keen to part ways with United. However, the manager believed both parties had made the right decision when discussing the midfielder months after his departure.",
      "''Andreas Pereira is a really good player,'' Ten Hag said ahead of facing Pereira's Fulham in March 2023. ''I [have] known him already a long time, I had him in the youth team at PSV, before he transferred to Manchester United.",
      "''I am really happy for him and that he is progressing that well. I think it was the right step for him as I think he has to play on a regular basis.\"",
      "Pereira is hardly the only United academy graduate to flourish in the Premier League after departing Old Trafford. Recent seasons have seen Anthony Elanga and Dean Henderson shine for Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace, respectively.",
      "Scott McTominay has been a sensation for Serie A champions Napoli, while former starlet Alvaro Carreras secured a big-money move to Real Madrid this summer, just a year after his sale to Benfica. Fulham ace Pereira has previously confessed that being sidelined at United fuelled his hunger to thrive at his new home, insisting he harbours zero regrets over his decision to leave.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I made in my life,\" Pereira told The Standard last year. \"To come to live and play here, to enjoy my football, to get back into the national team with great players, to enjoy my football in the Premier League, leaving is the best decision I made.",
      "\"The time I was there, I really enjoyed being at a fantastic club. But I don't regret leaving. We have this desire to show it was wrong that we didn't play.\"",
      "Despite United reportedly retaining a 20 per cent sell-on fee as part of Pereira's move to Fulham, they have yet to reap any benefits from the contract clause. Pereira credits Fulham boss Silva for reviving his career, which saw him return to the Brazil squad last year.",
      "\"He is responsible for everything that is happening in the club,\" Pereira said. \"He is responsible for me coming to Fulham. I will always be grateful for everything he has done for me. I have to show the trust he has in me by keeping doing what I am doing. He's been, for sure, the most important piece of our team.\"",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has achieved the first priority of the summer window - radically overhaul his attack. The Red Devils scored a paltry 44 goals in a Premier League season which saw them finish a desperate 15th.",
      "Benjamin Sesko’s imminent transfer is expected to be announced later today, after he completed his medical at Carrington on Friday. The £74million deal with RB Leipzig means United have now spent more than £200m on their new-look forward line which also included Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "Now Amorim can turn his attention to the midfield, having gone public with his desire to add extra dynamism in the middle of the park. Along with that, is the unenviable task of offloading United’s unwanted and overpaid members of the ‘bomb squad’. Marcus Rashford has already departed, but the likes of Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho are eagerly awaiting their own exits.",
      "After revamping and retooling his attack, Amorim is now on the lookout for a midfielder. Brighton star Carlos Baleba is understood to be United’s top target, even if a deal will be difficult to complete this summer.",
      "The Seagulls have slapped a price tag north of £100m on the Cameroon international and are insistent they won’t sell before the start of this season. The player himself is also understood to be willing to wait another 12 months before becoming the latest big-money exit from The Amex.",
      "United will nevertheless try to get a deal done, but any proposal won’t include Toby Collyer. Reports had suggested the academy graduate could be used as a makeweight in a possible Baleba offer, but those appear wide of the mark.",
      "While Collyer is likely staying put, Garnacho is almost certain to leave during the current window. The Argentine has been deemed surplus to requirements by Amorim and is training away from the main group.",
      "But Garnacho has put his foot down regarding where he will go next, with a belief he’s made it clear that it’s Chelsea or nothing.",
      "For their part, the Blues are also keen to strike a deal, despite their riches in attacking areas. On Friday, Fabirizio Romano reported that the two parties had reached a total agreement on personal terms. It’s now down to the two clubs to strike a deal.",
      "A new goalkeeper could also be on Amorim’s agenda this summer after another inconsistent season by Andre Onana. Publicly at least, the manager has stuck with the former Inter stopper, but that hasn’t stopped links with potential replacements.",
      "Gianluigi Donnarumma is at the top of that list, with his PSG future increasingly uncertain. The European champions are set to announce the signing of Lucas Chevalier, leaving Donnarumma free to look elsewhere.",
      "Could he make the move to English football? United would be silly not to look at it.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Arne Slot accepts Liverpool are favourites for the Premier League title - but insists it shouldn’t be about the money they’ve spent.",
      "The Reds have splashed the cash this summer with their spending nearly reaching £300m and more to come. But the defending champions have raised almost £150m so far in player sales with further departures in the coming days and weeks before the window slams shut.",
      "The Liverpool boss said: “If you won it last season it's quite normal that you are part of the favourites again for next season. For me it would not be normal if it's about spending, because the net spend of us compared to the other teams is not in our favour, if you look at the last two seasons. But it's completely normal that we are one of the favourites, because we won it last season. And we brought in good players, like all the other ones did, by the way.”",
      "Liverpool only spent £10m last summer on Federico Chiesa while they earned more in outgoings. They’re set to smash the British transfer record with a £116m deal for Florian Wirtz while Alexander Isak would cost £120m at least to get from Newcastle this summer.",
      "Arsenal have spent close to £200m this summer and brought in just £9m while Manchester United's move for Benjamin Sesko will take their spending to the £200m mark with no money yet from outgoings. Manchester City have spent £151m in the summer but also splashed out in January and have made £42m this window. While Chelsea have also spent over £200m but raised over £100m as well.",
      "Slot added: “This is the Premier League, this is what makes this league so nice. I think there's only been one exception [who didn’t spend big] in the last two, three, four, five, six years, and that's been Liverpool last season.",
      "“Sunderland is spending money as if they... They have a lot of money, of course, because they're promoted. So that is what happens in the Premier League, that's why it is such a nice league.",
      "“So if we are only favourites because we've spent a bit, I would see that as weird, because we've lost a lot as well. But that we are favourites because we won it last season and we played so well, that's clear. And the ambitions haven't changed, because the ambition of this club is always to compete for every trophy.",
      "“So that hasn't changed compared to last season. Not because we lost players and not because we brought players in. The ambitions are always the same at this club.”",
      "Slot remained tight-lipped on the pursuit of Isak and the potential of an attacker coming in but they are ready to spend big if the Newcastle striker is available while a defender is also on the cards.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

Garnacho, Antony, Tyrell Malacia and Jadon Sancho - ironically back in Manchester after Chelsea decided to pay a fine to cancel their summer transfer obligation - all remain in situ.",
      "Argentina international Garnacho looks the man most likely to be next through the exit door however. A regular under Ruben Amorim since his arrival, his talent isn’t in question, but the Portuguese has had enough of his attitude and the drama that comes with the 21 year-old.",
      "\"I think with Garnacho, you can understand and you can see that he's talented, he's a really talented boy,” Amorim said earlier in the summer. His post-match comments after only being a substitute in the Europa League final were the final straw however.",
      "“I have the feeling – and I think it's clear - that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership and I can understand that,” added Amorim. “So I don't think it's a problem. Sometimes you adapt to one guy and you have the connection. Other times you want a new challenge.\"",
      "Chelsea believe that Garnacho, not taken on United’s pre-season tour of the US, can shine for them in the Premier League. Garnacho believes that too.",
      "He is desperate to move to Stamford Bridge and has already agreed personal terms over a switch to west London.",
      "The question is whether Chelsea will meet United’s £50m price tag. That’s considerably lower than the £80m the Red Devils were asking for in January when Napoli came calling, but positions have changed; United are, clearly, no longer so keen to keep him while Napoli instead moved on Noa Lang.",
      "Plus, United could do with bringing in some money having spent over £200m on their new-look attack of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Chelsea are keen to get a deal done as soon as possible, but still want to pay less than that. United have so far insisted that’s the price. Take it or leave it.",
      "Thus, Garnacho continues to train in red - away from United’s first-team - rather than in blue as Chelsea’s latest shiny new acquisition.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe believes Manchester United now have a “world-class facility” following the £50m transformation of the club's training ground - befitting a brand that \"stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple.\"",
      "The Red Devils have called Carrington home since January 2000, when they left their longstanding base, The Cliff, to move into a facility that cost £14.3m to build at the time. The training ground has undergone renovations over the past 25 years but had fallen behind many Premier League clubs, leading United to announce plans to turn it into a state-of-the-art complex last June.",
      "The renovation work was completed during the 2024-25 season and Ruben Amorim’s squad moved into the men’s first team building this week having returned from their pre-season tour of the United States. Ratcliffe’s $300m (£236.7m at the time of the agreement) infrastructure investment as part of the deal to become minority owner funded a project that he believes will help United in their fight to return to the top.",
      "“This is one of the most recognised brands in the world,” the United co-owner said during a ceremony in which he cut a red ribbon in front of the first-team squad, club leadership and staff. “It stands shoulder to shoulder with Coca-Cola and Apple.",
      "“The club has to compete at the highest level that is appropriate to the size and history of the club. While a world-class training facility won’t take us to that position alone, it is one of the key ingredients in the modern facility. Now we have one.",
      "“When I first came to Carrington two years ago, we had a presentation here. It was clear then. It is an excellent facility. It was (leading edge) I am sure in 2000 but 25 years later it wasn’t at quite at the level it needed to be for one of the top four or five clubs in the world.",
      "“It was the first big decision when we arrived in the first quarter of 2024, to invest in this training facility. There were lots of naysayers, who said ‘that won’t be done in 12 months’…but I am pleased to say the project has come in on budget and on time.”",
      "Foster + Partners – also appointed last September to develop a masterplan for the Old Trafford stadium district – led the biggest upgrade to Carrington since it opened at the turn of the millennium. The club say it has been “designed to inspire collaboration, innovation and excellence”, with top-tier equipment and technology throughout a building that is light and open.",
      "Reflecting on the old building, Ratcliffe said: “Downstairs, there weren’t many windows on the ground floor. It felt like you were in a hospital in the basement. It was a slightly gloomy place, a gloomy rabbit warren. Now it is open, fresh, quite modern. It encourages interaction. That is what we needed.”",
      "The medical areas have been vastly improved and players’ wellbeing has been at the forefront of the plans, which has even included a barbers being built next to the restaurant.",
      "Chief operating officer Collette Roche, who led the project, said: “I’m really, really proud of the team. As you know, with any project, it’s complex, and we’ve had to work in an environment while there’s lots of things going on in the background, lots of change in the club, and also make sure that we kept everything running.",
      "“So, it’s been fantastic, on budget and on time and I think it just proves, for me, if you do a project of this size and scale, and you involve people, and you plan it in the right way, just how amazing and transformative it can be.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United could turn to much cheaper alternatives if they are ultimately priced out of a move for Carlos Baleba. The Brighton midfielder has emerged as a potential target for Ruben Amorim, who is keen to strengthen his midfield ahead of his first full season at the helm.",
      "United have reportedly made contact with the Seagulls, who could ask for around £100m for Baleba, as he still has three years remaining on his contract. United are believed to value him at closer to £70m, and it's been suggested that Baleba might request Brighton to reduce their asking price.",
      "If any deal were to happen, though, United would need to offload further players to help boost their spending power.",
      "To add further intrigue, Manchester City are also believed to be monitoring Baleba, who cost Brighton £23.2m when they signed him from Lille in 2023. If City don’t swoop in, United could decide to wait until a later transfer window, by which time Brighton’s asking price may have dropped.",
      "But if Amorim determines that he needs midfield reinforcements before the September 1 deadline, here are some other, cheaper alternatives…",
      "Monaco’s highly-rated 21-year-old, who has previously been linked with Tottenham, could be an option. An asking price of around the £53m mark – almost half of what it could cost to sign Baleba – has been reported.",
      "Camara has already impressed at an English ground, starring for Senegal during their 3-1 friendly victory over England at the City Ground. Suited to the pressing game Amorim wants to play, Camara is adept at both stopping and starting attacks.",
      "There are a number of other cheaper options United could turn to, including Middlesbrough’s Hayden Hackney, 22. Having played under former United midfielder Michael Carrick, who was sacked by Boro earlier this summer, Hackney knows how to look after the ball.",
      "He also does an excellent job out of possession too, with the ability to cover a lot of ground. Having not played in the Premier League, he would be one for the future, but could be a very wise investment.",
      "It seems a matter of of time before Agoume finds himself in the Premier League, with Arsenal believed to hold an interest in the Sevilla middleman.",
      "The 23-year-old starred for France at the recent European Under-21 Championship, his final age-group tournament. He will now be looking to take his game to the next level for both club and country.",
      "A lofty, combative midfielder, Agoume doesn’t take any prisoners, which could be just what Amorim’s midfield needs. He’s not lacking technically either and is capable of swashbuckling runs forward.",
      "A more unlikely target compared to the aforementioned trio but Wharton could still be a cheaper option than Baleba. The England midfielder was linked with Liverpool earlier this summer, with a fee of £75-80m mooted.",
      "Contracted to Palace until 2029 and with no release clause, the FA Cup winners are in a mightily strong position when it comes to one of their prized assets. However, given his immense quality, interest in him is sure to grow. United should be keeping tabs on his situation.",

At the time of writing, United are yet to confirm Sesko’s switch to Old Trafford - but an announcement is not far off. It's expected the 22-year-old will officially be unveiled in front of fans ahead of the club’s pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.",

      "Club legend Paul Scholes has already shared his thoughts on Sesko’s arrival and suggested that he needs to hit the ground running. Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, he said: \"From the point of Sesko... he'll have more chance at Newcastle to develop which he needs.",
      "“Now to be a Manchester United centre-forward, as we've found with Hojlund, a 22-year-old kid, you've got to be ready. It's got to be now.",

      "Reports in Italy have claimed that chiefs from the Italian side will fly to the UK to hold talks with their Red Devils colleagues. But Hojlund’s stance could put a deal in jeopardy, having expressed his desire to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "He said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes. I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 (like Erling Haaland).",
      "\"But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics. Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season so far. Just focusing on continuing that.",
      "\"Competition is fine with me. It sharpens me. I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",

He was one of the five players who made up Ruben Amorim's so-called 'Bomb Squad' after expressing a desire to leave Old Trafford this summer.

      "Fellow new recruits Diego Leon and Matheus Cunha will also be hoping to make their first Old Trafford appearances as United players after featuring during the tour.",
      "You can follow LIVE updates and analysis from Old Trafford via the blog below...",
      "Another short corner from United leads to a cross coming in from the right, finding Heaven, and he heads straight at De Gea.",
      "United's centre-backs have made their presence known inside the box in this first half.",
      "Mbeumo and Amad are developing a really good connection already. Cunha has been on the fringes so far, though. He had a quick conflab with Amorim a few minutes earlier. Fernandes also headed over for some guidance.",
      "Fiorentina are going to have to make a change earlier than scheduled. Defender Comuzzo has gone down and cannot continue. Kouadio is coming on to replace him.",
      "United will be thinking they should be ahead. Mbeumo plays a corner short to Amad, gets the return and sends over a cross that finds the head of Yoro, who heads towards goal and is somehow denied by De Gea. It was a brilliant save.",
      "Fiorentina didn't think that goal should have stood after some pulling of shirts in the box, but both sets of players were guilty of handbags. Casemiro and Yoro challenged for the ball at the back post and were rewarded with an own-goal.",
      "United have looked particularly dangerous down the left and won the corner from that side.",
      "United are back level. Fernandes sends over a corner with plenty of pace and Gosens, under pressure from Yoro and Casemiro, puts the ball into his own net.",
      "Fernandes is growing into this and just played a decent pass to Mount, although the move was thwarted when Mbeumo was fouled down the right side. Casemiro isn't giving Fernandes much help and, somehow, he actually looks slower than usual. He runs at the pace of a snail and takes far too long to accelerate.",

He's the only certainty to start against Arsenal as Amorim has opted for rotation with the other four centre halves. Maguire has looked leggy out there amid his lack of game time and Heaven's only start in pre-season before today was against West Ham in New Jersey.",
      "Casemiro demonstrated there why United need a midfielder. The prospect of him as one of four out-and-out midfielders is an undeniable issue, particularly when United are not in a Uefa competition. He reserved his finest form for the Europa League last season.",
      "Mbeumo was in the centre of the defence just there and I'm not sure how that happened. There looks to be some teething problems with the system in the opening few minutes, which is strange because United looked impressively organised during their USA tour.",
      "Fernandes was demanding more urgency from teammates after that and got it as United entered the Fiorentina area. Defensively, that was appalling. The corner was a drifter and still somehow evaded everyone. It was a classy finish by Simon Salomon Junor Sohm (it had to be the longest-named player who scored) but United have been playing walking football.",
      "Sohm was completely unmarked in the box from a corner and finished into the bottom right corner. That was really embarrassing defending from United and Amorim did not look happy on the touchline. His hands are in his pockets and he's walking up and down. The bright side is pre-season is the time to get those kinds of mistakes out of their system.",
      "Fiorentina take the lead with less than ten minutes on the clock. A corner from the right is sent in and Sohm ghosted in and fired a composed finish past Bayindir.",
      "Nobody in red picked him up.",
      "It looks like Mount is the false nine, which seems a needless experiment. He's played in midfield, on the right, as a 10 and now a nine. Cunha was not convincing as a false nine against Everton but it would be more logical to actually play a striker. Amorim is just not concealing how he feels about Hojlund any more.",
      "Fiorentina lost 2-0 to Leicester City in their opening pre-season friendly in England and drew 0-0 with Nottingham Forest in their next game. United should be winning today.",
      "You cannot read too much into pre-season performances, but the new Premier League season is just eight days away and the players should approach this seriously.",
      "Sloppy play from United results in Fiorentina being able to move the ball out wide and Kean gets a head to the cross and heads over.",
      "United were a little bit suspect with the ball against Everton in Atlanta last weekend.",
      "Mount has started through the middle for United this lunchtime. I don't think anyone anticipated that when the team news dropped.",
      "He is being supported by Cunha and Mbeumo in attack.",
      "That was a heart warming tribute to David de Gea, who deserved a brilliant reception upon his return to the club. De Gea looked overwhelmed with emotion while Alan Keegan read out his achievements and described him as one of the greatest goalkeepers to have played for the club. Keegan is right.",
      "United's final pre-season friendly of the summer is up and running.",
      "That was an NBA-style entrance for United's four recruits. Each one got a flattering introduction before they emerged from the tunnel.",
      "You know it’s a different crowd when they cannot even be bothered to air David de Gea's actual chant. They've settled for 'Oh, David de Gea' to the White Stripes' Seven Nation Army, one of the most overused tunes for football chants.",
      "Bruno Fernandes makes a presentation to former United goalkeeper David de Gea, who is getting a massive ovation from the crowd. He left the club two years ago and the fans never got a proper chance to say goodbye.",
      "United stadium announcer Alan Keegan has just welcomed Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Diego Leon and Benjamin Sesko out onto the pitch at Old Trafford.",
      "The quartet have been at the centre of what has been a successful transfer window so far this summer.",
      "The countdown to kick-off at Old Trafford is very nearly over. Stay tuned to this live blog for regular updates and analysis from Old Trafford.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim has said Benjamin Sesko is a player with \"great potential\", insisting he is just the sort of character his squad needs.",
      "The striker's move to Old Trafford from RB Leipzig was confirmed on earlier today, putting pen to paper on a five-year deal. He has joined the club for £66.4million with £7.3m in add-ons.",
      "Amorim told MUTV:",
      "\"He has the characteristics that we needed. Ben is a player that, with all the information that we have, we need to stop the guy from working - it is not the opposite! That is also important. He is really young, he is good in the air, he is good running the channels and he is good on the ball, so I think he has great potential. I think he can improve a lot. \"",
      "Click here to read more from Amorim.",
      "David de Gea received a rapturous reception when he emerged to warm up. He's a modern club legend and it\\s superb to see him back at Old Trafford. I'm sure he'll enjoy every minute this afternoon.",
      "Ahead of kick-off this lunchtime, United's summer signings will be introduced to the Old Trafford faitfhul.",
      "Benjamin Sesko became the club's fourth new reruit of the summer this morning, arriving from RB Leipzig, and will be introduced to the fans alongside Diego Leon, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo have both been included in the starting XI this lunchtime.",
      "Click here to read more.",
      "Former United goalkeeper David de Gea starts between the posts for Fiorentina this lunchtime.",
      "He should get the send off he deserved when leaving the club back in 2023.",
      "Casemiro starts in midfield alongside Bruno Fernandes, but something has gone hugely wrong if the Brazilian continues to start Premier League games this season. United need another midfield signing to provide cover to the defensive line. Ugarte has been an unconvincing signing and didn't cover himself in glory in the USA.",
      "It says a lot about Manuel Ugarte that United already need to replace him, just 12 months after his arrival from PSG.",
      "It looks like Matheus Cunha is starting down the middle, with Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount on the right and left side respectively. It will be interesting to see how they line up from the first whistle and I imagine they will be fluid throughout the game.",
      "It's promising to see Mbeumo start again. It's important he gets at least 60 minutes into his legs this afternoon, with a view to starting against Arsenal.",
      "Another pre-season friendly, another different back-three for United. This is the fifth different centre-back combination Ruben Amorim has deployed this summer.",
      "However, Yoro has been a regular fixture and he makes his fourth successive start this lunchtime. He has nailed down the right-sided centre-back berth and is joined in defence by Harry Maguire and Ayden Heaven this lunchtime.",
      "There is not a lot to read into pre-season line-ups but Rasmus Hojlund has started three of United's five friendlies on the bench. We know what needs to happen there, for club and player.",
      "Hojlund suggested he would dig his heels in and stay but people close to him say he will have to leave now that Benjamin Sesko has arrived."

      "Manchester United have confirmed the signing of Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko arrives at Old Trafford for a fee of €76.5million (£66.4m) and €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons, and the striker has signed a five-year contract.",
      "United were confident Sesko preferred a move to Manchester over Newcastle and moved swiftly to wrap up a deal. Newcastle submitted a more lucrative package, but Sesko's preference was decisive.",
      "In a statement, United said: \"Manchester United is pleased to confirm that Benjamin Sesko has joined the club, subject to registration. The Slovenia international has signed a contract until June 2030.",
      "\"Over the past two seasons, Sesko has scored the most goals of any player under the age of 23 in Europe’s top five leagues. The 22-year-old scored 21 goals and registered six assists for RB Leipzig during the last campaign.",
      "\"He has already been capped 41 times and scored 16 goals for Slovenia since becoming his country's youngest-ever debutant in 2021.\"",
      "After Aston Villa reiterated Ollie Watkins was not for sale, United turned their attention to Sesko. This summer was earmarked for a move away from Leipzig for Sesko, who attracted interest from Arsenal at the beginning of the window.",
      "United were interested in signing Sesko in the summer of 2022 and his agent visited Carrington, but the forward decided to sign for Leipzig from the fellow Red Bull franchise FC Salzburg.",
      "Sesko is regarded as one of Europe's most exciting young centre-forwards. He scored 39 goals in 87 appearances for Leipzig and has netted 16 goals in 41 games for Slovenia's national team.",
      "The 22-year-old travelled to Manchester in a private jet on Thursday evening alongside his agent, Elvis Basanovic, to complete his transfer to United.",
      "The confirmation of Sesko's transfer means Ruben Amorim has overhauled his attack in a single window, following a season in which United scored just 44 goals in the Premier League.",
      "United spent an initial combined £127.5m to sign Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo from Wolves and Brentford respectively. United have deliberately gone for Premier League-proven players, but staff believe Sesko can develop into one of the world's best strikers.",
      "Sesko's move creates uncertainty for Rasmus Hojlund. United are prepared to make a PSR loss on Hojlund this summer and are understood to be willing to listen to offers in the region of £30m.",
      "United begin the 2025/26 Premier League campaign against Arsenal next Sunday.",

      "Club chiefs fought tooth and nail to recruit the 22-year-old amid strong competition from Premier League rivals Newcastle United. The Magpies presented the more lucrative offer of the two suitors but in the end it was Sesko's preference to join Ruben Amorim's team.",

      "The Brazilian inherited the iconic No.10 shirt upon his arrival whilst the Cameroon international has taken up No.19, which was previously worn by Raphael Varane. The final detail of Sesko's transfer to be confirmed is which number he will wear.",
      "His favoured No.30, which he wore for Leipzig and Red Bull Salzburg, is not on offer as that was taken by full-back Diego Leon when he arrived earlier this summer.",
      "But there may be the opportunity to take up the No.21 he previously held playing for FC Liefering between 2019 and 2021. Those digits are currently occupied by Antony, who is actively trying to leave Old Trafford.",
      "The lowest available number to the Slovenian star right now is the No.14, which was worn last by Christian Eriksen until his departure at the end of last season. Other potential options include the No.20 - vacated by Diogo Dalot - plus the numbers 27, 28, 29, 31, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39 and 40.",
      "It is unclear when the decision will be made exactly but United have confirmed their new arrivals are to be unveiled at Old Trafford prior to kick-off in Saturday's friendly against Fiorentina.

      "Manchester United are preparing for a hectic end to the summer transfer window. After getting Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo through the door earlier in the window, Ruben Amorim could still welcome three new players to his squad.",
      "Improvements to United's attack have been made with Cunha and Mbeumo adding 35 Premier League goals to a team that struggled in front of goal. Diego Leon has also arrived from Paraguay to become the latest wonderkid to be signed under Ineos.",
      "It's expected the Slovenia striker will be unveiled as Amorim's new centre-forward at Old Trafford on Saturday ahead of the pre-season friendly against Fiorentina. With three weeks until the window slams, United have two more positions to deal with.",
      "Another new goalkeeper has been touted since the window opened, but a replacement for Andre Onana currently seems unlikely to come in. The priority after Sesko is expected to be a new midfielder - with Brighton's ball-winning sensation Carlos Baleba on their radar.",
      "It's been reported that United have made contact with the Seagulls - via intermediaries - over the possibility of a move for the Cameroon international. Since signing from LOSC Lille, Baleba has attracted interest with his displays at the AMEX Stadium and United are huge admirers.",
      "However, it has been widely reported that Brighton value the midfielder at £100million, a figure close to the one they received for Moises Caicedo in 2023 - from Chelsea. It's clear United would have to construct a near-perfect financial package to reach an agreement.",
      "Despite Brighton's asking price, the latest figures released by the CIES Football Observatory indicate the midfielder should be valued between €75m (£65m) and €87m (£75.4m). Using a sample of over 8,000 transfers, the website evaluates prices of players from the five major European top-flights using the statistical technique of multiple linear regression, with fees paid by clubs as an independent variable.",
      "It's understood that Brighton don't want to sell Baleba - at least for another year - but that hasn't stopped them cashing in on other highly-rated players, such as Joao Pedro, Alexis Mac Allister and Pervis Estupinan, throughout the years.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, United are aware that the Seagulls will be hard to negotiate with. However, it's still reckoned that Baleba would be ready to say yes to a move to Old Trafford this summer, even without the prospect of them playing in Europe.",

      "'Take me home, United road' is a pre-match staple at Old Trafford nowadays.",
      "And incoming signing Benjamin Sesko is poised to hear Manchester United fans belt it out for the very first time ahead of Saturday's pre-season finale against Fiorentina.",
      "The plan is for him to be unveiled to his new army of supporters ahead of the clash with the Italian side, similarly to the way Rasmus Hojlund was presented to the fans ahead of United's penultimate pre-season friendly of the summer against RC Lens two years ago.",
      "Like Hojlund, there is also a very high probability Sesko will make his United debut against Arsenal. Furthermore, they have also ended up at Old Trafford via spells in Austria.",
      "With the duo sharing a cluster of similarities, United supporters will just be hoping Sesko is more potent inside the penalty area. The Slovenian is on the cusp of joining the club from RB Leipzig in a deal that is going to cost £73.7million.",
      "He arrived in Manchester on Thursday evening and is now in the process of putting the finishing touches to the move. He will become United's fourth signing of the summer and their third new addition to the attacking department.",
      "After finishing last season with a negative goal difference of -10, United have prioritised attacking signings this summer. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo arrived from Wolves and Brentford on the back of highly successful seasons, scoring 17 and 20 goals respectively.",
      "Sesko is on the brink of joining the Reds on the back of a 21-goal season in Germany. Given he did not turn 22 until the very end of May, 21 goals in a season at the age of 21 marked a respectable haul.",
      "It marked the second time he had smashed his way through the 20-goal barrier in a single season in his senior career. He scored 13 times in the Bundesliga and chipped in with four goals apiece in the Champions League and DFB-Pokal.",
      "He previously went beyond the 20-goal barrier in 2020/21, also scoring 21 times, during a season-long loan spell at FC Liefering in the Austrian second division.",
      "In comparison, Hojlund has never scored 20 goals or more in a single season in his senior career. His best return in a single campaign is 16 - a landmark he reached in his first season at United and previously in the 2022/23 campaign.",
      "Hojlund's record in his first season at Old Trafford was very respectable. Considering he had joined United injured and immediately found himself at the top of the pecking order with no adequate support in his department, it was a promising maiden season at the club.",
      "However, he regressed last season, scoring just ten goals, of which only four of them were scored in the Premier League. United need to be able to rely on a striker who is capable of scoring 20 goals a season, and Hojlund does not look like being that player.",
      "With the exception of Erling Haaland, whose record can only be described as freakish, not many young strikers have arrived in the Premier League in recent seasons and immediately hit the ground running by scoring a lorry load of goals.",
      "There is no guarantee of Sesko, despite being compared with Haaland, following in the Norwegian's footsteps, but United will take confidence from the fact he has smashed his way through the 20-goal-a-season barrier - and so recently.",
      "At the age of 22, the weight of pressure on Sesko's shoulders will be unlike anything he has experienced before. Few positions in world football are scrutinised as much as the centre-forward position at United.",
      "Sesko built up a respectable record at Leipzig, scoring 39 goals in 87 games. His Bundesliga record stands at 27 goals in 64 games.",
      "Signing him for such an eye-watering fee, United will demand instant results from him. However, they will take comfort from the fact he will be playing alongside two attackers so well-versed in the Premier League - and that could make a world of difference.",
      "Hojlund, by contrast, did not have that luxury. He was brought in to be the main man with no support acts.",
      "The pair of them have taken similar routes to Old Trafford, and they could both make their debuts against the same opponent. United will just be hoping the end result is different.",
      "The countdown is on to the 2025/26 Premier League campaign - and our pre-season guide is the ideal way to prepare for the action ahead.",

      "David De Gea is set to make his first return to Old Trafford since his Manchester United exit on Saturday.",
      "The 34-year-old left United in June 2023 - after 12 years with the club. During that time, De Gea made 545 appearances, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup and Europa League among other honours.",
      "However, De Gea departed United following the expiration of his contract, leaving him as a free agent.",
      "United, meanwhile, replaced the Spain international with Andre Onana in a £47.5million deal from Inter Milan.",
      "There had been talk that De Gea could return straight to action and move to Saudi Arabia, but the ex-Atletico Madrid stopper instead spent a considerable amount of time out of the game. Indeed, De Gea did not sign for another club for more than 12 months - until August 2024 - when he made the move to Serie A side Fiorentina.",
      "De Gea made his debut in the Conference League against Puskas Akademia and went on to have a top debut season in Florence. In total, De Gea made 42 appearances, keeping 11 clean sheets and conceding just 50 goals.",
      "Now, De Gea, who signed a new three-year contract at Fiorentina back in May, is expected to make his return to United on Saturday when his side travel to Old Trafford for a pre-season friendly.",
      "But exactly how does De Gea feel about United, two years since he left the club? Well, speaking last summer, the Spaniard had nothing but positive things to say about his former employers.",
      "In his press conference after signing for Fiorentina, in August 2024, De Gea said: \"United is a top, top club and my heart will always be there. I never thought about retiring, it was just difficult to find motivations for a new chapter after 12 years at a top club like Manchester United... and I finally felt that at Fiorentina.",
      "\"I spent a year in Manchester, before returning to Madrid. I wanted to stay at a high level. I didn't stop. It's not easy to train alone. I spent two years in Manchester, it's my home. That's where my heart is set.",
      "\"It was difficult for me to find motivation to evaluate offers, so I decided to take a sabbatical.",
      "\"I am fit, I trained every day, even more than before. I am on a good level. Perhaps it will take some time in the first games, but I've been playing for many years, so you just need to put me in goal.\"",
      "De Gea's Fiorentina have already played two matches on English soil this week. They lost 2-0 to EFL Championship side Leicester City last Sunday before being held to a 0-0 draw at Nottingham Forest on Tuesday.",
      "As well as welcoming De Gea back, United will hold a presentation pre-match to honour De Gea's time at the club. Bruno Fernandes will lead the presentation - which will take place ahead of kick-off.",

      "Of those, only the latter has secured a move away after joining Barcelona on loan. Malacia spent the second half of last season on loan at PSV, but they did not exercise their option to make that move permanent.",
      "The defender commented on Lake's post that carries the caption 'Home stretch. Matthew 5:14-16 \"You are the light of the world\", proclaiming: \"God is great.\" Joshua Zirkzee, another of his teammates during their time together at Feyenoord, responded by saying: \"Love it bro go get em !!\"",

      "Manchester United have identified Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba as a potential target this summer.",
      "The Athletic reported this week that initial contact has already been made with the south coast club, though any potential arrival would, likely, depend on player departures - following United's summer spending spree. Marcus Rashford has already left the club to join Barcelona on loan, while talks over Alejandro Garnacho's move to Chelsea are still ongoing - although the Argentina international has reportedly already agreed on personal terms.",
      "Meanwhile, Baleba, who has three years remaining on his Brighton contract, is quickly emerging as one of the most highly-rated players in his position and has attracted the attention of the United hierarchy.",
      "According to ESPN, Brighton will demand €120million (£104m) for Baleba this summer. United are also mooted to face competition from Manchester City for his signature.",
      "Elsewhere, talkSPORT has suggested that the Seagulls would be willing to cash in on the midfielder, but not until next summer.",
      "Brighton's hierarchy reportedly believe Baleba has the potential to be as valuable as Moises Caicedo, whom they sold to Chelsea. Caicedo completed the transfer to Stamford Bridge, for a British record fee of £115million, in 2023.",
      "Toby Collyer will not be included as a makeweight in any potential deal for Baleba. While reports have stated he could be used as a sweetener to facilitate a proposed transfer - given his background within Brighton's academy before departing in 2022 - United have no plans to involve him in the negotiations.",
      "Born in Worthing, just 10 miles from Brighton, Collyer appeared destined to break into the first-team at the Amex Stadium before being released by the club. His future remains uncertain this summer.",
      "The midfielder has attracted loan interest, and there is also said to be interest from clubs looking to sign him on a permanent basis.",
      "Brighton's chief executive, Paul Barber, has played down speculation that United have been in contact over the possibility of signing Baleba.",
      "\"We've got some great talent, there's always going to be interest in our players,\" Barber said. Manchester United have not been in touch with me. From that point of view, speculation is speculation.",
      "\"We will always try to make sure we sell our best players at the right time, not just for the player but for us. If we end up doing that with any player, it's with the view to leave Fabian with a competitive squad, whatever happens. We don't want to sell our best players.",
      "\"Carlos is a fantastic talent who has a lot of years ahead of him.",
      "\"We hope he will be here for many years to come. But it's something that, as always, is subjective to the dynamics of the football world which isn't always predictable.\""

      "Saudi reports claimed Fernandes had been offered a multi-million pound financial package to move to Al-Hilal. However, there was no formal contact between the clubs and Fernandes rejected their proposal.",

      "Al Nassr's manager, Jorge Jesus, has admitted he wanted to bring Fernandes to Saudi, but he was informed the midfielder had already committed to remaining in Manchester.",
      "“I wanted to,\" Jesus told Sport Informa when asked about signing Fernandes. \"But Bruno decided on staying. We had already spoken last year. This year I knew he had made the decision to continue with Amorim.\"",
      "In June, Fernandes touched on his desire to play at the highest level when he explained his decision to reject Al-Hilal. And former Benfica boss Jesus reacted: “He is in a league that they say is the best in the world, but I do not agree. For me, it is the Spanish league [La Liga].\"",
      "When Fernandes discussed his decision, he said: \"It was a very exciting offer. The president of Al Hilal was very nice to me. They talked to my agent, but I spoke to my wife and family, and she asked me what I wanted to do with my future. Never did she say yes or no, or offer to make the decision for me.",
      "\"She's always been behind me with every decision. It would have been easy to change, even from a family point of view, as Ruben Neves and João Cancelo are there [with Al-Hilal].",
      "\"Our kids are used to each other, I'm used to them, but I want to play at the highest possible level, playing in the major competitions and I know I still can. And I'm happy about my decision.\"",

      "According to reports, three ‘vitally important’ factors helped Manchester United beat Newcastle United in the race to sign Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Sesko‘s move to Man Utd was announced on Saturday morning after the Red Devils struck a deal with German outfit RB Leipzig worth around £73m with add-ons.",
      "Man Utd faced competition from Newcastle United for Sesko, though the Red Devils proved that their pulling power still exists by fending off their Premier League rivals to land the 22-year-old.",
      "Therefore, Sesko is the third Man Utd summer signing to snub Newcastle for the Red Devils, as Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha also favoured a move to Old Trafford over St James’ Park.",
      "After completing his move to Man Utd, Sesko revealed what “really excites” him about the Red Devils.",
      "“The history of Manchester United is obviously very special but what really excites me is the future,” Sesko said in an interview for United’s official website.",
      "READ: Man Utd move above Arsenal as Liverpool still the biggest spenders in 2025 summer transfer window",
      "“When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "“From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.",
      "“I cannot wait to start learning from Ruben [Amorim] and connecting with my team-mates to achieve the success that we all know we are capable of together.”",
      "Now, a new report from Football Transfers reporter Duncan Castles has revealed ‘how Man Utd pulled off the Sesko masterclass’.",
      "There are said to be three ‘vitally important’ factors, while Man Utd also ‘threw in a sweetener’ for RB Leipzig.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘The Red Devils will travel to the Bundesliga side in the future for a glamour friendly, which is expected to raise around €1.5m more for Die Roten Bullen.",
      "‘On the player’s part, Sesko will accept a lower wage at Man Utd than he was offered at Newcastle. Furthermore, the agent also accepted a lower commission for his client to sign for the Old Trafford side.",
      "‘The involvement of Man Utd director of recruitment Christopher Vivell was also vitally important for this transfer. The German maintains a close relationship with Sesko and his representative, having previously worked with them in the Red Bull system.’",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed an update on the progress of Benjamin Sesko’s medical ahead of his move to Manchester United.",
      "Man City have joined rivals Man Utd in the race to sign Carlos Baleba from Premier League side Brighton this summer, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Benjamin Sesko and his team have made two sacrifices to force through a move to Premier League giants Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have reached an ‘agreement’ with RB Leipzig over a transfer fee for Benjamin Sesko, who is set for a medical.",
      "Rio Ferdinand has raised two concerns with Manchester United target Benjamin Sesko, but he has backed the 22-year-old to shine for the Red Devils.",
      "While Benjamin Sesko might make Man Utd better, Carlos Baleba definitely would. It’s not too late for Ruben Amorim to put his foot down."

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko and could turn their attention to a Paris Saint-Germain star, while Newcastle United have bid for a centre-back…",
      "With so much transfer talk doing the rounds, we’re here through the summer to sift through the bullsh*t and highlight the whispers that might have some substance.",
      "Each day we’re ranking the top 20 rumours involving Premier League clubs, the higher the link, the more likely we feel they are to become done deals.",
      "So we start with the tittle-tattle…",
      "",
      "20) 🔼 Gianluigi Donnarumma – PSG to Manchester United\nThis rumour keeps coming and going, but PSG’s signing of Lucas Chevalier certainly opens the door for Donnarumma’s departure, which was unthinkable when he was thwarting Arsenal, Aston Villa and Liverpool in the Champions League. ESPN reckon United, Chelsea and Inter are expected to make an offer. The Italian goalkeeper is in the final 12 months of his contract…",
      "",
      "19) Marc Guehi – Crystal Palace to Newcastle\nThe story goes that Newcastle are back in for the England defender after a failed pursuit last summer. Now he’s in the final year of his Palace contract, Guehi is available for £40m but Liverpool remain his preferred destination. And we wouldn’t be surprised to see Chelsea enter the race now Levi Colwill is crocked.",

      "",
      "18) 🆕 Bradley Barcola – PSG to Liverpool\nReports in France suggest Barcola is being considered as an alternative to Alexander Isak now that Darwin Nunez is on his way. But there are also suggestions that the Reds are not on the 23-year-old’s tail so we very much doubt this is a go-er. Nunez will be replaced, though.",
      "",
      "17) Jadon Sancho – Manchester United to Anyone\nIt was reported ages ago that an agreement had been reached with Juventus but nothing happened. Then Dortmund started sniffing again but still nothing happens. This will almost certainly go the way we expected it to: a loan move, late in the window when United get desperate to shift Sancho’s salary. At least they banked £5million when Chelsea decided they would prefer to pay to not sign him.",
      "MORE: Ten-striker transfer domino starts with Sesko to Newcastle and ends with Wissa via Isak to Liverpool",
      "",
      "16) 🔽 Carlos Baleba – Brighton to Manchester United\nBaleba would make United a very passable football team. But United are dealing with Brighton, which isn’t easy even when they aren’t reluctant to sell. Apparently, their preference is to hold on to the midfielder for another year before banking another record fee. If United – and Baleba, if that is his preference – can force the issue, they should. But we just can’t see it this summer.",
      "",
      "15) 🆕 Jorgen Strand Larsen – Wolves to Newcastle\nLarsen could be the next player to get the opportunity to snub Newcastle while they continue to tread on rakes. There have been whispers of the Toon’s interest in the striker throughout the summer, and Wolves could see an opportunity to milk their desperation.",
      "",
      "14) Samu Aghehowa – Porto to Newcastle\nVilla were interested before they spent £26million on Evann Guessand and we know Porto will sell if the price is right, so this could be a go-er. Assuming Newcastle bank a fee for Isak, Porto will want as close as possible to the £86million release clause in the 21-year-old’s contract. Or at least something like the Toon were willing to pay for Sesko.",
      "",
      "13) Jack Grealish – Manchester City to Everton\nEverton want to give Grealish the get-out he needs from City but the Toffees will have to haggle hard over who pays the bulk of the winger’s wages since he currently earns well over double that of their highest earner. We want to see the old Grealish back and that could happen at Everton.",
      "",
      "12) 🆕 Dango Ouattara – Bournemouth to Brentford\nApparently, the Bees are one of a few clubs to have been in touch about the 23-year-old, who has told Bournemouth that he wants to explore his options. With all due respect, though, we doubt he had Brentford in mind when he was thinking about taking the next step.",
      "",
      "11) 🔽 Alexander Isak – Newcastle to Liverpool\nLiverpool’s first bid for Isak was made a week ago and very swiftly rejected by Newcastle. It was so emphatically rejected, in fact, that the champions reportedly won’t make a second bid. That leaves Isak in a very sticky situation, having burned plenty of bridges in the north east. But we doubt this is dead yet. And it is in Newcastle’s interest to drag it out beyond August 25th.",
      "RANKING: Isak crashes into best available strikers ranking as Liverpool eye £130m Newcastle rebel",
      "",
      "10) 🆕 Harvey Elliott – Liverpool to Tottenham\nThomas Frank was, well, frank in admitting that Spurs will need a replacement for James Maddison after the playmaker was ruled out for much of the season with an ACL injury. This makes sense if the two clubs can make the numbers work. And Liverpool want that number to be around £40million. RB Leipzig are keen. The Germans are unlikely to compete in a bidding war but they could offer a buy-back option which is said to be part of the conditions Liverpool have laid out.",
      "",
      "9) Eberechi Eze – Crystal Palace to Arsenal\nEze is the Gunners’ next top target after landing Viktor Gyokeres. And the England star has, apparently, been telling his mates he’s moving to the Emirates, but Arsenal are yet to deliver on Palace’s clear demand for his £68million buy-out clause to be met. Andrea Berta will doubtless spend weeks haggling over the number of instalments and Arsenal could really do with selling to make room in the squad and on the books for Eze.",
      "",
      "8) 🆕 Malick Thiaw – AC Milan to Newcastle\nReported by Matteo Moretto and Fabrizio Romano, the Magpies have offered 40 million euros for the Milan centre-back, who is one of the only players who actually wants to join them.",
      "",
      "7) 🔼 Yoane Wissa – Brentford to Newcastle\nEveryone seems to be turning down Newcastle recently, but Wissa is one player who does want to join the Magpies. Strongly enough to go up against Brentford while they rebuff the Toon’s interest. At least until the offers reach around £40million. Brentford want that to lose another of their top players and they can see the desperation dripping off Newcastle.",
      "",
      "6) Xavi Simons – RB Leipzig to Chelsea\nA Chelsea move appeals to Simons and the Blues are keen to make it happen. But they will look for a hefty discount on the £56million RB Leipzig are demanding for the one-time Arsenal target. Banking £20million for Broja will help.",
      "",
      "5) 🔼 Tyler Dibling – Southampton to Everton\nDavid Moyes has voiced his concerns about the Toffees’ lack of transfer activity, and his bosses have taken note. Dibling is reportedly the subject of a £40m offer, but the Saints want more. Dibling has been withdrawn from some aspects of training, though, so a deal cannot be far off.",
      "",
      "4) 🔼 Alejandro Garnacho – Manchester United to Chelsea\nThe Blues have already signed Jamie Gittens this summer and are working on a deal for Xavi Simons. It doesn’t feel like they need Garnacho, but they’ve not required half the players they’ve signed in the Clearlake era. Talks are now ‘advancing’ between Chelsea and United. The Red Devils want at least £40million having watched Noni Madueke move for more.",
      "",
      "3) 🆕 Mads Hermansen – Leicester to West Ham\nIt was going to be Big John Victor, but the “disgraceful” Hammers transfer team shifted to original number-one target Hermansen at the eleventh hour. Poor John. West Ham are reportedly closing in on the Leicester ‘keeper for £18m.",
      "",
      "2) 🔼 Illia Zabarnyi – Bournemouth to PSG\nAndoni Iraola is going to be very short at the back for his side’s Premier League opener against Liverpool. Zabarnyi is set to follow Milos Kerkez and Dean Huijsen out of Bournemouth this summer.",
      "",
      "1) 🔼 Darwin Nunez – Liverpool to Al-Hilal\nA deal has been agreed with Al-Hilal to take Nunez to Saudi for £56million. PIF paying Liverpool big money – over the odds? –  so they can buy Alexander Isak is quite the situation. Given Nunez was so keen to remain in Europe, this one could have a twist yet.",

      "All fees and figures are taken from Transfermarkt. The 20 biggest deals of the summer are here.",
      "",
      "10) Juventus – £102.54m\nAfter sneaking into the Champions League, there was money to spend. Jonathan David on a free transfer might be the coup of the summer but the biggest money has been spent on Francisco Conceicao from Porto.",
      "",
      "9) Tottenham – £120.52m\nSpent a decent whack of money spent on Kevin Danso, Mathys Tel, Luka Vuskovic and Kota Takai before Thomas Frank even got a say. Mohammed Kudus had shot Spurs up into the top three before they were overtaken again; Morgan Gibbs-White would send them scurrying back up the list if they can ever get that deal done.",
      "CHECK OUT: The F365 transfer rumour power ranking",
      "",
      "8) Sunderland – £122.53m\nEight first-team signings have come in. We’re not sure they’re finished, either.",
      "",
      "7) Atletico Madrid – £133.6m\nAlex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Matteo Ruggeri and Marc Pubill have all cost a pretty penny and are aged between 22 and 24 as Diego Simeone rebuilds again. David Hancko completes the spending…for now.",
      "",
      "6) Real Madrid – £144.4m\nThey had already dropped £50m on Dean Huijsen and £8.5m on a few weeks of Trent Alexander-Arnold before they agreed to sign man-child Franco Mastantuono for an awful lot of money. And then came Alvaro Carreras for another £43m.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester City – £153.21m\nThat’s the price of a Rayan Ait-Nouri from Wolves, a Rayan Cherki from Lyon, a Tijanji Reijnders from AC Milan, a Sverre Nypan from Rosenborg, and a James Trafford from Burnley, and all of them feel like bargains.",
      "",
      "4) Arsenal – £194.9m\nThe long-awaited and interminably drawn-out arrival of Viktor Gyokeres nudges Arsenal up towards a £200m summer but has plenty of final-piece-of-the-puzzle vibes as the Gunners leapfrog Real Madrid to make it a Premier League top three.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester United – £208.4m\nThe Red Devils are back near the top of this list after making Benjamin Sesko their third major summer signing after Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha. Ruben Amorim would ‘love’ two more…",
      "",
      "2) Chelsea – £246.1m\nThey were the top spenders in the summers of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and will be up there in 2025 thanks to pre-arranged moves for Estevao, Dario Essugo, Mamadou Sarr and Kendry Paez. Throw in the £30m signing of Liam Delap and the Blues were already making very expensive waves before they signed Joao Pedro for an initial £55m and Jamie Gittens and Jorrel Hato for not much less.",
      "",
      "1) Liverpool – £263.5m\nFlorian Wirtz has cost an initial £100m (yes, it could rise to £116m but we’re not worried about add-ons on this particular list) and now have the top two most expensive signings of the summer after confirming the arrival of Hugo Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt. Full-backs Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez have joined for £29.5m and £40m respectively, and we have also added the £25m on Giorgi Mamardashvili as that transfer will be counted in this summer’s accounts."

      "1) Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool) – £100m rising to £116m\nLiverpool’s quiet summer of 2024 certainly isn’t being repeated 12 months down the line with another Premier League trophy in the cabinet. And while there will certainly be more to come, it’s going to take something pretty special to top this blockbuster nine-figure signing.",
      "",
      "2) Hugo Ekitike (Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool) – £69m rising to £79m with add-ons\nEkitike should send Newcastle his regards for insisting dream Reds target Alexander Isak is not for sale, particularly after the Magpies had their own bid for him turned down before the Premier League champions came calling.",
      "",
      "3) Benjamin Sesko (RB Leipzig to Manchester United) – £66.2m rising to £73.4m with add-ons\nThe Red Devils turned to the 22-year-old after missing out on Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres, as they have taken a huge risk in a Rasmus Hojlund repeat when Ollie Watkins was right there.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford to Manchester United) – £65m rising to £71m with add-ons\nIt was a painfully laborious chase but they’ve got there in the end. Turns out Sir Jim Ratcliffe can be ‘held to ransom’.",
      "",
      "5) Victor Osimhen (Napoli to Galatasaray) – £64.8m\nA pretty underwhelming outcome for Osimhen following years of links with Premier League clubs, especially Chelsea. But fair dos to him for rejecting the Saudi Pro League big bucks…",
      "",
      "6) Matheus Cunha (Wolves to Manchester United) – £62.5m\nSir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting scheme threatened Man Utd’s deal for Cunha as they had a ‘request’ rejected, but they eventually ‘met the terms’.",
      "",
      "7) Luis Diaz (Liverpool to Bayern Munich) – £60.5m rising to £64.8m with add-ons\nThis transfer is bad news for Newcastle fans. Alexander Isak to Liverpool is on, folks…",
      "",
      "8) Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad to Arsenal) – £60m\nLiverpool could not persuade Zubimendi to part with the mountains and food on offer in San Sebastian but when another opportunity to move to the Premier League came around a year later, the midfielder happily hopped aboard the Arsenal bandwagon.",
      "",
      "9) Mateo Retegui (Atalanta to Al Qadsiah) – £56.3m\nRetegui moves to Saudi after finishing as Serie A’s top scorer with 25 goals last season. Quite the coup.",
      "",
      "10) Viktor Gyokeres (Sporting to Arsenal) – £55m rising to £63m with add-ons\nIt is finally done. At last we can rest for five minutes.",
      "",
      "11) Joao Pedro (Brighton to Chelsea) – £55m rising to £60m with add-ons\nTwo years after joining Brighton from Watford for a club-record fee, the Seagulls have doubled their money on the Brazilian with the usual sale to Chelsea.",
      "",
      "12) Mohammed Kudus (West Ham to Tottenham) – £55m\nThis move will go down well in east London, we’re sure.",
      "",
      "13) Anthony Elanga (Nottingham Forest to Newcastle United) – £52m rising to £55m with add-ons\nNewcastle United have finally landed a right winger after missing out on targets in recent windows. Elanga, Anthony Gordon and Alexander Isak is a very fun front three…",
      "",
      "14) Dean Huijsen (Bournemouth to Real Madrid) – £50m\nReal Madrid matched Huijsen’s release clause just a year after he joined the Cherries for just £12.6m. The fee will be paid in three instalments by Real, with his former clubs Juventus due 10% and Malaga 5%.",
      "",
      "15) Jamie Gittens (Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nChelsea didn’t have enough forwards already.",
      "",
      "16) Noni Madueke (Chelsea to Arsenal) – £48.5m rising to £52m with add-ons\nThere was an actual petition launched against the signing of Madueke, who might well have come in handy last season when it turned out Raheem Sterling was no Bukayo Saka.",
      "",
      "17) Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan to Manchester City) – £46.6m rising to £59.2m with add-ons\nThe last of four signings rushed through in the first transfer window to prepare for the Club World Cup, as officially Serie A’s best midfielder in 2024/25 Reijnders might be the most intriguing.",
      "",
      "18) Alvaro Carreras (Benfica to Real Madrid) – £43m\nFive years after leaving Real Madrid for free, the Spanish full-back is returning to the capital for a hefty fee.",
      "",

      "The 22-year-old is considered one of the best young strikers in Europe and he scored 21 goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season.",
      "Arsenal initially looked likely to sign Sesko, but Man Utd and Newcastle United moved to the front of the queue for his signature after the Gunners turned to Gyokeres.",

      "On Friday, a report from The Telegraph revealed two signings wanted by Amorim and three potential were named.",
      "‘Ruben Amorim would love to add a defensive midfielder and new goalkeeper before the September 1 deadline. United have explored the costs involved in a potential deal for Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba.",
      "‘They made an enquiry about Gianluigi Donnarumma earlier in the summer, although it remains to be seen if they follow up their interest in the Italy goalkeeper who has entered the final 12 months of his contract at Paris St-Germain and could be available for the right price.",

      "With Spurs confirming the worst about James Maddison’s ACL injury and Thomas Frank offering a gloomy update on the fitness of Dejan Kulusevski after a 4-0 pre-season friendly defeat to Bayern Munich, it looks certain they will have to go back into the transfer market to do something about their moribund attacking options.",
      "Even the seemingly perfect – if emotional – end to Son Heung-min’s Tottenham career looks slightly different in the light of Maddison’s serious injury. The mischievous among you might well ask whether Spurs would even still have sanctioned his exit had the cat not been so entirely out of the bag before that game against Newcastle in Seoul.",
      "That’s a hypothetical, though, and what Spurs need is something real. Worth remembering they were pretty keen on signing Morgan Gibbs-White even before this Maddison setback. That ended… badly for Spurs. They could really do with at least one of these ending rather better over the next week or so.",
      "",
      "Nico Paz (Como)\nThere are conflicting reports about the seriousness and even existence of Spurs’ interest in the Como playmaker, but there would be something amiss if the 20-year-old wasn’t at least on their radar even before the last week’s unpleasantness.",
      "He would appear to have all the necessary tools for Spurs’ needs, but it’s a deeply difficult deal to do at a price Spurs are going to like with his former club Real Madrid entitled to 50 per cent of any fee and in keen and observant possession of a buy-back clause.",
      "",
      "Harvey Elliott (Liverpool)\nPerhaps not the most exciting of the options within the Premier League but in some ways the most interesting. After the way Elliott starred for England U21s this summer we really are incredibly keen to see what he can do given a full season of proper first-choice, first-team responsibility and there’s a compelling case that Spurs would now be the most fascinating place for that to happen.",
      "There really isn’t another club right now that can offer the same mix of opportunity and big stage for Elliott to prove he can take his age-group dominance into senior football.",
      "There’s nothing wrong with being happy as a vital and useful squad member at this excellent Liverpool side, but it does feel like he could be so much more somewhere else.",
      "",
      "Jack Grealish (Man City)\nIt seems like he’s going to be a key figure in the final weeks of the transfer window. It’s felt like everyone’s been playing a waiting game with Grealish this summer. We all know he’s going to leave City; the question is when and where to.",
      "We get the sense that he’s not yet ready to commit to the kind of teams that might have him at the top of their shopping list, and the teams he might be ready to commit to haven’t yet worked down their list of targets far enough to reach him.",
      "But the time where this game of chicken ends feels closer than ever after that Maddison injury. Even if it doesn’t kick Spurs into desperate action to find out whether the Aston Villa playmaker version of Grealish is still there lurking within the Guardiola automaton, it will surely make other interested parties get a wriggle on.",
      "We’re really not sure we want to see this one, purely because it would mean finding a new player to take second place on our list of the most Spurs player never to actually play for Spurs. Top spot is and always will be, of course, Stewart Downing’s.",
      "",
      "Ebere Eze (Crystal Palace)\nTottenham’s interest here is long-standing but Arsenal appear to have stolen a march on their local rivals this summer. But that deal remains undone and the chance for Spurs to make another move of their own is still there.",
      "Can they offer what Arsenal can? They cannot, but that cuts both ways. They can certainly offer him an easier route to unquestioned first-choice selection for 50-odd games in a World Cup year, for instance.",
      "As ever when talking about potential departures from Palace this summer, though, it is worth noting that they themselves are neither desperate nor particularly keen to sell any of their FA Cup-winning stars at this time. This will not be a cheap option.",
      "",
      "Xavi Simons (RB Leipzig)\nAnother high-class option where the interest is long-standing but the attentions of a London rival may render it moot. Chelsea have appeared Simons’ likeliest destination for most of the summer, and again the only real card Spurs have to play is in offering fewer existing players standing in his way.",
      "And that feels like it’s got more chance of counting for something with Eze than it does Simons. And we’re not sure it’s got that much chance with Eze.",

      "",
      "Morgan Rogers (Aston Villa)\nRogers’ name popped up briefly in connection with Spurs earlier in the summer and there’s a good chance the boat has been missed here, with any deal far more likely before the PSR deadline than after it.",
      "He also limped out of Villa’s 4-0 friendly win over Roma on Wednesday night, raising doubts about his participation in the early weeks of the season. Something that might, counter-intuitively, not be the worst news for Villa in the long-term.",
      "They remain keen to tie him down to a new contract but are surely primed to expect at least a phone call from London. One that very likely also mentions the words ‘Jacob’ and ‘Ramsey’.",
      "",
      "Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nReality bit for Mainoo in a difficult 24/25 season and there remain doubts about where he best fits into Ruben Amorim’s system at Manchester United. Is he physical enough for a role in the midfield double-pivot? Is he creative enough to be one of the two number 10s?",
      "After a summer full of talk suggesting he could be on the move, the tone has shifted. It now appears more likely he’ll remain at Old Trafford for now, but with United continuing to chuck all sorts of money at all sorts of players it does still feel like some will need recouping somewhere along the way; Mainoo could yet emerge as something of a spare part.",
      "Whether he’s exactly the sort of player Spurs need to take on such a significant creative burden in what currently looks like a team of honest plodders is less certain, but he does possess that Maddison-like ability to unlock a defence with a clever pass others might spot.",
      "",
      "Mikkel Damsgaard (Brentford)\nLook, at some point in this kind of list it is an absolute and irrefutable law that you must pose the question “Who has done this job for the manager elsewhere?”",
      "Damsgaard might not have got the same attention as your Bryan Mbeumos or Yoane Wissas at Brentford last season, but he was a key figure in their attacking efforts and reached double figures for assists.",
      "Frank obviously knows all about a player who started 34 Premier League games for the Bees last season – and came off the bench in all the other four – and he wouldn’t command the price tag of many others on this list. At 25, he’s also a potential long-term rather than stop-gap solution.",
      "But he has five years left on his contract and Brentford’s interest in losing another key figure this summer – and this late on – would, we suggest, be fairly low.",
      "",
      "Lucas Paqueta (West Ham)\nThe very idea of Spurs signing anyone from West Ham was a ludicrous one until as recently as this very summer, and we’ll cheerfully concede that when the first talk of Mohammed Kudus joining Tottenham emerged in June we immediately dismissed the idea and assumed the Hammers and/or Kudus’ camp were simply trying to smoke out interest from elsewhere.",
      "But no. With West Ham no longer quite sure about Kudus after a Difficult Second Season, Spurs came up with a sum of money sufficient to overcome the Hammers’ intrinsic unwillingness to do business with the north London mob.",
      "With Paqueta now free to resume his career after being cleared of spot-fixing charges that looked set to land him a lifetime ban, talk has instantly resumed about whether that career will indeed continue at West Ham.",
      "He had been poised to join Man City before it all kicked off, and they have been mentioned again. In a move that could take out two of the 10 options here in one swoop, there has been talk of City using Grealish as a makeweight in that deal. And you have to concede that Grealish at West Ham feels, if anything, even more correct than Grealish at Tottenham. Although that could just be the colour scheme.",
      "",
      "Mason Mount (Manchester United)\nHas been one of Manchester United’s best players in pre-season, which is admittedly a little bit like saying the bread has been one of the most appealing elements of a dogsh*t sandwich, but still.",
      "It may be that he’s done enough to convince Amorim he can turn around his MAN UNITED NIGHTMARE rather than needing the seemingly inevitable ESCAPE ROUTE from it, but we do still find ourselves wondering where exactly a player whose career has shambled down a cul-de-sac fits in at United.",
      "Whether anyone looking to resurrect a career gone backwards would be wise or keen to attempt that challenge at this iteration of Tottenham is another valid consideration.",
      "Arsenal are still planning to make moves for Real Madrid winger Rodrygo and Crystal Palace attacking midfielder Eberechi Eze, according to reports.",
      "Arsenal have been ‘offered’ the chance to sign Atalanta winger Ademola Lookman this summer as they look to sign another attacker, according to reports.",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have picked out ‘three’ potential replacements for James Maddison and will ‘meet all’ of Liverpool’s ‘demands’.",
      "Spurs are on the lookout for some reinforcements after James Maddison was ruled out for the majority of the season.",
      "Tottenham Hotspur have been dealt a huge blow as the severity of James Maddison’s injury has been confirmed as they plot a raid on Aston Villa.",
      "With a trio of Arsenal targets occupying the top two spots, here are the top 10 attacking midfielders who are available for transfer this summer."

      "Now, the signing of RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko – who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season – looks imminent to round out the attack.",
      "Once that move is complete, though finances might make it a struggle, United could look to improve the midfield. Caught Offside reports attention could be turned there, with Como midfielder Nico Paz looking ideal to add both quality and creativity to the Red Devils.",
      "After Tottenham began contact for the transfer, the report suggests United and Chelsea ‘could be next’. They state there could be a battle between the three sides for ‘one of the hottest names in European football’.",
      "Paz, in his first season with Como, scored six goals and assisted nine more in 35 games, and had his former side Real Madrid looking at him for a while before they reportedly opted against bringing him back.",
      "Paz is said to be valued around €70million (£60.6m), with it suggested there is a clause in place for him, as the report states Como would like to agree a new contract to remove those so they can cash in on him for more.",
      "Reports have suggested that Tottenham have already opened the bidding for Paz, at €40million (£34.6m) and it was said it was rejected, but those reports have been denied by Spurs sources.",
      "Though United are said to be showing strong interest, it seems it would be difficult for them to pay a big sum, given they have already parted with around £130million this summer, and another £74million will leave their account for Sesko.",
      "Chelsea too have paid big money for a lot of players this season, but they have also registered big sales, such as Noni Madueke and Joao Felix.",
      "As such, they might well be able to finance a deal for Paz, beating their Premier League rivals to the Spaniard’s signature.",
      "The report does also suggest there is a chance Real could activate their buyback clause for Paz, which is said to be much lower than what Como currently value him at.",
      "It rises by €1million each year, but will only reach €10million (£8.6m) by 2027, according to reports, so while Real are said to have left the scene for now, they might well be back at any point if Como don’t sell Paz."

      "Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a Manchester United flop ‘insists’ on staying at the club despite them having ‘definitively opened doors’ to his exit.",
      "United are moving to improve upon a 15th-placed Premier League finish last term. They have signed two quality Premier League attackers in Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, and are closing in on RB Leipzig star striker Benjamin Sesko, who scored 21 goals in all competitions last season.",
      "Current United striker Rasmus Hojlund‘s future has been up in the air all summer, with United reported at times to be unsure whether to keep him or let him go after he struggled massively in front of goal last season.",
      "Transfer insider Romano has revealed that United have opted for something in the middle of those two options, as they have ‘definitively opened doors’ for his loan exit, but there’s a twist.",
      "Indeed, Romano suggests that Hojlund ‘insists on staying at United’.",
      "He states AC Milan are in contact with his agents to advance for the deal, with the Red Devils angling for a loan fee of €6million (£5.2m) as well as having Hojlund’s full salary covered.",
      "But there seems a chance the striker could refuse the move in order to prove himself at United. That would be hard, though, as opportunities are likely to be limited after last season’s four-goal Premier League return, and the presence of current striker Joshua Zirkzee and soon Sesko, too.",
      "United’s thoughts on Hojlund have changed recently, too, as Romano said of late: “Højlund is saying, obviously, that he wants to stay at Manchester United, he wants to fight for his place, but if Man United sign a top striker like Sesko, Højlund can still leave the club.",
      "“No one from Man United told Højlund, ‘you have to go, you have to leave,’ but obviously if a top striker like Benjamin Sesko joins Manchester United, for Højlund it could be time to go and leave the club.",
      "“Don’t forget the interest from Italy, especially from AC Milan, who are looking for a striker. At the moment, financially, it’s still considered too expensive; it’s not the only option, because Milan are also considering a move for Dusan Vlahovic.”",
      "That differs from their current stance that the door is open for the striker to leave.",
      "Following on from that, it’s been suggested that Milan’s view is they’re ready to sign Hojlund, with United happy to see him go, but there’s been no green light from him, and it looks like it will stay that way.",

      "Liverpool, Manchester United, Man City and Real Madrid have all incorporated recycled plastic into their kits but more needs to be done for sustainability.",
      "",
      "Football kits have morphed from humble cotton shirts into technological, fashion-driven apparel packed with synthetic fibres.",
      "But beneath the slick designs and vibrant club badges lies a hidden environmental cost.",
      "Most kits are made from polyester, a plastic derived from fossil fuels that is notorious for its carbon footprint, microplastic shedding and waste generation. Major brands such as Adidas, Nike and Puma have unveiled sustainability initiatives. Yet questions remain about whether these efforts meaningfully change the game or simply greenwash it.",
      "From microplastic pollution to soaring carbon emissions and textile waste, the synthetic nature of modern football kits is problematic. Washing polyester garments releases tiny plastic particles into waterways, entering the food chain.",
      "It is estimated that only about nine per cent of all plastic is ever recycled. Most persists in the environment for centuries, as microplastics break down into smaller and smaller particles. Recycling and reuse may not be an adequate solution.",
      "“Recycling is the mop,” Jacqueline Savitz of Oceana, a non-profit organisation dedicated to protecting and restoring the world’s oceans, told PBS. “We need to first turn off the faucet.”",
      "The carbon cost of virgin polyester is also high. Producing new polyester consumes significant energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, while the fast turnaround of kit releases – driven by fan demand, marketing and trends – adds to the mountain of textile waste. Simply recycling used kits doesn’t address this systemic overproduction.",
      "Brand initiatives tackle some of these issues. Adidas, for example, launched the Primeblue and Primegreen programmes in collaboration with Parley for the Oceans, using recycled ocean plastic in their performance fabrics. Primeblue contains Parley Ocean Plastic, while Primegreen contains no virgin plastic. These fabrics were designed to help Adidas meet their commitment to eliminate virgin polyester use by the end of last year and reduce their carbon footprint by 30 per cent by 2030.",
      "In 2024, Adidas reported that 99 per cent of all polyester used in their products was recycled, painting a picture of early achievement of their goals.",
      "Nike’s sustainability push is centred on their “Move to Zero” campaign, which aims to reduce carbon, waste and reliance on virgin materials. Nike has produced kits composed of recycled polyester made from plastic bottles, diverting vast amounts of waste from landfill. These garments featured prominently in Liverpool’s recent kits before their switch to Adidas, aligning brand efforts with the club’s own sustainability objectives.",
      "Similarly, Puma have introduced their RE:FIBRE initiative, which recycles textile waste into new performance garments and pledges to reach 75 per cent recycled polyester use by 2025 across their products, including football kits.",
      "These efforts have influenced club policies. As well as Liverpool’s Nike kit including recycled polyester derived from plastic bottles, Manchester City’s Puma kits use materials from the RE:FIBRE program, reflecting a circular-economy approach driven by their sponsor’s sustainability targets. These partnerships are seen as aligning manufacturers’ material choices with club branding and green credentials.",

      "Fan sentiment and market forces are playing their part, too. According to a study by Sport Positive Leagues, clubs that adopted kits made from recycled materials saw a significant uptick in positive feedback, indicating growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products.",
      "But the path forward is thorny. Using recycled polyester still means reliance on plastic. While Adidas and Puma reduce dependency on virgin polyester, the end-product is still synthetic fabric. Critics note that recycled polyester may not match the performance properties of virgin polymers precisely, though most advances in fabric engineering now close that gap. Brands may also overstate sustainability claims, with limited third-party certification or product lifecycle transparency.",
      "Industry observers stress that while recycled polyester reduces waste and carbon emissions compared to virgin polyester, it perpetuates a plastic-dependent model unless broader systemic change occurs. Performance trade-offs also remain a concern at the elite level – especially in high-wicking, breathable kits designed for extreme physical exertion. Fabric rebirth may necessitate compromises.",
      "Transparency is another hurdle. Brands release sustainability milestones, but independent verification is less common. Adidas’ claim of 96 per cent recycled polyester is laudable, yet independent auditors and lifecycle assessments are limited in public view. Consumers may not know how ocean plastic was collected, where recycling processes occurred or what happens at end-of-life for the garments themselves.",
      "Ultimately, sustainability in football fashion is caught at the intersection of ecology, economics and consumer culture. Big brands have undeniably propelled recycled materials into flagship football kits, driving clubs to align with sustainability narratives.",
      "Adidas’ Parley initiative brought recycled ocean plastic into jerseys worn by Manchester United and Real Madrid, signalling symbolic and practical change. Nike’s Move to Zero and Puma’s RE:FIBRE similarly reflect an industry-wide shift towards circularity.",
      "But critics like Savitz remind us that greenwashing is a real danger without meaningful reduction in plastic production.",
      "To truly reach sustainable fashion, football apparel must embrace more than recycled synthetics. The industry needs to rethink supply chains, invest in biodegradable fibres, reduce the frequency of kit releases and provide clear transparency – from raw materials to end-of-life disposal.",
      "Clubs can leverage sponsor influence to push for real change such as longer kit cycles, reuse initiatives, buy-back programmes and circular design. Consumer education is essential, too. Fans should understand that buying a recycled kit is better than virgin plastic, but it is not a solution in itself.",
      "Until then, sustainability remains a work in progress. Brands and clubs can score goals in raising awareness and shifting materials, but the environment’s full victory depends on ending plastic dependency – not merely recycling it.",

      "Chelsea have ‘agreed every detail’ of personal terms with Man Utd winger Alejandro Garnacho ahead of a potential transfer, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The Blues have already got eight signings over the line this summer with Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Jorrel Hato, Liam Delap, Estevao, Dario Essugo, Kendry Paez and Mamadou Sarr all joining.",
      "But Chelsea are not done yet with rumours that they are looking to bring in both Man Utd winger Garnacho and RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons before the end of the transfer window.",
      "Man Utd are looking to offload the members of their ‘bomb squad’ with Garnacho, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Tyrell Malacia currently proving difficult to shift for the fees they want.",
      "Garnacho is priced at around £60m by the Red Devils, after previously asking for £70m, while Chelsea have reportedly said they won’t pay more than £30m for the Argentina international.",
      "But one thing is for sure: Garnacho wants to join Chelsea. A report on Thursday insisted that Man Utd have chosen to ‘rule out all options this summer’.",
      "READ: Mailbox: Newcastle must get over unavoidable transfer hijacks and inevitable Isak sale to ‘stupid’ Liverpool",
      "And Romano has now revealed that Garnacho has ‘agreed every detail of personal terms’ and that everything on the player’s side is ‘done’.",
      "Romano wrote on X: ‘Understand Alejandro Garnacho has agreed every detail of personal terms with Chelsea! Deal done on player side, he only wants Chelsea as revealed here since July. Talks with Man United about fee will follow soon. #CFC pursue both Garnacho and Xavi Simons, as revealed.’",
      "During a recent press conference, Man Utd boss Amorim revealed that Garnacho was keen to leave Old Trafford after being left out of the club’s pre-season tour.",
      "Amorim said: “Garnacho is a really talented boy, but sometimes things don’t work out.",
      "“You cannot explain specifically what it is. But I have the feeling that Garnacho wants a different thing with a different leadership. And I can understand that. It’s not a problem.",
      "“Sometimes you adapt to one guy, you have the connection. Other times, you want a new challenge. We try to make everything okay to all the parts, to the club, to the coach and to the players. It’s a natural thing in football.”",
      "Amorim added: “There are players that clearly show that they don’t want to be here, and that is normal. It’s not that they’re bad and I’m good, or I’m bad and they’re good.",
      "“It’s not that situation. It’s a simple situation that they want new challenges. If the market closes and they are still Manchester United players, we as a club have to treat them under the same conditions.",
      "“But at this moment, I’m just working with the players I think are going to stay, and the other guys are trying to find a solution for their careers.”",

      "Football finance expert Stefan Borson recently insisted that a deal for Garnacho would be a “no-brainer” for Chelsea if they could get him for £30m.",
      "Borson told Football Insider: “I think it feels like a bit of a no-brainer for £30million.",
      "“You would be hard pushed to lose money at £30million because I think he is a player whose wages are manageable right now because he’s young and he’s not had that big uplift.",
      "“I think he would get a sizeable contract at Chelsea, but I think to the point where he’s the kind of player that if you bought him for £30million and he was okay, not disastrous, but you wanted to shift him on next summer or the summer after, it feels very doable to Europe.",
      "“I do think it’s a low-risk deal. But then, if it is so low risk, then it is interesting that so far nobody has bitten. There seems to be very little interest aside from Chelsea, which is slightly surprising.",
      "“You would have thought maybe he’s a deal that’s doable for quite a few clubs that are just under the main big teams. That sort of Europa League tier of teams maybe. I guess it’s limited numbers.",
      "“France is never going to be an option outside of PSG. I guess maybe Marseille, but very few teams now in France can do any sort of major business.",
      "“So, then you’re looking at Germany. Yes, there are two or three teams in Germany that could do this deal. In Italy, it’s a bit harder, maybe two or three again.",
      "“Then Spain, he really doesn’t seem to be interesting for Barca or Real, and he’s definitely doable for Atletico, but they seem not to have moved for him, which was once touted as being a potential option.",

      "The deal breaks down to an initial £66.26m (€76.5m) and £7.36m (€8.5m) in performance related add-ons for Benjamin Sesko; the forward had been the subject of two bids from Newcastle United but Manchester United ultimately won the race for his signature",
      "Saturday 9 August 2025 13:23, UK",
      "Manchester United have completed a £73.7m deal to sign striker Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig.",
      "The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with Man Utd set to pay an initial £66.26m (€76.5m) with £7.36m (€8.5m) in performance-related add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "In his first interview as a Man Utd player, Sesko said: \"When we discussed the project, it was clear that everything is in place for this team to continue to grow and compete for the biggest trophies again soon.",
      "\"From the moment that I arrived, I could feel the positive energy and family environment that the club has created. It is clearly the perfect place to reach my maximum level and fulfil all of my ambitions.\"",
      "Sesko was formally presented to Man Utd supporters on Saturday, ahead of the club's final pre-season friendly against Fiorentina.",
      "Newcastle had been working on a deal for Sesko, and on Tuesday made a second bid of £69.7m plus add-ons, after an initial offer of just under £70m (€80m) plus add-ons.",
      "United are understood to be delighted with the deal they have struck with RB Leipzig. They did not want to get embroiled in a bidding war with Newcastle - and are paying less up front than Newcastle's improved second bid.",
      "The forward's strong desire to join Man Utd was not lost on club officials - they have consistently said they only want players who want to be part of what they are trying to build, regardless of whether they can offer Champions League football or not.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox has played a key role in getting Sesko's deal over the line, while director of recruitment Christopher Vivell and chief negotiator Matt Hargreaves had been in Leipzig finalising the deal.",
      "Talking about the new signing, Wilcox said: \"Benjamin possesses a rare combination of electrifying pace and the ability to physically dominate defenders, making him one of the most exceptional young talents in world football.",
      "\"We have followed Benjamin's career closely; all of our data analysis and research concluded that he has the required qualities and personality to thrive at Manchester United.",
      "\"Working under the guidance of Ruben Amorim and our excellent performance team, Benjamin is joining the perfect environment to support him to reach his world-class potential.",
      "\"The desire that all of our new signings have shown to join the club this summer highlights the appeal and stature of Manchester United as we continue to build and develop a team capable of challenging for the biggest honours.\"",
      "Manchester United have been aware of Sesko ever since he moved to Red Bull Salzburg aged 16. They've scouted him for many years and this isn't actually the first time they have tried to sign him. In the summer of 2022 - three years ago now - there was some concrete interest from Man Utd.",
      "Sesko reached an agreement to join Leipzig a year later instead. That was because he didn't feel ready to make that jump to a club in the Premier League. He has now made that big move.",
      "What makes Sesko so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago, but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Read Nick Wright's feature here.",
      "Sesko's signing will raise further questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford. It is understood the club would consider offers of around £40m for the player, and AC Milan are interested.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood they can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are also interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Manchester United's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "Manchester United's deal for Sesko could have ramifications for Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.",
      "Newcastle will only let Isak leave St James' Park if they can bring in a ready-made replacement. However, with Sesko now heading to Manchester, it puts any possible move for Isak into doubt.",
      "Liverpool had a bid of £110m plus add-ons rejected by the Magpies.",

      "Manchester United have signed Benjamin Sesko from RB Leipzig; Slovenia international striker has impressed in Germany and drawn style and stature comparisons with Manchester City's Erling Haaland",
      "Saturday 9 August 2025 10:53, UK",
      "Manchester United have beaten Newcastle to the signing of Benjamin Sesko, while Arsenal were also interested in him - so what makes the striker so appealing?",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig after joining them from Red Bull Salzburg two years ago but what qualities will the 22-year-old bring to the Premier League?",
      "And could he really be the next Erling Haaland?",
      "Here we take a closer look at Man Utd's new £73.7m frontman...",
      "His scoring record is modest by comparison but Sesko is a rare breed of striker with a similar physical profile to Haaland. At 6ft 4in, he is exactly the same height and similarly quick.",
      "His stature allows him to play the role of a targetman, holding the ball up, bringing team-mates into play and providing an outlet for long passes, crosses and set-piece deliveries.",
      "Like Haaland, he combines those qualities with explosive pace.",
      "Last season in the Bundesliga, Sesko's top speed of 35.69 km/h put him 26th among 492 players to feature in the competition. He ranked even higher in the previous campaign, at 15th.",
      "His pace no doubt formed a significant part of his appeal to Newcastle as they face the potential prospect of having to replace Alexander Isak, though it is Manchester United who have added more explosiveness to their attack following the signing of Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "Sesko's speed can stretch and destabilise defences. It is also a devastating weapon on the break and on transitions, something he has demonstrated throughout his time in Germany.",
      "RB Leipzig are known as one of the country's most effective counter-attacking teams - their total of 17 counter-attack goals since the start of last season is the second-highest among Bundesliga sides, behind only Eintracht Frankfurt - and Sesko has been a big part of it.",
      "His total of five fast-break goals across the last two Bundesliga seasons puts him third in the division, behind his RB Leipzig team-mate Lois Openda and former Eintracht Frankfurt forward Omar Marmoush, who have scored six each.",
      "Sesko's most recent example came during a 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich in May, when he accelerated away from Eric Dier to latch onto a Xavi Simons pass and send a superb, first-time finish past stranded goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from long range.",
      "That attack saw the ball travel from the edge of RB Leipzig's box to the back of the Bayern Munich net in a matter of seconds and it was enabled by the speed and ruthless efficiency of Sesko.",
      "It is also worth noting that it is not just in open spaces that Sesko is able to carry the ball upfield.",
      "Unusually for a player of his stature, Sesko is also an accomplished dribbler with the technical skill to beat defenders in tight spaces before accelerating towards goal.",
      "His average of 1.46 successful take-ons per 90 minutes was in fact the highest of any out-and-out striker in the Bundesliga last season, highlighting another area of strength.",
      "Sesko's scoring rate dipped slightly as RB Leipzig endured a poor campaign last term but his penchant for the spectacular remains, thanks largely to his outstanding ball-striking ability.",
      "That opening goal against Bayern Munich in May, curled around Urbig using the outside of his boot from 40 yards out, was one of four he has scored from outside the box in the Bundesliga since the start of last season. Only a handful of players have scored more.",
      "Even fewer can claim to have found the net from distance with the same level of ferocity.",
      "Sesko is able to generate astonishing power with his shots, as seen most memorably with his stunning strike against Werder Bremen in January, rifled into the top corner from 25 yards out. The ball was later revealed to have travelled at a speed of 126.43 km/h.",
      "That goal against Werder Bremen, like the one against Bayern five months later, was hit with his stronger right foot but he can muster similar power using his weaker foot too.",
      "Playing for Slovenia in a Nations League game against Sweden in September 2022, he scored a sensational, left-footed volley which drew comparisons with Marco van Basten.",
      "Sesko's willingness to shoot from improbable angles and unlikely positions can, on the flip side, be frustrating. His shot map for the last two Bundesliga seasons shows a high percentage of his shots were statistically unlikely to result in goals.",
      "It is also worth noting he has significantly overperformed relative to his expected goals at RB Leipzig, scoring 27 times in the Bundesliga from only 17.7 xG across the last two seasons. The numbers raise questions over whether his scoring rate is sustainable.",
      "At the same time, though, knowing what he is capable of, it is easy to see the logic behind his ambitious shot choices. Sesko has shown he can score from just about anywhere. His directness is another part of his appeal.",
      "Another of Sesko's biggest attributes is his prodigious leap.",
      "He was a promising basketball player in his teens and the agility honed on the court can now be seen in the way he challenges for headers and controls high balls on the pitch.",
      "Coupled with his height, it gives him an edge in the opposition box, as seen when he leapt above the outstretched hand of Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp to head home a rebound before Trapp could reach it during a 2-1 win in December.",
      "That goal was one of eight Sesko has scored with his head across the last two Bundesliga seasons. It is the fourth-highest total in the competition behind Harry Kane, Serhou Guirassy and Tim Kleindienst, and underlines the extent of his aerial threat.",
      "That threat is particularly pertinent to Manchester United as they aim to increase their set-piece threat. They rank as the Premier League's lowest scorers from set-pieces over the last three seasons.",
      "Sesko is not yet the finished article having only turned 22 at the end of May. Some elements of his game are still raw. His goals tend to come in bursts rather than consistently.",
      "This move to the Premier League will come with considerable pressure and high expectations but his age ensures he has plenty of room to grow and develop.",
      "There is of course an element of risk in signing Sesko ahead of a more established option. He does not boast the same prolific scoring record as Haaland when he made the move to England. Haaland had scored 86 goals in 89 games for Borussia Dortmund whereas Sesko has scored 39 goals in 87 games for RB Leipzig.",
      "But his potential is huge and the parallels in style are clear. The pair have even followed similar routes, with Sesko effectively brought in as Haaland's replacement at former club Red Bull Salzburg.",
      "It is also worth noting that, at only 22, Sesko has already amassed considerable experience, making more than 250 appearances for club and country, featuring at Champions League level, and reaching double figures for goals in five consecutive campaigns.",
      "He has done all that while avoiding any serious injury setbacks. That durability is another factor in his favour, and another source of encouragement to Manchester United.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "\"I hope it helps take Manchester United where Manchester United needs to go.\"",
      "The words of Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he cut the ribbon to re-open their men's training facilities.",
      "It marks the conclusion of a year's worth of work at Carrington, which has been disruptive to say the least.",
      "The knock-on effect on the men's and women's teams was far from ideal, but the important news for United is that the redevelopment has now finished and importantly, on time and within budget ahead of the new season.",
      "United partnered with Foster + Partners to lead the redesign of Carrington - the same company who are in charge of designing their ambitious 100,000 capacity stadium.",
      "When Ratcliffe and INEOS first arrived at United 18 months ago, one of their first major decisions was to revamp and invest in Carrington, in their image, as the beating heart of the club.",
      "Although Cristiano Ronaldo famously called out the club's deteriorating facilities in 2022, perhaps in hindsight, his actions, rightly or wrongly, had an everlasting impact that led to Carrington's improvement.",
      "\"It sends a message that you're playing for the biggest club in the world.\"",
      "United believe that after finishing this huge renovation that their facilities are back to being among the best in class when compared to their rivals - a familiar feeling to when Carrington first opened in 2000.",
      "Dalot was pretty happy with the players' revamped facilities but what are they really like?",
      "United goalkeeper Tom Heaton described the improved facilities as much of a 'flow' for the players. I did not know quite what he meant until I had a look myself, and actually, it made a lot of sense.",
      "From the ground floor, you immediately step into the players' gym - this was one of the only aspects of the building relatively untouched.",
      "However, as you meander through to the active recovery rooms, this is where you start seeing major changes that will benefit United players for years to come.",
      "A new high altitude room with multiple bikes and rowing machines have been installed - one in which the levels of temperature, humidity and more can be altered for a group of players to train in. This room at Carrington is believed to be one of the biggest of its kind in elite sport.",
      "Then onto the pool area. Sauna and steam rooms have been improved and enlarged, with new additions as well, such as a small pool with an underwater treadmill. The treadmill can be elevated up and down to the appropriate height to aid those who need it for rehabilitating from injury.",
      "The \"flow\" of the layout Heaton mentioned made a lot more sense at this point, as you really do feel everything is one, meaningful order of facilities for these players with their gym and recovery work - this will make more sense as I go on... Probably.",
      "As we continue the tour, naturally, after the gym, we find ourselves in a long, bright hallway with the changing rooms and player services areas.",
      "However, just before you to get to the first team changing room - interestingly enough - there's a door that says 'U23'. This is seen as the 'emerging talent' dressing room - a room breaking through to the first team and giving them a taste of what it is like to be in the first team building.",
      "The likes of Chido Obi and Sekou Kone are a few names that spring to mind who could be using that room at the moment as they continue to make their mark on the first team.",
      "Into the first team changing room we go - more spacious and brighter than its predecessor - with touchscreens on each player's space to go through their routine for the day.",
      "One of the more odd facts we learned is that the changing rooms is that they include… 'smart urinals' - these help measure whether a player is dehydrated and just how much liquid they may need to get back to their ideal hydration levels.",
      "One aspect Ruben Amorim hopes his players won't see too often is the new and improved treatment room. United see this as a huge improvement to the previous edition, especially after feedback from former and current players alike.",
      "The room is more spacious while also featuring more natural light for those recovering from their injuries, with views all around Carrington.",
      "United's improved medical facilities will be warmly welcomed, especially now that they have an MRI, CT and a full body scanner in their armoury.",
      "The whole body scanner - the recent addition - can, in seven minutes, find out everything about a player's body composition.",
      "With these extra and improved facilities, United also hope players who pick up any length of injuries will be more motivated to get back to full fitness at Carrington rather than carry out their rehabilitation abroad.",
      "As we make our way upstairs, we pass the trophies of United's past, the Premier League, the Champions League, it goes on - a reminder of the past but also the aims for the future, no matter how close or distant.",
      "We find ourselves in the new player's lounge and kitchen. On first view, it is pretty stunning. Bright and open - much look the redesigned Carrington, it is understandable why the players have been excited about this redevelopment.",
      "On one side of the lounge, there are two rooms. One is a barbershop - where players can bring in their own to get their fresh cut, a footballer's necessity!",
      "Next to that, a F1 simulator, which has gone down pretty well too.",
      "As we continue on past the open floor office spaces, we see where Amorim and his staff are based. Just down the hall from Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell's recruitment team. With much of Old Trafford's staff relocating to the training ground in the coming months, there is a clear message here: the club want this to be a new chapter for United with it's heart in Carrington.",
      "My personal favourite, for obvious reasons - a new press conference room! In the same building, the first team will be conducting most of their business - this slight change will make a shorter walk for Amorim to come through and answer the tough questions every week.",
      "Although United have no European football to offer this season, this new room is UEFA compliant and could, as United hope, host future Champions League news conferences rather than having to constantly switch back to Old Trafford."

      "Newcastle have upped their bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "It is understood Newcastle are now offering £69.7m (€80m) as a fixed fee plus add-ons for the Slovenia international.",
      "They have since been negotiating with Leipzig and have now raised their offer.",
      "Meanwhile, Manchester United are discussing internally the next steps regarding their interest in Sesko.",
      "United have not made an official bid and are aware of Newcastle's latest offer, but they intend to remain disciplined and will not get drawn into a bidding war",
      "Sesko is believed to be open to both projects, although one source has claimed he has been leaning towards United, if they can agree a deal with Leipzig.",
      "It is thought United would want a clear indication Sesko only wants to join them before making a formal bid.",
      "While United's focus has been on Sesko, he is not the only striker United are looking at.",
      "They have explored the conditions of a deal for several strikers, including Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins.",
      "United's pursuit of Sesko raises questions over Rasmus Hojlund's future at Old Trafford, with the club understood to be listening to suitable offers for the striker.",
      "It was thought United would have to make sales in order to bring in a striker. However, while the priority is to offload players, it is understood Ruben Amorim's side can buy before selling, provided there are sales before the window closes.",
      "It is understood Leipzig are interested in Hojlund and have explored the conditions of a loan. Leipzig had proposed taking the striker on loan as part of any possible deal for Sesko.",
      "Hojlund has started two of Man Utd's four pre-season games so far and scored in their 4-1 win over Bournemouth, but the possible arrival of a new striker could limit his game time.",
      "A scenario where Sesko joins and Hojlund stays cannot be ruled out.",
      "Sesko was absent from RB Leipzig's pre-season friendly loss to Atalanta on Saturday due to his expected departure from the club. The striker has told his team-mates that he will be leaving, according to Sky in Germany.",

      "Substitute Mason Mount put Manchester United back in front when he turned and curled a superb finish beyond Jordan Pickford from Fernandes' pass, but Everton levelled again when Amad's attempted clearance struck Ayden Heaven and went into the net.",
      "The freakish own goal, which occurred as Fernandes kicked out at Ndiaye, who reacted by shoving him as both players were booked, denied Manchester United a third consecutive win at the Premier League Summer Series but they still finished as winners, a point ahead of West Ham in the four-team group.",
      "As in the previous games against West Ham and Bournemouth, there were positives for Amorim, particularly in the first half, when his side produced several slick attacks and Mbeumo combined smartly with Fernandes and fellow new signing Matheus Cunha.",
      "Mbeumo was replaced by Patrick Dorgu at half-time and the game lost its rhythm as both sides made changes in the second period, with new Everton signing Adam Aznou among those introduced.",
      "Manchester United had a late chance to win it when Mount played in Dorgu but the wing-back's diagonal shot was well saved by Pickford to round off a much-improved performance from Everton following their defeats to Bournemouth and West Ham.",

      "\"Hopefully we can get one or two players more to help with that.\"",
      "His first run in behind Everton's defence came inside the very first minute of the game. Soon afterwards, he was dropping deep to release Bruno Fernandes and launch an attack. Some time later, fans cheered as he dribbled out of danger in his own half.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo only played 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday but even in that short timeframe he offered plenty of evidence to show just how much he can bring to Ruben Amorim's attack following his £71m arrival from Brentford.",
      "The 25-year-old's early withdrawal showed there is work to do to build his fitness but he looked sharp, starting in an inside right position, behind Matheus Cunha, but interchanging roles with the Brazilian throughout the first half, his movement causing problems.",
      "He was involved in the build-up to the penalty, releasing Amad Diallo with an instinctive first-time pass, and went close to scoring himself, first when he tested Jordan Pickford from a free-kick, and again when he had two efforts in quick succession blocked.",
      "As became customary at Brentford, his speed and dynamism was a major feature of his performance. His forward runs provided a foil for Fernandes and there were early signs of chemistry with Amad and Cunha. All in all, this was a positive start by Manchester United's new No 19. He looks primed to make a big impact.",
      "Ruben Amorim was pleased with Bryan Mbeumo's first Manchester United appearance.",
      "\"He played well,\" he said. \"He needs to understand the position, the movements, but first his touch, the way he connected with one touch, opened a lot of space.",
