      "Former Premier League referee Mike Dean has added fuel to Wayne Rooney's conspiracy theory surrounding Manchester City's dramatic 2012 title triumph. In a moment that will live long in the memory, the title was wrenched from Manchester United's grasp that year in the dying embers of the final game, thanks to that Sergio Aguero goal.",
      "Dean, who was the man in charge of that historic match, has now, for the first time, revealed that there were elements of Queens Park Rangers' performance against City that surprised him.",
      "Rooney was a part of the United team who were waiting on the pitch to be crowned champions after winning at Sunderland before City's two stoppage-time goals.",
      "In the years since, he has voiced scepticism over the manner in which QPR conceded two late goals, insisting it was 'strange' and that it 'doesn't sit right' with him. And now Dean has admitted he can't explain why City were given the ball back immediately after Mario Balotelli's goal pegged it back to 2-2.",
      "\"It was one of those games, as all the referees that week, when the appointments came out, we all wanted that game,\" he said on The Overlap Fan Debate. \"I couldn't believe I had the game, to get the game, the stakes and how it went.",
      "\"We always knew United were going to beat Sunderland. The way it transpired, we all thought City would win, and it went the wrong way.",
      "\"What was strange about it, we allude to the end of the game, but once QPR found out they were safe, I spoke to Clint Hill about it. Once they knew they were safe, Jamie Mackie was on the pitch celebrating while the game was going on.",
      "\"They make it 2-2 and they just kick it back, and we were like, 'what's going on, why are they giving the ball back straightaway?' I said [that] in the earpiece.",
      "\"It was a strange one. To kick off and give the ball straight back to them.",
      "\"Neil Swarbrick, the fourth official, said, 'Keep switched on, something is going to happen.' You just knew something was going to happen; you could just tell.",
      "\"But I still can't get my head around why they kicked the ball straight back. I just couldn't... I don't know.\"",
      "Rooney, who was alongside Dean when he made the admission on Tuesday, said: \"They had loads of ex-City and Liverpool players in the team, I know Joey tried his best, but Djibril Cisse came out and said he was celebrating with City after it.\"",
      "Back in April, United's all-time leading scorer also said: \"Obviously that was a tough one that, but again, didn't Paddy Kenny turn the ball in, two goals, QPR knew they were safe, and City got it to 2-2, then they just boot the ball back to them.",
      "\"They had (Djibril) Cisse on the pitch, Joey Barton got sent off for acting stupid. Who else was it, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Nedum Onuoha diving about?\"",
      "Cisse, however, hit back at Rooney's claim that QPR 'rolled over' just last month, saying: \"I was celebrating with Samir Nasri, my friend of 15 years. I didn't care about Man City - I was just happy for him and relieved that we stayed up.",
      "\"If we'd wanted them to win, we would've let them score 4-0 or 5-0, but we didn't. We fought hard, and we had a strong team out there. It wasn't our fault United lost the title. They dropped points all season.\"",
      "Ex-City star Barton also recently said that Rooney's 'conspiracy theories were untrue'.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Tonge described the message as a 'lovely' gesture for the family. The Bolton News quoted him saying: \"They're big Manchester United supporters, so this was lovely to receive, what a guy.\"",

      "\"The fact that it took place at a local supermarket, used by so many of us, has created an even stronger sense of, 'This could have happened to any one of us.'\".",

      "Former Manchester United goalkeeper Ben Foster has disclosed how he once rejected the chance to feature on I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here. The keeper made 23 outings for United during a five-year period after arriving from Stoke City in 2005.",
      "Foster predominantly served as backup to Edwin van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak throughout his Old Trafford tenure under Sir Alex Ferguson. He subsequently racked up 390 Premier League matches across his career, turning out for clubs including Watford and West Bromwich Albion.",
      "The 42-year-old initially hung up his gloves in September 2022, following the expiry of his Watford deal. It was during this period that he received an approach to take part in the popular reality programme on ITV.",
      "Foster revealed to talkSPORT that he declined the opportunity to venture into the Australian jungle due to worries about excessive public exposure. However, he has suggested he feels regretful about the choice after insisting he would excel as a contestant.",
      "\"I was offered it a couple of years ago, actually, when I first retired,\" Foster told talkSPORT presenter Jeff Stelling. \"I think that level of fame, though it's not for me. That's a different level of fame.",
      "\"In sport, if you walk down the street, you'll get a few people who will say hello or whatever. But this opens you up to the other side of fame, with the people that watch telly at night.",
      "\"I was thinking, 'that's not for me' but I'd have enjoyed it, though. I watch it sometimes and think 'I could do this.' I'd be all over that survival stuff. I can start fires and I can cook.\"",
      "Had Foster accepted, he would have joined numerous former footballers who have appeared on the programme, including Ian Wright, Dennis Wise and Wayne Bridge. Just two ex-professionals have ever claimed victory in the series, with Harry Redknapp and former Manchester City Women star Jill Scott both securing the jungle crown.",
      "Foster's regret over declining the opportunity comes as little shock considering the path his career has followed recently. He temporarily returned from retirement in March 2023 to assist Wrexham in securing the National League title.",
      "He featured heavily in the Welcome to Wrexham documentary, chronicling the club's ascent under Hollywood proprietors Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac. The former England goalkeeper also presents his own football podcast titled 'Fozcast'.",
      "Foster has spoken candidly about his taste of fame at Wrexham after disclosing how Canadian actor Reynolds once presented him with a special present in return for his shirt He revealed the exchange occurred following the Welsh club's promotion from the fifth tier courtesy of a 3-1 home victory against Boreham Wood.",
      "Speaking in 2023, Foster recalled: \"Ryan Reynolds, he text me on the morning of the game to say, 'Can I have your shirt'. I was like, 'Yeah, cool'. He was like, 'Cool, because I've got something for you as well'. I was like, 'OK? What on earth's this?'",
      "\"So, anyway, he text me yesterday and said, 'I forgot to tell you what it is. I was going through my memorabilia the other day of Deadpool and I found the original gloves that I wore in the film.'\".",
      "\"He said, 'I gave one of the gloves to a guy with terminal cancer the other day, but the other one I want to give to you...because I see you give your gloves away all the time and you never get anything back in return'. I was like, 'Mate, I am buzzing so much for this.'\".",
      "Welcome to Wrexham is back on Disney+ for a fourth season. Fans can watch the series with a £4.99 monthly plan, or get 12 months for the price of 10 by paying for a year upfront.",

      "Ruben Amorim continues to lean on a Manchester United engine room he knows is not built for the long haul. One the Portuguese coach hopes will still function until the end of this season, before it is given a serious overhaul.",
      "Bruno Fernandes continues to be the main cog and most influential part of United's midfield, while Brazilian veteran Casemiro has found a new lease of life in recent weeks to suggest he can still do a job for his team, despite approaching the age of 34. And Mason Mount has offered glimpses of the form which once persuaded United to spend £60m luring him to Old Trafford.",
      "But Amorim knows he is still papering over the cracks, when it comes to an area of the team where the biggest games are won and lost. Manuel Ugarte and Diogo Dalot are not up to the standards required at the highest level, while Kobbie Mainoo's career has gone backwards faster than Max Verstappen in reverse.",
      "Before agreeing to take charge of United, Amorim revealed he had followed the fortunes of the English giants since being young. So he knows more than most how the most successful United teams on record were defined by those magical of midfield units.",
      "Like the one Sir Alex Ferguson put together, in the shape of Roy Keane, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and David Beckham. And these four also had a little help from a certain Ryan Giggs. This formidable quartet helped United win the Treble back in 1999 - and countless other trophies.",
      "Fergie also had the privilege of having United greats Bryan Robson and Paul Ince bossing games in a previous era. What would Amorim give to be able to call on players like Robson and Keane now?",
      "Instead, what Amorim will have to give is a huge amount of cash to other clubs next summer, if he wants to build a midfield capable of earning comparisons with the greatest of them all.",
      "United bosses spent last summer addressing the team's glaring deficiencies in attack. And will spend the next one targeting the heartbeat of the side. Director of football Jason Wilcox is working closely with Amorim to compile a list of realistic targets.",
      "These include Brighton's Carlos Baleba, who United made tentative enquiries about six months ago. There is also interest in England international Adam Wharton, Wolves star Joao Gomes and VFB Stuttgart sensation Angelo Stiller.",
      "In short, Amorim wants a midfield of youth, energy and class. None of these will come cheap, with Baleba being valued in the region of £115m.",
      "But co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made it his mission to balance the books at Old Trafford since taking a stake in the club 18 months ago. Ratcliffe has cut jobs across the board and reduced the player wage bill. And the INEOS supremo knows United's bid to strengthen their midfield options will also be shaped by the prospect of making more significant savings between now and then.",
      "These include seeing the contracts of highest earners Jadon Sancho, Casemiro and Harry Maguire coming to an end. Sancho will leave on a free contract, and if Casemiro and Maguire want to stay, they will have to do so on significantly reduced terms. There is also confidence Marcus Rashford's £325,000-a-week salary will be removed by a permanent move to Barcelona.",
      "If those four are all gone, that'll be £1m-a-week off the wage bill - not to mention whatever fee they receive for Rashford added on top.",

      "After being put in a five-man bomb squad at United, Antony was the subject of offers from Europe and Saudi Arabia. But having enjoyed a superb half-season loan spell with Real Betis last term, the winger held out for a return to Seville.",
      "Antony, 25, eventually got his way with just hours to go the window slammed shut, as the Red Devils and Betis agreed a deal worth up to €25million (£21.7m). But the former Ajax star, who United paid a jaw-dropping £86m for in August 2022, claims to have had a late opportunity to sign for German giants Bayern, despite flopping in the Premier League.",
      "\"Dude, I'm going to be completely honest with you right now, it really shook me up,\" Antony told Brazilian outlet Globo Esporte when asked about the Bundesliga champions' interest. \"We\\re talking about a global giant, Bayern Munich, where there is a coach with that kind of history.",
      "\"Vincent Kompany called me and we had a conversation. He was super polite to me, said he always really liked my football, and this was at 11pm (on deadline day), a little after 11pm.\"",
      "However, the 16-time Brazil international says that he put his family first and turned down the move to Munich. \"Whether I wanted to or not, it really affected me because of the greatness of the club, the greatness of the coach and the way he approached me, the way he talked to me,\" Antony continued.",
      "\"But what weighed heavily on my decision was that I'm a family, man. It's about looking out for my children. Lorenzo (his son) loves this place, loves this city (Seville). When we were on vacation in Brazil, without knowing anything, he always asked, 'Dad, when are we going back to Spain?'\"",
      "Reflecting on his departure from United, there's no bad blood for the 25-year-old, who's happy playing his football in La Liga. \"I don't hold any grudges, I'm not angry at anyone there,\" Antony affirmed.",
      "\"This serves as a great learning experience for me to know how to fight with the right weapons and with wisdom when faced with certain situations because that's part of life, it's part of the process.",
      "'I'm also very grateful to Manchester United because I didn't only experience bad moments, but I also had some good moments there, with people I met who were also great. Now I'm here at Betis, Manchester was a very good experience and I'm very happy to be here at Betis.\"",

Semenyo, 25, will be allowed to leave for £65million in the January transfer window after it emerged that the new contract which he signed just four months ago contains a release clause.",
      "Bournemouth won't be able to stand in the forward's way if a club actives his clause within the first two weeks of January and he wants to leave. Semenyo has been one of the league's standout players so far this season, scoring six goals and providing three assists in 12 games.",
      "The London-born Ghana international has been linked with Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham. United boss Ruben Amorim reportedly met Semenyo at the end of last season before he turned down a move to Old Trafford and signed his new deal.",

      "Jadon Sancho has endured a challenging four years since joining Manchester United, but the end of his nightmare spell is in sight. The England international has not played under Ruben Amorim, having spent last season on loan at Chelsea before joining Aston Villa on a temporary basis for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "The 25-year-old has been mostly used in the Europa League by Emery, with 336 minutes played this season - just under a quarter of which have been in the Premier League. He is yet to start in the latter competition with a cameo off the bench against Manchester City ending in brutal fashion when he was substituted off.",
      "Emery later made it clear that the decision was fitness-related, with Sancho having played 67 minutes in Europe just a few days earlier. Nonetheless, he appears to be in Villa's second-choice team with updates now emerging on his future at Old Trafford and the three clubs he could join next year.",
      "With all of that being said, Mirror Sport has taken a closer look at Sancho's predicament at Villa Park, United contract and potential next club.",
      "Sancho signed a five-year contract when he joined United from Borussia Dortmund back in 2021, which means that deal is set to expire in roughly six months.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Sancho will depart the club as a free agent, having made 83 appearances with 12 goals and six assists to his name over what is technically just two years, given his loan spells elsewhere.",
      "United will be glad to get his hefty salary off their wage bill, but will no doubt rue the fact that they now face the prospect of losing a player they spent £73million for nothing.",
      "Former club Borussia Dortmund, who could yet try to sign him again, was one of the places Sancho spent time at. He helped them reach the 2024 Champions League final before his mediocre loan spell at Chelsea last season.",
      "Unai Emery clearly rates Sancho but it is not totally clear if he has intentions on signing him permanently. Villa, who are paying 80 per cent of Sancho's wages, did not agree with United an obligation to buy clause as part of his loan but would no doubt be frontrunners if they opted to try and strike a deal at the end of the season.",
      "Reports in September claimed that Villa were already planning on making his move permanent. However, Sancho's limited game time since his summer move has done little to suggest that is the case.",
      "Despite this, Villa boss Emery is in no doubt when it comes to Sancho's qualities. \"When Leon Bailey left, it was a moment for us to assess the players we had identified through our scouting,” Emery said in response to being asked about the decision to sign the winger.",
      "“We then had the opportunity to make a signing - and one of the players on our list was Jadon Sancho. He’s capable of playing on both the right and left wings, and he provides something different. He’s a good player - 25 years old - and I felt he performed very well last year at Chelsea.",
      "“Yes, he had some problems at Manchester United, but during his time at Borussia Dortmund, he performed fantastic. He’s also played 25 times for England. He’s still young, still hungry, and has the ability to show his skills and qualities.",
      "“Hopefully, we can bring out the best in him here. In the last few years, he’s played more on the left, but at Dortmund, he was more often on the right. Here, I see him being able to play in both of those positions.\"",
      "Sancho is set to see out the current season on loan at Villa with no break clause included, meaning United do not have the option to recall him in January.",
      "Sancho appears destined to leave United upon the expiration of his contract next summer, but there is a scenario in which he moves on permanently in the January transfer window.",
      "According to a report by CaughtOffside, 'discreet but meaningful discussions' have taken place over the November international break between Sancho's representatives and figureheads from Fenerbahce, Galatasaray, and Besiktas.",
      "They have also claimed that those conversations occurred in a luxury hotel with the trio of Turkish heavyweights presenting their respective visions for Sancho.",
      "It has also been stated that Sancho would be willing to take a pay cut from the £13million per season he currently earns.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Robbie Fowler has compared Manchester United star Benjamin Sesko to an academy player as he continues to adapt to the Premier League. The Slovenian striker was signed for £74m in the summer from German side RB Leipzig.",
      "He has had a slow start to life at Old Trafford though, scoring just twice so far in 12 appearances. And he is now set to be restricted to the sidelines until at least mid-December having picked up an injury before the international break.",
      "For much of the summer, both Benjamin Sesko and Viktor Gyokeres were linked with moves to both United and Arsenal, with the latter ultimately making the move to North London. Therefore, the two are often compared as both get up to speed in the English top-flight.",
      "And Liverpool legend Robbie Fowler speaking to Adventure Gamers, was asked which striker looks better suited to the league, with Fowler pulling no punches in his Sesko assessment. “For me I think the obvious one is Gyokeres,\" he explained.",
      "“He's probably better suited to the Premier League and he understands what is needed in terms of speed, energy and commitment. Whereas Sesko has probably struggled a little at times. He looks a little bit, I hope this doesn't come across wrong, but he looks a bit of an academy player.",
      "“I have no doubt he's a good player. No one's questioning his ability, but at the minute I think out of those two it's Gyokeres by far who looks better equipped.”",
      "Alan Shearer has also been particularly critical of Sesko, having claimed that United would have been expecting more given the money they paid for the forward.",
      "Speaking to Betfair, he said: “One player that must do better for United is Benjamin Sesko. They paid 70 odd million for him.",
      "“That was a lot of money, I know it’s the market but it was too much. He’s had a tough start and I don’t expect huge things from him to be honest.",
      "“I think he’s a good player but I’m not sure he’s any more than that. He should have scored a couple more goals than he has so far. It’s been a tough start for him, especially considering the money United paid.”",
      "Sesko now faces an extended period on the sidelines despite avoiding serious injury. He will miss this weekend’s clash with Everton at Old Trafford, while he will also be out of upcoming clashes against Crystal Palace, West Ham, Wolves and Bournemouth.",
      "Man United head into this weekend’s game in seventh in the Premier League following a five-game unbeaten run. Joshua Zirkzee and Chido Obi are among the options that Amorim could select to lead the line in Sesko’s absence.",

The Sweden international, who was signed from Newcastle United for a whopping £125million on deadline day, has struggled to replicate the same success he enjoyed at St James' Park last season.",
      "Since his high-profile move to Anfield, Isak has only managed to find the back of the net once, spending much of the season either working on his fitness or recovering from an injury.",
      "The 26-year-old hasn't featured in any of Liverpool's last five matches under Arne Slot, but was on the subs bench during their 3-0 loss to title rivals Manchester City before November's international break.",
      "With Premier League football is set to resume this weekend - which will see Liverpool host Nottingham Forest at Anfield - Dwight Yorke has offered some words of wisdom to the striker.",
      "The former Man Utd player - who scored 123 goals in the Premier League throughout his career - reckons that Isak needs to make just one change to his game.",
      "\"Alexander Isak doesn't need to do everything that he did at Newcastle,\" Yorke said in an interview with Snabbare. \"He's got to fit in and recognise the quality around him at Liverpool.",
      "\"He simply has to play as the No.9. Be up there, hold the ball up, and get yourself into good goal-scoring positions because, at the end of the day, you've got to get the goals.",
      "\"When I played for Aston Villa, I used to come deep and link the play. Isak for Newcastle would come deep, dribble out into the wide areas and go past one or two defenders.",
      "\"He doesn't need to do all that for Liverpool. They have got flying wingers to take care of it for him, like Mohamed Salah, and a midfield with real quality behind him.",
      "\"That's the problem for Isak. Don't come deep.",
      "\"When you start to do all of that stuff, and you feel like you're that player, you end up losing time that you didn't need to spend on those parts of your game.",
      "\"He has to recognise that he doesn't need to do so much as an individual. Just be in your position.",
      "\"Put in the legwork. Do the simple things well.",
      "\"That means holding up the ball, linking up play and making sure that his teammates can find him in the box. It's a simple fix. It's not complicated.\"",

      "Benjamin Sesko faces the prospect of missing up to eight Manchester United matches, after the full severity of his knee injury was disclosed. The big-money summer signing was substituted during their 2-2 stalemate vs Tottenham - with several updates surfacing throughout the November international period.",
      "Slovenia manager Matjaz Kek initially indicated that no correspondence had been received from United prior to their fixture against Kosovo. That's while also emphasising that the national side warranted respect.",
      "Following defeat in that encounter, which meant Slovenia and Sesko will not be at next summer's tournament in the United States, Kek provided a further update that clearly outlined his position on various matters.",
      "\"Completely expected from the English media,\" he remarked regarding his earlier comments being blown out of proportion. \"But I emphasise, once again, the moment that communication was established between us and the Manchester United medical team, the problem was solved in five minutes.\"",
      "The essence of that discussion was, presumably, to confirm his unavailability, with United also bracing themselves to be without their No.30 for several weeks at minimum. The Athletic have reported that Sesko is now expected to be side-lined for approximately one month with a knee complaint.",
      "They have also highlighted that contingent on how his rehabilitation progresses, the 22-year-old could be absent for anything between three to five weeks. Should it prove to be the shorter timeframe, Sesko would potentially miss home fixtures at Old Trafford against Everton and West Ham United, as well as away journeys to Crystal Palace and Wolves.",
      "A five-week absence would also see him miss Premier League clashes against Bournemouth and Aston Villa, with a potential return on Boxing Day at home to Newcastle United. United will be keen for Sesko to be fit by then, especially as key attackers Amad and Bryan Mbeumo are set to represent Ivory Coast and Cameroon respectively at AFCON.",
      "Before Sesko's injury at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Harry Maguire and Casemiro were both substituted but appear to have escaped injury. Casemiro has since played and scored for Brazil, while Maguire, who was clutching his hamstring, has been seen putting in the effort at the gym.",
      "Long-term absentee Lisandro Martinez is also nearing a much-needed return. However, it's likely his comeback will be carefully managed given that he hasn't played since February.",

      "Manchester United have been told that signing Antoine Semenyo would take Ruben Amorim's side to the 'next level' - and Bournemouth will be powerless to stop them. Semenyo, 25, started the season on fire with six goals and three assists in six Premier League games.",
      "The Red Devils have prioritised signing players who are proven in the English top flight since Jason Wilcox became their sporting director, evidenced by the big-money arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. United are also keen on the likes of Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba, Joao Gomes and Adam Wharton, further proof that their focus is on domestic deals.",
      "Semenyo was a target for the Red Devils this summer, with Amorim reportedly meeting him for a meal in London to assess the forward's character. Since then, Semenyo's stock has risen rapidly, prompting links with Liverpool and Tottenham.",
      "It's recently emerged that the Ghana international has a £65million release clause which can be activated in January. Bournemouth therefore know that they won't be able to block Semenyo from leaving if he wishes, despite him signing a new five-year deal in July.",
      "A club would have to trigger his clause within the first two weeks of the transfer window in order to give the Cherries sufficient time to find a replacement for the 25-year-old. United have a golden opportunity to sign Semenyo, and former Arsenal and Manchester City right-back Bacary Sagna thinks that Old Trafford would be a 'good destination'.",
      "\"Looking forward, if he was to leave Bournemouth and stay in the Premier League, I think Manchester United would be a suitable option for him,\" Sagna told Oddspedia. \"He could definitely help the club get back to the top end of the league and if he did join them, he'd be regarded as the player which makes the difference and take United to the next level.",
      "\"He's young, fresh and has proven he can shine in big games this season - so I think Old Trafford could be a good destination for him.\"",
      "However, the Frenchman doesn't believe that Semenyo should quit Bournemouth just yet. \"If I was Antoine Semenyo, I would stay at Bournemouth until the end of the season,\" Sagna added.",
      "\"As a player, moving clubs in the January transfer window can be disruptive; it's much better to stay until the summer and then make a decision, and integrate into the team properly - rather than joining midway through a campaign.\"",
      "Semenyo will have the chance to audition at Old Trafford when Bournemouth make the visit on December 15. United aren't expected to spend big in January but in order to steal a march on their rivals, Wilcox and Co. might have to pull the trigger.",

      "Matheus Cunha has hailed Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim as ‘a winner’ and admitted he sees his best role as a 'false nine'. The Brazilian forward was tempted to move to Old Trafford by Amorim this summer after the Red Devils activated the £62.5m release clause in his Wolves contract.",
      "So far, Cunha has had a slow start to life at Old Trafford, having scored just once in his opening 11 appearances for the club. That form has coincided with a rollercoaster start to the season for United.",
      "The club endured a woeful first few months of the season, which saw the pressure crank up on Amorim. That has alleviated over recent weeks and Cunha has now made his feelings very clear on the Portuguese coach and teammate Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Speaking to Hayters while on international duty with Brazil, he said: “Amazing. What a player [Mbeumo]. You asked me some questions to think about United, right now my mind is in Brazil.",
      "“But it’s amazing to be there and it’s amazing to play with big players like Bryan. And to be coached by a winner is always something I feel privileged about.\"",
      "Cunha has played a number of roles throughout his career, both with his former clubs and current employers. Asked what his favourite position was, the 26-year-old claimed he was just happy to play, albeit preferred to take to the pitch as more of a withdrawn forward.",
      "He added: “My favourite position is to be on the pitch and help my team of course. Right now in Brazil, I have a different job to come a little bit and help the team in the build-up and attack as a striker.",
      "“I feel fine playing as a false nine, exactly, this kind of participation in the build-up and get on the ball more.”",

      "Antoine Semenyo's future could be one of the biggest talking points of the January transfer window. Notching six goals and three assists in Bournemouth's first six games of the Premier League season, the forward started the campaign on fire.",
      "Two of those came on the opening night against Liverpool, as the Cherries came from behind to level the scores at Anfield - only to lose 4-2 in the dying embers. Although Semenyo, 25, hasn't scored or assisted since the start of October, interest in him persists.",
      "It emerged on Monday that the Ghana international has a £65million release clause, adding to the simmering speculation over his future. Semenyo signed a new contract with Bournemouth in July, supposedly keeping him on the south coast until 2030.",
      "But Liverpool and Manchester United could test the Cherries' resolve this winter, with Tottenham also linked. It wouldn't be the first time that Semenyo has spoken to one of the so-called 'Big Six' either.",
      "While Bournemouth aren't pushovers by any means, they do have to accept reality. That's why chiefs at the Vitality Stadium have reluctantly accepted that they're powerless to stop Semenyo from leaving as soon as January, despite wanting to keep him until at least the end of this season.",
      "The Athletic were first to report news of his £65m release clause as well as Bournemouth's acceptance that a departure could be just over six weeks away. Notably, the proposed buyer - which can be any club at home or abroad - must activate the clause by a specific date in order to allow Bournemouth a couple of weeks to find a replacement.",
      "In a recent interview, Tim Bezbatchenko, general manager at Bournemouth, admitted that he'd struggle to deny Semenyo a move to an elite club and even mentioned Liverpool. \"When a club like Real Madrid, Liverpool, PSG come in and they're competing for Champions League positions, who are we to say, 'No, you can't go, you can't fulfil your dream',\" Bezbatchenko told the Business of Sport podcast.",
      "\"No it wouldn't be like that for all clubs because not everyone is Real Madrid. But there is an opportunity and everybody wins right? I think that's what we're trying to find, this commonality where everybody can win.\"",
      "With the signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, and interest in the likes of Elliot Anderson, Carlos Baleba and Adam Wharton, it's clear that United want to recruit Premier League-proven stars. That explains why Ruben Amorim reportedly had dinner with Semenyo in London at the end of last season to assess his character.",
      "Old Trafford chiefs Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are also said to have held talks with Bournemouth, with United willing to pay £55m. But it's claimed via The Transfers Podcast that Semenyo rejected their advances after discovering that United intended to offer him less money than their other targets.",
      "Liverpool may've spent £320m to reshape their attack just a few months ago but the Premier League champions are still looking to add to their squad. Multiple reports say that Liverpool are keeping tabs on the 25-year-old, who joined Bournemouth from Bristol City for £10m in January 2023.",
      "On paper, Semenyo would find it hard to find a place in Arne Slot's side but their form this season suggests that a readymade goalscorer could be exactly what they need. But can they afford another expensive outlay in the same financial year?",

      "Manchester United are set to bide their time come January in their pursuit of Crystal Palace starlet Adam Wharton. A pair of United legends agree that the 21-year-old is full of quality going forward.",
      "Ruben Amorim was given some new attacking tools to work with over the summer as Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arrived at Old Trafford. According to new reports it is his midfield that will be bolstered next.",
      "United supposedly have a long shortlist of midfield talent they will look to recruit and Palace ace Wharton is high in the club's estimations. Despite both Roy Keane and Rio Ferdinand agreeing that one aspect of his game is game-changing, it is thought that any approach will have to wait until next summer.",
      "Since Wharton arrived at Selhurst Park in January 2024 for £18.5million from Blackburn Rovers, he has quickly and seamlessly transitioned into one of the Premier League's finest young midfield stars.",
      "He is usually employed as a deep-lying playmaker, with a defensive engine, high IQ and a wide range of passing, which has been praised by United icons Keane and Ferdinand.",
      "Wharton is already in contention for England caps and he was in from the start in their latest 2-0 win against Albania. It was in this tie that Keane picked out what he thinks is the youngster's greatest quality.",
      "\"I do like Adam Wharton,\" said Keane after the win. \"A lot of the modern midfielders, their first option seems to be, 'Can I go sideways or backwards?'",
      "\"What I like about him, the first option he seems to look at it is, 'Can I pass it forward?' and that's a big strength to have. This is where he can mature over the next year or two if he's playing at the top level.",
      "\"Put demands onto people. Shout at players, go, 'Give me the ball!' That's what I used to do, I used to fall out with people a lot. 'Give me the ball!' Put demands on your team-mates.",
      "\"He's still new to it, so I'm not going to be too harsh on him. But as he matures and starts playing more games, put demands on your team-mates.\"",
      "Ferdinand agrees and is equally as impressed with Wharton's attacking transitions. He said on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel: \"I would sign another central midfielder this summer to play alongside Manuel Ugarte. That player needs to be able to take the ball and transfer it up the pitch. You know who I would go for? Adam Wharton.",
      "\"I would go get him. The reason I would take him is that he can get on the ball and transfer it up the pitch. Wharton has got a great range of passing. I think he would be a great addition to the United squad. He reminds me of Michael Carrick a bit.\"",
      "However, though it may be tempting to approach Wharton in January, ESPN report that United have a detailed plan regarding recruiting a midfielder. They suggest that Wharton is on the club's radar, but any move will be put off until next summer.",
      "United will reportedly shave off up to £1m per week in wages after players such as Casemiro, Harry Maguire and Jadon Sancho depart with their contracts set to expire in 2026. Marcus Rashford is also a high earner that the club are hoping can be offloaded after his loan move to Barcelona.",
      "The club are set to bide their time during the January window and then allow these stars to depart come the summer, which should free up some funds to pursue their top targets. These reportedly include Wharton, as well as Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Stuttgart's Angelo Stiller.",

      "Premier League leaders Arsenal are reportedly among several top-flight clubs reviewing their position ahead of a vote to introduce a controversial new salary cap. The proposed plans are said to now be 'under serious threat' ahead of Friday's meeting with top-flight representatives.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side was one of the driving forces behind the proposed introduction of 'anchoring', which would limit Premier League clubs to spending five times the figure paid in prize money and broadcast revenue to the side that finishes bottom of the division.",
      "Based on the most recent figures available from the 2023-24 campaign, clubs would be able to spend £550million based on the money Sheffield United earned after finishing 20th that season, receiving £109.5million.",
      "However, The Times claim that the departure of Tim Lewis from the Emirates Stadium, the former Arsenal executive vice-chairman, has softened the Premier League leaders' stance and plunged the plans into doubt.",
      "The report claims eight clubs are 'habouring reservations' over changes to the rules ahead of Friday's shareholder meeting. It adds that some clubs believe financial restrictions will impact Premier League clubs' performances in Europe and run the risk of missing out on world-class talent to rival leagues.",
      "Any change to impose anchoring would need a majority vote of 14 clubs voting in favour, with Arsenal among the 16 clubs to vote in favour of exploring anchoring last year.",
      "However, both Manchester United and Manchester City are opposed to introducing new regulations, and the Gunners' change in stance could seriously threaten the proposals.",
      "When contacted by The Mirror, the Premier League said: \"It is the League’s objective to maintain the Premier League’s value, competitive balance and ensure clubs operate in a financially sustainable way.",
      "\"We are engaging with our clubs, and they will continue to evaluate the proposals. They will have the opportunity to vote on them later this month.\"",
      "The proposals to introduce anchoring have also been criticised by several other sectors across the English game.",
      "The PFA have also threatened legal action ahead of a key shareholders' meeting, as reported by the Daily Mail.",
      "A spokesperson from the PFA warned: \"We've been clear with the Premier League that it is something we will oppose, but the Premier League themselves know that, even before the PFA does this, there will be clubs within their own room who will legally challenge the measure.",
      "\"The only ones who end up winning are the lawyers. We want to talk about football, we don't want to talk about legal bills. There are ways to engage on measures around financial sustainability, but this cannot be imposed unilaterally; it needs to be negotiated, and there are mechanisms (to consult) that need to be respected.\"",
      "In an official statement to Mirror Sport, responding to the above claim, a Premier League spokesperson said: \"We disagree with the PFA’s views regarding the proposed financial rules and the extensive consultation process we have been conducting with our clubs and other stakeholders.",
      "\"The PFA has had numerous opportunities since March 2024 to provide feedback on, and shape, the proposals and the principles that underpin them. Where the League has received feedback on the New Financial System from stakeholders, including the PFA, we have considered it carefully and, where appropriate, incorporated it into formulating the draft rules.",
      "\"It is the League’s objective to maintain the Premier League’s value, competitive balance, and ensure clubs operate in a financially sustainable way.‘We are engaging with our clubs, and they will continue to evaluate the proposals. They will have the opportunity to vote on them later this month.\"",
      "Three of football's biggest agencies, CAA Stellar, CAA Base and Wasserman, have told the Premier League that they will also embark on legal action if they do choose to introduce a salary cap.",

      "Marcus Rashford's dream of playing at the Camp Nou is set to become reality after Barcelona confirmed their imminent return to the iconic stadium. The Manchester United star's loan move to the Spanish giants was one the England forward actively pursued last summer, and he's been open about his desire for a permanent transfer to Catalonia.",
      "His time in Spain has been enjoyable despite being unable to feature at the club's legendary home due to a £1.3billion renovation project. Barcelona haven't played at the Camp Nou since 2023, instead hosting fixtures at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium.",
      "However, a homecoming is now on the cards for the Catalan side, who have confirmed they will return to the Camp Nou on Saturday when they host Athletic Bilbao.",
      "The club revealed that a licence has been approved for their return, with more than 45,000 supporters permitted to attend the match. The statement read: \"FC Barcelona informs that the match corresponding to matchday 13 of the League, against Athletic Club, scheduled for Saturday, November 22 at 16:15 hours, will finally be played at Spotify Camp Nou.",
      "\"This decision comes after obtaining the first occupancy license corresponding to Phase 1B, which allows increasing the capacity up to 45,401 spectators. This authorization includes the entire Lateral area and adds to the license already granted for Phase 1A, which covers the Tribune and South Goal.",
      "\"The Club continues working on Phase 1C to guarantee the resumption of activity in the North Goal, gathering all operational, security, and comfort conditions for members and fans.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 50% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Playing at Barcelona's iconic stadium was something Rashford confessed he'd long dreamed of achieving, and that ambition became reality earlier this week during an open training session before Saturday's match.",
      "Reflecting on his time at the venue, he said: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable. Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in. But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "The stadium's redevelopment is scheduled for completion in 2027, when its capacity will increase to 105,000, making it the fifth largest stadium globally.",
      "As for Barcelona's plans moving forward this season, the club has submitted a request to UEFA to switch their designated home venue back to the Camp Nou for the remainder of their Champions League fixtures.",
      "Rashford has notched up a team-leading 15 goals and assists across 16 matches in all competitions this campaign, with Barcelona sitting just three points adrift of Real Madrid in La Liga.",

      "Manchester United completed a huge rebuild of their attack in the summer - and are now set to move onto their next stage. Ruben Amorim is targeting an overhaul of the club’s midfield as his next task at Old Trafford.",
      "The futures of Casemiro and Kobbie Mainoo are in doubt and should both leave, that could see United move for a host of midfield additions. Club officials have already started compiling a list of potential names that they could move for.",
      "Premier League stars feature among the names on the shortlist, albeit all of them are expected to be expensive. But who is most likely to join United?",
      "Dubbed as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League by England boss Thomas Tuchel, Nottingham Forest star Elliot Anderson looks set to be at the heart of a battle between the Red Devils and former club Newcastle.",
      "Both Premier League sides are interested in the England man but it could be a difficult deal for both to do. Forest have categorically ruled out a January exit from the City Ground, while owner Evangelos Marinakis has placed a £100m price tag on his head.",
      "It remains to be seen whether United would be willing to fork out that amount. Anderson’s contract in the Midlands is set to run until the summer of 2029, having only sealed a £15m move to Forest from Newcastle last summer.",
      "Again, Anderson looks slightly out of reach for United as it stands so he might be one that they revisit in the summer.",
      "Brighton have harnessed a reputation as one of the most effective talent factories in the Premier League over recent seasons. But the Seagulls have not been afraid of selling their star men.",
      "The next off of the conveyer belt looks set to be Cameroonian midfielder Carlos Baleba. United are long-term admirers of the 21-year-old and attempted to sign him in the summer.",
      "They are expected to renew their interest in the near future but may have to pay up to £100m to secure his signature. Speaking earlier this season, Brighton chief Tony Bloom said: “I don’t think Baleba was a saga. There was interest from Manchester United, and we said that he wasn't available this summer and they went away.",
      "“So we've had many bigger sagas in the past. But Carlos Baleba, his improvement has been immense. Massively important player to this football club, and just delighted that he's with us for this season.”",
      "This one looks unlikely in January - but could become a real option next summer.",
      "Despite Wolves’ rotten season so far, Brazilian midfielder Joao Gomes has been a bright spot. The 24-year-old has emerged as one of the Black Country side's best players since his 2023 arrival from Flamengo.",
      "Recent reports have suggested that Man United are keeping a keen eye on him, with £44m thought to be enough to seal his services. In the meantime, former Wolves star Matheus Cunha has also shared his admiration of his compatriot.",
      "There are some caveats to a potential move though. Gomes only signed a new deal back in April, while Wolves might not be too keen on cashing in during the January window as they attempt to rescue their Premier League spot.",
      "Wolves have also promised new boss Rob Edwards that they won't be selling any key players in the winter window. Of course, that could change should United make an offer way in excess of Wolves' reported valuation. United will certainly be keeping an eye on developments ahead of any potential swoop.",
      "The former Chelsea star enjoyed an impressive debut season with following his permanent move to Spain, but Gallagher has fallen out of favour this term and has made just two league starts.",
      "It has already been suggested that the Red Devils have submitted an enquiry regarding the England star. And while Gallagher has revealed that he is ‘not satisfied’ with his current situation, he is not actively looking for a move away.",
      "He said: “No, no, of course not. I'm not satisfied. I don't think anyone is if they're not playing as much as they'd like, but I'll keep working very hard to help the team whenever I have the chance, and hopefully more opportunities to be a starter will come.",
      "“I'm very happy here. My goal is to win titles with Atleti and I want to have a bigger role in the team. And, as I've said, I'm going to keep working as hard as I can to play more minutes and help the team.”",
      "Gallagher remains under contract with Atletico until 2029. As it stands, he looks to be the most likely option for the Red Devils.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Premier League referee Mike Dean has denied Manchester United bias following complaints from rival supporters. The issues have been sparked following high-profile decisions being made during high-stakes matches in the Premier League.",
      "There has been a stigma surrounding United and referees for a number of years, which came to a head when former Liverpool winger Ryan Babel posted a picture of referee Howard Webb in a Manchester United kit following their encounter in 2011, landing him a £10,000 fine.",
      "Current top-flight referee Anthony Taylor has been in charge of a number of showdowns between the two North West clubs in recent years, which often sparks anger due to Taylor's affiliation with Greater Manchester, having grown up in Altrincham, also supporting the National League side.",
      "But the Wirral-born referee was keen to dismiss the notion of refereeing bias against any Premier League club, using Taylor as an example.",
      "\"I get where you’re coming from and Anthony [Taylor] is from Altrincham, he has supported them. He does Man United against Liverpool,\" he said speaking on the Overlap's Fan Debate. \"Having said that, Liverpool fans never complained when I officiated them and I’m a Tranmere fan. I get where you’re coming from and there could be a bit more thought in that.",
      "\"Sometimes, unfortunately, the best refs that we have live in certain areas, so there’s nothing you can do. You’re not going to have Man City vs Liverpool refereed by a guy who has only done one or two years in the Premier League, whether it's Oliver, Brooks or Kavanagh. It was like when Stuart Attwell did a game at Everton and gave a penalty, did someone complain?\"",
      "The game Dean is referencing involved Everton and Luton Town, where the Hatters were awarded a penalty. Luton picked up an important win during a crucial time in the Premier League relegation battle.",
      "The decision angered Nottingham Forest, leading to a social media post from the City Ground club, which ultimately landed the club an unprecedented fine of £750,000.",
      "Dean also discussed a so-called bias towards the Premier League's big six. But the 57-year-old feels that officials are making big calls against those teams on home soil now, more than ever.",
      "He said: \"You’ve got to ref what’s put out in front of you, if there’s a big call, make a big call. Refs aren’t afraid of big calls if it’s for the so-called, as you say, teams at Man U, City or Liverpool.",
      "\"If it’s an unpopular call, it’s an unpopular decision. You’ve got to referee 11 v 11 and forget what’s around. If you go to Burnley against Man City, I sent Sterling off for taking his shirt off, you could’ve said I overlooked it against a smaller team but you have to referee what’s in front of you.\"",
      "Liverpool recently lodged a complaint with the PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Limited) after Virgil van Dijk's header was ruled out for offside against Andy Robertson. The Reds didn't cite any foul play but were unhappy with the reasoning behind the Dutchman's header being chalked off.",
      "The referee for the encounter was Chris Kavanagh, with Michael Oliver on VAR. Meanwhile, Arne Slot was left aggrieved during their defeat to Manchester United after Bryan Mbeumo's opener early on.",
      "Alexis Mac Allister went down with a head injury after a collision with Van Dijk, but play continued, leading to United earning the lead. The referee in the middle for that was Michael Oliver as Harry Maguire scored late on to inflict further misery on the Reds.",
      "Taylor has managed more Liverpool matches than any other club, 12 more times than the likes of Arsenal and Chelsea, while he has officiated 55 United games and 49 Manchester City outings.",
      "In his last 10 matches involving the Premier League champions, he has been in charge of games against either City or United on three occasions.",

As such, they're ready to build on what club chiefs believe was an extremely positive summer transfer window when the new year hits.",
      "Having spent £200million to rebuild the club's ailing attack and finding themselves a new No.1 in the shape of Senne Lammens, adding more quality to United's midfield ranks is the next port of call. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes have emerged as Amorim's preferred options, but the Brazilian's long-term future remains in question, while there is also speculation that Uruguay international Manuel Ugarte could be sold to raise funds.",
      "There are also questions over the future of Kobbie Mainoo, with Amorim uncertain over his best role and the player having seen his World Cup hopes dwindle due to a lack of playing time.",
      "Nottingham Forest and England midfielder Elliot Anderson is well liked at United, but the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City are also keeping tabs on a player whose reputation is growing fast, while Brighton's Carlos Baleba is a long-term target. However, both would likely cost in excess of £100m.",
      "But, as first reported in Portugal, Wolves' Joao Gomes has emerged as an alternative. The Brazil international, hailed previously as \"unbelievable\" by United No.10 Matheus Cunha - a team-mate with the Selecao and during their time together at Molineux - has extensively been watched by United chiefs over the past 18 months and could be available for much cheaper than the aforementioned £100m duo. A £44m price tag has been mooted abroad.",
      "And that includes something akin to a gentleman's agreement with their new head coach not to sell the club's prized assets in January to give them the best possible chance of staying in to the Premier League. And that means keeping the ex-Flamengo star.",
      "Of course, that could change if United made an offer worth greatly in excess of Wolves' valuation of Gomes. But that figure would need to be well above the mooted price.",
      "For Gomes' part, he has a World Cup with Brazil next summer to think about and knows he needs to be playing regularly in the Premier League to give himself the best possible opportunity of being in Carlo Ancelotti's squad. He gets that at Wolves and may not initially in Manchester. However, a move to United may not still be there for him in summer, if United have other options on the table.",

Gomes has previously been linked with a move to United, with rumours intensifying as the January window approaches.",
      "United are in the market for a new midfielder, with several names being thrown into the mix, including Carlos Baleba of Brighton and Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest.",
      "Given the ongoing speculation, United may be tempted to enter the running to sign Gomes give his price tag is much less than half the price of other rumoured targets.",
      "The 26-year-old revealed in an interview in July 2024 why he sees similarities between Gomes and United star Casemiro, who has become his teammate at both club and international level. The United No.10 also hinted at why Gomes would be a welcome addition to Amorim's squad, describing the midfielder as 'humble'.",
      "\"Maybe Casemiro,\" Cunha said last year when asked which players reminds him of Gomes. \"He is a bit older now, but I put Casemiro's name there only to show where Joao Gomes could arrive.",
      "\"I think Joao has the possibility to arrive. He is very humble, and he works a lot. The good teams come like a gift when you do that.\"",
      "\"He is unbelievable on the pitch,\" Cunha added. \"I feel very secure. I feel like I can lose the ball when I have my midfielders behind me. He played very well for the national team, too.\"",
      "Casemiro has already won two major trophies during his time with United with triumphs in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup. Not to mention, the 33-year-old was part of a Real Madrid team that won three La Liga titles as well as five Champions League trophies.",

      "The January transfer window may be a notoriously difficult month for clubs to do business, but for Manchester United and other top teams it can present an opportunity. Players who are out of contract in the summer can speak to overseas clubs as early as January.",
      "If you are club like United where there are a number of players out of contract at the end of the campaign, you need to decide what the plan is for them before January rolls around. If you don't, you risk losing players who you may wish to keep. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at five players United must make decisions on before the January window opens.",
      "Tom Heaton",
      "Starting with the least urgent decision, Heaton has been a good servant for the club since moving back to Old Trafford. Some often underestimate the importance of the third-choice goalkeeper but Heaton has been part of the leadership team at United this season and he is clearly respected at the club.",
      "His future will depend on whether the former Burnley man wishes to retire at the end of the campaign. If he doesn't, the Reds will need to make a choice. But either way, they will want to know what is happening at the end of the season before January arrives.",
      "Tyrell Malacia",
      "This one feels like an open and shut case. Malacia requested to leave United in the summer transfer window but he was the one member of the 'bomb squad' to miss out on an exit.",
      "Ruben Amorim has reintegrated him into first-team training and he has made one appearance on the bench this season. His time at the club is coming to an end and United would more than likely welcome him signing a pre-contract agreement elsewhere in January.",
      "Jadon Sancho",
      "Certainly a trickier decision than Malacia. Not because there is a route back into the United fold for the winger but due to whether or not the club decides to take a risk and activate the 12-month extension in his deal.",
      "If they do that, the Reds will have two chances to gain some money back for the forward. However, they are only pushing the issue further down the line and activating an extra 12 months against his will doesn't seem like the right move for United to make.",
      "Sancho's time to earn a permanent exit for a fee has passed him by and United need to put this sorry saga to bed. His performances at Aston Villa have done little to suggest any club would want to pay a fee for him.",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Maguire has managed to turn around his career at Old Trafford and will now be remembered somewhat fondly for how he has bounced back. United would like to keep Maguire and you can tell he is a good person to have in the dressing room. The contract needs to be right though.",
      "Casemiro",
      "Arguably the trickiest decision on this list. Casemiro has been superb this season for United, he is their second top goalscorer and is enjoying a renaissance at Old Trafford. United hold an option to extend his contract by a further year but the Reds would like to negotiate him down from that lofty salary.",
      "There seems to be a severe lack of affordable and quality defensive midfielders at present and United will know that. But if Casemiro is unwilling to agree to a lower salary, the Reds will have no choice but to move on, but that decision needs to be made soon.",

      "Matheus Cunha labelled Ruben Amorim \"a winner\" when asked about the Manchester United boss while on international duty.",
      "The Reds signed Cunha for £62.5m from Wolves in the summer. The early part of the campaign was particularly challenging for the club, increasing the pressure on Amorim. However, recent weeks have brought some relief and Cunha has expressed his admiration for the Portuguese coach and teammate Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "While on international duty with Brazil, Cunha told Hayters when asked to describe Amorim and fellow summer signing Mbeumo: \"Amazing. What a player [Mbeumo]. You asked me some questions to think about United, right now my mind is in Brazil.",
      "\"But it's amazing to be there and it's amazing to play with big players like Bryan. And to be coached by a winner is always something I feel privileged about.\"",
      "Throughout his career Cunha has played in various different roles. When asked about his favourite position, the 26-year-old said he was simply happy to play.",
      "He continued: \"My favourite position is to be on the pitch and help my team, of course. Right now in Brazil, I have a different job to come a little bit and help the team in the build-up and attack as a striker.",
      "\"I feel fine playing as a false nine, exactly, this kind of participation in the build-up and get on the ball more.\"",
      "Cunha could be called upon to play the false nine role next week depending on Benjamin Sesko's fitness. The forward limped off in the draw with Tottenham Hotspur with a knee injury.",
      "United could be without him when the Premier League returns. Amorim's men welcome Everton and former manager David Moyes to Old Trafford on Monday night.",
      "Cunha featured for just over 60 minutes when Brazil faced Senegal at the Emirates Stadium, and could again be in action on Tuesday night when they take on Tunisia.",
      "United return to action next week on the back of a five-match unbeaten streak, having salvaged a late 2-2 draw with Tottenham before the international break.",

      "Manchester United sent plenty of players out on loan in the summer transfer window.",
      "Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana were among the highest-profile loan exits from the club, while Rasmus Hojlund and Jadon Sancho completed moves to Napoli and Aston Villa respectively.",
      "There were several players from the academy sent on loan to gain experience. Some of those youngsters are excelling, while others have not made the impact they might have hoped. United loaned 18 players in total - and here is how they are faring this season.",
      "Sheffield Wednesday have been hit with a 12-point deduction due to their ownership situation, but they were able to promise regular game time to Amass, who has made 11 starts. The youngster scored his first senior goal against Southampton and United are delighted with his stint so far.",
      "Collyer was limited to seven substitute appearances after his arrival. He broke into the starting team against Millwall last month and retained his role in the next game, but he picked up a muscle injury.",
      "Ennis spent the second half of last season with promotion-winning Doncaster Rovers. The youngster joined Fleetwood on a season-long deal for this campaign and he has started eight league games. Has contributed two goals and an assist during his positive loan spell in League Two.",
      "Gore picked up an injury shortly after signing for Rotherham last January, but he made a strong impression in the time he was available, so he was re-signed for this season. Gore has been crucial for Rotherham in midfield. Has started in 15 games in League One and has been one of their best players.",
      "Onana has received praise in the Turkish media since his move to Trabzonspor, who have lost just once in the league from a possible eight games since he signed. The 29-year-old has recorded three clean sheets and helped Trabzonspor to third in the table.",
      "After missing the opening two games of the League Two campaign due to a minor injury, Harrison started the next four games for Shrewsbury Town before reporting for England Under-20 duty in September. In his absence, another young goalkeeper came into the side and has earned first-choice status over Harrison.",
      "Hugill started the first two games of the season for Barnet in League Two, but he picked up an injury and has been absent since.",
      "Defender Aljofree started the first eight games of the campaign and notched a goal but he has lost his starting role over the last few weeks. The 20-year-old was not in the squad for Notts County played Harrogate Town last weekend.",
      "Solihull Moors are midtable in the National League. Jackson started in their first two games of the season, but he has struggled to make the XI since. The centre-back has been absent from their last five matchday squads.",
      "Hojlund made an excellent first impression in Naples, scoring twice against Sporting Lisbon in the Champions League shortly after his arrival, but he has scored just four goals in total. Hojlund has copped some flak from the Italian media for his recent performances. Napoli won Serie A last season but sit fourth.",
      "Kana-Biyik recently scored his first senior goal. He salvaged a point for Lausanne in a local derby and was called up to France's Under-20 squad for the November international break.",
      "Moorhouse has made 15 appearances for League One side Leyton Orient, but just four of those have been league starts. The youngster has shown glimpses of quality from the bench.",
      "Dave Hughes, who coached Ogunneye in United's academy, has just departed Newport County. That might impact Ogunneye's role in the squad, but the youngster has made 13 league starts in League Two so far and gained valuable experience, albeit in a struggling dressing room.",
      "Barcelona seemed a great fit for Rashford to rediscover his form. The United academy graduate has contributed six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances this season, and has looked back to his best.",
      "Rashford has been revitalised by leaving on loan - but Sancho continues to be in a slump. The winger has not started for Aston Villa in the Premier League and has failed to record a goal or an assist.",
      "Vitek has started every league game for Bristol City in the Championship, keeping five clean sheets. The 22-year-old has made some great saves. Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber recently said of Vitek to the Bristol Post: “He’s young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.”",
      "Wheatley needed to leave on loan after outgrowing academy football. The young striker has made 13 starts in League Two for Northampton and has found the back of the net twice, as well as recording two assists.",
      "Williams is performing well north of the border. Has contributed a goal and three assists in nine appearances in the Scottish top-flight for Falkirk, who are exceeding expectations by sitting fifth in the table.",

      "Zidane Iqbal is used to making history.",
      "The midfielder became the first British-born South Asian to represent Manchester United and the first to play in the Champions League. Iqbal came off the bench against Young Boys in December 2021 and at that stage in his career it looked only a matter of time until he was handed more regular opportunities.",
      "Chances may not have materialised at Old Trafford but Iqbal and his Iraq team-mates have a significant one tonight. A win against the United Arab Emirates in the home leg of their World Cup qualifying play-off will keep alive the dream of qualifying for the tournament next summer.",
      "Iqbal, who was the first Iraqi to play for United, came off the bench in last week's first leg, which ended 1-1 and leaves Iraq as marginal favourites to progress. Should they prevail they will enter a six team inter-continental play-off in March. Their world ranking is likely to see them go straight into one of the two finals and thus one win away from the World Cup.",
      "For Iraq that would be a first appearance since their sole qualification in 1986. For Iqbal it would be the latest piece of history and perhaps vindication for opting to leave United and move to Utrecht in the Netherlands.",
      "The tipping point for the now 22-year-old was a lack of opportunities and a seeming lack of trust from then manager Erik ten Hag in granting him a first team chance during the 2022-23 campaign.",
      "\"I thought I would get a chance and unfortunately I didn’t,\" said Iqbal in an interview last summer. \"I just wanted 10 minutes off a bench to show myself and it really frustrated me that the gaffer didn’t seem to rate me enough to give me a chance to show if I could sink or swim.",
      "\"I spoke to my dad and agent and said: 'I can't do this for another year'. From the outside, it looked amazing to all my friends because I was training and travelling with United’s first team. For me, it was mentally tough because I was just training and not allowed to play with the Under-23s. I thought to myself, 'I'm just like a number'.",
      "\"I was supposed to start a cup game against Charlton. I was in all the shapes and patterns in pre-match training. I was starting as a 10 and Lisandro Martinez came up to me and said: 'Now's your chance'. He talked to me and said, 'all of us are supporting you. Just show yourself, you're a good player. We're going to fight for you, make sure you're ready to fight'. It motivated me and it was nice from him, an aggressive leader in the team, a big player. I got tickets for family and friends to see me. Finally, my chance.",
      "\"Then I got to the stadium, looked at the whiteboard and didn't see my name. I was gutted. Then I thought I'd come off the bench. Nothing. That was the turning point for me. I didn't feel the manager respected me enough to play me.\"",
      "Iqbal turned down the chance to play at the Under-19 World Cup in April 2023 after Ten Hag told him he wanted to retain him as part of the United senior squad, but no club minutes followed and that summer he left for the Netherlands for a fee in the region of £1million.",
      "Injury has hampered his opportunity for regular minutes in Holland but he is closing in on 50 senior opportunities for the club and is a regular for the national team, scoring a crucial goal in a victory over Indonesia earlier this season. He'd love another against the UAE this afternoon (4pm), it would be the latest chapter of a history-making career.",

      "Jadon Sancho's challenging four-year stint at Manchester United appears to be nearing its conclusion. The England international has not featured under Ruben Amorim, having spent the previous season on loan at Chelsea before moving to Aston Villa for the 2025/26 campaign.",
      "The 25-year-old has primarily been utilised in the Europa League by Emery, clocking up 336 minutes this season - just under a quarter of which have been in the Premier League. He is yet to make a starting appearance in the latter competition, with a brief substitute appearance against Manchester City ending abruptly when he was taken off.",
      "Emery later clarified that the decision was due to fitness concerns, as Sancho had played 67 minutes in Europe just days prior. However, it seems he is part of Villa's second-choice team, with updates now surfacing about his future at Old Trafford and the three clubs he could potentially join next year.",
      "Sancho penned a five-year deal when he transferred from Borussia Dortmund to United in 2021, meaning that contract is set to run out in roughly six months.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Sancho will leave the club as a free agent, having made 83 appearances and scored 12 goals with six assists over what is technically just two years, considering his loan spells elsewhere.",
      "United will be relieved to remove his substantial wages from their books, but will undoubtedly regret the possibility of losing a player who cost them £73million for nothing.",
      "One destination during Sancho's career was former club Borussia Dortmund, who may attempt to re-sign him. He contributed to their run to the 2024 Champions League final before an underwhelming loan period at Chelsea last season.",
      "Unai Emery evidently values Sancho, though his intentions regarding a permanent transfer remain unclear. Villa, who are covering 80 per cent of Sancho's wages, did not include an obligation to buy clause in his loan agreement with United, but would likely be leading contenders should they choose to pursue a deal at the season's end.",
      "Reports in September suggested that Villa were already considering making his transfer permanent. Nevertheless, Sancho's restricted playing time since his summer arrival has done little to support that notion.",
      "Despite this, Villa manager Emery has no doubts about Sancho's abilities. \"When Leon Bailey left, it was a moment for us to assess the players we had identified through our scouting,\" Emery said when asked about the decision to bring in the winger.",
      "\"We then had the opportunity to make a signing, and one of the players on our list was Jadon Sancho. He's capable of playing on both the right and left wings, and he provides something different. He's a good player - 25 years old - and I felt he performed very well last year at Chelsea.",
      "\"Yes, he had some problems at Manchester United, but during his time at Borussia Dortmund, he performed fantastic. He's also played 25 times for England. He's still young, still hungry, and has the ability to show his skills and qualities.",
      "\"Hopefully, we can bring out the best in him here. In the last few years, he's played more on the left, but at Dortmund, he was more often on the right. Here, I see him being able to play in both of those positions.\"",
      "Sancho is due to complete the remainder of the current campaign on loan at Villa, with no break clause inserted into the agreement, which means United cannot bring him back in January.",
      "Sancho looks likely to depart United when his contract runs out next summer, although there remains a possibility he could secure a permanent transfer during the January window.",
      "According to CaughtOffside, 'discreet but meaningful discussions' took place throughout the November international break between Sancho's advisers and representatives from Fenerbahce, Galatasaray, and Besiktas.",
      "The report also suggested that these meetings happened at an upmarket hotel, where the three Turkish clubs each outlined their individual plans for Sancho. It has also been suggested that Sancho would be prepared to accept a reduction in his current £13million per season salary.",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim will be eagerly awaiting news on Benjamin Sesko's injury ahead of the clash with Everton.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is the only other senior forward available to Ruben Amorim, but he has been on the fringes of first team action this season.",
      "United could be without Sesko for the visit of Everton next Monday, so how will they line up if the Slovenian is not fit?",
      "If Amorim continues to overlook Zirkzee when naming his starting XI, United will adopt a strikerless system against Everton. This could see Noussair Mazraoui retain his place at right wing-back with Amad in the No.10 role. Bryan Mbeumo could then move across to the left with Matheus Cunha leading the line in a 'false nine' role.",
      "This would give Mazraoui some more much-needed minutes having been eased back into action by Amorim following an injury. It also pushes Amad into a more offensive position, with the Ivorian having struggled with the defensive side of his role at right wing-back at times.",
      "However, if Everton play with a low block at Old Trafford, having an attacking outlet like Amad at right wing-back might be a good option. If he does start in that role, we can expect to see Mason Mount brought back into the starting XI to play alongside Mbeumo.",
      "Amorim is a big fan of Mount and he has so far managed to avoid any major injury concerns this season.",
      "United have looked impressive when playing in a strikerless formation at times this season and with plenty of options for Amorim to choose from, Sesko's absence might not be felt as harshly as you'd expect if he is ruled out.",

      "Modern football is often a reflection of the world surrounding it.",
      "When the older generations were watching the sport in the 1960s and 1970s, discussions surrounding the mental stability of a player or the squad was rarely aired. However, as the world became more aware of the challenges of mental health, football has accepted it and now each Premier League club takes into account the psychological fortitude of a player during every aspect of their career - all the way from scouting to the day they depart.",
      "Manchester United are no exception and within their current squad there are two players who are facing mental challenges which shall be putting them to the test. First, is Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Little more than a year after suffering a severe foot injury, the Argentine damaged his ACL and has been sidelined since February. He is now back with the United camp as he continues his recovery and his return to the pitch is expected before the festive period.",
      "But managing to navigate past the mental barrier of returning to professional football will be the crucial step in Martinez's recovery. Specialist in psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University Dr Martin Turner, who has worked with The FA and Scarlets Rugby, believes the 27-year-old could come back a stronger athlete.",
      "\"I imagine he [Martinez] will be worrying that it [his injury] would happen again,\" Dr Turner told MEN Sport. \"That is just sensible. That is just the reality.",
      "\"What you wouldn’t want a player like that to do is delude themselves that this will never happen again and everything is always going to be hunky-dory because sport is so unpredictable, and there is so much uncertainty that you can never really predict what is going to happen.",
      "\"But having gone through two quite difficult injuries, he will have learnt quite a lot and his personality and character would have had some shifts. From my experience of working with athletes who have especially had these back-to-back injuries and even sometimes surgeries, they do develop a shift in their personality.",
      "\"I wouldn’t say it is necessarily more resilience, but there is clarity there of what this means to them. They suddenly have a gratitude and thinking of: ‘Well, this could go away at any minute, so I am going to apply myself doubly compared to what I was doing before. I am going to really take care of this and do all the right things.'\"",
      "\"You can’t put it to one side and say that is done now because there will be monitoring that takes place after training and after performances around that injury and around recovery to make sure that everything is going well.",
      "\"There will be physical limitations because it will have been a long time since they have played to the intensity of a proper game.",
      "\"So it is not just a case of putting it to the back of your mind but about trusting the medical professionals you are working with to know that they would not let you step on this pitch, if you wasn’t physically right. Players have to take confidence from that and trust the people they are working with and then they can trust their bodies.\"",
      "Martinez's teammate Bryan Mbeumo is currently negotiating a different type of mental challenge heading out of the international break. Last week, Cameroon lost to DR Congo in World Cup qualifying meaning Mbeumo's national team will not be competing in the USA, Mexico and Canada next summer.",
      "Missing out on the World Cup, arguably the pinnacle of football, will have been a bitter blow for Mbeumo to take but Dr Turner believes that United do not have to fear the forward's confidence dropping upon his return to England.",
      "\"I am not sure they would have to do, or do anything special there,\" he explained. \"Experienced players are able to lift themselves, really, and move on quite quickly. One of the good things about football in particular is how quickly things move from game-to-game.",
      "\"Say you play badly and then you play well in the next game, it is sort of completely forgotten. Things move on so quickly so he would be expected to come back and hit the ground running and get his club mentality on.",
      "\"I think the direction of football, particularly in this country, is more of a club mentality and it is realised that is your bread and butter. I wouldn’t foresee any issues there and I wouldn’t expect staff to do anything in particular for that player.",
      "\"I might be wrong and I have no idea what is going on behind the scenes, but from my experience of being in environments like that, it would be an expectation to get back on your feet and go again.",
      "\"The more that you make a big deal of something that has happened or bring it into the room, the more that is going to affect other players so you have got to get him back moving, playing and within the mentality of the squad.\"",

      "Following the disaster at Manchester City, Shaw has been dependable for the Reds this campaign in a back three. He had to deal with plenty of criticism following that derby day defeat - notably from Roy Keane - and after addressing it, he set about making amends.",
      "Ever since that game, Shaw has got better and better for United and you can see him settling into his new role on the left side of defence. That's why it was surprising when England head coach Thomas Tuchel overlooked him for the final World Cup qualifiers this month.",
      "While being overlooked for selection will have been a blow to Shaw, Ruben Amorim will have taken the positives from the decision. He admitted himself, from a selfish perspective, he wanted all his players to be training and recovering at United during the international break. But he would still be delighted to see Shaw competing with England.",
      "\"For me, I want him to go to the national team, but I also want Luke Shaw to train with me, recover with me, and be prepared for my game, so I'm a little bit selfish on that, so if he's not going to the national team, for me it's fine, because I can control better what he's doing,\" Amorim said earlier this season.",
      "While missing out on the November camp was a big blow for Shaw, Tuchel has admitted it is not necessarily the end of his World Cup dream. \"First of all, it's my job now to make contact with everyone,\" the England head coach said at the end of the Three Lions' final international break this year.",
      "\"Players like Trent [Alexander-Arnold], players that are on our long list, 55, 60 players, to reach out to them, be in touch with them, explain to them why they were not here. Explain to them what they have to do, where they can improve.",
      "\"Can they even do something or is it just a choice, so this is my job in the next weeks and months.\"",
      "Shaw and Harry Maguire will be on Tuchel's list of 55-60 players who he is in contact with to discuss their spots in the England squad.",
      "That phone call should work to United's benefit. Shaw will know exactly what he needs to do over the next few months to put himself in contention and that can only help United.",
      "Shaw will be eager to show Tuchel that he was wrong to overlook him. The best way to do that will be to impress for Amorim and the Reds.",

      "Manchester United centre-back Matthijs de Ligt has admitted he is finding the five-at-the-back system under Ruben Amorim easier as time progresses.",
      "Amorim has been heavily criticised for his decision to stick with the five-at-the-back defence, with three centre-backs playing alongside two wing-backs. Some argued the Portuguese head coach needed to be pragmatic and revert to a traditional four-at-the-back system in order to secure results.",
      "Prior to the Burnley victory and with scrutiny mounting, the United boss told reporters: \"Guys, if I feel that it's best to change... I played all my life in the 4-4-2, 4-3-3. The only system that I didn't play one minute: 3-4-3.",
      "\"I just have one idea that we need to be so good in this way of playing, then we are going to adapt. It's like some coaches have a mentality that I'm going to put this system, and then I'm going to change.",
      "\"What I'm thinking is that we have one system that is going to adapt to different systems, and then when everyone is doing this with his eyes shut, I'm going to change a lot of things.\"",
      "United are on a five-game unbeaten run and sit a point outside the top four. Integral to this recent form has been De Ligt, who has started every Premier League match for Amorim this season.",
      "On Monday night, he played the full 90 minutes alongside Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk in a back four as the Netherlands beat Lithuania in their final World Cup qualifier to top their group. After the game, De Ligt was quizzed on his preference and the 26-year-old insisted that he does not have one.",
      "\"No, I don't really have a preference,\" he told Flashscore. \"We play with a five-man defence at Manchester United, but on paper, we defend with four.",
      "\"It didn't feel awkward today; it felt the same as always. I can play in both systems. I'm more experienced with a five-man defence now; the more experience you have, the easier it gets.\"",
      "In the last match before the November international break, you could see De Ligt's point in practice. United would often drop to a back four with Luke Shaw moving into central midfield.",
      "The Netherlands have now qualified for the World Cup and De Ligt expressed his delight post-match to have made his first start for his country since last November. \"Whether it's a comeback? Yeah, a bit,\" he admitted.",
      "\"I wasn't here last time, I haven't started for a long time, so I'm delighted with today. The season is going well so far.",
      "\"I'm not sure if you call it a comeback season, but I'm feeling well, and it's going better with the club, and now I'm rewarded with a start, so that's great.\"",
      "\"It's [the World Cup] still far away,\" De Ligt added. \"It'll be about being fit a lot, that's the most important thing to everyone.\"",

      "Former Premier League referee Mike Dean has rejected accusations of bias against Manchester United from Anthony Taylor, as the quality of refereeing in the top flight was brought into the spotlight.",
      "The Cheshire referee was appointed as the official for United's encounter against Liverpool last year, casting fresh light on the 47-year-old's association in the North West. Taylor supports Altrincham, of the National League, and grew up in the town, which led to some complaints regarding his appointment for matches involving both United and Manchester City.",
      "At the time of his appointment for last season's United vs Liverpool game, ex-Premier League referee Keith Hackett said: \"I do not understand why Anthony Taylor has been given the Liverpool game against Manchester United and I do not think he should be doing it.\"",
      "Expressing worries for the referee's personal safety, the former referee added: \"There is a risk to his personal safety and that of his family after the game if something was to go wrong. That is not right. The fact he lives so close to Old Trafford means he has been put under unnecessary pressure and it could have been avoided if the game had been given to another referee from the Select Group.\"",
      "Despite being on the border of Greater Manchester, the elite referee has overseen numerous clashes between the two North West rivals in recent seasons.",
      "His involvement in City and United's matches was brought up again this week during the Overlap's Fan Debate, but Dean was quick to shut down any suggestions of officiating prejudice towards any Premier League side and defended his appointments for their matches.",
      "\"I get where you're coming from and Anthony [Taylor] is from Altrincham, he has supported them. He does Man United against Liverpool,\" he said during an appearance on the Overlap's Fan Debate.",
      "\"Having said that, Liverpool fans never complained when I officiated them and I'm a Tranmere fan. I get where you're coming from and there could be a bit more thought in that.",
      "\"Sometimes, unfortunately, the best refs that we have live in certain areas, so there's nothing you can do.",
      "\"You're not going to have Man City vs Liverpool refereed by a guy who has only done one or two years in the Premier League, whether it's Oliver, Brooks or Kavanagh. It was like when Stuart Attwell done a game at Everton and gave a penalty, did someone complain?\"",
      "United icon Wayne Rooney interrupted with a surprising claim that Taylor has trained with United before and is actually a good player. He said: \"He’s a good player, he’s trained with us a few times… he actually did.\"",
      "According to PGMOL regulations, referees must not take charge of matches involving teams they support. Altrincham club president told The Athletic previously: “Anthony has always been an Altrincham fan.",
      "\"Even now, he gets a season ticket every year, despite the fact he can’t go to all the matches. People around here always ask if you’re a Red or a Blue. He’s actually a great advocate for non-League football and should be praised, not criticised.\"",

      "Manchester United will find it difficult not to look on enviously at Barcelona this season considering how well Marcus Rashford has done for them.",
      "The loan spell to Catalonia was the last throw of the dice for Rashford. His bridges were burnt with Ruben Amorim and, for all involved, the best thing to do was to let him leave.",
      "Rashford wanted Barca in January but an approach was not deemed viable by the La Liga giants. Fortunately for the United academy graduate, they returned in the summer and the deal was done.",
      "He joined the Camp Nou club on a season-long loan with the option to purchase him in the summer. If all goes according to plan for United, Rashford will impress, Barca will trigger that option and the winger's time in Spain continues.",
      "Six goals and nine assists in 16 appearances suggests Barca will want to keep Rashford. Whether they have the finances to do it is another issue. Barca can sign the England international for £28m in the summer but the financial pressures Barcelona face are well documented.",
      "No matter how well Rashford does at Barca or for England, he will not have a place to come back to at Old Trafford. Amorim has made his mind up and therefore the task would be to find him a new club.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "With that in mind, United know what they can't do. Sell Rashford to a Premier League rival. In Spain, El Nacional has reported that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have both made early contact with Rashford's agent to try and persuade him to move to the Premier League. United can't let that happen.",
      "If he was to impress in the Premier League, suddenly Rashford becomes a more prominent issue for the United head coach. So ideally United must find a way of making things work with Barca. The alternative of him returning to England with Chelsea or Spurs is not worth thinking about.",
      "United can only hope that if it comes to it, Rashford still does not fancy a move down to London...",

      "Manchester United fans will have eagerly taken in Casemiro's latest Brazil masterclass as the midfielder looks to tie down his spot in Carlo Ancelotti's plans. And the midfield maestro turned the clock back as he scored in a 2-0 friendly win over Senegal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.",
      "He and Chelsea winger Estevao each contributed as the Selecao continue to make progress under former Real Madrid chief Ancelotti. And the response from Brazilian media suggests United star Casemiro will indeed have an important role to play at the 2026 World Cup.",
      "The major question for United fans is whether that will be as a United player, with Casemiro's contract due to expire next summer. The club hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension to his stay, and Casemiro has been making a strong case despite his eye-watering £350,000-a-week salary.",
      "News outlets in his home country have nevertheless been raving following his impressive performances for his national team this season, with his latest display showing he \"has evolved\" at a late stage in his career while also becoming his side's \"main leader\" ahead of next summer's World Cup.",
      "\"There is no longer any reason to divide the midfield, as was done in Brazil in recent decades, between the number five, number eight and number 10 shirts,\" read one report of the win against Senegal in Folha de Sao Paulo. \"They blend together. As Klopp, former Liverpool coach, said, more important than a good, classic number 10 is recovering the ball closer to the opponent's goal.",
      "\"Even better is having both options, the pressure and the star player, which happens in many teams. There is still room for midfielders who play more centrally and further back, who protect the defence and initiate offensive plays with excellent passes.",
      "\"They are the links between defence and attack. Great teams have this type of player. Casemiro, who has always stood out from midfield back, has evolved and is now a great playmaker.\"",
      "The 33-year-old has shown that in spades of late, having collected three goals and one assist in his last four outings for club and country. Casemiro, who was recalled to the Brazil squad by Ancelotti after a two-year hiatus, is expected to contribute in more areas for United than he was during his days at Real, and that has helped redefine his importance at both levels.",
      "After securing a new role as a playmaker in Ancelotti's side, it also appears the midfielder could well be heading to the World Cup with a starting spot following his latest impressive performance.",
      "\"But it was the creative and attacking players of the Brazilian national team who were the protagonists of last night,\" read an excerpt of Globo's report. \"Increasingly in sync, Casemiro and Bruno Guimaraes are consolidating themselves as the starting midfield duo for the World Cup.",
      "\"Since Ancelotti's arrival, both have demonstrated a good ability to alternate in chasing down opposing midfielders and participating in the build-up to attacking plays.\"",
      "Correio Braziliense piled on with their praise by suggesting Ancelotti has indeed found his preferred formula: \"Casemiro, one of the few remaining players from the last World Cup and the team's main leader alongside Marquinhos, sealed the result. Both goals were scored in the first half, a period in which the Brazilian team was flawless.",
      "\"The presentation suggests that Ancelotti has found a starting line-up. Or at least he's close to it. It's quite likely that the 11 who started the match in the English capital will be at the World Cup. And that some of them will be starters at the World Cup hosted in Canada, the United States and Mexico.\"",

      "Manchester United goalkeeper Senne Lammens has received the seal of approval from club legend Sir Alex Ferguson following an impressive run of form.",
      "The 23-year-old shot-stopper joined the Red Devils from Belgian side Royal Antwerp for just over £18million toward the end of the summer transfer window. Since then, he has established himself as the first choice under Ruben Amorim, starting each of the last five games.",
      "While he has kept only one clean sheet in that time - a 2-0 win over Sunderland - three victories mark a significant improvement on the start of the season and have lifted United to seventh in the table, just a point off the top four.",
      "Having missed out on Europe altogether after a dismal league finish last term, reclaiming their place near the top of the table is imperative for Amorim’s side this season.",
      "So far, so good for United, as Ferguson believes the signs are encouraging in light of recent results. Praise rarely comes higher from a United perspective, given what the Scot achieved during his lengthy tenure, and he has been particularly impressed by Lammens as well as Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "“There are signs, the manager has had some good signs,” Ferguson said in an interview with Raceday RTV. “Particularly the goalkeeper - he’s been outstanding. He’s only played three or four games and he’s looking really good.",
      "“Of course, Mbeumo and Cunha, the new players from Wolves and Brentford, have added to it. I hope the manager gets a bit of success because at United you need to have success - and the signs are getting better.",
      "“I think back-to-back wins is something teams like United should always expect. But having gone through a cycle where improvement requires patience, they’ll enjoy it now.”",
      "The goalkeeper position has been something of a problem area for United in recent years following the departure of David de Gea in the summer of 2023. Andre Onana was initially signed as his replacement for a hefty £47 million from Inter Milan, but despite some positive moments, the Cameroon international never fully convinced as United’s long-term solution.",
      "Amorim handed Turkey’s Altay Bayindir an opportunity at the start of this season to stake his claim, but he too struggled to convince, prompting United to return to the transfer market. Now, just a few months into his time at the club, Lammens already looks like a smart piece of business and someone capable of making the position his own.",
      "After the international break, United face a crucial run of fixtures in the build-up to Christmas, with winnable matches against the likes of Everton, Crystal Palace, West Ham, Wolves, Bournemouth and Aston Villa. With full focus on Premier League football, climbing the table and breaking into the top four will be Amorim’s priority in the weeks ahead.",

      "The midfielder only made 34 appearances for the Reds but that did not stop Ferguson from being livid with the Irishman for choosing to leave. Reflecting on the conversation he had with the legendary manager ahead of the release of his new book Pass Master, O'Brien told Chronicle Live: \"I didn’t expect him to be impressed with the news I had to tell him.",

After being sent off on his debut for United away at Southampton live on TV, O'Brien found himself under scrutiny like never before.",
      "Sir Bobby Charlton even stormed the team bus before it departed the south coast to lambast O'Brien for his tackle on Mark Dennis. But the ex-midfielder said that Ferguson was a lot more understanding about the situation.",

      "Here are how the players have rated so far this season:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "The bar was low to impress between the sticks, but Lammens has made a huge impact since his strong debut against Sunderland. The Belgium international has made a supremely confident start to life at Old Trafford, and the \"are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" chants tell you how he has performed. 7",

      "It was only a matter of time before Bayindir lost his first-choice status. He made a mistake against Arsenal on the opening day of the campaign and another error against Burnley at Old Trafford. Made some good saves against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium, but still conceded three. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Has started every Premier League game on the left side of the back three. Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby, but he bounced back against Chelsea in the following week and hasn't really put a foot wrong since then. His passing has been a huge asset from the back. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "Maguire started on the bench for the first four games of the campaign. Technically recorded an assist against Chelsea and scored the matchwinner at Anfield. Maguire has produced some memorable moments during his United career, but he will look back on that goal with particular fondness. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "De Ligt has markedly improved this season. He is showing the kind of form that saw him earn a reputation as one of Europe's best defensive prospects, and he is delivering consistent performances each week. He is still the only United player to have played every minute in the Premier League. 8",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Yoro has started seven league games this season. He has been substituted off in five of those matches, with Amorim reshuffling his defensive line in the closing stages of contests. Looked to have scored for United at Craven Cottage in August, but it was marked down as an own-goal. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "It's been a mixed bag for Dalot this season. Has recently been asked to play at left-wing back, and he didn't look comfortable in that role - he is better on the right - against Sunderland and Nottingham Forest. Was dropped to face Tottenham last weekend. 5",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Dorgu looked sharp in pre-season and started the campaign full of confidence, but he has delivered some unconvincing performances and his end product around the box must improve. Dorgu did not start once during United's excellent run of three wins on the bounce throughout October. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Has played just over 200 minutes across five appearances this season due to injuries. Mazraoui performed well against Spurs last weekend and it felt harsh to remove him before the hour mark. 6",

      "Heaven started against Grimsby in August when Blundell Park felt like hell. The youngster has made just two substitute appearances in the league, but he provided an assist in the 4-2 win against Brighton. 5",
      "Casemiro",
      "Has become hugely important this season. United have conceded five goals when Casemiro has been on the pitch and 15 when he has been off it. Also contributed goals against Chelsea, Brighton and Nottingham Forest, so he's been one of the standout performers. 8",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "Fernandes' performance against Tottenham encapsulated his season so far - he was poor but played the corner into the box for the equaliser. Has scored two goals and recorded three assists in total, but missed penalties against Fulham and Brentford. Could easily go up another level. 6",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Looked bright without scoring when starting the first three matches of the campaign. Scored brilliantly to open the scoring against Sunderland and was industrious against Liverpool. 7",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Was far too weak when allowing Wilson Odobert to breeze past him for Tottenham's first goal last Saturday. Ugarte was off the pace against Grimsby and has struggled when introduced from the bench. 3",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Mainoo has not really made a negative or positive contribution due to his lack of involvement. Was absent against Spurs due to a knock, and hopefully that injury is nothing serious. 5",
      "Amad",
      "His relationship with Bryan Mbeumo has blossomed as the season has developed. He assisted Mbeumo against Liverpool and Tottenham, and scored a stunning goal against Forest to salvage a point. Has delivered strong performances from right wing-back. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "Mbeumo is the current favourite to win the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award. The Cameroon international was unstoppable before the international break and he was named the Premier League Player of the Month for October. Six goals in 12 appearances for United. 8",
      "Matheus Cunha",
      "Has made a big impact since his arrival and scored his first goal for the club against Brighton, but Cunha would have liked to have more goals and assists to his name. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko",
      "Sesko started on the bench for the opening three Premier League games of the season. He made his debut against Manchester City in September and notched his first goal against Brentford. Built on that by scoring against Sunderland, but has failed to fire since that game in early October. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Can't mark Zirkzee higher or lower than a five - he hasn't started once. 5",

      "An update has emerged about Joshua Zirkzee's future at Manchester United amid continued speculation as the January transfer window approaches.",
      "United signed Zirkzee from Bologna in the summer of 2024 in a deal worth €42.5million (£37.5m). The Netherlands international moved to Old Trafford after being signed by former manager Erik ten Hag, but Zirkzee has found game time difficult to come by since Ruben Amorim's appointment 12 months ago.",
      "Zirkzee has made just five appearances for United so far this season, four of which have come in the Premier League, and he is yet to score his first goal of the campaign.",
      "Amorim has yet to name Zirkzee in the starting line-up in any match so far this term, with the striker being left as an unused substitute on seven occasions in the top flight.",
      "As a result, there has been frequent speculation linking Zirkzee with a move away from United during the January transfer window.",
      "However, The Sun have reported that this will not be the case as Zirkzee looks set to remain at Old Trafford. It has been claimed that the 24-year-old has \"no chance\" of leaving United in the New Year.",
      "The report claims that the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which will be expected to see Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad Diallo be unavailable for several weeks, is influencing United's decision-making for the January window.",
      "It's because of this that Zirkzee has reportedly been told that a transfer in January will not be possible, with the expectation now that the forward will get more game time across December and January.",
      "Various reports have been claiming for some time that Zirkzee would seek a chance to leave United in January in search of more regular first-team football, but if the latest article is accurate then that may not be possible.",

      "Manchester United's Shea Lacey has long been touted as a star of the future - and it might not just be at club level.",
      "The 18-year-old has caught England's eye in recent weeks and months and again played a starring role on the international stage this week.",
      "The United prospect came off the bench to score for England Under-20s in their 1-1 friendly draw with Japan on Friday night, having only made his debut at that level last month.",
      "That outing came after the teenager was called up to train with the Under-21s - who beat Ireland 1-0 on Friday - where he received glowing praise from boss Lee Carsley.",
      "\"He's been in the pathway a good amount of time now and he's a player that we rate highly,\" said Carsley.",
      "\"It worked out well that we needed that position for the training we were doing and Shea was more than happy to come over and train with the Under-21s. You can see he's a good talent.",
      "\"I know he's struggled with injuries in the past, which has probably held back his development, but I think it's so important we don't rush these young players, we let them develop in their own time. I think he trained two sessions with us and I enjoyed having him.\"",
      "In October, Lacey spent time training with the England senior squad under the watchful eye of boss Thomas Tuchel when he was drafted in from age-group sides to assist ahead of the friendly win over Wales.",
      "His international showings are reward for a strong start to the season with United at Under-21 level. He's got five goal contributions in eight games across the Premier League 2 and EFL Trophy, while he was one of a clutch of youngsters who were alongside the senior group when United returned to pre-season training in the summer.",
      "The playmaker had an injury-hit campaign last term and was carefully managed as a result. His minutes at academy level were therefore limited, but he did travel on the post-season tour to Asia and was handed a senior appearance off the bench in the defeat to ASEAN All-Stars.",
      "That offered a glimpse of what he can offer, with his ability on the ball evident. Lacey, who featured for United's Under-18s aged just 14, signed a professional deal at the first opportunity last year and Old Trafford insiders believe he has the potential to break into the first team.",
      "At this rate it might one day be for club and country.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "A pundit has explained why he thinks Manchester United need to sign replacements for two stars, but there are five “positives” under Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Red Devils have made progress under head coach Amorim this season as they are five games unbeaten in the Premier League. They are currently only one point adrift of the Champions League places.",
      "Man Utd declined to a new low under Amorim last season as his squad struggled to adapt to his favoured 3-4-3 formation, but they recruited well in the summer to build a well-equipped team.",
      "Benjamin Sesko has had his critics as he gets up to speed with life in the Premier League, but Sanne Lammens, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have made a great impact in recent weeks.",
      "However, Man Utd still have improvements to make if they are to win the Premier League and/or Champions League in the next couple of years, with their priority to sign a centre-midfielder.",
      "Former Liverpool star Don Hutchinson thinks Man Utd are on track, but he has encouraged them to replace Amad Diallo and Diogo Dalot.",
      "“I think the win at Anfield has helped them massively. Because you can’t underestimate when you’re losing games and you’re getting done by Grimsby, and you’re getting beat by Brentford, it’s not great,” Hutchinson said in an interview with sportscasting.com.",
      "READ: Antoine Semenyo to Man Utd makes no sense until Amorim addresses biggest problem position",
      "“It’s a bit doom and gloom and it’s like win two, lose one. The league table, because it’s early, helps.",
      "“Last weekend against Tottenham, if they won, they went second, which is psychologically huge. You’re in a decent little space because you’re playing quite well.",
      "“The job’s not done yet, but the league position would say, if we win we’re marching towards Champions League football, into second.",
      "“Then you go to Anfield and beat Liverpool. That puts him in a good frame of mind. I’m still not sold on his system in terms of personnel. I don’t think Dalot’s a left wing-back. I don’t think Amad’s a right wing-back.”",
      "However, Hutchinson thinks five players have been “positives” for Man Utd this season.",
      "“There’s a lot of questions that I ask from a tactical point of view,” Hutchinson added.",
      "“I’m a little bit baffled but what you’ve got to say is with the likes of Mason Mount’s form, Cunha, Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes, and Casemiro’s upturn.",
      "“I still think there’s a group of players now where if you go back towards last season, I couldn’t name you one Man United player apart from Bruno that’s improved under Amorim.",
      "“Now I’m starting to see three or four or five. So that’s a positive.”",
      "A Man Utd star has been blasted for not being good enough in attack or defence by a man who really, really hates “high fives”.",
      "Manchester United are one of the clubs reportedly tracking an Ivorian wing-back, with offers ‘expected’ in January, but Amad Diallo should not worry about his compatriot.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has been tipped to replace two players in January, while Matheus Cunha’s impact on the team has been “exaggerated”.",
      "Former Man Utd winger Lee Sharpe insists that the Red Devils should look to upgrade Diogo Dalot with the defender “sloppy in his decision-making”.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has been told that he has a “problem to sort” regarding one of his players, who has been made to “look bad”.",

      "Everton are ready to break their transfer record to sign former Man Utd midfielder Scott McTominay from Serie A giants Napoli, according to reports.",
      "The Red Devils allowed McTominay to leave Old Trafford for around £25m in August 2024 with Erik ten Hag looking to reshape his squad at Man Utd.",
      "Ten Hag was sacked a few months later and replaced by Ruben Amorim, with Man Utd ending up with egg on their faces as McTominay helped Antonio Conte’s side win the Scudetto in his first season at the club.",
      "McTominay contributed 12 goals and four assists in 34 appearances in Serie A last term as he took the league by storm – but he has not quite reached the same levels as last season this campaign.",
      "The Scotland international has two goals and one assist in ten appearances in the league as Napoli’s recent form has seen them drop down to fourth in Serie A.",
      "And now Spanish website Fichajes, which doesn’t have the best hit rate when it comes to transfer news, claims that Everton are ‘preparing’ a €70m (£62m) offer to break their transfer record and sign McTominay from Napoli.",
      "READ: Every club’s best and Wirtz player: Man Utd problem, his January replacement and £55m Newcastle man flops",
      "The report adds: ‘At Goodison Park, McTominay is seen as a strategic figure. Moyes values ​​his ability to burst into the box from deep, comparing him to the powerful Marouane Fellaini of old. This quality would give Everton a dangerous option in their attacking transitions, capable of creating havoc in the opposition’s defense.",
      "‘The club is considering a significant investment to bring him back to the Premier League. The estimated sum of 70 million demonstrates their ambition. Recent reports suggest that Everton understands the Scot could be a game-changer for their midfield, both in the short and long term, should Garner leave or lose his place in the starting lineup.’",
      "Naples journalist Vincenzo Credendino explained earlier this year why McTominay has flourished under Antonio Conte, he told the BBC: “Conte changed his system to put him in the best conditions to play.",
      "“In the system of Conte he’s not a builder, he’s a raider – the best option while you have a number nine like Romelu Lukaku, who today plays – and builds – a lot for the team.”",
      "READ: Jude Bellingham the ‘divisive soloist’ who is becoming a senseless obsession",
      "Credendino added: “You can compare McTominay with the big midfielders of Conte’s history. In his first years at Juventus (2011-12 and 2012-13), Claudio Marchisio and Arturo Vidal scored nine and 10 goals respectively.",
      "“It’s not a coincidence. McTominay is perfect for Conte as Conte is perfect for McTominay.”",
      "Speaking in December on why he chose to join Napoli, McTominay told BBC Scotland: “I saw the passionate fans, I saw the coach, I saw the players and I saw an opportunity.",
      "“I took it, I didn’t look back. It didn’t take me long to make the decision because I knew that was what I wanted and I’ll never have any regrets in my life. As soon as I put my mind to something I want to do it, that’s it. There’s no holding me back.",

      "The report adds: ‘For the Real Madrid president, Tchouaméni is completely untouchable , someone who fits perfectly into the new backbone designed to dominate Europe for the next decade. And no offer, however large, can change that view.’",
      "Real Madrid have made a decision ‘in the last few hours’ over Aurelien Tchouameni’s future after Arsenal launched a bid, according to reports.",

      "Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo may be a luxury signing, not a necessity, for Manchester United, but he can take them “to the next level”, says Bacary Sagna.",
      "Reports emerged on Monday that Semenyo has a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, sparking rumours of a departure in the January transfer window.",

      "“Looking forward, if he was to leave Bournemouth and stay in the Premier League, I think Manchester United would be a suitable option for him,” he told Oddspedia.",
      "“He could definitely help the club get back to the top end of the league and if he did join them, he’d be regarded as the player which made the difference and take United to the next level.",
      "“He’s young, fresh and has proven he can shine in big games this season – so I think Old Trafford could be a good destination for him.”",
      "Sagna added: “If I was Antoine Semenyo, I would stay at Bournemouth until the end of the season.",
      "“As a player, moving clubs in the January transfer window can be disruptive; it’s much better to stay until the summer and then make a decision, and integrate into the team properly – rather than joining midway through a campaign.”",
      "Semenyo is a fantastic player, but it’s probably worth seeing if Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha can continue to improve United before they spend big on another Premier League forward.",
      "Amorim’s frontline was completely revamped in the summer transfer window with the signings of Cunha, Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for over £200million.",
      "Not only are those three players shiny new investments, but the Red Devils have bigger priorities in the transfer market, namely a new central midfielder.",
      "Suppose United are convinced that recruiting from lesser Premier League clubs like Wolves, Brentford and Bournemouth is the way to go, they won’t look further than Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton in their pursuit of a new midfielder.",
      "Sure, Semenyo would improve the United squad, but Amorim also has Amad Diallo, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount. Obviously, £65m should be invested elsewhere.",
      "While we aren’t convinced by the financial practicality of United signing Semenyo, we are convinced that Semenyo to Liverpool is a transfer that makes perfect sense.",
      "The Premier League champions also spent big on their attack in the summer, signing Hugo Ekitike and Alexander Isak for over £200m, while attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz joined for £100m.",
      "However, there is an alarming lack of depth behind Mohamed Salah on the right, with right-back Jeremie Frimpong seemingly second in Arne Slot’s pecking order.",
      "Not only is there no serious competition for Salah, but Liverpool need a long-term replacement for the 33-year-old.",
      "No matter how you look at it, the odds are stacked in favour of Liverpool recruiting a serious downgrade on Salah, because he’s played at an all-time level for the Reds.",
      "The best option is arguably Michael Olise, Bayern Munich’s world-class winger, but even he would be a downgrade on the Salah we saw last season. Unfortunately for Liverpool, they can’t replace the best Premier League winger of all time with someone capable of making the same impact.",
      "So, Semenyo shouldn’t be viewed as an underwhelming replacement, and he probably isn’t, having scored six goals in 12 Premier League matches this term.",
      "Despite record-breaking summer expenditure from Liverpool, they still have money to spend, and they’d be wise to invest their funds into the signing of Semenyo, but only if they sign a centre-back first, in what would likely be a £100m total investment, unlike Man United’s £165m spend on the Bournemouth man and a midfielder like Anderson or Baleba.",

      "Is ‘personal goal difference’ a thing? Probably not. But it absolutely can be when in need of content ideas in that awkward period between an international break and the Premier League’s return. The gooch, if you were.",
      "We have looked at each club’s best and worst player in terms of the goal difference they have accrued during their time on the pitch this season, with 100 minutes the cut-off point for inclusion.",
      "",
      "Best: Gabriel Magalhaes and David Raya (+15)\nNeither player has missed a minute for a side which has scored 20 goals and conceded just five after 11 games. That absurd Chelsea record is still on the agenda.",
      "Worst: Cristhian Mosquera (+1)\nIt really was an exceptional signing but Mosquera has suffered for his craft as third-choice centre-half, even if none of the three goals Arsenal have conceded with him on the pitch could be at all attributed to him. Gabriel ended up on the floor for two of them (Nick Woltemade and Brian Brobbey).",
      "",
      "Best: Lucas Digne (+6)\nThe one Premier League game Digne didn’t start this season resulted in a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Villa Park. He remains really quite crucial to Unai Emery.",
      "Worst: Tyrone Mings (-5)\nThe former captain did not miss a minute of Villa’s five-game winless start, then was forced off through injury shortly before Ollie Watkins equalised against Fulham in their first win of the season.",
      "",
      "Best: Alex Scott (+4)\nIt was enough to catch the eye of Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Worst: Marcos Senesi (-4)\nThe Italian has played all but 12 minutes of Bournemouth’s Premier League campaign so far; the Cherries just so happened to mount their stirring comeback against Fulham in October immediately after Senesi came off.",
      "",
      "Best: Kevin Schade (+5)\nBrentford haven’t scored a single goal without Schade on the pitch this season. If Spurs want him they will have to pay.",
      "Worst: Keane Lewis-Potter (-4)\nKeith Andrews has spoken about his delight at having “options” at left-back, but Lewis-Potter – rather understandably as a natural forward playing out of position – seems to struggle bringing that balance to the team.",
      "",
      "Best: Georginio Rutter (+6)\nIt does seem to make Brighton tick when Rutter plays – even if the £40m record signing forward has scored precisely none of their 17 goals.",

      "",
      "Best: Zian Flemming (+2)\nThe one Burnley player with a positive individual goal difference; only Erling Haaland has scored more Premier League away goals than Flemming so far this season.",

      "Worst: Florian Wirtz (-4)\nIt is only by virtue of having played more minutes that Wirtz edges ahead of Conor Bradley and Giorgio Mamardashvili, which neatly underlines how Liverpool have struggled to replace key players in net and at right-back. But those numbers are particularly stark for nine-figure signing Wirtz, who still awaits his first Premier League goal or assist.",
      "",
      "Best: Jeremy Doku (+16)\nManchester City have not lost a Premier League game Doku has started since March. Liverpool felt the Belgian’s entire wrath and the only players in Europe’s top five leagues with a better personal goal difference all turn out for Bayern Munich.",

      "Best: Casemiro (+8)\nThe football undeniably left him but has emphatically returned. The only defeat Manchester United have suffered with Casemiro starting this season was on the opening weekend against Arsenal.",
      "Worst: Manuel Ugarte (-7)\nThat is a remarkable swing which emphasises the significant drop-off in quality between the club’s two foremost holding midfielders. Ugarte – and more specifically Ruben Amorim’s insistence on leaning on the Uruguayan as a perennial substitute – has become one of Manchester United’s biggest problems.",
      "",
      "Best: Jacob Murphy (+2)\nThere might be no better, more effective or important Newcastle player than the one Rafael Benitez signed from the Championship eight years ago. And that is damning, no less so because…",

      "Worst: Matz Sels, Nico Williams, Nikola Milenkovic and Elliot Anderson (-10)\nFour ever-presents largely paying for the crimes of Evangelos Marinakis and Ange Postecoglou. Of course one of them is a legitimate £100m talent.",
      "",
      "Best: Dan Ballard (+6)\nThat just feels right for 2025’s Radhi Jaidi.",
      "Worst: Jenson Seelt (-2)\nThat’s a fairly harsh reflection of a player who went off through injury at 0-0 of a 3-0 thrashing of West Ham, then played the majority of a 2-0 defeat to Burnley before leaving for Wolfsburg on loan.",

      "Best: Guglielmo Vicario (+9)\nSome doubts remain but Gary Neville reckons “the goalkeeper looks a lot better” and “more solid than he has been” recently.",

      "",
      "Best: Fer Lopez (-3)\nPerhaps Rob Edwards will find a use for £19.6m summer signing Lopez; Vitor Pereira rarely seemed enamoured with the idea.",
      "Worst: Joao Gomes (-15)\nIt is, along with Heidenheim pair Diant Ramaj and Patrick Mainka, the worst personal goal difference in Europe’s top five leagues so far this season. Perhaps Gomes isn’t the answer to Manchester United’s Ugarte problem.",

      "However, the Red Devils are not putting all their eggs in one basket, with Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton also on Man Utd’s wish-list, as reported by Fletcher on September 23.",
      "A report emerged on November 17 claiming that Man Utd have submitted a bid for Wharton, with manager Amorim claimed to love the 21-year-old England international.",
      "The account on X, which has almost 700,000 followers and is run by a ‘team of five elite reporters’, wrote at 6pm: ‘My contact at the club are telling me that bid has been submitted for Adam Wharton.",
      "‘Ruben Amorim loves the player and believes he can sell the project to Adam before Liverpool contact the player.’",
      "While this rumour has to be treated with caution, given that no other media outlets have reported it, TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, has revealed that the “information” that he has been given from sources is that Palace will not sell Wharton in the middle of the season.",
      "When asked if Palace could sell Wharton in January,  Jones told TEAMtalk: “There are no signs of it happening. I just don’t think deals like this are going to happen in January.",
      "“I would love to be able to reveal there was going to be a huge battle to sign him in a mega-money transfer, but all the information I have had on it just doesn’t lead to that.",
      "“I think Palace will keep him at this stage and we will then see what happens at the end of the season.”",
      "TEAMtalk DEBATE 🔴 Liverpool or Man Utd, which move is better for Adam Wharton? – ‘It’s a no-brainer’",
      "In other news, Man Utd have joined Manchester City and Arsenal in the race for one of their best young players in the Bundesliga.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has picked one particular Man Utd summer signing for praise, with the Red Devils’ legend hugely impressed by him.",
      "And finally, sources have told TEAMtalk whether Man Utd would be able to sign Joao Gomes from Wolves in the January transfer window."

      "One Premier League player is in our team of the season but is yet to be capped by his country, while Chelsea have a pair of expensive, uncapped youngsters.",
      "While these guys rip it up in World Cup qualifying, some Premier League players are yet to get going…",
      "He’s in our Premier League team of the season so far, but he’s behind Bart Verbruggen (and probably Mark Flekken) with the Netherlands, though his move to – and outstanding subsequent form in – the Premier League did at least earn him a first call-up in September. He’s been sat on the bench ever since.",
      "",
      "Yes, he of the long throw and the being really quite excellent for Brentford. He has been extensively capped by his country at Under-18, Under-19 and Under-21 level but remains uncapped for actual Italy, which might be a blessing considering the absolute sh*t-show going on there.",
      "",
      "It’s really quite astonishing that Botman remains uncapped while his lofty Newcastle United teammate Dan Burn is merrily collecting England caps. But Botman faces some very, very tough Premier League competition in Virgil van Dijk, Micky van de Ven, Nathan Ake, Jan Paul van Hecke and Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "",
      "Another centre-half that would absolutely have a little hatful of caps (should you keep a collection of hats in another hat?) if he were English, but Yoro is French and they are spoiled at centre-half even beyond Dayot Upamencano, William Saliba and Ibrahima Konate. He’s roughly 25 injuries away from a call-up.",
      "",
      "We’re old enough to remember when Ryan Sessegnon was definitely going to be England’s left-back for over a decade. He was not. But there is still a chance after he re-established himself as Fulham’s first-choice left-back. And England do have a left-back problem. And this uncapped XI had a left-back problem because Rico Henry went and played nine minutes for Jamaica.",
      "",
      "Very, very expensive for an uncapped player but City paid a January tax on Nico, who had represented Spain at every level bar the big one. He did not make himself indispensable in his first few months in England but he has proved to be a very valuable member of the City squad, starting and scoring in a dominant performance as they battered Liverpool 3-0.",
      "",
      "“He had an excellent Euros and won the title, Lee [Carsley] was full of praise and he did an excellent job in midfield with Elliot Anderson, who is now a regular starter for us. He was very impressive and then he took another step and has become a very regular starter for Bournemouth.",
      "“They are in the top third of the league, overperforming constantly, and he is a starter for them. He puts the intensity in and gets his minutes, so we thought this was the perfect time to reward him, get to know him and see what he can bring to our team.”",
      "The words of Thomas Tuchel when calling up Scott for the first time. It’s astonishing that Anderson was in this uncapped XI as recently as June.",
      "",
      "There was A Clamour in March but Tuchel resisted, with Nwaneri fast-tracked into the England Under-21 set-up instead, and he is now firmly established in Lee Carsley’s starting XI. Unfortunately, Arsenal minutes are a little harder to come by after serious summer investment and he has found himself in the Carabao Cup team with Myles Lewis-Skelly. He could yet play for England but it feels a long way away now.",
      "",
      "A move away from Liverpool was supposed to bring more minutes and a greater chance of an England call-up, but Elliott has struggled to understand Unai Emery’s quite specific tactics at Villa and remains very much on the fringes there. Thankfully, there is so little competition for England in the No. 10 role, that he should walk straight in when he’s ready…",
      "",
      "He’s yet to log a Premier League goal or assist but he has at least established himself as one of four or five wide options at Chelsea, with the Carabao Cup win over Wolves providing something of a breakthrough moment. And he is absolutely part of Carsley’s England Under-21 plans, which might mean that he is at least in Tuchel’s peripheral vision.",
      "",
      "With Tuchel teasing that he will likely take one out-and-out striker to understudy Harry Kane, it could be a straight race over the next six months. And at least Delap is now fit to take his place in the blocks. If Jean-Philippe Mateta can get capped (and score) for France, then Delap can do it for England. Even Eddie Nketiah has an England cap, FFS.",
      "Manchester United have a problem player, but his mooted ‘surprise’ January replacement has the joint-worst record in Europe’s top five leagues this season.",
      "Liverpool are bad enough for us to pretend Arne Slot might be about to get sacked and, thus, replaced.",
      "One man has become a little obsessed with Jude Bellingham and it ‘makes no sense at all’ to others in the England media camp.",
      "Daniel Farke is the manager under the harshest international-break spotlight which leads us to inevitably ponder who might be next in the Leeds hotseat.",
      "Why are the media so eager to vilify Jude Bellingham? Is it because England are too good to be truly interesting?",
      "Just the 1214 caps between this XI, featuring only one non-centurion and, of course, the age-old question around Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard."

      "World Cup qualification is very nearly over and with just a handful of games left to play before the play-offs in March, we bring you the top 10 Premier League players of a campaign which for some nations started way back in September 2023.",
      "Here’s who’s already qualified and here’s what’s next for Republic of Ireland and the other play-off hopefuls.",
      "And here’s a Premier League XI of players yet to be capped.",
      "",
      "10) Declan Rice (Arsenal and England)",
      "There’s a degree of crowbarring an England player in here, and with Premier League judas Harry Kane not available for selection, we’ve plumped for a man described by Lee Dixon on Sunday – with no hint of irony or any notable nod to Alan Partridge – as “the very best corner-kick taker on earth”.",
      "Only one of Rice’s four assists actually came from a corner, but two more from crosses, and while our guess is Mr Dixon’s assertion is largely based on televised Premier League and Champions League games, he is indeed a very fine courier of a football.",
      "",
      "9) Mohamed Salah (Liverpool and Egypt)",
      "A brace against Djibouti in October served as quite the moment of positivity amid the club-level sh*t for Salah, as the Egypt captain secured their place at the World Cup while also becoming the top goalscorer in African qualifying history with 20 to his name.",
      "His nine across the 2026 campaign was only bettered by Algeria’s Mohamed Amoura. Arne Slot may well take nine from him across the 38-game Premier League season on current form.",
      "",
      "8) Cody Gakpo (Liverpool and Netherlands)",
      "More Premier League goals and assists combined (5) than any Liverpool player this season and yet he’s still seen as a weak link by most, who would much rather have Luis Diaz back despite Gakpo going toe to toe with the Colombian for a starting spot last season. We suspect Gakpo would have Liverpool fans looking on just as wistfully had it been him who had made the move to Bayern Munich in the summer.",
      "And he’s got four goals and four assists for the Netherlands having started every World Cup qualifier under Ronald Koeman, taking his career tally to 19 goals and 10 assists in 46 games for his country. For context, Bukayo Saka has 14 goals and nine assists in 48 games for England.",
      "",
      "7) Mikkel Damsgaard (Brentford and Denmark)",
      "Those reading this north of the border will hope Damsgaard’s place on this list doesn’t act as some sort of harbinger of doom ahead of Tuesday night’s showdown at Hampden Park. Some advice to Steve Clarke, if we may: stop Damsgaard; stop Denmark.",
      "He has three goals and an assist in five games, chiefly from the left wing but with the license to cut inside and combine with Christian Eriksen in a more central area, behind Rasmus Hojlund. He’s infuriatingly neat and tidy, and his increased influence for Brentford in the last year has built up a level of confidence that he’s now arguably showing to an even greater degree for his country.",
      "",
      "6) Enzo Fernandez (Chelsea and Argentina)",
      "He played and thrived for Argentina, and continued to be heralded as an undroppable star player, through thin times at Chelsea, and Fernandez remains a key cog in Lionel Scaloni’s team now that things are rather thicker for him at Stamford Bridge.",
      "His and Argentina’s zenith came in a 4-1 win over Brazil in March, after which the local press marvelled at his “near to perfect” display. The 24-year-old “dominated” the game playing as the closest midfielder to Julian Alvarez, often with his back to goal, linking the play with the sort of time on the ball only afforded to the most technically gifted footballers.",
      "He’s one reason Argentina are top of our World Cup power rankings.",
      "",
      "5) Jeremy Doku (Manchester City and Belgium)",
      "Doku had been grouped in a herd of not-quite-good-enough Manchester City forwards, and may even have been bringing up the rear behind Savinho, Oscar Bobb and Omar Marmoush before a season in which he’s shown a significant improvement that we’re as guilty as anyone in believing he would never make. We assumed he was destined to be little more than a kick-and-run winger forever.",
      "He comes across as a very intelligent guy in interviews and something of a sponge for advice, previously hailing Thierry Henry for telling him how to improve his number of goals and assists rather than just insisting on the need for an increase. Both Manchester City and Belgium are reaping the rewards of Henry’s suggestion he cut out the “stutters” in his dribbling and avoid thinking he has to beat his man to deliver a cross.",
      "Only Lamine Yamal (7.5) completed more dribbles per game than Doku (5.6), but the key to Doku’s place on this list and his status now as something at least approaching a complete winger is his 3.1 key passes per game, which is the 14th most in European qualifying.",
      "",
      "4) Manuel Ugarte (Manchester United and Uruguay)",
      "Just as none of us can believe Ugarte has ever shown quality worthy of a £53m move to Paris Saint-Germain and then a £44m move to Manchester United given the almost comically lacklustre displays we’ve seen of him in the Premier League, we imagine Uruguayan nationals are similarly perplexed as to how the guy they’re seeing cleaning up at the base of their midfield isn’t having a similarly dominant effect for the Red Devils.",
      "No player has won more than Ugarte’s 33 tackles in South American qualifying, with Moises actual Caicedo behind him in second on 27 having played more minutes, and no player has made more than Ugarte’s 29 interceptions. Incredible.",
      "It is very gratifying indeed to know that no matter the degree to which the floppiness of an Old Trafford flop appears to be down to the player and not the club, it is in fact always Manchester United that is the problem.",
      "",
      "3) Martin Odegaard (Arsenal and Norway)",
      "There’s something of the Wales 2016s about this Norway side in that they’ve got an outstanding goalscorer and playmaker of a similar standing and influence to Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey.",
      "Like Wales, there is talent elsewhere in the side. They had Ashley Williams, Ben Davies and Joe Allen. Norway have Alexander Sorloth, Sander Berge and Kristoffer Ajer. They’re no mugs and would have been an outside bet to qualify anyway, but those questioning whether they can make any sort of mark at the tournament proper without Erling Haaland should have similar doubts over an Odegaard-less Norway.",
      "His seven assists in just five games was the most of anyone in Europe and no-one created more than his five chances per game.",
      "",
      "2) Mikel Merino (Arsenal and Spain)",
      "He’s started all of Spain’s five games and played every minute of the first four, scoring six goals, including a hat-trick in the 6-0 away win against second-placed Turkey.",
      "After two goals and an assist against Bulgaria in October, Spain boss Luis de la Fuente hailed Merino as “an exceptionally complete player with great adaptability”. That versatility is arguably costing him at Arsenal – for whom he’s started just four Premier League games – as he’s neither one thing nor the other, very good at everything but not the best at anything, but he’s made himself undroppable for Spain, and is now always shoehorned into the team, shining whether as a No.8 or No.10.",
      "",
      "1) Erling Haaland (Manchester City and Norway)",
      "He’s now scored an absurd 55 goals in 48 games for his country, stretching his lead as Norway’s all-time top goalscorer dramatically through qualifying, with Jorgen Juve second on 33.",
      "Haaland would be 20th on the list through this World Cup campaign alone, with his 16 goals in eight games just one less than Morten Gamst Pederson managed in 82 appearances.",
      "He scored twice as many goals as anyone else in European qualifying – Harry Kane, Marko Arnautovic and Memphis Depay all scored eight – and is the top scorer in qualifying across all continents, including those where teams play twice as many games.",
      "“We’ve not had someone who’s been an outright superstar in the way that Erling is,” said Norwegian journalist Lars Sivertsen. “I think there’s already a case to be made that he’s our greatest ever player.”",
      "Paris Saint-Germain are lining up a deal to sign Man City superstar Erling Haaland in the summer transfer window, according to reports.",
      "Erling Haaland has been a Premier League player for barely three seasons but has already outscored a legion of legends and is firing Norway to the World Cup.",
      "Relegation via a guilty FFP verdict would lead to a Manchester City exodus, so we have ranked their 26-man squad based on exit likelihood in this scenario…",
      "Here are the 10 current favourites for the Premier League Golden Boot with Erling Haaland disappearing over the horizon already.",
      "It is easy to see why Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is the way he is when you consider who and what dominated English football when he first joined.",
      "Pro-VAR Manchester City forward Erling Haaland being a robot is no longer a playful joke – it actually might be true…"

      "If you’re of a mind to discount Erling Haaland as an all-round footballer and still see him purely as a goalscorer despite plenty of evidence to the contrary this season, there’s a fair case to be made that Antoine Semenyo has been the Premier League’s best player this term.",
      "Semenyo’s six goals and three assists puts him second behind Haaland (14 goals; 1 assist) in the Premier League goal-contribution charts and the Ghanaian passes the eye test with flying colours with his wonderfully rangey running style and an astonishingly rare ability to be just as devastating off his left or right foot.",
      "Amid interest from Tottenham and Manchester United in the summer and Manchester United and Liverpool now, it’s a case of when and not if Semenyo moves on from Bournemouth, and The Athletic’s David Ornstein has revealed the 24-year-old looks set to leave the Vitality Stadium at the earliest possible opportunity.",
      "Only a week ago Fabrizio Romano claimed it was “very unlikely” that Semenyo would leave in January, but Ornstein now says the Cherries ‘reluctantly accept they may be powerless to prevent his exit’ in the winter window, with his release clause ‘formally set at £65m’.",
      "It would be a significant blow to Bournemouth, but they have arguably (and incredibly) improved having sold left-back Milos Kerkez, winger Dango Outtara and centre-back pair Dean Huijsen and Ilya Zabarnyi in the summer. And Ornstein added that the clause ‘must be activated by a specific date, which would give Bournemouth a couple of weeks to replace their best player’. Probably with another gem to be sold for huge profit in future.",
      "The revelation is sure to bring more suitors than Manchester United and Liverpool to Semenyo’s door as £65m is a very reasonable price for a player of that much ability whose ceiling we suspect is yet to come into view.",
      "It’s been claimed Liverpool would be Semenyo’s ‘top choice’ as he ‘wants to win the Champions League this season’, which is quite the flight of fancy. And if – as that report suggests – Semenyo is a man focused on the short-term, we would actually put Liverpool’s advantage over United in this fight down to their side being an altogether easier one to a) get into, and b) make a significant difference in.",
      "While we’re not convinced Arne Slot has the stones to drop Mohamed Salah, such is the inevitable impact his sulking would have on the dressing room dynamic, part of the problem with leaving him out is there being no obvious worthy replacement for him. Let’s face it, the Liverpool love-in for Federico Chiesa is far more about the song than the football.",
      "Semenyo walks into Liverpool’s starting lineup, in place of Salah on the right or on the left for Cody Gakpo, who’s been one of the Reds’ better players this season and is often picked out as a weak link when he’s in fact been the strongest, but doesn’t have the game-changing knack of Semenyo.",
      "Let’s be clear, the Semenyo we’re currently seeing gets in the United team too, just as he gets in every Premier League team, and would cement Benjamin Sesko to the bench if Ruben Amorim was to play him down the middle in a position he’s operated in before.",
      "But fast starts for Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo at Old Trafford means Semenyo’s inclusion in one of the inverted ten spots isn’t a formality, and is part of the reason why he wouldn’t have the transformative affect on United as he would on Liverpool, which really is quite something 11 games into the season after Arne Slot’s side doubled the Red Devils’ points tally in winning the title.",
      "According to reports, Liverpool have “pretty much wrapped up” one signing as they look to strengthen their squad in January and next summer.",
      "Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo may be a luxury signing, not a necessity, for Manchester United, but he can take them “to the next level”, says Bacary Sagna.",
      "Liverpool have been in ‘direct negotiations’ for two months with Bournemouth as they look to sign Antoine Semenyo, according to reports.",
      "Antoine Semenyo has reportedly told Bournemouth that Liverpool ‘is his top choice’ for a January transfer as he looks to win the Champions League.",
      "Liverpool have made an offer to sign Rodrygo ahead of the January transfer window as they continue to monitor Antoine Semenyo, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly ‘preparing to move fast’ to land a star Premier League winger in January before Liverpool and other big clubs can get there."

      "England completed a successful 2025 in enormously predictable fashion.",
      "Another couple of wins. Another couple of clean sheets. Another couple of Harry Kane goals that don’t count. Another Daily Mail hatchet job on Jude Bellingham. Just your bog-standard international break for England these days.",
      "We already knew before it they’d be off to the World Cup, but are we any clearer now as to which specific players will be doing so?",
      "Here’s the latest all-important F365 England Ladder, with October’s rankings in brackets – you can read the full thing here.",
      "As ever, the rules of the Ladder are that this is not our ranking, but our best guess at what we think Thomas Tuchel is thinking. And he can be a tricky fella to read, sometimes, but we do think we’re starting to get a clearer idea now of what makes him tick.",
      "Which only makes it funnier just how far off the mark huge swathes of this will be by March.",
      "",
      "The easy part of the Ladder is still easy. We’re not even pretending to shuffle him down to two or three just to feel alive. He is still England’s most important and least-challenged player.",
      "Even when Thomas Tuchel made a bunch of changes for the dead rubber against Albania, Harry Kane remained. Even when Thomas Tuchel made a bunch of second-half substitutions in the dead rubber against Albania, Harry Kane remained. And then scored the two late goals to complete the flawless qualification campaign. Because that is simply what Harry Kane does.",
      "He now has more international goals than Pele (without scoring a single one that counts), and his next England goal will lift him into the top 10 all-time for men’s international goals, level with Neymar and just behind Ferenc Puskas. Joining Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and the legendary Ali Daei in the 100 club is now very, very possible.",
      "With Ollie Watkins struggling for form and fitness and absolutely nobody else seemingly even in the frame, it’s even now possible that Kane winds up the only specialist No. 9 in Thomas Tuchel’s squad, with your Marcus Rashfords and Phil Fodens and the Cole Palmers of this world providing potential back up as nines of varying degrees of falseness. Tuchel himself described such a scenario as ‘possible’ but unlikely.",
      "And, of course, even describing Kane as a ‘specialist No. 9’ is to traduce one of the world’s very best players, who is also a more than handy No. 10, No. 4, No. 6 and No. 8.",
      "It’s a bit of a shame he went in goal that time for Spurs in the Lamela Rabona game and answered the question of whether he could play there too with such an emphatic ‘no’, because otherwise we’d strongly suspect he could.",
      "",
      "His usual serene, game-running self in the win over Serbia, but was one of several players left slightly discombobulated by Thomas Tuchel’s experimental approach to the first half in Albania.",
      "We’ve absolutely no problem with anything Tuchel tried in that first half – if not then, when? – and even the 3-2-2-3’s near total failure to launch taught the manager and us something useful. And equally we’re not really perturbed by the players struggling to get to grips with it.",
      "This was an experiment Tuchel justifiably felt able to implement because things were going so well; it will only be seen again if things are going so wrong.",
      "Rice was back to his usual self in the more familiar shape deployed in the second half, and remains as indelibly inked-in and integral as ever.",
      "Mandatory comment here about set-piece delivery and its potential outsized importance for the nitty-gritty of a major tournament.",
      "",
      "Kept another facile clean sheet in the first qualifier of the break, taking his personal clean sheet streak for England to 10 games since the 2-1 defeat to Greece at Wembley in October last year.",
      "Thomas Tuchel still hasn’t seen Pickford pick the ball out of his net in any England game he’s managed, which is a daftness no matter the level of opposition.",
      "Amusingly, the almost sarcastically under-employed Pickford was then rested for the final qualifier in Albania, and got to sit back and watch Dean Henderson have more to do in that one game than he’d had in the previous seven combined.",
      "",
      "It was a while before Tuchel was able to call on Stones, but since then he’s been a fixture in the side and that tells you something.",
      "There are still some who argue he’s in a three-way battle for two starting spots with Marc Guehi and Ezri Konsa, but we’re increasingly convinced that pair are fighting to start alongside Stones.",
      "Whatever the truth of it, those three are now head and shoulders clear of anyone else in the centre-back conversation.",
      "Tuchel had spoken before about Stones’ midfield potential, and it was interesting – if not particularly successful – to see him try it out in that final game against Albania.",
      "",
      "Lovely goal against Serbia to deliver on a direct request for more goal contributions, and then came off the bench to set up the opener for Kane in Albania in what was a slightly curious half-hour cameo that featured one odd decision to try and tee up a team-mate when another goal appeared certain had he gone for it himself.",
      "Either way, still absolutely no reason to doubt he’s a certain starter on the right of England’s attack if all things are equal next June, despite the estimable competition provided by Noni Madueke and Jarrod Bowen. Both are enormously capable, neither is in Saka’s class.",
      "",
      "The speed with which Elliot Anderson has become the undisputed first choice in what was one of England’s problem positions alongside Declan Rice is pretty extraordinary. It really is only something that’s come about across this season’s three international breaks.",
      "Quietly impeccable again against Serbia at Wembley, and even earned (most of) a night off in Albania as Adam Wharton got his chance to impress.",
      "As ever, the Ladder is our estimation of the England manager’s position on players and when he talks we listen.",
      "“Elliot and Declan are at the moment ahead in midfield. They are a very good pair, and they complement each other very well.”",
      "We cannot argue with that, and have no desire to do so.",
      "",
      "Tuchel couldn’t help but – in our view unnecessarily – stir the pot with a bit of an OTT reaction to Bellingham’s pretty standard frustration at being substituted late on in Tirana, but the fact he got that start, the fact he was so eye-catching even when not at his best and, most importantly, the fact he is simply a better footballer than Morgan Rogers means we do now have just about enough evidence that when it comes to it and the real business begins next summer, Jude Bellingham will be England’s No. 10.",
      "It really is no slight on Rogers to suggest that by next summer the idea that six months earlier it was even a meaningful debate at all will look a bit odd.",
      "Still, though, this is based on what we think Tuchel is thinking and we’re still not entirely sure he’s as convinced this is a closed conversation as we are, so Bellingham’s upward movement remains conservative for now.",
      "But Bellingham is a generational talent and Tuchel absolutely knows this. Sorry, Daily Mail, there really aren’t ‘serious questions over his World Cup inclusion’ no matter how much that boils your hateful acrid p*ss.",
      "",
      "The eighth player we believe to be inked in to England’s starting XI for June, and the only reason he isn’t three or four places higher up the list is that even with the Ladder’s usual rules about assuming everyone is injury-free, we simply cannot even comprehend a universe where Reece James is reliably injury-free.",
      "Which is really bloody annoying actually, because he’s entirely and reliably excellent in every other way.",
      "",
      "Must have feared the worst when ruled out of this break through injury, but two things are true.",
      "First, when given the opportunity to select Gordon, Tuchel has generally selected Gordon.",
      "And second, neither Marcus Rashford against Serbia nor Eberechi Eze against Albania did enough to really suggest they can rip the starting shirt away from the Newcastle man.",
      "Also, when you think about it, the fact both Eze (against Serbia) and Rashford (against Albania) were far more impressive when coming off the bench to make a late impact only strengthens Gordon’s case to be the starter out of that trio.",
      "As far as missed international breaks through injury go, that was an absolute belter for Gordon. The team didn’t suffer any unpleasant consequences whatsoever, but nor did anything happen to remotely diminish his own standing and prospects. You’ll take that in the middle of such a busy season.",
      "",
      "Like Gordon, he was missing from this camp, and like Gordon it probably hasn’t done him too much harm.",
      "We thought he was in a straight fight with Ezri Konsa to start alongside John Stones, and we still think that after watching Konsa look very good against Serbia and Dan Burn look…not so good against Albania.",
      "At the very, very least his place in that group of top three centre-back options hasn’t been challenged, with Burn having a rough time and Jarell Quansah finally getting a debut but getting it in a weird and confusing right-back/right-centre-back-of-three hybrid role that didn’t really give him the best foundations upon which to attempt a bit of claim-staking.",
      "We think Tuchel slightly favours Guehi over Konsa, and don’t think we’re doing that thing where we project our own instincts on to the manager. Either way, if the sort of selection debate we’re worried about when the World Cup comes around is ‘Guehi or Konsa’ we will sleep easy in our beds knowing we don’t much care either way because it’s going to be absolutely fine. Given some of the scenarios we’ve had before, this one feels like extremely small beer.",
      "",
      "One of the key things we’ve learned about Tuchel thus far is that when you’re in, you’re in until you’re not. He’s already made it a feature of his selection methods as an international manager – worth remembering this is all new to him as well – that players who do the job for him will not be replaced just because some bigger or shinier name comes back in the fold.",
      "One exception to this, we think, is at left-back. It’s the one position where it feels like Tuchel really is still experimenting because he needs to, rather than resting players because he can or adapting to the availability picture in front of him.",
      "As such, we’re not quite willing to say that Nico O’Reilly’s pair of wonderfully assured performances in that position in this break have cemented his place. But it does now feel like his shirt to lose, even if that is pretty harsh on Djed Spence – who was exemplary on both flanks in October.",
      "Does feel like there’s still a fight here, though, one that your Lewis Halls and Myles Lewis-Skellys may yet have their say in as well.",
      "",
      "Had one particularly eye-catching moment when marshalling Dusan Vlahovic expertly against Serbia and as we’ve already said, we think he’s in a pretty close scrap with Marc Guehi to partner John Stones, and we are extremely comfortable with whichever way that particular cookie crumbles.",
      "His ability to do a very tidy job at right-back might, in a weird way, hurt his starting chances; in a major tournament you might not want to risk having to separate your starting centre-back pairing because Reece James is injured again.",
      "But that versatility absolutely locks down a squad place. We’re still very much in ‘on the plane’ territory here.",
      "",
      "Slips outside the starting XI now, we think. Is unlucky really to have Bellingham as his direct competition, and may eventually suffer from offering less squad-building versatility than other players who could potentially play at 10 but also offer options out wide, like Eberechi Eze or Cole Palmer or even Phil Foden.",
      "But he’s played better for England in that 10 role than any of those lads, and we know Tuchel values that enormously highly. He can have no complaints about anything Rogers has done for him, and while it wouldn’t enter our heads to do so it still wouldn’t entirely surprise us to see Rogers’ name on that starting team-sheet in seven months.",
      "As ever when discussing Rogers v Bellingham, we’re aware we can come off quite disparaging to the Villa man. We don’t mean to be. He’s excellent, we would be entirely unconcerned if England need to use him in tournament conditions. He played in every single game of what was a uniquely successful qualifying campaign for England.",
      "He’s just not Jude Bellingham.",
      "",
      "Had a busier game against Albania than Pickford has had against anyone in an England shirt this year, but for Henderson that’s probably a blessing. He actually got the chance to show Tuchel what he can do after being one of the players to suffer in the Senegal game, and kept a clean sheet that was nothing like the formality of so many of Pickford’s.",
      "There were smart saves and some good decision-making from Henderson. Nothing that has any chance of unseating Pickford as No. 1, of course, but the Albania game has absolutely solidified Henderson’s claim on first-reserve status, with James Trafford simply not playing any football and Nick Pope unfortunately ruled out after a hard-earned recall.",
      "",
      "If you’d told us a couple of years back that Jordan Henderson would be a Thomas Tuchel regular for England with a significant and clearly-defined role at his big age we’d have been so alarmed we probably wouldn’t even have registered our surprise at Thomas Tuchel being England manager.",
      "Now, though? We’re fine with it. He brings experience and leadership to the squad and his role within the squad is clear; he’s maybe fourth or fifth choice to actually start in central midfield, but absolutely first-choice sub to come on in there when there’s a job that must be done.",
      "",
      "Still seems like a straight fight between him and Anthony Gordon to start on the left for England and while it would be no surprise to see Rashford continuing to deliver the more eye-catching contributions at club level, where all his problems really do seem to have been solved by the one neat trick of simply joining one of the biggest football clubs on earth, we know how high a value Tuchel places on the work people have done specifically for him.",
      "And, given the opportunity in this window by Gordon’s injury setback, we’re just not sure Rashford did quite enough to shift the needle on the starting XI. Especially when he actually strengthened the idea that his best contributions might come from the bench by having his best contributions come against Albania, from the bench.",
      "",
      "Brilliant cameo from the bench against Serbia, drab performance from the start against Albania. Not sure exactly where that leaves us or more specifically Eze really, but overall probably roughly back where we started, which is: brilliantly talented, game-changing bench option anywhere across the attack but probably not really in serious contention for any starting position.",
      "We’re okay with it. Worth noting also that Eze, with three goals, was the only person not called Harry Kane to score more than once for England during this qualifying campaign. Feels like that definitely ought to count for something.",
      "",
      "We know Tuchel is a big Madueke guy, to the extent that if we take him at his word he wouldn’t even have recalled Bukayo Saka in October had Madueke not been injured himself.",
      "It makes him among the harder players to place in this Ladder, but we do think the only real option at this time is to go with Tuchel’s confirmed high opinion of a player who should be back fit and firing by the time the next squad comes around in March.",
      "Before his injury, Madueke was statistically perhaps the most important non-Kane attacker for England during this qualifying campaign, leading the way in both chances created per 90 and dribbles per 90.",
      "Second on both those metrics? Look away, Daily Mail, but it was that awful prick Jude Bellingham.",
      "But back to Madueke, it feels certain to us that Tuchel will at least give him a chance to reassert his claims to be at least first reserve on that right-hand side come March, and we’d be pretty confident at that stage that he would take that chance.",
      "",
      "Even further away from rivalling Kane for a starting spot than ever before – it really is mad to think now how the sight of Watkins replacing a lumpen and grimly ineffective Kane at the Euros was a source of such joy – but now finds his squad place under threat.",
      "Not from any other striker – don’t worry, Ollie, there aren’t any of those – but from the slim possibility that Tuchel might not bother with one at all.",
      "Given the paucity of the back-up options, sadly now up to and including Watkins himself, the magnificence of Kane and the multi-faceted nature of England’s great many other attacking talents, it becomes a tempting option.",
      "If you don’t have another No. 9 you’d really trust, but you do have, say, Phil Foden and Marcus Rashford and Cole Palmer, do you really need another No. 9 in there for the sake of it?",
      "We do still kind of think that in a 26-man squad the answer is probably ‘Yes, don’t be silly, we do still need another proper striker’.",
      "Tuchel sees it similarly, having said he will likely pick another ‘classic number nine’. That keeps Watkins above the 26-man cutline for now, but even the fact Tuchel is talking about the possibility of not having one, and pointedly refusing to dismiss the idea altogether (“I cannot rule out that we go with one striker, but it’s more likely we have more than one classic number nine”) while also not specifically mentioning Watkins by name mean it’s looking dicier than it probably should for someone with literally no meaningful competition at this time.",
      "",
      "Back in the fold and given a couple of different roles in the Serbia and Albania games as Tuchel tries to succeed where others have failed and unlock Foden’s obvious talents in an England setting.",
      "We do like the false nine option deployed against Serbia; anything that reduces the need for unnecessary spare Kane back-ups in the squad in favour of more versatile players is to be encouraged.",
      "The collective will for Foden to show what he can do for England perhaps led to be a bit of an over-reaction to his assist for Eberechi Eze’s goal – described in at least one place as ‘putting it on a plate’ for the Arsenal playmaker. But we’re not having it as the easy-peasy straightforward pass some naysayers have insisted it was on the other side of the debate.",
      "One of the advantages of having skilled finishers in creative positions is they know exactly what pass they would want to receive if roles were reversed, and Foden’s pass to Eze was exactly that. Perfect weight, perfect line, so that Eze didn’t have to break stride and a difficult finish was made as easy as it could be.",
      "Against Albania, we even got a brief glimpse of the Foden-Bellingham-Kane triangle Tuchel had previously dismissed as impossible. So there’s definitely hope.",
      "It still feels like at least one ludicrously talented attacking player is going to miss out when Tuchel’s final 26 is named, but it’s less likely now than it was a fortnight ago for Foden’s to be that name.",
      "",
      "Appears to be fourth-choice centre-back. As sanguine as we are about the first three centre-backs, this fills us with some kind of dread.",
      "We would really very much like something more compelling and bit less cumbersome to make itself known by March, please and thank you.",
      "He’s a good lad is Burn, and it’s been a great story. But we really don’t think he’s good enough, and he’s now the one player we’ve got inside the 26-man cutline about whom we have those kind of deep-lying fears.",
      "",
      "Time is running out and others are making strong claims for all sorts of roles within England’s attack. As we’ve said time and again elsewhere, there are simply more excellent attacking players available to Tuchel than squad positions for them all and someone deserving of a place – probably multiple someones – is going to miss out.",
      "And there is a real risk that Palmer, who has played only 64 minutes for England under Tuchel in their least convincing performance (the 1-0 win over Andorra), is such a someone.",
      "Probably not. Still probably not. On balance, his ability and versatility still probably tip the scales far enough his way. Especially if he can recover sufficient goalscoring touch to convince Tuchel he can offer a meaningful option as the focus of England’s attack rather as well as one of its support riders.",
      "Does feel quite mad to be talking about someone we tried and failed to squeeze into the F365 England starting XI perhaps missing out on the squad altogether, but that’s the level of competition.",
      "There will, inevitably, be stuff in here that looks absolutely mental come March. Because that’s four months away, and there’s stuff that looks mental from one Ladder to the next when there’s only one month between them.",
      "But we really hope ‘Palmer might not even make the squad’ is one of the things that looks really crazy by March.",
      "",
      "A touch overpromoted in October on the back of our desire for neatness and trying to make the first 11 names on the ladder represent an actual starting XI, but despite being a non-playing member of the squad in this break he doesn’t fall too far.",
      "Tuchel’s obvious dislike of Spence’s infamous Thomas Frank snub after the Chelsea game felt a bit OTT and quite schoolmasterly to us – and also quite funny given Tuchel’s own history with handshakes at the end of games between Chelsea and Tottenham – but can’t be ignored either given the Ladder’s remit.",
      "But we still think Tuchel values Spence’s pure defensive ability as a full-back with tough major tournament tests in mind. He might not be first choice or even necessarily first reserve on either flank, but we’d still be surprised to see him left out altogether because he does offer that one-on-one ability to nullify the best, and that’s a powerful weapon to have in the arsenal for a player who is also perfectly capable of starting any game at full-back on either flank.",
      "",
      "Could return to Newcastle this weekend after missing their last nine games through injury, and no specialist has staked much of a claim to be the second right-back in the squad.",
      "Djed Spence, Ezri Konsa and Jarell Quansah have all been used there in addition to obvious first choice Reece James, and that can’t do Livramento any harm.",
      "And while Spence in particular offers a solid defensive option on that right-hand side, we’re still not sure you’d really want to be picking a 26-man squad in which Reece ‘Darren Anderton’ James is your only specialist right-back.",
      "Livramento, despite his own recent injury struggles, hasn’t really been usurped at all in the fight to be that second specialist right-back.",
      "",
      "We’ve desperately wanted to put him higher and higher in the Ladder but couldn’t because it’s the England manager’s Ladder, not ours. And for some inexplicable reason, we are not the England manager.",
      "We really do think Wharton, with his vision and line-breaking passing ability is the kind of high-risk, high-reward player you want in a tournament squad. There’s a make-something-happen quality to him that doesn’t really show itself in stats or data. He’s an old-school player who absolutely has to be watched to be appreciated.",
      "A bit unfortunate to get his chance in an experimental formation, one that confused more experienced international minds than his, but still did well even when often finding himself as a pretty isolated single-pivot in England’s midfield.",
      "Tuchel acknowledged as much after the Albania game, while also stressing that isolation was not Wharton’s fault. We’ve heard enough: Tuchel likes him, up the list he goes to join Rice, Anderson and Henderson among Tuchel’s World Cup midfield options.",
      "",
      "Lucky to get a reprieve and find himself in this squad with Nick Pope suffering cruel injury timing, and for now that means, with the clock ticking and only one more England camp before final squad choices are made, we’re leaning towards Tuchel sticking with what he knows for such a low-key position as third-choice keeper.",
      "But if by March Pope is playing well for Newcastle and Trafford is still riding the bench at Man City, he can have few complaints if he loses even that bench-warming position for his country.",
      "",
      "Was England’s best and most consistent attacking threat in that disjointed first half against Albania and we do really like the energy that Bowen brings to the table. Does feel like he offers a tangible point of difference as a right-wing option in comparison to Saka and Madueke.",
      "But Bowen surely sits behind that pair in Tuchel’s thinking when everyone’s fit, and that leaves the West Ham man in some significant danger of finding himself without a seat when the music stops next year. He’d be desperately unfortunate to miss out on the squad, but we’re finding it increasingly hard to work out how Tuchel can possibly pick a coherent, balanced squad without some enormously talented attacking players being desperately unfortunate.",
      "Unless there’s a wild injury crisis, and we really don’t want to wish that into existence no matter how much easier it would make this – ultimately trivial – Ladder to compile.",
      "",
      "Got a long-awaited and deserved debut, but got it at right-back. Or kind of right-centre-back in sort of a three-man defence but not really. In the hardest game of an admittedly easy group.",
      "It was not fertile ground for making a great impression, but Tuchel certainly seemed to like what he saw. Personally, we thought the ‘like he had 50 caps already’ quote was a bit odd and that Quansah had done, at best, a serviceable job in an unusual position that wouldn’t really be anyone’s speciality and certainly not his.",
      "What that ringing endorsement must do, though, is shove him up this Ladder a fair few places. That fourth centre-back spot is still there to be claimed, and incumbent Dan Burn is far from secure.",
      "",
      "Deserved his recall and was desperately unlucky to miss out on it through concussion. Still has every chance of unseating Manchester City bench-warmer James Trafford as the third-choice keeper, but time is now tight.",
      "",
      "Not as good as Jude Bellingham, and more importantly not as good for England as Morgan Rogers. And Thomas Tuchel seems wildly unlikely to find room in his squad for a third No. 10 when he has so many other elite and versatile attacking choices.",
      "",
      "Is now on the outside looking in and simply doesn’t appear likely to get the opportunity to play enough football to prove to anyone why that shouldn’t be the case.",
      "There will, very obviously, be a great many more tournament chances for MLS, but it does currently seem like this one is slipping away.",
      "",
      "We have never, ever really known what to do with him in the England Ladder, and we still don’t know what to do with him. Given we are literally no closer to squaring that circle than we were this time last month, we are going to quite literally repeat ourselves.",
      "Has spent pretty much his entire England career being just about the hardest player to place in the Ladder and the one most likely to make us look very clever and then very stupid on a month-by-month rota basis.",
      "We still don’t have much idea what to do with him and precious little Tuchel-era data to go by. The positive spin on it might be that while Reece James does appear to be Tuchel’s first choice the manager didn’t take the chance to look at any other actual right-backs this month, which would indicate a door that remains there to be opened.",
      "Does, though, still feel like the question at the moment with TAA and the World Cup is not so much ‘Is he in the squad?’ but ‘How far away from the squad is he?’",
      "There is of course the other question: is he even a right-back? But that only makes things even less clear, and is thus a question we will ignore at this time.",
      "",
      "At this stage it really is starting to feel like wish fulfilment having him in the list at all. But we must allow ourselves the odd indulgence.",
      "READ: The discarded England XI without a hope of a World Cup squad place",

      "Fifth-choice central midfielder? If he’s lucky. Will Tuchel pick five central midfielders? If he’s lucky.",
      "",
      "Got himself into the squad, which was good, but didn’t get himself onto the pitch, which is not. The call-up was deserved recognition for some eye-catching displays for Bournemouth, but the harsh truth is that when naming international rookies in a tournament squad it’s easier if they’ve at least got some halfway relevant experience from big European nights and the like.",
      "It’s an example of big-club bias, but also a pretty understandable one. If you’ve got two inexperienced options going into a major tournament and one of them has experience under a big-club microscope, that player presents a lower risk.",

      "",
      "There’s a squad place absolutely there to be grabbed. Solanke seems to have spent almost the entire season one or two weeks away from a return, but if he can show any kind of form for Spurs between now and March he’s going to give himself a chance.",

      "Is it really as mad an idea as it sounds? He is still, incongruously, only 30 years old. But for a tournament schedule, yeah, it probably is a bit mad.",
      "Has been almost ever-present for Manchester United this season, but that is in its own way damning; how much of his ability to play almost every game for United has been down to United having, through their own incompetence, a laughably light fixture list?",

      "Fabrizio Romano has named Manchester United’s ‘dream’ midfield signing and both he and sources at TEAMtalk have confirmed the player wants to join the Red Devils.",
      "It’s no secret Man Utd are on the hunt for impactful additions in central midfield next year. However, what’s less clear is which of the countless players they’re linked with they actually want to sign, and of those, who is number one on the shortlist.",
      "From just the Premier League, Adam Wharton, Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson are understood to be in Man Utd’s crosshairs. From further afield, the likes of Conor Gallagher and Angelo Stiller have been mentioned.",
      "United may yet make multiple additions in midfield, but obviously will not sign five new players in the same position. And per the latest from transfer guru, Fabrizio Romano, we now know who United will give priority to signing before all others.",
      "“There is a lot of confusion in the media [about] who is the dream target for Manchester United in midfield,” began Romano when speaking on his YouTube channel.",
      "“My information remains that there are several names, but I keep telling you since August, don’t forget Man Utd want Carlos Baleba.",
      "“Baleba wants to go to Man Utd. Man Utd want Baleba. The conversations with the player and his agents were very good but at that time in August, Brighton didn’t want to sell the player.”",
      "United made an official approach to Brighton for Baleba in the summer window, but were informed a deal could not be made at that time, irrespective of how much United bid.",
      "The Red Devils’ interest in the 21-year-old has maintained and Romano then stressed a winter window move will be “difficult,” with a summer swoop in 2026 the likelier scenario.",
      "“In January it’s likely to be a difficult deal,” the reporter continued. “Brighton insist on not selling the player [in January].",
      "“But for the summer, unless the stance changes in January, let’s see what happens… but the summer of 2026, for sure, Man Utd see Baleba as a priority target.”",
      "Romano concluded by stating Man Utd will “insist” on signing Baleba next year and and the player is “very keen” on making the move.",
      "At the time of United’s approach for Baleba in August, it was widely reported the Cameroon international was receptive to the interest but was not actively seeking to leave Brighton.",
      "However, Romano categorically stated Baleba now “wants to go to Man Utd” and that echoes what our own insider, Dean Jones, reported on Sunday.",
      "Jones revealed Baleba “clearly wants the move” and United’s summer approach – which may have been launched with one eye on turning the player’s head ahead of a move in 2026 – appears to have succeeded.",
      "The player is now unsettled on the south coast and would jump at the chance to move to Old Trafford. However, Brighton – who previously valued Baleba in excess of £100m – won’t go down quietly.",
      "Baleba is contracted to the Seagulls until 2028 and there’s an option for an extra season. As such, Man Utd’s biggest issue now is negotiating a more palatable fee with Brighton, but one that is still convincing enough to get their green light.",
      "Jones exclusively told TEAMtalk on Sunday: “It is being talked about again that Baleba is a priority target, but it has to be stressed that they [United] are not paying £100million for him any time soon.",
      "“The player clearly wants the move, and their attempt to turn his head in the summer has worked, but his form has actually been worse since then, and so I do not see United going close to the level Brighton value him at.",
      "“The message remains clear that United want a midfielder in January and also a midfielder in summer.",
      "“So they are working on targets that are attainable in each of those, and the ones from the Premier League seem unattainable in January. That’s how the picture is for now.",
      "“Obviously, these things can change, but Baleba is going to have to be very patient here because a lot is going on.",
      "“United do still like him; they do still think he would suit the role, but his form and valuation do not match up at the moment. And on top of that, Brighton don’t want to sell him in January.”",
      "In other news, insider Ben Jacobs has revealed it’s “absolutely true” that Manchester United want to sign a Newcastle star who director of football Jason Wilcox knows “incredibly well.”",
      "Elsewhere, Eric Cantona has told Sir Jim Ratcliffe he has “destroyed” the style of football created by Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, and the legend has revealed his offer to help the club was rebuffed.",
      "Finally, Manchester United scouts will be patting themselves on their backs for identifying a young midfield gem who has won a major award, but the Red Devils will not find it easy to negotiate a deal with Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis."

      "“So, Baleba is a name we have to keep very high on Man Utd’s shortlist for the midfield.”",
      "Spanish website Defensa Central has claimed that current Man Utd midfielder Casemiro has been offered a new contract at Old Trafford with the Red Devils looking to more than cut his salary in half.",

His current contract expires in 2027, he earns £350,000 a week, and the Old Trafford club wants him to stay but on a much lower salary: £130,000 a week . This figure is ridiculous, and Casemiro will likely reject it. If that happens, [Aurelien] Tchouameni is the Red Devils’ first choice.’",

      "The Manchester United goalkeeper has enjoyed a hugely beneficial loan spell so far at Bristol City - a move that came around because City's previous No 1 Max O'Leary suffered an ankle injury at the end of last season which forced the club to move for a short-term replacement.",
      "Vitek was brought in on a season-long loan but has surpassed any expectations from when he first arrived at the club and is now keeping O'Leary out of the team having recovered from his injury, due to a run of dominant performances by the young Czech keeper.",
      "\"It's true it came a little bit out of nowhere,\" Vitek said. \"I knew I was going to go on loan this season because I had an agreement with the coach it was the best thing to do and get more experience at a higher level than last year.",
      "\"It was a no-brainer because to play in the Championship for a club such as Bristol City for me was really attractive.",
      "\"I said yes straight away after I spoke with Gerhard Struber.\"",
      "Vitek had previously been on loan at Accrington Stanley in League Two before spending a season in Austria but Vitek's impressive form for City has helped lead them to eighth in the table.",
      "\"I'm still quite young but I would describe myself as a goalkeeper who likes to be both dominant and also confident for the team in front of me so they can rely on me,\" Vitek explained.",
      "\"Everything since day one has come together. The people around the club, the city… everyone has been really nice to me since day one and the fans have been amazing.",
      "\"First game away from home, Sheffield Wednesday... to celebrate the win like that was an amazing memory. I don't think I'll ever forget this one.\"",
      "Having grown up in Czechia, Vitek admitted he was a shy kid growing up - perhaps more introverted than you would expect from a now 6ft 6in goalkeeper.",
      "Vitek admitted he did not start out his footballing journey in goal and he used to play every position when he was younger, but as with other kids who hit a growth spurt earlier than others, he was thrown into goal because he was always the tallest in his age group.",
      "Having joined Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc's academy, Vitek was soon invited to trial for different clubs in England after catching the eye in his home country.",
      "But for Vitek, at just 16-years-old there was only one club he was interested in signing for.",
      "\"I knew straight away that Manchester United wanted me,\" Vitek said. \"They told me straight after seven weeks' trial, they told me they want me to sign.",
      "\"It was the time when Covid hit though - I spent six months at home but I didn't have any doubts because I felt really confident with the conversations I had with the coaches in Manchester.",
      "\"Obviously my club knew as well about the interest and they already spoke with Manchester United about the contracts and everything like that so it was basically done - some of my team-mates couldn't believe it because it's not an everyday thing someone goes from a Czech academy to a club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Almost six years on from signing for the club, this feels like a huge milestone in Vitek's footballing journey and development.",
      "Playing regularly, showing what he can do at the size of a club like Bristol City is clearly doing him wonders.",
      "It was undoubtedly pleasing for those at Manchester United as well, as he is highly-rated at Carrington. Despite Senne Lammens impressing at United since his summer arrival, the No 1 shirt still feels there to be fought for at this moment in time.",
      "So could we see Radek Vitek in that shirt one day?",
      "\"I'm taking it step-by-step, we'll see next summer what's best for me,\" Vitek said. \"I speak on a regular basis with my goalkeeper coach from Manchester United who has come here to watch my games and I have a good connection with them.",
      "\"I know they're watching me and I really appreciate that I'm not just the guy who is being forgotten or anything.",
      "\"Obviously long term, I would love to play for Manchester United one day but also I'm realistic and I know that my pathway can lead somewhere different as well.\"",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Thursday 13 November 2025 16:35, UK",
      "A number of Premier League stars have entered the final year of their contracts, meaning they can negotiate a free transfer with clubs outside of England from January.",
      "Mikel Arteta's side have prioritised extending the deals of players at risk of leaving in the near future and the contract situation for the team is in a strong position as a result.",
      "Nothing to report for next summer and with no potential exits on a free, Arsenal can now concentrate on more important matters on the pitch.",
      "Ross Barkley",
      "A seemingly shrewd addition to Unai Emery's squad when signed for just over £5m from Luton Town in 2024. Injuries have plagued his second stint at Villa, after previously joining on loan from Chelsea in the 2020/21 campaign, but Barkley has played a role off the bench when available so far this season.",
      "Whether that warrants a fresh deal at Villa Park remains to be seen.",
      "Marcos Senesi",
      "In the absence of Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, following their moves to Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, Senesi has become a fundamental cog in a Bournemouth side battling for a spot in the top five of the Premier League this season.",
      "Talks are reportedly under way regarding a new deal but like the future of his boss Andoni Iraola, there has been no news as of yet.",
      "Adam Smith",
      "The 34-year-old signed a one-year extension with the club in 2024 but is now approaching the end of his deal with the Cherries. Smith joined permanently in 2014 and was labelled a Bournemouth \"legend\" in the statement confirming his previous deal.",
      "Injuries have hindered his involvement for the first team this season but 11 years into his career at the Vitality Stadium, Smith still has a role to play.",
      "Vitaly Janelt",
      "Talks over a new deal are yet to reach an agreement and the Bees want a new defensive midfielder they can build their long-term future around.",
      "Rico Henry",
      "Brentford hold the option to extend Henry's stay in west London by an additional year so are in no danger of losing the left-back.",
      "Knee injuries and other fitness issues have blighted his time at the Bees but Henry has played a role in cup competitions for Keith Andrews' side, providing crucial depth and experience at left-back.",
      "Mathias Jensen",
      "Another future at Brentford that the club are in control of. Jensen is one of three players with an option of an additional year in his current contract.",
      "The 29-year-old, who will be turning 30 when the transfer window opens, has been used prominently in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Josh Dasilva",
      "Dasilva signed a deal in October to remain at the club until the end of the season after seeing his previous contract expire in the summer.",
      "The 27-year-old is yet to return from a serious knee injury suffered in February but head coach Andrews has stressed his importance to the team. Brentford hold an option to keep him for a further 12 months if his return from injury goes to plan.",
      "Myles Peart-Harris",
      "The attacking midfielder is yet to make an appearance for Brentford this season after previously impressing on loan with Swansea in the Championship last season.",
      "He was last included in the match-day squad for the Bees first team on August 26 against Bournemouth.",
      "Adam Webster",
      "A severe knee injury in pre-season has ruled Webster out for the majority of the current campaign, after thigh and hamstring problems limited him to just 11 starts in the Premier League in 2024/25.",
      "Webster has been a key figure for the Seagulls since joining from Bristol City in 2019 but injury problems could now play their part in his future at the Amex Stadium.",
      "Lewis Dunk",
      "The Brighton captain remains a key figure at the club despite approaching his 34th birthday. Dunk has been crucial in the Premier League so far and would likely jump at the chance to continue at the Amex, adding to his club legend status after rising through the academy ranks to forge a career at the highest level.",
      "Solly March",
      "With game time limited for the 31-year-old in wide areas, it is unclear whether the club will trigger the option to extend his stay by another year.",
      "Danny Welbeck",
      "The forward is ageing like a fine wine in the Premier League and his form for the club warrants a new deal.",
      "The 34-year-old, who is approaching his 35th birthday, has been at the Amex since 2020 and signed his last extension in 2024. After hitting new heights in the latter stages of his career while working with Fabian Hurzeler, a new deal seems like an obvious choice for both parties.",
      "Joel Veltman",
      "Veltman triggered an option to extend his stay at the club for an additional year last season but is now approaching the end of his contract.",
      "He missed five games with a calf injury but returned in the derby against Crystal Palace, outlining his role to play in Hurzeler's squad.",
      "James Milner",
      "The Premier League veteran will turn 40 when the window to negotiate with foreign clubs opens in January.",
      "Hurzeler said his experience was \"invaluable\" when he signed a one-year extension in June. The likelihood of a similar deal remains unclear.",
      "Martin Dubravka",
      "Dubravka signed a one-year deal with the Clarets upon their return to the Premier League and ranks amongst the best in shot-stopping in the division.",
      "His future at Turf Moor will likely be determined when - and if - Burnley manage to avoid the drop.",
      "Josh Laurent",
      "Laurent has been a useful member of the squad since joining from Stoke City in 2024. He signed a two-year deal when he first arrived at the club, with the option for a third.",
      "Vaclav Hladky",
      "The Czech Republic shot-stopper has only been included in two match-day squads this season - both in the Carabao Cup - and is yet to make an appearance in the 2025/26 campaign after featuring in pre-season.",
      "With 21-year-old Max Weiss currently ahead of him as Dubravka's understudy, an exit feels inevitable.",
      "Ashley Barnes",
      "Barnes signed a deal running until the end of the season after terminating his contract at Norwich City in January, returning to Turf Moor almost 11 years after he first joined the club.",
      "He then put pen to paper on a new one-year deal in the summer but has failed to make an impact in the Premier League.",
      "Chelsea are known for offering long-term deals to their players and have no one approaching the end of their respective deals ahead of next summer.",
      "Marc Guehi",
      "Arguably one of the most talked-about contract sagas ahead of next summer. Palace stopped Guehi from joining Liverpool on Deadline Day and with no fresh contract in sight, his exit from Selhurst Park feels like a matter of when, not if.",
      "Rumours linking him with a move to Anfield continue to swirl but clubs in Europe, who will be free to open negotiations for pre-contract agreements in the New Year, are also on alert.",
      "Daichi Kamada",
      "Informal conversations have taken place regarding a contract extension but nothing has been confirmed as of yet.",
      "Naouirou Ahamada",
      "The 23-year-old has spent the vast majority of his time with the U21s side. Ahamada spent last season on loan at Rennes, making five appearances.",
      "Nathaniel Clyne",
      "In his second spell with the Eagles, Clyne signed a one-year contract extension with the club in the summer. However, his role has been reduced this season, making two appearances without a start.",
      "Clyne will be 35 when his current contract expires and an exit in search of more frequent game time in the latter stages of his career could be on the horizon.",
      "Jefferson Lerma",
      "Lerma is a useful and reliable option for Oliver Glasner to turn to, especially as he looks to balance fixture congestion in domestic cup competitions and Europe.",
      "The Eagles hold an option to extend his stay at Selhurst Park for an additional year.",
      "Vitaliy Mykolenko",
      "Mykolenko has confirmed his agent will soon enter talks with Everton regarding a new contract at the Toffees. The 26-year-old remains a key part of the squad with summer signing Adam Aznou yet to break into the first team.",
      "James Garner",
      "Garner is a regular for Everton under David Moyes. Jordan Pickford and James Tarkowski have both been rewarded with new deals in recent months and Garner will likely follow suit to reflect his new status within the team.",
      "Michael Keane",
      "Another mainstay in Moyes' squad. Keane reportedly had offers to leave the Toffees in the summer but chose to remain on Merseyside by signing a new deal and is now benefiting from that decision.",
      "Keane, 32, reportedly has an option to extend his stay for an additional 12 months.",
      "Idrissa Gueye",
      "Gueye signed a new deal in July, running until the end of the season, but the club hold an option for an additional year.",
      "The Senegal international, in his second stint with the Toffees after leaving in 2019 to join PSG for £26m, has been a regular for Moyes in the league so far this season.",
      "Triggering the extension seems like a suitable option for all parties.",
      "Seamus Coleman",
      "The 36-year-old club legend signed a new deal just before the new campaign began to commit to a 17th season with the Blues.",
      "He has been used sparingly but would likely jump at the chance to end his career at Everton with another deal, if he wishes to continue past the 2025/26 season.",
      "Harry Tyrer",
      "Tyrer impressed while on loan at Blackpool last season, making 38 appearances in League One and keeping 12 clean sheets.",
      "Despite showing promise, the 23-year-old is behind Mark Travers in the pecking order for Jordan Pickford's understudy and will likely need to pursue first-team opportunities elsewhere if he wants game time.",
      "Ryan Sessegnon",
      "The Fulham academy graduate rejoined the club on a free transfer after leaving Tottenham in 2024 and has already started more games in the Premier League than last season.",
      "His importance is growing at Craven Cottage and the club hold an option to extend his stay by an additional 12 months. If he can stay fit and continue his current trajectory, expect a new deal with fresh terms to reflect his importance to arrive in the near future.",
      "Harry Wilson",
      "Fulham pulled the plug on Wilson's move to Elland Road, reiterating he was not for sale, and head coach Marco Silva has since confirmed that he is set for talks regarding an extension.",
      "Adama Traore",
      "Fulham triggered an option to extend Traore's contract until 2026 last season but the winger has found minutes hard to come by in the current campaign.",
      "Raul Jimenez",
      "Jimenez was another player whose contract was extended until the end of the 2025/26 season and he continues to play a key role for Silva, competing with Rodrigo Muniz for the starting role up front for the Cottagers.",
      "Tom Cairney",
      "Club captain Cairney left it late to sign an extension at Fulham but has been used sparingly so far this season. With his 35th birthday approaching, an emotional exit from Craven Cottage could be on the cards.",
      "Illan Meslier",
      "The 25-year-old has fallen out of favour at Elland Road after previously being a mainstay in the team.",
      "Meslier started 39 games on the way to Leeds' promotion to the Premier League last season but is yet to feature for the Lilywhites this season.",
      "An exit, whether that is in the January transfer window or for free next summer, seems inevitable.",
      "Sam Byram",
      "Signed on a free transfer from West Ham in 2023, Byram was a useful option for Daniel Farke to turn to on their push for promotion, making 36 appearances in the Championship, but has been unable to have the same impact since the Whites returned to the top-flight.",
      "Karl Darlow",
      "Darlow has been a shrewd signing for just over £350,000 from Newcastle in 2023 and has solidified himself as the second-choice shot-stopper for the club.",
      "Alex Cairns",
      "Academy graduate Cairns has never made a first-team appearance for Leeds since re-joining the club from Salford City in 2024.",
      "Ibrahima Konate",
      "An exit for Konate in January is unlikely but after the Spanish giants made their interest in Trent Alexander-Arnold known at the beginning of 2025, before going on to sign him before the Club World Cup, it is worth noting that Konate would be free to speak to them in the New Year.",
      "Andy Robertson",
      "The veteran defender has insisted he is relaxed about his future at Anfield with his contract coming to an end this season.",
      "Atletico Madrid were interested in signing the Scotland international in the summer ahead of Milos Kerkez's arrival but given the struggles of their new left-back, conversations may be revisited with the 31-year-old, after he confirmed discussions had taken place during the summer to extend his stay.",
      "Freddie Woodman",
      "Woodman joined on a free transfer in the summer following the expiration of his contract at Preston North End.",
      "In the absence of Alisson due to injury, Woodman has operated as Giorgi Mamardashvili's back-up and started in the 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace in the Carabao Cup in October. The club hold an option to extend his contract for a further year.",
      "Rhys Williams",
      "Even with numbers at centre back low at Liverpool following Giovanni Leoni's ACL injury at the beginning of the campaign, Liverpool have not handed Williams an appearance in any of the three competitions they have competed in so far.",
      "Bernardo Silva",
      "Silva spoke openly about his future during the summer, outlining he is focused on the season but is aware he can leave the Etihad Stadium next summer.",
      "He continues to play a crucial role for Pep Guardiola's side and had options to leave but remained at the club.",
      "John Stones",
      "The future of John Stones is yet to be decided, with the England centre-back also approaching the end of his current deal.",
      "Stefan Ortega",
      "Ortega is now third-choice at the club following the arrivals of Gianluigi Donnarumma and James Trafford. The German shot-stopper was linked as a potential target for Burnley in the summer.",

      "Signed in the summer before Trafford and Donnarumma arrived at the Etihad, Bettinelli is yet to make his debut for the club.",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "One of the more notable names approaching free agency. Maguire has enjoyed an upturn in his career at Old Trafford over the last two seasons.",
      "Maguire is not a regular starter under Ruben Amorim but adds crucial depth and experience. A one-year extension in his deal was triggered in January.",
      "Casemiro",
      "The club hold an option to extend Casemiro's stay by an additional year but there is a real possibility his contract is not renewed to free up space on the wage bill to strengthen the midfield area next season.",
      "Tom Heaton",
      "Third-choice goalkeeper behind Senne Lammens and Altay Bayindir at the club. Heaton has not featured for United since the 2022/23 season and will be 40 when his contract expires.",
      "Fabian Schar",
      "Schar extended his contract at the club in April and has admitted he would be open to discussing a new deal with the Magpies, while speaking to The Chronicle in October.",

      "Emil Krafth",
      "Krafth signed an extension in February to keep him at the club until the end of the 2025/26 season. The Sweden international right-back has been rotated into the squad for domestic cup competitions and his agent has downplayed suggestions he could leave in January.",

      "Axel Tuanzebe has lodged a lawsuit against Manchester United seeking damages 'in excess of £1m'; Burnley defender spent 17 years at United before leaving in 2023; lawsuit obtained by Sky News details accusations of a back injury not being treated 'promptly' and 'appropriately'",
      "By Rob Harris, Sky News",
      "Wednesday 12 November 2025 10:44, UK",
      "Manchester United have been accused of harming the career of a former player by failing to treat an injury \"promptly\" and \"appropriately\", leaving him with more serious long-term problems, according to a £1m lawsuit obtained by Sky News.",
      "While defender Axel Tuanzebe is still in the Premier League at Burnley, he blames United for no longer being able to play \"without restriction or impediment\", impacting his career and earnings.",
      "The landmark case has been brought by the footballer claiming clinical negligence - shining an unprecedented spotlight on the inner workings of a leading club's medical care and alleged handling of an injury.",
      "The lawsuit lodged at the High Court in London shows the 27-year-old Congolese player \"expects to recover damages in excess of £1,000,000\".",
      "An academy graduate at United, he left the club in 2023 after 17 years before going on to join Ipswich Town for two seasons and then signing for Burnley in June. United declined to comment.",
      "The case centres on stress fractures at the back of the spine, which the British Association of Spine Surgeons says footballers are vulnerable to.",
      "It's alleged Tuanzebe sustained a left-sided pars fracture in January 2020, which became chronic by July 2022 when he also developed a right-sided pars fracture.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "The details of the injury have never previously been reported.",
      "The case centres on how MRI scans in early 2020 were interpreted following a hamstring injury suffered in a League Cup match in December 2019 against Colchester.",
      "A suspected pars fracture was detected - referencing spinal stress fractures in the lower back, which athletes can suffer from repeated movements.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"It is the claimant's case that the defendant [United] negligently failed to properly investigate the claimant's pars fractures, failed to rest the claimant and failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon.",
      "\"As a result, the claimant's symptoms significantly progressed to bilateral grade 4 fractures, and he developed a left-sided chronic spinal fracture.",
      "\"Had the claimant been appropriately rested, his left-sided pars fracture would not have developed into a chronic condition and the right-sided fracture would have been avoided altogether.\"",
      "The fractures, which developed by July 2022, caused Tuanzebe \"significant pain and discomfort since their development and deterioration.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that in January 2020, United \"failed to refer him to a specialist sports spinal surgeon\" who would have apparently advised at least 12 weeks of rest to allow the fracture to heal.",
      "But Tuanzebe was back playing by March 2020 for United in the Premier League 2 development competition and returned to first-team action in October in the Champions League against French side Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "Then United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hailed \"a tremendous defender, a great leader\", adding: \"He's going to be a top player for us and he's got the character and the attitude that a Man Utd player should have.\"",
      "In December 2020, Tuanzebe told United he was suffering hamstring pain after sprinting. Despite concerns at the start of the year, the lower spine \"was not imaged on this occasion\", the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to train and play as normal from February to March 2020 and thereafter, he suffered more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "It claims an \"appropriate treatment plan\" was only put in place three years later - in April 2023.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"Appropriate treatment plans would, on the balance of probabilities, have resulted in the claimant avoiding the pain and discomfort set out below and would have resulted in him being able to play professional football at elite level without restriction or impediment.",
      "\"As it is, although he continues to play at an elite level, this has impacted his career and earnings.\"",
      "It was while on loan at Napoli in January 2022 that left-sided lower back pain led to the Italian club sending Tuanzebe for scans.",
      "United were informed by Tuanzebe of difficulties getting out of bed and into his car.",
      "But Dr Steve McNally, United senior club doctor and head of sports medicine and science, who left the club after 16 years in December 2022 to take a role with the PGMOL, is alleged to have \"indicated no urgency\" for him to return home for an examination.",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have told Tuanzebe it was \"most likely\" he had \"disc irritation or change in posture mechanics rather than a stress problem\" and that it \"usually resolves with physio\" rather than being serious.",
      "The lawsuit highlights the period from January 2020 to January 2022, claiming United \"failed to properly assess, record or attempt to treat the claimant's fracture in the acute phase\" when further regular medical examinations were required and appropriate rest from training and playing was needed.",
      "Examinations continued into the following month, February 2022.",
      "The lawsuit says while a stress fracture was excluded by Dr McNally following a CT scan, there could be an \"inflamed facet joint between the vertebrae\".",
      "But Napoli's club doctor said an analysis of a CT scan showed a potential stress fracture, described as \"chronic incomplete lysis of the isthmus of L5 with intact superior cortical profile\".",
      "Dr McNally is alleged to have responded by saying that it was already visible on a CT scan from 2017, so \"don't think that would cause your current pain\".",
      "Based on a referral by United, Tuanzebe was recommended pain relief injections in March 2022.",
      "Despite reporting pain in June 2022, Tuanzebe went on United's pre-season tour to Thailand the following month, but then asked to return to England for treatment.",
      "After further MRI and CT scans, a stress fracture of the spine was reported in medical reports in August 2022.",
      "He was able to return to full training by January 2023 and joined Stoke on loan until the end of the season, but ongoing discomfort limited him to five appearances.",
      "United then released Tuanzebe rather than triggering a one-year contract extension.",
      "The lawsuit says: \"By allowing the claimant to return to training and playing, including an intense strength and conditioning and running programme following August 17 2022, this has caused him to suffer more serious symptoms than he would have if he had been diagnosed promptly and treated appropriately with rest.\"",
      "The \"particulars of claim\", which sets out the basis for the case, was filed after being signed by Tuanzebe on October 27."

      "\"You're not gonna do miracles. Even the players. Manchester United have good players, but then some of them don't have the mind what is Manchester United?\"",
      "Asked about Ronaldo's comments, Amorim suggested that, despite Ronaldo knowing full well the impact that his words can have and mistakes in the past, improvements are being made at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He knows he has a huge impact in everything he says,\" Amorim said at his press conference.",

      "A win for Amorim's side, who have shown an upturn in form on a current run of four without defeat, will see them move into second place in the Premier League.

      "\"We believe more that we can win any game, and we already proved that we can win any game. The last game [at Nottingham Forest] was tough on us, because in some moments, we were not the team that we were supposed to be in every minute.",
      "\"And compare that to Brighton, and we suffer two goals against Brighton, but was a different thing. So we know that we cannot forget that we have a lot to improve.",
      "\"We are more prepared for anything that happens in the game, so that is also a good thing. So we are in a better moment, but we also know that we have a lot to do, a lot to improve, to be able to win more of this kind of game, and consistently win games in a row.",
      "\"So we know that we are capable, we are confident, but we also know that we struggle sometimes in games that we need to do better.\"",
      "Defeat in May and a 15th-place finish meant that United missed out on a place in this season's Champions League, while Spurs, who finished 17th, qualified for the competition.",

      "\"Every time Soucek played against me, he was a nightmare,\" said his manager Nuno Espirito Santo, who has to take big credit for utlising Soucek in this role. From his last 44 minutes on the pitch as a striker, the battering ram Czech has scored twice and played a huge role in another goal. You just can't keep him down.Lewis Jones",
      "Everton’s midfield set the tone from the first whistle, with Idrissa Gana Gueye driving the team forward and capping a dominant first half with the opener. His energy and control allowed the Toffees to dictate the tempo and keep Fulham penned in for long spells.",
      "Michael Keane’s late header sealed the points and reflected Everton’s growing confidence under David Moyes. The defender looked assured at the back and dangerous from set-pieces, delivering one of his most complete performances of the season.",
      "For Everton, this felt like a statement of control and composure, a reminder of their growing maturity under Moyes.",
      "Fulham, though, will be left frustrated. They improved after the break, with Josh King and Rodrigo Muniz both forcing saves from Jordan Pickford, but their lack of quality in the final third once again proved their downfall as the pressure grows near the bottom.Sam Cohen",

      "Ruben Amorim was downbeat after Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a 2-2 draw for Man Utd at Spurs and extended their unbeaten run in the league to five games, their longest under him, after throwing away another lead and seeing Benjamin Sesko forced off with a knee injury",
      "Saturday 8 November 2025 22:53, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said his team \"have a lot of problems\" as he delivered a reality check after the 2-2 draw at Tottenham.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt's 96th-minute equaliser salvaged a point for United to extend their unbeaten league run to five games, their longest under the Portuguese, but Amorim was frustrated to see his side repeat the mistakes of last Saturday's draw at Nottingham Forest.",
      "United led for nearly an hour through Bryan Mbeumo's first-half header, but late goals from Spurs substitute Mathys Tel and Richarlison, seven minutes apart, turned the game before De Ligt rescued a draw with his side a player down after Benjamin Sesko's injury.",
      "Amorim said United, who would have gone second had they held on to win, struggled to cope when he took Casemiro and Harry Maguire off with less than 20 minutes to go as he struck a downbeat tone ahead of the international break.",
      "\"We have a lot of problems,\" said Amorim. \"We are just in the beginning. I know that sometimes the results show to people that we are improving, but we have a lot to do.",
      "\"You can divide the game in the final 10 minutes, also when we have to take out Harry Maguire and Casemiro at the same time, then suffer two goals, then losing [Sesko], even before the second goal with a big opportunity.",
      "\"To play with 10 men, but then to overcome everything and to manage to score, is a good thing, but if you look at the rest of the game, we were comfortable.",
      "\"I think we should do better, be more aggressive, feeling the environment in the stadium.",
      "\"The three points were there, the space was there, and I think we felt too comfortable during the game, and we need to expect that in one play anything can happen and change the mood of the stadium, and today was that.",
      "\"We controlled the game well, but we need to do better, because the game was there for the taking.\"",
      "Sesko, who was dropped from the starting line-up at Spurs, was forced off with a knee injury coming off the bench and could miss Slovenia's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "The striker had a chance to put United in front shortly after Tel's late equaliser for 1-1 but let the opportunity pass him by, taking too long to shoot before Micky van de Ven recovered, picking up the injury in the process.",
      "That was Sesko's last act as he headed straight down the tunnel with the medical team, who will assess the severity of his problem, which was enough to stop him playing on despite United having used all five of their subs.",
      "Asked about Sesko being low on confidence, Amorim said: \"No, I think that is not the biggest concern now. That happened in the same way that he was not scoring and then he scored two goals in the next two games.",
      "\"That happens, especially with a striker. I'm more concerned with his injury because it's in the knee and I don't know [how bad it is]. We need Ben to be a better team.\"",
      "Asked if it is a serious injury, he added: \"I have no idea, but because it's the knee, we never know.\"",
      "United are already set to lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui to AFCON, which begins on December 21 and ends on January 18, and a serious injury to Sesko would leave Amorim in a precarious position.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee, who Amorim does not view as a No 9, was the only senior striking option on the bench at Spurs and was an unused substitute, with Mason Mount preferred as an impact player.",
      "Asked if they will be active in the January window, Amorim said: \"We have to check everything, we have to check what's happened with Ben.",
      "\"Of course we are going to have a problem [with AFCON], but we already knew [that]. Managing that situation is going to be hard, but let's see when the window is open if we can improve the team and try to repair something. Until then, we have to take the chance.\"",
      "Asked if he wants to make January signings, Amorim added: \"We'll see.\"",
      "But the numbers show that those plans might have to be brought forward to the January window if, of course, PSR will allow.",
      "Casemiro, 33 and in the final year of his deal at Old Trafford, cannot be relied on to hold everything together for the whole season and clearly the other options are not up to the job.",
      "Of the 20 goals United have conceded this season, only five have come when Casemiro is on the pitch, which means the other 15 have come in his absence.",
      "That will surely be a huge concern for Amorim, who has only used the Brazilian for the full 90 once this season. He needs to find Casemiro's heir and fast.",

      "Manchester United are on a run of four matches without defeat and for director of football Jason Wilcox, it's a reflection of the positive work slowly being achieved at Old Trafford; Wilcox outlines how the club's hierarchy work with head coach Ruben Amorim to navigate transfers",
      "Thursday 6 November 2025 08:48, UK",
      "Manchester United director of football Jason Wilcox has shed further light on how the club intend to navigate future transfer windows and why there are signs of progress at Old Trafford.",
      "United's recent upturn in form has seen Ruben Amorim begin an impressive run of four matches without defeat - a spell that included a three-match winning run in the Premier League, which was the first time the club had achieved the feat under him.",
      "The Portuguese coach saw his side earn a draw late on at Nottingham Forest to mark his first year at United. After a turbulent 12 months for Amorim and signs seemingly pointing towards the turning of a corner at Old Trafford, what have we learnt from Wilcox's assessment of United and their vision for the future?",
      "United's form has picked up. Last season, a record-low finish of 15th place in the Premier League did very little to inspire confidence at Old Trafford going into the new season.",
      "However, following a summer of change in the playing squad, at the moment, there are green shoots that suggest things are moving in the right direction.",
      "United are currently eighth in the Premier League, in touch of the top five positions that could secure United a return to Europe. Amorim's side can go second in the Premier League if they beat Tottenham in their Saturday lunchtime meeting.",
      "\"The most important thing is internally, we know what we need to do,\" Wilcox told Manchester United's official channels.",
      "\"We know where we are as a group. The players understand that and we are making progress on and off the pitch.",
      "\"I spoke last week to MUTV, and when I say we're making progress with our processes, the facilities, the structures and the staff - what we've got to do is, despite all the noise, we just have to remain calm, understand that we're moving in a positive direction.",
      "\"We are going to have bumps in the road, and it's important that we just smooth out the bumps and don't get overexcited and too disappointed.",
      "\"I really feel now this football club is moving in the right direction. That's my own personal view. That's not a biased view because I'm working here.",
      "\"When I think about the sporting department, we are making progress in every single area.\"",
      "In an interview aired on Tuesday, Cristiano Ronaldo gave a scathing review of United's current identity and lack of structure. Amorim, too, has received a fair share of scrutiny for his perceived rigid 3-4-3 system. However, Wilcox disagrees and believes the current work being done is helping to establish United's identity and game model.",
      "\"We've just got to continue to build the spirit,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"Continue to build on Ruben's idea. He's got a very clear idea. It's a lot more flexible than people give him credit for.",
      "\"We've got to start with the end in mind and understand the game model, how Manchester United are, is really important.",
      "\"And we have to pull the jigsaw together. We would love to have all the pieces in place where we can see a very clear picture.",
      "\"But while we're building the picture, it's really important. It's even more difficult when you lose some football matches, because people start questioning things. But we're really clear, myself, Ruben, Omar [Berrada] and the ownership. We're really clear on the direction of travel. And this is really important.\"",
      "Transfers have been a mystery at Old Trafford for many years. While United have always been active in windows, the opaque nature of United's transfer strategy has opened the door for criticism for supposed slow dealings and reported missed targets.",
      "However, Wilcox lifted the lid on how United's hierarchy work with head coach Amorim to navigate transfers.",
      "\"The brief will come from me and Ruben,\" Wilcox said.",
      "\"It goes into Chris [Vivell], a lot of debate and discussion around the profiles of what we need, and then the scouts will go into the market.",
      "\"We'll combine that with the data team, and they'll just be in a constant dialogue. Right now, I'm having weekly meetings with the recruitment team on the different profiles.",
      "\"The different age brackets, the costs, are they attainable with Ruben as well. So it's a real joined-up approach.",
      "\"When we sign a player, there are so many people that are involved in the process, the data team are involved in the process.",
      "\"We will then focus all our attention on certain players. And it's really important then that we do the background checks around.",
      "\"Are they clean-living professionals? This is really important. This year we looked at Premier League-ready players.",
      "\"Certainly with Bryan [Mbeumo] and Matheus [Cunha], we couldn't take too much risk in this area.",
      "\"We needed players that we could plug in and play with little transition time. Senne [Lammens], we were always looking at goalkeepers who have got huge potential, and Senne was available. We decided to move but it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction.",
      "\"Tony Cotton [Man Utd goalkeeper scout] was putting Senne on my radar 12 months ago and he was relentless with it.",
      "\"'This guy is going to be a top signing for us. And he's started well, but he's got to keep it going. He's very reflective and he's very professional in his approach.\"",
      "Summer signings Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens have played their role in United's upturn in form, with fans impressed with not only their performances but their attitude.",
      "United's recent transfer success is a trend that Wilcox suggests will continue at Old Trafford as the club aim to re-establish themselves at the top of the Premier League, as well as being capable of competing in Europe.",
      "\"We have got a clear plan,\" Wilcox told the United website.",
      "\"We know what we have got to do, we know the areas of the team that we have got to improve.",
      "\"For us to get in the top four and consistently challenge for Champions League places, win Champions League, win Premier League, we have got to invest in the squad.",
      "\"We have got to buy the right players. The right players who are talented but also who can deal with the pressure, who can take the squad forward. It is not always about just signing elite talent; they have got to have the right character and be somebody who can bring something different to the team.\"",
