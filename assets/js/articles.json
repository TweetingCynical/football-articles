      "Manchester United defender Harry Maguire has revealed his disbelief at the club's failure to build on their progress under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer before the Norwegian's departure in November 2021. Solskjaer has recently been touted for a shock return to Old Trafford as caretaker boss following United's split with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The former United forward initially took the reins in December 2018, stepping in for Jose Mourinho on an interim basis. His impressive start earned him the permanent role just three months down the line.",
      "Under Solskjaer's stewardship, United secured consecutive top-three finishes in 2020 and 2021. He also took the Red Devils to the 2021 Europa League final, where they were beaten on penalties by Villarreal.",
      "Speaking on Rio Ferdinand's YouTube channel back in August, Maguire reflected on his spell under the Norwegian boss, expressing his surprise at how things unravelled during Solskjaer's third season. The centre-back also confessed to feeling \"the best I've ever felt\" whilst playing under the former striker.",
      "Maguire said: \"We just couldn't believe what happened because we obviously finished third and second and then that season we brought in Jadon Sancho, Rafael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer and you're thinking here we go now like let's go and win the Premier League.",
      "\"And it just never happened. It just never clicked. and obviously we lost Ole (Solskjaer) which was disappointing if I'm being honest. I felt like Ole did an unbelievable job.\"",
      "He continued: \"I'll probably speak more about Ole when I'm when I'm retired but the way that he set us up in them first two years is probably the best I've felt in a team. Under Ole and Kieran (McKenna) and Carrick. Those three they had us so well organised.",
      "\"And like I said we didn't have the I wouldn't say the the best team, just a well coached , tactically brilliant, pragmatic, we could play, we could press, but yeah, the third season I was there, it just didn't work.\"",
      "Maguire's comments will serve as a glowing testimonial for Solskjaer's potential return. Sources suggest the club's senior players would also be receptive to welcoming back their former manager, with The Guardian reporting that Bruno Fernandes is amenable to his comeback.",
      "Solskjaer brought Fernandes to Old Trafford in January 2020, with the Portuguese midfielder now considered the standout acquisition of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson period.",
      "\"For me, he's doing a really good job and it's been a big improvement on the team since he arrived. We're still dropping points at home and it's not good enough and we know that but it's not only the coach's fault.\"",
      "Former United star Michael Carrick, who left Middlesbrough during the summer, is also understood to have been sounded out about the role. Under-18s boss Darren Fletcher will step up to manage Wednesday's fixture at Burnley and possibly Sunday's FA Cup clash against Brighton.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Oliver Glasner's Premier League credentials are impressive in their own right, but Manchester United could also benefit from a potential boost in the transfer market if they appoint him. This is particularly relevant given that Marc Guehi's departure from Crystal Palace seems only a matter of time.",
      "Ruben Amorim's sacking as United boss on Monday has reignited discussions about who will be the next permanent manager at Old Trafford. Glasner remained elusive when recently asked about being the frontrunner for the United job, although this might not come to fruition until his contract ends in the summer.",
      "Guehi finds himself in a similar situation with his contract at Selhurst Park nearing its end. The defender was widely tipped to join Liverpool on the final day of the summer transfer window, but talks fell through at the last minute.",
      "However, a move could materialise this month following a hint from FA Cup-winning Glasner himself. Until recently, Palace had been adamant that Guehi, who is now also reportedly on Manchester City's radar, would not be allowed to leave mid-season; however, their stance appears to have softened.",
      "Discussing the possibility of Guehi leaving in January, Glasner has now said: \"There's the situation that the contract ends in the summer and if somebody is coming, there will be a moment when the club says, 'Now the financial issue is more important than the sport issue.'",
      "\"We have to do it and try to get the best. That's why I'm always saying, 'I don't know.' Because this is different. \"There will be a threshold where the club has to say [sell].",
      "\"If the player says, 'I want to leave' and the money is above the threshold, it will happen. I'm not so naive not to know that if a massive offer comes from City and Marc wants to do it, it will happen.\"",
      "However, City might not be the sole Manchester powerhouse to enter the fray this month, with United having their own requirements in defence. Not to mention the added satisfaction those at Old Trafford would derive from thwarting their rivals' attempts to strengthen.",
      "Guehi represents the ultimate catch, though. He offers an authoritative England international defensive presence at what could be a significant bargain.",
      "Furthermore, the Eagles captain would bring some of the essential leadership attributes that have been missing at Old Trafford for quite some time. And despite their best efforts to create leader figures, captain Bruno Fernandes perhaps remains the only genuine, reliable example.",
      "Should this truly mark the end of his Palace journey, Guehi will depart south London as an icon. The skipper who brought the club's lengthy wait for silverware to a close while cementing his status as one of the nation's finest centre-halves and maintaining his principles when a giant like Liverpool came knocking.",
      "All these qualities hint at the type of player United have been desperately seeking. If Glasner does decide to make the switch to Manchester, either in the summer or sooner, having Guehi on speed dial could prove extremely beneficial if he can be persuaded to maintain his links with Glasner.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford is still expected to leave Manchester United permanently despite the sacking of Ruben Amorim. Rashford, 28, was frozen out under Amorim and joined Barcelona on a season-long loan in July.",
      "United announced on Monday that they had relieved Amorim of his duties, prompting speculation that Rashford could return to his boyhood club under a new manager next term. The England international is enjoying himself at Barcelona, scoring seven goals and providing eight assists in 25 games, mostly from the left wing.",
      "Rashford has also gone on record to say that his 'ultimate goal' is to remain at Barca beyond the end of this season. The La Liga champions have the option to sign him permanently for £28million.",
      "According the Sun, Rashford's time at Old Trafford is up regardless of what officials at the Camp Nou decide. It's reported that the decision for him to leave was led by United's hierarchy rather than Amorim.",
      "The same goes for the rest of United's loanees, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana, with the Red Devils expected to move them on permanently, too. Barcelona haven't made a decision on Rashford at the halfway point of his spell, but there's no doubt that boss Hansi Flick is a big fan - even when the forward isn't playing.",
      "\"When he [Rashford] is on the bench, it also shows we have a good team,\" Flick explained. \"In this position we have excellent players. What I can say, he's an absolute professional player.",
      "\"His attitude, mentality is great. In the beginning, he had to adapt a little bit, but now he's on his best level. I speak with the players when they're not playing, explaining why.",
      "\"What he said to me the last day (before facing Eintracht Frankfurt in December) was, 'Boss, you don't have to tell me this, it's only about the team. We have to win three points, nothing else is important'. It's the right attitude. The mentality he has is fantastic and I am really happy he is here.\"",
      "Will Manchester United regret selling Marcus Rashford? Give us your prediction in the comments section.",
      "Rashford is fully focussed on making Barca's decision for them by improving his output, despite being given limited minutes since Raphinha returned from injury. \"Of course, what I want is to stay at Barca,\" he told Spanish publication Sport.",
      "\"It's the ultimate goal, but it's not the reason I'm training hard and giving my all. The purpose is to win. Barca is a huge, fantastic club, built to win titles.\"",

      "Manchester United are once again searching for a new head coach after sacking Ruben Amorim on Monday morning. Amorim’s 14 underwhelming months at Old Trafford ended in acrimony as things unravelled following Friday’s heated meeting with director of football Jason Wilcox.",
      "Current under-18s boss Darren Fletcher has been placed in temporary charge for tonight’s trip to Burnley. Fletcher is also among those under consideration to take charge for the remainder of the season.",
      "However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is claimed to be the leading contender to take charge on an interim basis until the end of the current campaign. But when it comes to appointing a permanent successor to Amorim, the United hierarchy are looking for someone who has experience of managing in the Premier League.",
      "That is according to David Ornstein of The Athletic, who is reporting that after appointing both Erik ten Hag and then Amorim, who both had no Premier League experience, having experience of managing in England's top-flight is going to be crucial moving forward.",
      "That is expected to rule out the likes of Luis Enrique and Zinedine Zidane, who have been mentioned as possible long-term replacements for Amorim. The former Real Madrid manager has long been linked with a move to United despite always publicly distancing himself from managing in England.",
      "Another manager who has been linked with the vacancy is Oliver Glasner, who is out of contract in the summer. However, speaking on Tuesday afternoon, the Crystal Palace boss played down links with the role.",
      "He said: \"I am not allowed to bet. I also cannot give insider information. That would also be breaking my contract. I am Crystal Palace manager and it makes no sense for you to ask more questions about it.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Gary Neville believes his old club's next step should be appointing a manager who \"fits the club's DNA.\" He said: \"The experiments have got to stop.",
      "\"I've always been very proud of what this club is - adventurous, exciting football, playing young players and entertaining the crowd. They must take risks and have the courage to play attacking, aggressive football.",
      "\"United have got to a point where they need a manager who fits the DNA of the football club.",
      "\"Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe United should change for anybody. The club has to find a manager who has got experience and who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking and aggressive football.\"",
      "\"Ultimately everyone loses, particularly when you are sacking a manager partway through the season. It's very difficult to get an adequate replacement in.",
      "\"I am surprised it's happened this morning, I'm not surprised it's happened. I didn't realise it would happen so quickly. I did think they'd get through another couple of weeks and try and work out what to do.",
      "\"But obviously it's become that challenging internally that they decided to do it very quickly, which was a shock this morning when I heard the news at 10 o'clock.",
      "\"If you look at some of the performances in the last month, they've really been shocking. However, there have been some bright spots along the way. The Wolves game seems to me to be the killer game. It was a bad one, that.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick could work together at Manchester United as successors to Ruben Amorim. It comes as the Portuguese head coach was sacked on Monday morning, with the club explaining the decision was made to give them the best chance of the highest-possible Premier League finish.",
      "The BBC, meanwhile, claimed a player felt the job could be shared by more than one contender. Carrick was a major part of Solskjaer's coaching team when the Norwegian took up tenure at Old Trafford in 2018 in the wake of Jose Mourinho's exit. It is said that United will hold further talks with Solskjaer and Carrick in the coming days before making a decision on their plans for the rest of the season.",
      "In the meantime, Darren Fletcher will take charge of the United first-team for Wednesday's Premier League clash with Burnley. It marks the Scot's managerial debut at senior level, and the Red Devils legend explained that he is honoured to be handed the task.",
      "He said during his pre-match press conference on Tuesday: \"Surreal. It is an amazing honour to lead a Manchester United team especially as it was not in my wildest dreams that would be something which could potentially happen.",
      "\"To lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do but not in the circumstances I expected it to happy so that is something which doesn't sit quite easy with me. But, I have just got to think I have a job to do and I just have to lead the team tomorrow and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.\"",
      "It is also suggested that Fletcher could be given the head coaching role until the season's end, depending on how well he fares against Burnley.",
      "As for Solskjaer, he could make a return to management following a brief seven‑month spell in charge of Besiktas in Turkey, while also working as a UEFA match analyst between jobs. Prior to that, he spent three years at Old Trafford between 2018 and 2021.",
      "Carrick, on the other hand, took his first steps into management in 2022 when he was appointed head coach of Championship side Middlesbrough, having previously taken charge on an interim basis following Solskjaer’s exit in 2021.",
      "Carrick was unable to lead Boro back to the Premier League and ultimately lost his job in the summer of 2025.",
      "Should both managers return to Old Trafford, it remains to be seen whether that reunion would work, with the key question being who would act as the main voice in the squad.",
      "In terms of a permanent successor, several names have been mentioned, including Oliver Glasner, Luis Enrique, Gareth Southgate, Kieran McKenna and Unai Emery.",

      "Whilst Darren Fletcher is currently holding the fort, United could look to the well-known figure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who experienced a successful spell as caretaker before securing the manager's position permanently. Speculation about discussions over a temporary arrangement for the Norwegian tactician could see him 'back at the wheel' once again.",
      "Solskjaer enjoyed just under three years at the helm at Old Trafford, taking charge of 168 games, with 92 wins across all competitions. The 52-year-old was recently seen in Cheshire, where he is still believed to own a £4m property, which could hint towards his return to United in the near future.",
      "His home is situated in Alderley Edge, an area favoured by numerous high-profile figures - including Christine McGuinness, Kerry Katona, Manchester City's Erling Haaland and Coleen and Wayne Rooney, whilst Victoria and David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo previously resided in the vicinity. Solskjaer purchased his property, initially a cottage, and converted it into an \"eco mansion\", with construction commencing in 2007.",
      "The former Manchester United player took some time before relocating with his family, having spent a period in Norway following the conclusion of his playing days. This prompted him to list it for sale, but when a buyer couldn't be found, reports suggested he rented it out to Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.",
      "Solskjaer ultimately settled into the residence permanently in 2019 upon his return to Old Trafford, with the luxury home boasting 3.4 acres of surrounding land. When the property was marketed back in 2016, the estate agents' brochure highlighted its features, stating: \"[The property] is an impressive contemporary style recently constructed detached family residence in extensive grounds of approximately 3.4 acres with impressive leisure complex with pool.",
      "\"[It] is a charming quiet, cobbled road on the outskirts of Alderley Edge enjoying a delightful rural setting. The village centre which is within a few minutes drive offers an excellent range of shopping, educational and recreational facilities with a wealth of quality cafes and fine restaurants.\"",
      "The estate agent continued: \"[The home] enjoys extensive mature grounds surrounding the property with sweeping lawns, mature trees and shrubs with open views beyond.",
      "\"Natural wood electrically operated double gates to the front where a sweeping gravel driveway provides excellent parking facilities and leads to an attached garage.\"",
      "The property also includes a pool room alongside a media room, comparable to the cinema rooms frequently found in other footballers' residences. Given that Solskjaer is thought to still own the property and has been seen back in Cheshire, there's a chance he and his family could return to the house if he's brought in for an interim period.",
      "For now, like every United fan, he'll be keeping a close eye on the team as they gear up for a series of intriguing matches under Fletcher's leadership. His tenure as interim starts against Burnley in midweek, before a clash with Brighton in the FA Cup third round over the weekend.",
      "It remains to be seen whether another appointment could then be made in time for the Manchester derby taking place on January 17. If Solskjaer is the man in charge, then it may give United the boost that they need to get another win over Pep Guardiola and the \"noisy neighbours\".",
      "The Norwegian coach has four wins and one draw in nine encounters with his Spanish counterpart, which may give the side an edge during an uncertain few weeks and months ahead. Former United star Michael Carrick is also thought to be in contention for the interim role after Ruud van Nistelrooy was reportedly ruled out.",

      "Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani might not have ended up as owner of Manchester United, but aspects of his blueprint for the club are becoming reality. In 2023, the Qatari billionaire went head-to-head with Sir Jim Ratcliffe after the Glazer family indicated they were open to selling the club.",
      "Ratcliffe ultimately prevailed, securing a 25 per cent stake - later increased to 28.9 per cent - in 2024, leaving Sheikh Jassim empty-handed. Still, one key element of his proposed ownership plan now seems to be shaping decisions at Old Trafford.",
      "Reports during the bidding period suggested he wanted to place former United players in \"prominent roles\" across the club, strengthening the link between the boardroom and the dressing room.",
      "Sheikh Jassim argued that United's hierarchy lacked club icons, missing out on valuable experience and institutional knowledge - and that idea is now taking hold even in his absence.",
      "Over the last year, Ratcliffe, who oversees football operations at United, has increasingly relied on ex-players for support. After Erik ten Hag's dismissal last season, former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who was his compatriot's assistant, became interim head coach.",
      "This strategy has continued after Ruben Amorim's exit this week, with another former United figure, Under-18s manager Darren Fletcher, stepping in temporarily to lead the first team.",
      "Fletcher has also been joined on the coaching staff by his ex-team-mate Jonny Evans, who only recently left his position as head of loans and pathways.",
      "Looking beyond the immediate arrangement, Ratcliffe is again drawing on United's past to find short-term solutions in the dugout. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, manager of the club from 2018 to 2021, is in discussions for a possible interim return, while former midfielder Michael Carrick is also being considered.",
      "Amorim was dismissed on Monday following a heated reaction after United's 0-0 draw with Leeds the previous day. In a tense post-match press conference, the 40-year-old insisted he was the \"manager\" of the club, not simply the head coach - a comment that suggested friction with the hierarchy.",
      "His 14-month spell proved deeply disappointing. Amorim won just 38 per cent of his matches, the lowest for any permanent United manager since Frank O'Farrell in the early 1970s.",
      "The Portuguese coach also oversaw one of United's worst domestic seasons in decades, finishing 15th in the Premier League last term. They were also beaten in the Europa League final, missing out on a Champions League return.",
      "Despite these difficulties, Amorim leaves the squad in reasonably solid condition. At the time of writing, United sit sixth in the table - their highest spot under the former Sporting CP coach - and are only three points off the top four.",
      "With the club now turning to familiar faces for guidance, a transitional period is beginning that could reshape United's short-term future.",

      "Adding to their woes, suggestions he might quit the French capital have already been dismissed by club officials. When asked about the speculation on Tuesday, PSG sporting director Luis Campos told Canal+: \"100% fake news.\"",
      "Enrique has enjoyed remarkable success at PSG. He has secured two league crowns, lifted the Coupe de France twice and claimed the Champions League in 2025.",
      "His victory in the European Cup marks his second managerial triumph, following his win with Barcelona in 2015. He also clinched two La Liga titles with the Catalan powerhouse.",
      "At present, PSG are still contenders in all domestic cup competitions, hold the second spot in Ligue 1 and are third in the Champions League table with just two league phase games remaining.",
      "PSG kicked off the new year with a 2-1 victory over city rivals Paris FC. Post-match, Enrique expressed his ambition to bag more trophies in Paris.",
      "\"We came back to the Parc with a victory,\" he said. \"I hope we win as many trophies in 2026. That's our goal, which is ambitious, of course, but I think that everyone in this team, club, and our supporters are ambitious, too. We want to win trophies and that's what we're going to try to do.\"",
      "Amorim was given his marching orders on Monday morning and left United immediately. His tenure ended with a record of just 24 victories in 63 matches.",
      "It's understood that United have been in discussions with Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy about temporarily taking the reins until the season's end, although the latter is believed to be out of contention.",
      "Solskjaer is a front-runner for the role, having indicated his willingness to return to Old Trafford. Darren Fletcher will step in as interim manager and will lead the team from the dugout in Wednesday evening's match against Burnley.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher will be in the dugout on Wednesday for the match against Burnley after Ruben Amorim's sacking. He might not be the only member of his family involved, though, with twin sons Jack and Tyler both pushing for first team minutes.",
      "Both of the youngsters, who turn 19 in March, have made matchday squads this season under Ruben Amorim. Jack has even played his first Premier League minutes, making a late cameo in the defeat against Aston Villa and then featured for 45 minutes against both Newcastle and Wolves, while Tyler was an unused substitute in each of the last three games.",
      "When asked whether either of his sons might get a run out at Turf Moor, Darren said: \"That would be disclosing team information before the game and I am not going to do that before the game. They were in the training group on Monday because that was already arranged before I got there.",
      "\"They have been in the squad recently but obviously we have got a couple of players back from injury so we will assess that tomorrow and we will have to assess a couple of players tomorrow due to the short turnaround from games. They are in the periphery squad but whether they make the match squad I don't know yet, that remains to be seen.\"",
      "After the weekend draw at Leeds, and before his Monday dismissal, former manager Amorim indicated captain Bruno Fernandes was closing in on a return from injury. Fletcher confirmed Fernandes and Mason Mount are both in contention to feature on Wednesday but there could still be a chance for the Fletcher twins to build on an already promising start to life at Old Trafford.",
      "Jack and Tyler have spent their youth careers in the same United academy but have gone down different paths at international level. Jack represents the country of his birth, England, while Tyler plays for Scotland, for whom his dad won 80 caps during his own playing career.",
      "In fact, the twins found themselves on opposite sides during the November international break. Jack came off the bench to score his first goal for England Under-19s as they beat a Scotland side captained by his twin brother.",
      "At club level, Jack is slightly ahead of his brother in the road to first-team football. In August, it emerged he was training with the first team ahead of the Premier League opener against Arsenal and he made the bench a handful of times in the Premier League last season under Erik ten Hag, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Amorim.",
      "Tyler's first inclusion in a Premier League squad came more than a year after his twin, in December 2025, but both have featured prominently in United's Under-21s and Under-18s while coming through the ranks. Tyler has featured in all eight of the Under-21s' games in Premier League 2 this term, while Jack played seven.",
      "Both were also regulars as United's youth side reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup in 2025. Jack chipped in with big goals and assists during the run, including the opener in a 3-2 quarter-final win at Arsenal.",
      "Jack has largely offered a greater goal threat than Tyler, scoring six times from midfield in 16 Premier League 2 outings. However, Tyler has been the assist king for the Under-18s, setting up nine goals last season as United's youngsters finished the league season second behind Manchester City.",
      "Regardless of whether the Fletcher twins feature at Burnley, Fletcher has a clear idea of what he wants his line-up to represent. \"I hope it represents a Manchester United team with a bit of me,\" he said in his pre-match press conference.",
      "\"What I know is Manchester United so hopefully it resembles a Manchester United team who fans can be proud of. That I can be proud of and I am sure it will because I believe in the players.\"",

      "Manchester United will officially begin life after Ruben Amorim on Wednesday as they travel to Turf Moor to face relegation-threatened Burnley. Amorim was dismissed as head coach on Monday, with Darren Fletcher stepping in as interim manager.",
      "Burnley come into this fixture on the back of a 2-0 defeat to Brighton & Hove Albion, extending their winless streak in the Premier League to 11 matches. Scott Parker’s side last tasted victory with back-to-back wins over Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers at the end of October, but have since lost nine of their last 11 games—a run that firmly places them in relegation danger. The Clarets have collected just 12 points from 20 matches, leaving them 19th in the table and six points adrift of safety, with 17th-placed Nottingham Forest set to face 18th-placed West Ham United on Tuesday night.",
      "Burnley famously won their first-ever Premier League home game against Manchester United in August 2009, but have failed to win any of the subsequent eight meetings at Turf Moor, suffering six defeats and scoring only once. In their earlier clash this season at Old Trafford, Burnley fell to a 3-2 defeat, with Bruno Fernandes netting a dramatic 97th-minute penalty to secure victory for United. Fernandes could make his return from injury for this match.",
      "Despite the managerial upheaval, United remain sixth in the Premier League, level on points with fifth-placed Chelsea and just three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool, keeping their top-four ambitions alive. However, a challenging run of fixtures lies ahead.",
      "Darren Fletcher will lead United against Burnley and is also expected to remain in charge for the FA Cup tie with Brighton & Hove Albion this weekend. It is uncertain whether a caretaker manager will be brought in before the crucial Premier League double-header against Manchester City and Arsenal later this month. A permanent successor to Amorim may not be appointed until the summer, but whoever takes the reins in the interim has a vital task ahead, with the club aiming to secure European football for the 2026-27 season.",
      "Fletcher’s audition as interim boss begins at Turf Moor, and fans will be optimistic about the prospect of a fresh tactical approach in the coming week.",
      "Burnley are currently among the hardest-hit teams in terms of injuries and absentees. Josh Cullen (knee), Zeki Amdouni (knee), Connor Roberts (calf), Axel Tuanzebe (AFCON), Hannibal Mejbri (AFCON), Lyle Foster (AFCON), Joe Worrall (muscle), Zian Flemming (muscle), and Jordan Beyer (hamstring) have all been ruled out for this match. However, the Clarets are hopeful that Maxime Esteve could make his return after missing the Brighton game due to injury. With four goals so far this season, Jaidon Anthony will once again be looked to for attacking inspiration.",
      "On the Manchester United side, Darren Fletcher has confirmed that both Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount are set to return to the squad after recovering from injuries, with Fernandes potentially slotting straight back into the starting XI. However, Bryan Mbeumo (AFCON), Amad Diallo (AFCON), and Noussair Mazraoui (AFCON) remain unavailable, while Kobbie Mainoo (calf), Matthijs de Ligt (back), and Harry Maguire (thigh) are also expected to miss out due to injury.",
      "Fletcher is likely to opt for a 4-2-3-1 formation instead of the 3-4-3 we were used to seeing under Amorim, with Patrick Dorgu possibly featuring on the right flank and starts anticipated for Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in attack. Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte have formed a solid partnership in midfield and are expected to continue, given the limited options in that area. Ayden Heaven and Lisandro Martinez could be paired together at the heart of the defence.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's possible return to the Manchester United dugout could spell excellent news for the club's emerging talent. The Norwegian, who guided United to third and second-place league finishes during his three-year spell in charge, is being considered again following Ruben Amorim's dismissal.",
      "Both Solskjaer and another Old Trafford legend, Michael Carrick, who departed Middlesbrough over the summer, have been approached about returning to the club, potentially in tandem. While his tenure ultimately ended in dismissal after a disappointing start to the 2021/22 campaign, Solskjaer's time at the helm is now regarded more favourably given United's subsequent struggles.",
      "One underappreciated aspect of his management was his readiness to trust young talent, something Amorim appeared hesitant to embrace. Both Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay featured in over 100 matches under Solskjaer's guidance, while several other academy graduates reached 50 appearances.",
      "Solskjaer handed Amad his United debut in 2021, while 16 youngsters in total, including Anthony Elanga, made their maiden senior appearance under his management. Discussing Solskjaer in early 2021, Ferguson told the BBC: \"If you don't get results, there's questions to be asked. He is getting the results, he really has done very well.",
      "\"And what is really important for this club is to introduce young people, and he's given young players a chance. The young guys, if they are good enough, play them. Never a problem at this club.\"",
      "It would be interesting to hear Ferguson's thoughts on Amorim's handling of youngsters, particularly given the Portuguese coach's blunt assessment that some were overpaid and entitled before his dismissal.",
      "He recently said: \"They feel entitlement and then they have legends of the club saying, 'If you don't play, then leave.' No, let's stay and fight and overcome. We have to fight against this feeling.\"",
      "Amorim evidently lacked faith in Kobbie Mainoo, suggesting the midfielder hadn't done enough in training or during his sparse appearances to warrant a regular starting berth.",
      "He explained: \"In the end, it's going to be the training, the games. Of course, he's not playing so many games, but Kobbie has had opportunities, especially last year. Everyone has.\"",
      "Furthermore, he was scathing about less-established prospects, such as Harry Amass, who is on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, claiming he was \"struggling in the Championship\" and highlighting Toby Collyer's minimal playing time at West Brom.",
      "He also justified his reluctance to give promising attacker Chido Obi a chance by emphasising he wasn't even a regular starter for the under-21s.",
      "While Amorim may have been accurate in his assessments, whether he should have publicly aired his doubts about the club's emerging talent remains questionable and presumably didn't go down well with the club's hierarchy, who ultimately decided a change was necessary.",

      "Thomas Tuchel is the outstanding choice to be the next Manchester United manager. But it feels as if everyone is just afraid to admit it because Tuchel’s No1 priority is being in charge of England’s World Cup campaign this summer.",
      "It is certainly a distraction the Football Association could do without ahead of the tournament which Tuchel was brought in to win. And you can bet that Tuchel will not welcome questions on the subject, although he is unlikely to face any sort of media scrutiny until England play next in March.",
      "However, Tuchel fits the United bill because they have made it clear they want a manager with Premier League experience, which is definitely a lesson learned from the whole Ruben Amorim reign. Tuchel is also an outstanding coach with real pedigree, he is highly regarded on the world stage and has experience of managing big clubs.",
      "The German coach led Chelsea to the Champions League and also managed Bayern Munich as well as Paris Saint Germain. You cannot begin to doubt his CV which is very different to someone like Oliver Glasner who is doing a remarkable job at Crystal Palace, leading the club to their first ever major trophy after they lifted the FA Cup.",
      "But managing Palace would be very different to United and, together with it, the whole discussion about “managing up” and whether Glasner would be a good fit at Old Trafford. Glasner could be a huge success but you are into that unknown and risk territory again whereas Tuchel comes with more of a guarantee and experience.",
      "Clearly, United have taken a view on installing a caretaker manager until the summer with Darren Fletcher taking charge of their game at Burnley. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could be back at the wheel until the end of the season which feels like a ridiculous and also comedy step back in time.",
      "But that is being done with the clear intention of waiting if necessary for the best candidate and then it is just a question of whether the stars align. It would be naive to suggest that if United went for Tuchel then it would not become a distraction. It never pans out well when there is uncertainty over an England manager going into a tournament.",
      "Tuchel has indicated how happy he is in the role and how much he is enjoying it, even hinting that he would quite fancy a contract beyond his 18 months which expires after the World Cup. Overall, Tuchel has done a great job after leading England to faultless qualifying campaign and they will be among the favourites at the World Cup having already been placed in the top four seeds.",
      "This is a great opportunity for Tuchel and England to deliver something truly unforgettable. It is also once-in-a-lifetime for him so it is hard to believe he would take his eye off the ball. But Tuchel was sounded out by United previously when they opted to stick with Erik ten Hag and any manager would be tempted.",
      "United have issues like many clubs as to whether it is set up for success and the structure. But any manager in world football would sit up and listen if United were interested. And that is why even with the World Cup on the horizon, this is a story which could easily develop.",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is exactly what Manchester United are looking for at present if Michael Carrick's past assessment is anything to go by. The Norwegian has been linked with a grand return to Old Trafford on an interim basis following the sacking of Ruben Amorim earlier this week.",
      "In an official statement, United explained that the decision was made to give the club the \"best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish\" in the second-half of the season. As a result, the board are now scouting the market for a suitable successor, with a number of names emerging as candidates.",
      "While the likes of Crystal Palace boss, Oliver Glasner, Enzo Maresca and Gareth Southgate have been named by the bookmakers as potential long-term successors, it is reported that United could be looking at bringing in a short-term head coach before assessing their options at the end of the season.",
      "Carrick and Solskjaer have ultimately emerged as potential names for an interim job, given both men have prior experience at the helm of the club and hold stellar relationships with the top brass of Old Trafford. As a result, the club are set to sit down with both men to engage in conversation regarding a stint with the club until the end of 2025/26.",
      "However, Carrick may well have already talked himself out of the opportunity with a glowing assessment of Solskjaer in the not too distant past.",
      "Speaking in 2019, the 44-year-old said of the Norwegian: \"Ole’s got that personality that rubs off on everybody, he’s so positive, he’s so upbeat all the time. I think you can see that rubbing off on individuals, and that goes a long way to bringing the best out of the players.\"",
      "It comes as Darren Fletcher will take charge of United's clash with Burnley come Wednesday evening, as United look to continue in their fine vein of form in the Premier League. It is also understood that the club will hold talks with the Scot over the potential of taking over until season's end, while Ruud van Nistelrooy has reportedly been snubbed by his former club.",

      "His run in the Midlands was far less fruitful last season, with the Foxes ultimately suffering relegation to the Championship and parting ways with the 49-year-old in June via mutual consent. Should Solskjaer be appointed as Manchester United's head coach until the end of the season, the club could be in good hands.",
      "The 52-year-old took up tenure with the club between 2018 and 2021, helping United to sixth, third and second-place finishes in the Premier League. While he failed to bring home any silverware across all competitions, his endeavours in the league proved more successful than the work done by David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Ten Hag, while Jose Mourinho also lead United to a second-place finish in 2017/18.",

      "In a new revelation last month, Fernandes revealed how he felt 'hurt' after realising that United 'wanted him to leave'. \"From the club I felt it was, 'If you go it's not so bad for us',\" ex-Sporting Lisbon star told Canal 11.",
      "\"It hurts me a bit. More than hurting me, it makes me sad. I'm a player that no one can criticise, I'm always available, I always give my best. I could have left in this transfer window, I would have earned much more money.",
      "\"I would have won many trophies this season, but I decided not to go, not only for family reasons but because I genuinely love the club.\"",
      "Fernandes added: \"The club wanted me to leave. I told the directors that, I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision because the manager wanted me. But if I said I wanted to leave, even with the manager wanting me to stay, the club would let me.\"",
      "With Amorim out of the equation, Al-Hilal could try their luck in January. More likely, though, is a move in the summer, just as Fernandes hinted at in October. \"As I've always said, I feel good here. I want to achieve my dreams still,\" the 31-year-old said.",
      "\"I can't talk for the club. I've seen a lot of people talking that I had an agreement to go already next season. If the club has done that agreement, it wasn't made with me.",
      "\"I haven't spoken with anyone. My agent also knows how I work. If he wants to talk to me, it will be after the World Cup. Until then, I won't speak to anyone.\"",
      "One man who likely won't want United to sell Fernandes is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who brought him to Old Trafford in January 2020 in a deal worth up to £67.7m. Solskjaer is a leading candidate to replace Amorim on an interim basis, and if he's selected, he'll attempt to get the job permanently and could have a say in their transfer business.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "There was a reason Ruben Amorim packed his bags and walked out of Manchester United's training ground with a smile on his face.",
      "He had lost his job. But the Portuguese had also lost that huge weight that had been hanging around his shoulders. That burden that comes with managing a team which belongs to one of the most dysfunctional football clubs on the planet.",
      "A brutal fact that the regime of Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS have only served to enhance since purchasing a stake in the club almost two years ago. Managers like Amorim lose their jobs when things are not going well. That's just how it is in football.",
      "Meanwhile, those in positions of power and influence above are allowed to make failings of their own - but remain untouchable. Which brings us to Omar Berrada (chief executive) and Jason Wilcox (director of football).",
      "In the last 18 months, these two bright sparks allowed Erik Ten Hag to spend £300million on new signings, then sacked him a few months later. Ratcliffe's regime hired and fired Dan Ashworth as sporting director in the space of just six months, because his advice wasn't welcomed.",
      "Amorim was then appointed, after Ratcliffe had tried but failed to get Thomas Tuchel. A manager who favoured a 3-4-3 system, but wasn't handed the talent to make it work. So he was sacked after 14 months. And don't get United supporters started on the powers that be signing-off deals for the likes of Joshua Zirkzee, Manuel Ugarte and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "The millions United have wasted on compensation and incompetent players is staggering. Something made even more painful to swallow considering it's happened at a time when Ratcliffe decided to make hundreds of employees redundant to reduce costs.",
      "And where has all this left the supposed 'biggest club in the world?' In the position of seeing those Old Trafford kingmakers and silent assassins asking one of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Michael Carrick to take charge on a caretaker basis.",
      "Solskjaer had his chance to manage United and wasn't good enough. While Carrick, who replaced Solskjaer on a caretaker basis for three games when the Norwegian was sacked in November 2021, couldn't cut the mustard as boss of Championship side Middlesbrough.",
      "You genuinely couldn't make it up. How the likes of Wilcox and Berrada are allowed to make such seismic decisions without any offer of explanation or recourse, is beyond baffling.",
      "Make no mistake. Amorim wasn't sacked because of results, like losing at Grimsby Town or failing to beat Wolves and West Ham. He was sacked after refusing to become a puppet for Wilcox, Berrada and Ratcliffe. Which is why he called them all out in his rant at Elland Road.",
      "And if that doesn't make people realise the manager isn't the problem at United - then there will never be a chance of the club getting back to the kind of success it believes it is entitled to.",

      "Ruben Amorim's bold declaration that he would depart Manchester United \"without any conversation about compensation\" may now return to haunt the club's former manager. United are reportedly facing a bill of around £12million following Amorim's dismissal because the head coach had 18 months remaining on his contract.",
      "This payout comes just over a year after the club splashed out nearly £10million to prise him away from Sporting CP in November 2024. When factoring in his salary from their appointment until Monday's sacking, the total cost of Amorim's trophy-free tenure could reach £30million.",
      "United might be able to use the coach's own words against him, though, following comments after the Europa League final. In the aftermath of their loss to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, Amorim said: \"If the board and the fans feel I'm not the right guy, I will go in the next day without any conversation about compensation, but I will not quit.\"",
      "Maguire noted that matters become more complex when considering Amorim's backroom team. Assistant manager Carlos Fernandes, first-team coaches Adelio Candido and Emanuel Ferro, goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital and fitness coach Paulo Barreira all left alongside the Portuguese tactician.",
      "The expert explained: \"If they're going to sack all of his staff at the same time, then I think it becomes more complicated than that because, presumably, all of his entourage will go as well. [The club] might be able to hold him to his comment last May, but equally, he could hold the club to its comments from Jim Ratcliffe that they weren't going to sack him.\"",
      "Ratcliffe said on The Business podcast in October: \"Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. He then reiterated when asked whether Amorim would get three years: \"Yes, that is where I would be, three years.\"",
      "Maguire, meanwhile, recognises United are \"fine from a financial point of view\" despite the massive expenditure on Amorim and summer signings alongside extensive cost-cutting measures throughout the club following Ratcliffe's acquisition. He explained: \"They've controlled wages fairly well, partly due to the fact that the players they've recruited, they're coming on big fees but not big wages, and they've managed to shift some of the big wage players, at least out on loan, if you take a look at [Jadon Sancho and [Marcus] Rashford and so on.",
      "\"So I don't see them being in a financial crisis at all. And also for the first time in a long time, they've managed to monetise the academy.",
      "\"You've got the sales of [Scott] McTominay, [Mason] Greenwood and [Alejandro] Garnacho, all the former academy players.\" United pocketed nearly £100million in transfer fees from that trio. Maguire added: \"So all of that's pure profit, which means that they're good from a PSR point of view. It's starting to generate money as well.",
      "\"Historically, they've been a long, long way behind the other clubs in the big six, especially Chelsea and Manchester City, both of whom are super smart when it comes to converting sort of the commoditisation of children. I know that sounds a bit melodramatic, but that's what you're doing with the academy.\"",
      "He concluded: \"So I think that's part of the culture of Manchester United that probably has changed. That has improved under Ineos to an extent; other aspects of the club, perhaps less so.\"",
      "United are presently hunting for a new permanent replacement for Amorim, but are likely to name a caretaker manager until the season concludes. In the meantime, Darren Fletcher will oversee Wednesday night's fixture against Burnley.",
      "However, the club have been in discussions with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick regarding taking the reins for the remainder of the campaign. The former appears most likely to take charge from Fletcher.",

      "The pressure mounted on Amorim after a post-match press conference that hinted at a rift between him and club chiefs. Shortly after, United confirmed the exit of the Portuguese coach.",

      "Pictures have now showed Bruno Fernandes going for coffee with Carlos Fernandes on Tuesday evening. Images show the duo leaving a coffee shop at around 6pm.",
      "Reacting to his departure from the club, Carlos Fernandes took to his personal Instagram account on Tuesday night to send a message. Sharing a series of photos from his time at Old Trafford, he wrote: \"Thank you, Manchester United.",
      "\"Thank you to the world-class players I had the privilege to coach and to learn from.",

      "\"In the end, working at a football club of this dimension doesn't just test your knowledge - it reveals character.",
      "\"A special chapter in my life. Proud to have served as Assistant Manager of Manchester United.\" He included a red heart emoji.",
      "Now, all eyes are on who will succeed Amorim as manager. The club is reportedly in discussions with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick, and Ruud van Nistelrooy about taking the reins until the end of the season. Solskjaer seems to be the front-runner for the role.",
      "The Norwegian departed the club back in 2021 after a three-year stint at the helm. With United set to play tonight (Wednesday), U18 head coach Darren Fletcher will temporarily take charge of the squad for the match.",
      "He'll be supported by former defender Jonny Evans, who is poised to return just months after stepping down from his position as loans manager, along with Travis Binnon and Alan Wright.",
      "Updating on the hunt for a new manager, Fletcher stated: \"I've had a conversation and the focus was on this game and we'll speak after the game\"\"I've got a game to prepare, training session to organise, speak to players. The focus has been on the Burnley match and we'll speak after the game\"When queried about whether he'd like the job on a more permanent basis, he responded: \"Honestly, it's not something I've thought about.",
      "\"That discussion is for after the game. It's all happened so quickly, all my concentration and efforts are going on Burnley.\"",
      "Reflecting on managing United, he added: \"It's surreal, it's an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team. I didn't think in my wildest dreams that was something that could happen.",
      "\"To lead out a team is an amazing honour and something I'm really proud of. Not in the circumstances I expected, that's something that doesn't sit easy with me, but I've got a job to do and will think of the honour and pride.\"",

      "Sir Alex Ferguson once tried to persuade Pep Guardiola to take over as Manchester United manager during a secret meeting between the pair. In the 13 years since the legendary Scot retired, the club has attempted - largely in vain - to fill the vast void his departure left behind.",
      "Six permanent managers have come and gone in that time, the latest being Ruben Amorim, who was relieved of his duties on Monday. But much of that upheaval might have been avoided had Ferguson succeeded in convincing Guardiola to take the reins from him at Old Trafford.",
      "The pair met at a restaurant in New York in 2012, ahead of what would be Ferguson's final season in charge of the Red Devils. At the time, Guardiola had just embarked on a sabbatical after a hugely successful four-year spell at Barcelona.",
      "Although Ferguson had yet to formally decide when he would retire, he effectively offered the Spaniard the opportunity to succeed him in the United hot seat. Reflecting on the encounter in 2014, Guardiola joked that he was not entirely sure he had even been offered the job, citing the language barrier - and Ferguson's famously thick Glaswegian accent.",
      "\"He invited me to [a] super restaurant and we had a very, very good time,\" he recalled. \"My English [was] not so good [and] Sir Alex spoke a little bit quickly, I sometimes had a problem understanding him.",
      "\"That's why I didn't understand if I received an offer or not,\" he laughed. \"It was a friendly dinner, like always with me when I started as a coach, he was so, so gentle, and we spent a very, very good time together.\"",
      "Ultimately, the offer was futile. In January 2013, it was announced that Guardiola would take over as Bayern Munich boss at the end of the season.",
      "\"I couldn't make him any direct proposal to [Guardiola] because retirement was not on my agenda at that point,\" Ferguson wrote of their meeting in his 2015 book Leading.",
      "\"He had already won an enviable number of trophies with Barcelona... and I admired him greatly. I asked Pep to phone me before he accepted an offer from another club, but he didn't and wound up joining Bayern Munich in July 2013.\"",
      "Instead, on another of Ferguson's recommendations, United turned to David Moyes, whose disastrous tenure ended in his dismissal just 10 months later. Guardiola would eventually make his way to Manchester after three years in Bavaria - only it was the blue half of the city that secured his services.",
      "Since 2016, Guardiola's Manchester City have run roughshod over the Premier League, collecting six titles as well as two FA Cups and the Champions League in 2023. They also became the first club in the competition's history to win four in a row - and remain the only side to have amassed more than 100 points in a single season.",
      "By contrast, United have floundered throughout the decade since Guardiola arrived on English shores. The club have slipped completely out of the title picture and finished the 2024/25 campaign in a record-low 15th place.",
      "That dismal state of affairs, compounded by growing tensions between the manager and the board in recent months, ultimately led to Amorim's departure earlier this week. Darren Fletcher has been placed in temporary charge, with former head coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer reportedly in the frame to take over as an interim successor while the search for a permanent appointment continues.",
      "It means that since Ferguson's retirement, United could, by the start of next season, have cycled through 13 different managers - an extraordinary rate of turnover for a club once defined by stability and long-term vision. Across the city, the man Sir Alex hoped would inherit his throne has instead built a neighbouring dynasty, turning a rival into the dominant force of an era.",
      "Football history often hinges on fine margins, fleeting conversations and missed opportunities. For United, that dinner in New York may stand as the ultimate sliding doors moment.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Darren Fletcher will be joined in the dugout by Travis Binnion, Alan Wright and Jonny Evans as he takes interim charge of the Reds for the first time. The Scot has had a busy couple of days and his sole objective as things stand is to mastermind a victory over relegation-threatened Burnley.",
      "The hosts have not won in their past 11 matches and United could be buoyed by a few returns to their team. Captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount are both expected to be in the matchday squad, although their minutes are being managed following their return from injury.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo could also feature at Turf Moor but he is being assessed today before the trip. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is among the names United have approached to become the caretaker manager until the end of the season and he will be watching this game intently tonight.",
      "Follow all the updates from Turf Moor in our live blog below...",
      "Think you know how United will line up against Burnley tonight? Why not have a go at selecting the side below...",
      "It has been a whirlwind couple of days for Manchester United following their draw at Leeds on Sunday lunchtime. Ruben Amorim made his thoughts on the Ineos decision-makers crystal clear after the game, was fired for said outburst and Darren Fletcher has taken charge. The former United midfielder and U18s coach will be looking to settle all of the noise surrounding the club with a straightforward victory against Burnley on Wednesday night. Scott Parker's relegation-threatened side have not won in their last 11 matches but as the Wolves game proved, no match will be easy for this squad.",
      "It is expected Fletcher will make some changes to the starting line-up tonight - chief of which would be to revert to a four-at-the-back system. Sticking with a three would be a rogue decision considering the fallout which led to Amorim's sacking. But while the 4-3-3 could be considered when players are back from injury and the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), a 4-2-3-1 seems more likely when they make the short trip to Turf Moor tonight.",
      "United predicted XI vs Burnley: Lammens; Dalot, Heaven, Martinez, Shaw; Ugarte, Casemiro; Dorgu, Zirkzee, Cunha; Sesko",

      "Burnley 1-1 United - February 8, 2022",
      "It will be a proud night for the Fletcher family when Darren enters the dugout, potentially with sons Jack and Tyler following, for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Burnley at Turf Moor. The 41-year-old was appointed interim manager of the Reds on Monday following the sacking of Ruben Amorim. In his first press conference, Fletcher refused to say whether his twin sons, who joined from Manchester City in 2023, would be part of the matchday squad. But if they are, it will undoubtedly be the first time a manager and his twins have been part of the backroom staff and squad in the Premier League.",
      "While that is not a guarantee to happen tonight, there are some scenarios which we expect to pan out at Turf Moor during Fletcher's first game in charge of the Reds. So with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at what we think will happen.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Fletcher will be hoping to get off to the best possible start tonight as he takes charge of the Reds for the first time. United enter the game off the back of a tumultuous few days following the draw with Leeds. After Ruben Amorim criticised the Ineos decision makers in his post-match press conference, he was promptly sacked on Monday and Fletcher was put in temporary charge. MEN Sport understands Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy have been approached over a caretaker role until the end of the season but for today at least, it will be Fletcher in the dugout.",
      "To deliver United's first win since Boxing Day, Fletcher will be hoping he can call upon a couple of players at least who have been injured in recent weeks.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Welcome along to the United matchday blog ahead of a huge game at Burnley this evening in the Premier League. After back-to-back draws against Wolves and Leeds, tonight's clash with Scott Parker's side was always going to be a major fixture. However, following Ruben Amorim's sacking and Darren Fletcher's appointment as interim manager, the stakes have been raised even further. In the context of the season, United really need to be beating Burnley particularly with Chelsea and Liverpool having tough midweek fixtures against Fulham and Arsenal respectively.",
      "Fletcher will be well received by the travelling United fans this evening but the result is the main thing. With at least one or two first-team starters returning to the side this evening, there should be a boost in the strength of the team if nothing else.",
      "Stay tuned for updates..."

      "Darren Fletcher won't tell his former teammates now working in the media to go easy on his Manchester United team, despite the criticism being levelled at players and the club being raised under Ruben Amorim. In his press conference broadside at club officials on Sunday, Amorim suggested that even executives were influenced by criticism from the likes of Gary Neville.",
      "The club's former right-back is one of a cohort of United greats who have waded in on the club in their media roles, with Roy Keane and Paul Scholes also heavily critical. Those attacks have damaged the confidence of some players and caused divisions between the dressing room and some United greats, but Fletcher believes those now wearing the shirt should embrace the challenge that comes with the pressure of being at the club.",
      "\"You can’t ask them to go easier because they're passionate guys and I think they're right to their opinion and they're really good,\" Fletcher said of the critical pundits he played with. \"They're engaging, they're good to listen to. I enjoy listening to them, you know. I had years of listening to them in the dressing room and I used to sit and listen to them and take it all in.",
      "\"Outside noise, ex-players, it's difficult to deal with, it's not easy because those players have won everything. They've got success behind them, they've got trophies, so it's hard to criticise them back because they've got their medals on the table, so it's really, really difficult.",
      "\"But again, that's what it is being a Manchester United player. Get your head around it, learn how you're going to deal with it, and embrace the challenge.\"",
      "Although the withering attacks on a string of disappointing performances and underwhelming seasons have been seen internally as damaging, Fletcher turned the equation on its head and said players should be grateful for the support they receive inside Old Trafford.",
      "Supporters have rarely turned on the team despite their struggles, with Fletcher pointing out that wouldn't be the case everywhere given the struggles United have endured in recent years, with finishes of sixth, eighth and 15th in three of the previous four seasons.",
      "\"People want to win football games, people want to be entertained, people have a standard of what Manchester United is and what Manchester United expects,\" said Fletcher.",
      "\"I think the fans, especially in Old Trafford, have been amazing in recent years, if I'm perfectly honest with you. I think there's been a few moments here and there, but in general the support that the fans have given players, managers, understanding of the situation, I think it could have been a lot worse inside the stadium.",
      "\"I've probably experienced other stadiums where there has been a lot more pressure and hostile, so maybe the players have to deal with that noise more than actual stadium sort of pressure.",
      "\"So that should help and I think the fans have been amazing in that and I'm going to sit here today and ask them to support the players. Not me, support the players in the club, because they need it and they need that help.\"",

      "The irony of Manchester United's new power structure appointing Ruben Amorim as the club's first head coach in November 2024 is that a few months earlier, his name hadn't really been in the frame at all. That was the summer when Liverpool considered appointing Amorim, only to opt for Arne Slot amid concerns over the Portuguese's system, his stubbornness in playing it and how the squad would fit. Those concerns were cast aside at Old Trafford later in the year.",
      "But for a few heady, confusing weeks in the summer of 2024, change was in the air at United, too. Sir Jim Ratcliffe had decided to sack Erik ten Hag and contenders to replace him were lined up on the catwalk. Then Ten Hag won the FA Cup final, United dithered and the Dutchman stayed, new contract, pay rise and all.",
      "Before that, Ratcliffe spoke to potential replacements as United scoured the market. They met with Thomas Tuchel in Monaco and the German was right at the top of the list of likely appointments, should they have gone through with the decision to dispense with Ten Hag.",
      "There were also talks with Premier League managers, as Marco Silva, Thomas Frank and Roberto De Zerbi were all considered. However, there was little indication that Amorim was part of the conversation before the Ibiza summit, which led to Ten Hag staying.",
      "That decision was reversed within four months, with no improvement in results under the Dutchman. As United looked for a replacement this time, Amorim was high on the shortlist. For all the reservations of the then sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and his colleagues at Anfield, the Sporting head coach's stock was high.",
      "Perhaps the switch to Amorim and a coach with such a unique style of play can be attributed to chief executive Omar Berrada settling into the job. Berrada was particularly taken by Amorim's personality and charisma. Speaking to the BBC in March of this year, Ratcliffe explained the decision to stick with Ten Hag as one made at \"short notice\".",
      "\"At the end of the day, we are a consensus organisation,\" he said. \"So there's a collection of us who make decisions. It's not just me that makes the decision, it involves that management team.",
      "\"If you look at the time we made the decision about Erik the management team hadn't been in place more than five minutes. Omar [Berrada] had only just arrived, Jason [Wilcox] had not been there terribly long, so we didn't really have the management team in place for very long to make… it was a very difficult decision to make at short notice.\"",
      "That consensus was lacking when Amorim was appointed. Berrada and Ratcliffe might have been on board with the decision, but Wilcox needed convincing and Ashworth's doubts never dissipated. Having insisted that a football structure would make a decision on a style of play, Ratcliffe turned to a head coach who was unique in this department.",
      "What does that tell us about the next search for a head coach, now that Amorim has gone? The structure is more settled, with Ashworth having also left. Berrada and Wilcox are the key figures, with director of recruitment Christopher Vivell on the rise. Ratcliffe will again be involved.",
      "The management team that Ratcliffe discussed should be able to make the right decision this time, but they will be under pressure to do so. Given the names under consideration in June 2024, the decision to appoint Amorim felt like a change in strategy. Maybe it warns us to expect the unexpected as United consider their options this time around.",

      "Former midfielder Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team for tonight's Premier League clash against Burnley. He will be helped by former defender Jonny Evans, who will return to the club just months after leaving.",
      "While the game is going on, work is likely to be happening in the background on an appointment. It's suggested that former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is in talks over taking charge of the club until the end of the season, although Michael Carrick is also being linked.",

      "It will be a proud night for the Fletcher family when Darren enters the dugout, potentially with sons Jack and Tyler following, for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Burnley at Turf Moor. The 41-year-old was appointed interim manager of the Reds on Monday following the sacking of Ruben Amorim.",
      "In his first press conference, Fletcher refused to say whether his twin sons, who joined from Manchester City in 2023, would be part of the matchday squad. But if they are, it will undoubtedly be the first time a manager and his twins have been part of the backroom staff and squad in the Premier League.",
      "While that is not a guarantee to happen tonight, there are some scenarios which we expect to pan out at Turf Moor during Fletcher's first game in charge of the Reds. So with this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at what we think will happen.",
      "Considering the fallout from Amorim's sacking, it seems highly unlikely Fletcher will choose to stick with a back three formation. The Portuguese head coach looked to appease the owners on Boxing Day by playing a back four against Newcastle and it worked.",
      "By no means was the performance perfect, particularly in the second half, but it was the last time United tasted victory and it seems certain the back four will return at Turf Moor. It also makes more sense to play a four at the back now, considering the players at Fletcher's disposal.",
      "Amad is United's best wing-back but he is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Diogo Dalot has played on the left and right, but he is much better as a full-back and thus a return to this system would be beneficial for the Reds.",
      "There must have been an audible sigh of relief among United households across the world when Fletcher announced Bruno Fernandes would be back in the matchday squad tonight. Not only is Fernandes the captain, but he is also the star player in a team which struggles for consistency.",
      "You have to wonder in the games against Wolves and Leeds whether United would have won had Fernandes been on the park. The Portuguese midfielder has a knack of creating moments of magic out of seemingly impossible situations and his creativity has been missed desperately.",
      "Of course, Fernandes may not play the full 90 minutes, considering his recent return from injury. But, we can expect Fletcher to lean in heavily on the captain and potentially even start him - if only for the first 45 minutes - to rouse the troops.",
      "Whether the fans make their feelings towards the boardroom clear tonight will be interesting to see. A lot of supporters have been left angered by the manner in which Sir Jim Ratcliffe has run football operations since acquiring a minority stake in the club.",
      "This does not necessarily mean they are unhappy Amorim has gone, but there will likely be a large amount of fans travelling to Burnley who feel Ratcliffe has embarrassed the club with another quick upheaval. Should the travelling supporters voice those opinions, remains to be seen.",
      "What is not in doubt is the rousing reception Fletcher will receive as he strides out at Turf Moor this evening. United fans adore most of their ex-players, as will be proven if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer takes on the caretaker role until the end of the season.",
      "And one certainty Fletcher can rely on is the away fans backing both him and the team tonight.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard has been encouraged to make a surprising return to UK football. Lingard is currently without a club after leaving FC Seoul in December after two years in South Korea.",
      "The former England international's contract was mutually terminated after he expressed his desire to move on to \"the next stage of his football career.\" United legend Dwight Yorke has now suggested the 33-year-old should consider joining Championship side Wrexham to see out the final chapter of his career.",
      "Yorke spent the twilight of his career in the second tier with Sunderland, helping them win the title and secure promotion to the Premier League. The former Trinidad and Tobago striker believes a similar experience would benefit Lingard and help revive his fortunes.",
      "Speaking to PokerScout, Yorke said: \"Jesse is an interesting character. I've always kept an eye on him due to the United connection. I really don't know what his priority is right now, but he still obviously wants to play football and at the Championship level, there's no question he'd be an asset.",
      "\"If he were to go to Wrexham, that wouldn't be a surprise either. Maybe he feels it's time to come back home to be closer to his daughter and help Wrexham get promoted to the Premier League. That could be one last rodeo for him, and I've experienced the advantages of joining a Championship team.",
      "\"I did it at Sunderland when they were 23rd, and we got promoted as champions. It can be done, and it's a way to get Jesse back to a level I'm sure he's craving. I would certainly consider it. Wrexham are a very ambitious team with wealthy backers, making good progress and currently sitting mid-table in the Championship.\"",
      "He added: \"I would tell Jesse to look at it, as I'm a prime example that it's possible. When it's done, it's a fantastic achievement and before you know it, you're playing Premier League football again when you thought it was all doom and gloom. I encourage him to look at it.\"",
      "During his recent spell in the K League, Lingard made 66 appearances and scored 18 goals, even captaining the side in his final season. FC Seoul paid tribute to him as a \"symbolic figure\" who generated enormous attention both on and off the pitch.",
      "Reflecting on his stint abroad, Lingard wrote on Instagram: \"My time in South Korea has been unbelievable – the football, the atmosphere and the passion around this club have been top class.",
      "\"The love, support and the appreciation you have shown towards me for these last two years has been truly amazing. I'll always be grateful for the opportunity to play for such a massive club.\"",
      "Before his move overseas, Lingard's career in England had seen its ups and downs. After emerging from United’s academy and making 232 appearances, his opportunities at Old Trafford diminished.",
      "He enjoyed a prolific loan spell at West Ham in 2021, scoring nine goals in 16 games, but returned to United to find limited game time, later joining Nottingham Forest where injuries and poor form curtailed his impact.",
      "Lingard has faced criticism over professionalism in the past, with pundits questioning his focus and off-field distractions. However, he has consistently defended himself, insisting his personality and lifestyle never detracted from his commitment to the game.",
      "Wrexham, owned by Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac (formerly McElhenney), currently sit ninth in the Championship and are chasing an unprecedented fourth consecutive promotion under manager Phil Parkinson. The Welsh club splashed out £33million on new players during the summer and are expected to invest in their squad again in January.",

      "As the post-Ruben Amorim era gets underway at Manchester United, a certain Andre Onana will feel buoyed about the future. That's after the loan outcast signalled his intention to revive his Old Trafford career once (or if) he returns to the club.",
      "Sending Onana on loan to Super Lig side Trabzonspor was Amorim's last piece of major transfer business in England. United's former No. 1 was dispatched in mid-September, several weeks after Senne Lammens was secured as the latest candidate between the sticks.",
      "It marked the end of an era after two seasons of frantic frustration with Onana as United's first-choice goalkeeper. For every positive action, it at times felt like Onana contributed two negative ones in response and never truly looked settled as a starter.",
      "But for all intents and purposes, the 29-year-old remains a United player and could return to his parent club this summer. However, an impressive start to Lammens' career in England appears to have ended any future prospects of him as No. 1.",
      "Onana initially joined United in 2023 when he reunited with former Ajax coach Erik ten Hag. And despite any criticism coming his way, Amorim stuck with the Cameroon keeper, who was left out of their Africa Cup of Nations squad, for the most part.",
      "Turkey international Altay Bayindir had his own chance to impress between the posts amid Onana's unreliable form. And while it may appear as though his days in Manchester are done, Onana could feasibly reintegrate with a clean slate under a new manager.",
      "The i Paper reported in November that Onana remains keen on winning back his place as United's No. 1 once he returns from Turkey. Trabzonspor are understood to be open to turning Onana's move into a permanent transfer after being impressed with his work thus far, however.",
      "Fatih Tekke's side are currently third in the Super Lig, making it unlikely they'd agree for the player to be recalled. However, it can't be ruled out altogether without knowing who will replace Amorim and their thoughts on the matter.",
      "Lammens' own agent has suggested United planned to keep Onana at Old Trafford to work alongside Lammens. That could indicate Onana does indeed have his supporters still in Manchester.",
      "In truth, there are bound to be those at United who hope Trabzonspor, or any other team, step up with an acceptable offer to purchase the player. But in the event no one is willing to match his valuation, a return to Old Trafford could well be on the cards.",
      "The player is contracted at United until 2028, having signed a five-year deal when he joined the club. And while Lammens is steadily marking himself out as the clear superior among United's goalkeeping corps, every club needs a capable back-up.",
      "That's not to suggest Onana would be content playing second fiddle, but it may be his only option. And Amorim's successor may view a 53-cap international player and Champions League runner-up as a handy deputy.",
      "It's reasonable logic considering Onana held a much grander reputation when United signed him from Inter Milan for £43.8million almost three years ago. And while many fans may not wish to see any more of the player in red, Amorim's heir may well have different thoughts.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's Harry Maguire claimed he couldn't believe the club didn't kick-on under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, prior to the Norwegian leaving in November 2021. Solskjaer has been linked with a sensational return to the club as interim manager after United parted ways with Ruben Amorim.",
      "The former United striker first took charge of United in December 2018, replacing Jose Mourinho in a caretaker role. His performance with the team saw him offered the job on a permanent basis just three months later.",
      "Solskjaer led United to two top‑three finishes, in 2020 and 2021. He also guided the club to the 2021 Europa League final, which United lost on penalties to Villarreal. However, a poor run of form the following season led to his sacking with United sitting in seventh in the Premier League.",
      "Speaking on Rio Ferdinand’s YouTube podcast back in August, Maguire opened up about his time under the Norwegian, claiming he was shocked at the club's slide in Solskjaer's third season. He also admitted to feeling \"the best I've ever felt\" under the ex-striker.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Maguire said: \"We just couldn’t believe what happened because we obviously finished third and second and then that season we brought in Jadon Sancho, Rafael Varane and Cristiano Ronaldo in the summer and you’re thinking here we go now like let’s go and win the Premier League.",
      "\"And it just never happened. It just never clicked. and obviously we lost Ole (Solskjaer) which was disappointing if I’m being honest. I felt like Ole did an unbelievable job.\"",
      "He added: \"I’ll probably speak more about Ole when I’m when I’m retired but the way that he set us up in them first two years is probably the best I’ve felt in a team. Under Ole and Kieran (McKenna) and Carrick. Those three they had us so well organised.",
      "\"And like I said we didn’t have the I wouldn’t say the the best team, just a well coached , tactically brilliant, pragmatic, we could play, we could press, but yeah, the third season I was there, it just didn’t work.\"",
      "Maguire's words will be a ringing endorsement for Solskjaer's temporary comeback. Reports state that the club's senior players would also welcome back their former coach, with The Guardian claiming that Bruno Fernandes is open to his return.",
      "Solskjaer signed Fernandes in January 2020, with the Portuguese star widely regarded as the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.",
      "\"For me, he's doing a really good job and it's been a big improvement on the team since he arrived. We're still dropping points at home and it's not good enough and we know that but it's not only the coach's fault.\"",
      "Fellow United legend Michael Carrick, who departed Middlesbrough in the summer, is also believed to have been approached about the vacancy. Under-18s manager Darren Fletcher will take the reins for the match at Burnley on Wednesday and potentially against Brighton in the FA Cup on Sunday.",

      "Manchester United could consider offering an interim role to both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick in a potential reunion for the pair at Old Trafford.",
      "That's according to The Sun, which claims that the possibility of both former players and coaches returning as part of a team up could be on the cards,",
      "Talks have been held with both Solskjaer and Carrick, with the former spotted back in Cheshire ahead of a possible return, in what could be an important few months ahead for the pair.",
      "It's a potentially radical move from United, following the sacking of Ruben Amorim, with both coaches having worked as the main head coach in roles since their time at Old Trafford together.",
      "Carrick was part of Solskjaer's backroom team during his spell at the club, which started as an interim in 2018, and ended up with him getting the job permanently in 2019.",
      "That team lasted until 2021, when the manager was eventually dismissed, as United once again looked to push on in search of success.",
      "Solskjaer has since managed at Besiktas in Turkey, which lasted just seven months, while he has held a position as a match analyst for UEFA in between roles.",
      "As for Carrick, he took his first steps into management in 2022, when he was appointed the head coach of Championship outfit Middlesbrough - following his own caretaker spell with Man United back in 2021.",
      "The former midfielder continued to knock on the door of the Premier League, pushing for promotion, with 136 matches managed during that spell.",
      "While Carrick picked up 63 wins in that time, he never quite got his Boro side over the line, eventually losing his job in the summer of 2025.",
      "With both having their experiences in management since then, it remains to be seen whether a reunion with both as an interim manager would work, while questions would remain over who the main voice is for the squad.",
      "It's a decision that could bring more experience to the coaching staff, however, with Darren Fletcher currently taking charge of the side in the absence of an appointment for the role.",
      "The 41-year-old will take charge of the Burnley game in midweek, while he could also oversee Man United's clash with Brighton in the FA Cup over the weekend.",
      "\"Surreal,\" Fletcher said when asked to describe being handed the caretaker role. \"It is an amazing honour to lead a Manchester United team especially as it was not in my wildest dreams that would be something which could potentially happen.",
      "\"To lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do but not in the circumstances I expected it to happy so that is something which doesn't sit quite easy with me. But, I have just got to think I have a job to do and I just have to lead the team tomorrow and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.\"",
      "While the focus is on the games ahead for the squad and the makeshift management team, the hierarchy are set to continue their plans for the future.",

      "As if Oliver Glasner's Premier League CV didn't speak for itself, Manchester United would get a welcome boost in the transfer market should they hire him. At least in principle, that is, given it only looks like a matter of time before Marc Guehi leaves Crystal Palace.",
      "Ruben Amorim's dismissal on Monday has reopened the forum regarding who will succeed him as United's next long-term boss. Glasner was cryptic when recently quizzed about him being the favourite to take over at Old Trafford, though that may not materialise until the summer when his contract expires.",
      "He isn't the only one, either, given Guehi is in an identical position regarding the expiration date of his terms at Selhurst Park. The defender was widely expected to join Liverpool on transfer deadline day in the summer, only for negotiations to collapse at the 11th hour.",
      "A move could now come to fruition this month following a hint from FA Cup-winner Glasner himself. Until recently, Palace had held firm in their stance that Guehi, who is now understood to be in Manchester City's sights as well, would not be allowed to leave midway through the campaign; however, that hardened position appears to have softened.",
      "Speaking about the prospect of Guehi leaving in January, Glasner recently said: \"There’s the situation that the contract ends in the summer and if somebody is coming, there will be a moment when the club says, 'Now the financial issue is more important than the sport issue.'",
      "\"We have to do it and try to get the best. That’s why I’m always saying, 'I don’t know.' Because this is different. “There will be a threshold where the club has to say [sell].",
      "\"If the player says, ‘I want to leave’ and the money is above the threshold, it will happen. I’m not so naive not to know that if a massive offer comes from City and Marc wants to do it, it will happen.\"",
      "Except City may not be the only Manchester giant to weigh in this month, and United have their own need for such an asset. Not to mention the bonus enjoyment those at Old Trafford would feel from blocking their nemeses' efforts to reinforce.",
      "Guehi is the real prize, however. He brings a commanding England international presence in defence at a potentially hefty discount. Moreover, the Eagles skipper would add some of the much-needed leadership qualities that have been lacking at Old Trafford for some time.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's regime has signed defensive talents like Matthijs de Ligt, Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, but all are either too young or the wrong profile to be considered dressing room leaders. Harry Maguire has had his chance at the captaincy and is now hampered by fitness issues, similar to those of Luke Shaw and Lisandro Martinez, who haven't been present enough to be considered reliable.",

      "Darren Fletcher, who is currently in charge of the club’s U18 side, has been temporarily promoted to interim head coach for tonight’s trip to Burnley. The Scot is also among those under consideration to take charge for the remainder of the season.",
      "However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is claimed to be the leading contender to take charge on an interim basis until the end of the current campaign. But when it comes to appointing a permanent successor to Amorim, the United hierarchy are looking for someone who has experience of managing in the Premier League.",
      "According to David Ornstein of The Athletic, after appointing both Erik ten Hag and then Amorim, who both had no Premier League experience, having someone who knows England's top-flight well is going to be crucial. That could rule out the likes of Luis Enrique and Zinedine Zidane, who have been mentioned as a possible long-term replacement for Amorim.",
      "The former Real Madrid manager has long been linked with a move to United despite always publicly distancing himself from managing in England. Another manager who has been linked with the vacancy is Oliver Glasner, who is out of contract in the summer.",
      "However, speaking on Tuesday afternoon, the Crystal Palace boss played down links with the role. \"I am not allowed to bet,\" he said. \"My contract has one paragraph that I am not allowed to bet. And I don’t look at it.",

      "\"Ultimately everyone loses, particularly when you are sacking a manager partway through the season. It's very difficult to get an adequate replacement in.",
      "\"I am surprised it's happened this morning, I'm not surprised it's happened. I didn't realise it would happen so quickly. I did think they'd get through another couple of weeks and try and work out what to do.",
      "\"But obviously it's become that challenging internally that they decided to do it very quickly, which was a shock this morning when I heard the news at 10 o'clock.",
      "\"If you look at some of the performances in the last month, they've really been shocking. However, there have been some bright spots along the way.",

      "This comes despite Amorim hinting at limited January investment just days before being dismissed. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team for Wednesday's Premier League clash with Burnley, with a successor expected to be named later in the month.",
      "During last year's winter transfer window, United were relatively inactive. Ayden Heaven arrived from Arsenal's academy, followed later by Patrick Dorgu.",
      "The club reportedly have several targets, particularly in midfield, with players like Carlos Baleba and Elliot Anderson high on their wish-list. Current indications suggest a January splurge is unlikely, particularly with the club spending over £200million on new talent in the summer.",
      "That said, the Red Devils are expected to explore several possibilities, with various areas of the squad in need of bolstering. Here, we examine the latest transfer updates surrounding Old Trafford.",
      "While United may have to wait until the summer to make major investments, more creative deals could still be explored in the interim. One option involves RB Leipzig defender El Chadaille Bitshiabu, with L'Equipe reporting that the Red Devils could propose a loan with an option to buy.",
      "However, they are unlikely to be the only club interested. Bayer Leverkusen are reportedly considering a similar arrangement, Monaco are also in pursuit due to a defensive injury crisis and Lyon are said to be involved as well.",
      "There is a bigger complication, though. Earlier reports from Bild suggest Leipzig are unwilling to allow the young centre-back to leave in January, whether on loan or permanently.",
      "Bitshiabu returned from a hamstring injury in December but has only seen limited action this season. Just three of his five appearances have been in the league, with Castello Lukeba and Willi Orban ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "Bitshiabu's team-mate Yan Diomande's impressive start at RB Leipzig has seen him attract attention across Europe too, but a January move away also appears unlikely. Diomande joined Leipzig from Leganes in the summer and has quickly made an impact, notably scoring a hat-trick against Eintracht Frankfurt in early December.",
      "According to The Athletic, United are one of two Premier League clubs interested in him, with Tottenham also reportedly monitoring the Ivorian winger. Leipzig are expected to demand up to £86m, with several unnamed European clubs also showing interest.",

      "The jury is still out on Benjamin Sesko, who joined United from the Bundesliga side last window, while Timo Werner and Christopher Nkunku struggled to replicate their Leipzig form at Chelsea. Both forwards were eventually sold at a loss, with Werner returning to Leipzig and Nkunku moving to AC Milan.",

      "The only member of the first-team coaching staff staying at Old Trafford in the wake of Amorim's departure is goalkeeping coach Craig Mawson. The 46-year-old has been at United for six years, having joined the club from Wednesday's opponents Burnley in late 2019.",
      "Evans, who left his role as United's head of loans and pathway just a month ago, could return as part of the first-team coaching staff and might be back in time to be involved against the Clarets. He is expected to stay on until the end of the season.",
      "The centre-back retired at the end of the 2024/25 season after two spells at the club as a player and his knowledge of United is considered valuable. Evans played with Fletcher, who will get a chance to show his credentials this week after stepping up from his role as Under-18s head coach.",
      "Fletcher was a first-team coach under Erik ten Hag and had previously served as the technical director at United. This is his first experience in management, and as a result, the club are weighing up the appointment of a more experienced caretaker until the end of the season, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick among the names in contention.",
      "Solskjaer recently left his job at Besiktas and Carrick is out of work after leaving Middlesbrough. Both have more experience than Fletcher having been in the Old Trafford hotseat before.",
      "Fletcher will hold his first press conference at the later time of 5pm on Tuesday. United sought Premier League approval to push the press conference back, with league guidelines usually insisting press conferences should start no later than 1.30pm the day before the game, or on a Friday if it is a weekend fixture.",
      "Fletcher is keen to get his feet under the table today and sort out the identity of his staff and plans for the trip to Turf Moor, before then undertaking his round of media engagements.",

      "Imagine the memes if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is pictured at Old Trafford in the next week or two, scarf above his head, club crest on his breast pocket and nostalgia in the air once again. It would be a social media field day for opposition supporters.",
      "But that wouldn't necessarily make it the wrong call. In fact, for a club looking to stall its decision on another permanent manager until the end of the season, it might be the really obvious one. And Manchester United have learnt their lesson when it comes to turning Solskjaer from interim to the king of the castle.",
      "This week, Darren Fletcher will get his go. The midfielder with 342 appearances to his name will follow in the footsteps of Solskjaer, Michael Carrick and Ruud van Nistelrooy as former players to get a go in the dugout in recent years.",
      "Fletcher knows the club inside out. He spent 20 years at Old Trafford as a player, has served as technical director, first-team coach, and Under-18s head coach. There isn't a nook or cranny of this place he can't navigate to.",
      "But this is his first time in the hot seat for any club, and it comes at a crucial time. United are three points off fourth and four points off 14th, so while the Champions League is within reach, so is the bottom half of the table. It would be a risk to leave a 41-year-old with no management experience in charge for the second half of the season.",
      "That makes someone with experience all the more appealing and Solskjaer ticks that box. For all the criticism thrown at the Norwegian, he has managed 471 games, of which 168 were at United. He has added to that experience with seven months in the goldfish bowl of Turkish football with Beşiktaş.",
      "He left that role in August and is available again. Solskjaer would be interested in returning to United in a caretaker role and his name is under consideration as chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox consider their next move.",
      "Solskjaer has experience of lifting a group following a mid-season sacking. He inherited a squad relieved to see the back of Jose Mourinho in December 2018, so the circumstances are a little different, but he showed his light-touch approach can pay immediate dividends.",
      "He won his first eight games as interim boss, and lost only one of his first 17, culminating in that magical night in Paris in March 2019. That made his appointment as a permanent boss a fait accompli. In hindsight, it was almost certainly a mistake, although his reign wasn't the disaster it is often portrayed as, and it stacks up well against what has followed since.",
      "Solskjaer's win rate of 54% is almost identical to Erik ten Hag's but is comfortably better than Ralf Rangnick's and Ruben Amorim's. He also guided United to second in 2020/21, reaching the Europa League final and the League Cup semi-final.",
      "The failure to get over the line and win a trophy was probably rightly held against Solskjaer. He lacked something that the very best managers have at the highest level. That runner-up finish also has an asterisk next to it, with that season played out in empty stadiums, which seemed to suit United.",
      "But it's also true that the progress he felt was coming was destabilised by the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo. It forced Solskjaer to rip up the tactical framework he had built. Solskjaer would never criticise a United legend and Ronaldo's legion of super fans would reject the idea, but it would have been interesting to see the evolution of Solskjaer's team without his signing.",
      "We will never know now, and when the end came, it was the right call. Solskjaer had run out of road and United needed a better, more experienced manager in charge. They still do.",
      "That might have to wait, however. It makes sense for United to make an appointment in the summer, when Marco Silva, Andoni Iraola, and Oliver Glasner are out of contract at Fulham, Bournemouth, and Crystal Palace, respectively, while Thomas Tuchel could leave England after the World Cup.",
      "The pool of potential head coaches will be greater in the summer and United should be able to land their man without paying compensation. If they need a safe pair of hands until then, Solskjaer's credentials are strong.",

      "Manchester United are on the hunt for a new head coach after parting ways with Ruben Amorim on Monday morning. In a statement, the club wrote: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United.",
      "\"Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May. With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change.",
      "\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"",
      "While Darren Fletcher has been named as taking over Amorim's duties for Wednesday's clash with Burnley, it remains to be seen as to whether the club will afford him the rest of the season before appointing a full-time head coach in the summer. Elsewhere, Michael Carrick and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have recently been touted as potential caretakers for the rest of 2025/26, with an update on the latter emerging on Tuesday afternoon claiming he had been 'sounded out'.",
      "Here, the MEN looks at all of the names which have been linked with taking up tenure at Manchester United as of recent, as well as the bookmakers' odds...",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is currently favourite to take up tenure at Manchester United. The Norwegian enjoyed a three-year stint with the club between 2018 and 2021 and has already demonstrated that he can hold his own in the Premier League. An interim or caretaker role until season's end is the most likely scenario, but it remains to be seen as to whether that would interest Solskjaer.",
      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has also been linked with being next in line for the United hot seat. The Austrian said of the role in September: \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is [to it] - neutrally and completely relaxed. Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Out of contract at Selhurst Park this summer, a move to United any sooner looks bleak considering Glasner's commitment to the club.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been handed the reins of the first-team for United's clash with Burnley on Wednesday. However, the club could afford him the rest of the season on an interim basis depending on how he fares this week, as they continue to search for a full-time appointment.",
      "Out of the managerial game since stepping down from the England national team last summer, Gareth Southgate has been linked with a role with the Reds for some time now. It is unknown whether he would be willing to step up in an interim job, or whether a permanent role would solely appeal to him at present.",
      "Enzo Maresca could be set for a return to Premier League management just a week after leaving Chelsea. The Italian head coach has a solid resume with the Blues, including a Europa Conference League title and last summer's Club World Cup win.",
      "An appointment for Thomas Tuchel is highly unlikely at present, considering the German is currently preparing to guide England to glory at the 2026 World Cup. However, his name has been put out there by the bookies.",
      "Mauricio Pochettino has also found himself highlighted as a suitable candidate to guide United to glory. The Argentine has experience in the Premier League with both Chelsea and Tottenham, although is currently tied up with the USA national team ahead of the World Cup.",
      "Michael Carrick has been out of a job since he was sacked by Middlesbrough last summer, and given his past affiliation with the Reds, could work as a caretaker until season's end. He has previously worked in a caretaker role, and will know what is expected by the board.",
      "Barcelona legend, Xavi, is another name which has been mentioned with regard to taking up a head coach role at Old Trafford. The La Liga legend has enjoyed managerial stints at Al Sadd and at the Camp Nou, but has never managed - nor played for - an English team.",
      "Currently in charge of Ipswich, who are third in the Championship standings, Kieran McKenna is also a bit of a longshot for the job. However, given he has previously worked at the club as an assistant to Jose Mourinho and Solskjaer, he could be a good fit should he have his head turned."

It has been over four years since the ex-Reds striker was sacked by United in November 2021 after a disastrous start to the season that culminated in a 4-1 defeat away at relegation-threatened Watford.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "The next step is to then proudly and openly tell a room of fellow adults about how the immediate instinct at any mildly important juncture in your existence is to discuss things not with your wife and family but your boss of at least a decade and a half ago, and for that room of fellow adults to somehow not burst into simultaneously uproarious laughter.",
      "This is not a particular dig at any of those individuals and their blind veneration of Ferguson, more the wider culture whereby Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada literally invited him over for coffee on Tuesday morning because Manchester United cannot get over the man who literally recommended David Moyes as his replacement – and nor does Ferguson really want them to.",

      "Despite all this, part-owner Jim Ratcliffe said in the summer that Amorim should be judged over three years but Owen believes there was always “scepticism” about the Portuguese boss.",
      "“With regard to problems Amorim had,” Owen said. “I think the one positive he had, was I think people liked him, the way he spoke and how he articulated things and how honest he was. And I think that was an absolute stark contrast to his predecessor, Ten Hag.",
      "“I actually think Amorim’s honesty and his take on things was quite refreshing, and he would quite openly say, This is the worst Manchester United team there’s ever been, and all these things.",
      "“So it’s quite refreshing when you see that from a manager. So that possibly is one of the reasons why he kept the job after some real dips, because his results at the end of the day, compared to any manager in the last decades, were worse.",
      "READ: Solskjaer told to block ‘absurd’ Neville and ignore shadow of Sir Alex…",
      "“So I think there was a little bit of that. And I also think there was a little bit of everybody thinking, we can’t just keep changing the manager. So people were willing to give him even longer.",
      "“However, I do think behind the scenes, there was scepticism. I do think the results, I do think the system and the way he was reluctant to change had a big bearing on that. I do think that probably the powers above him were not convinced. Once he was going to step out of line, let’s say, in this situation, it almost gave them the perfect excuse to say ‘right, well, we weren’t happy anyway, so this is the perfect time to do it.’ I think that’s what happened.”",
      "For those reasons, Owen said he was not “surprised at all” by the decision and linked it to Enzo Maresca’s departure from Chelsea.",
      "The former Liverpool and Manchester United striker added: “I think both scenarios, Maresca at Chelsea and Amorim at Manchester United, both almost happened quickly. A week before, there was nothing.",
      "“In the lead up to the game against Leeds, I was doing the game on TV, and all the chat behind the scenes was, Amorim, there’s been a big bust-up. So I knew before the game that this could escalate rather like it did with Maresca. And of course, in many ways, it’s a very similar scenario.",

      "“Now there’s plenty of different departments that all need to be happy. So, yeah, it did happen quick, but I wasn’t surprised at all. I was a little bit surprised with what he said after the game, but I knew that there was trouble behind the scenes. But as soon as he said it, I wasn’t surprised that it ended quickly. You simply can’t say things like that about your team, about your employers, about anything, and expect to last.

It’s eventually you can’t hide behind results and his weren’t good enough,” he exclusively told F365, courtesy of casino.org where he is UK ambassador, which helps players find the best casino online options in Britain. “Then obviously, the $64 million question is, to me, what type of manager? Who would you like to see go in there? Because it’s obviously going to take some type of manager to work under that system that they have at the club. They’ve tried the younger coaches.",

      "United seem quite unique in having a large contingent of club legends dominating the mainstream media, and even more unique that said contingent is so persistently negative about the club, typically under the banner of “that’s not how it was done in our day” (Carra, by contrast, is usually sycophantically praising of Liverpool, even during their recent dafter moments of player management).",
      "Amorim is not the first post-Sir Alex Man U manager GNev, Keane and Scholes have gone after – Solskjaer himself is basically the only one who escaped their more acerbic assertions, largely because “he is one of us”.",
      "It hasn’t seemed to dawn on them that “their day” has long been consigned to history, and that Modern Football, and indeed modern Manchester United, are unrecognisable from the swashbuckling-winger era that Sir Alex Ferguson presided over, with the kind of impunity that modern managers can only dream about. One can leave to their own imagination what the fall out would have been if, say, Jason Wilcox had told Ferguson in 2012 “we are not signing Robin van Persie for you because he is over 25”.",
      "One could also point out the absurdity of Neville and Keane in particular having such little sympathy for modern managers given how they both failed abysmally as managers themselves. Neville’s entire managerial career lasted less than six months with a win percentage almost as low as Amorim’s, while Roy Keane torched bridges with the same aplomb he perfected in the back-end of his playing days. Club legends they may be, but experts on football management they are not.",

This hardly constitutes a different approach for Manchester United.",

There are 0 world class players at United and barely 5 above-average players at United”. Now, let’s ignore the Hojlund and Garnacho elephant in the room, that leaves 3 above-average players at United according to Aman.",

I’m guessing Aman doesn’t rate Dorgu or Sesko (because he comes across as that type of impatient supporter) and perhaps rates the others on a par with Bruno (remember “above-average”). That means that he doesn’t think most of our defence or midfield is good enough to be playing for United. Yet here he is, harping on about how good managers should be able to get players to perform their best, and suggesting this squad (remember, only a handful are “above-average”) should be doing better.",
      "In terms of results, we are joint 5th in the league, our attack is 3rd best. There are 5 teams above us who are at least a couple of years ahead in terms of squad building. How much better should we be doing? By your own admission the squad isn’t ready to compete. Money has been spent on the attack and it was working, in a season or two our MF and Defence would be stronger. Before this season started, had any Utd supporter been offered 5th, 3 points off 4th, with the 3rd best attack, at the halfway point they would have bitten your hand off.",

      "There are lots of words that used to serve a perfectly good and useful purpose. Words that had meanings that were understood and widely agreed upon. Now a great many of those words have had their specific meaning diluted and stretched and twisted beyond any lingering hints of usefulness, and that seems a shame.",

      "Two entirely predictable and normal things happened during Oliver Glasner’s most recent press conference at Crystal Palace.",

Four journalists have contributed, each putting forward four different names for who it should actually be: Zinedine Zidane, Roberto De Zerbi, Oliver Glasner and Enzo Maresca.",
      "That’s the opposite of agreement reached, if anything. You can’t have an agreement on who a new manager should be by all agreeing on one person who it shouldn’t be, surely. That way madness lies. We can all agree the new Man United manager shouldn’t be Donald Trump, for instance, but that doesn’t really get us any closer to agreeing on who it should be.",

      "There were many lows. I’m one of them who looks back at the lows more than the highs.",
      "The end at Watford, well you can’t get lower than that. I more or less knew at half-time, so my team talk was about enjoying the last 45 minutes together and giving their all.",
      "Some of them had stopped running, caring. But then in the second half we played well.",
      "Donny [Van de Beek] came on and scored. We should have scored more. Then we got a sending off. 2-1 until the 94th minute. It sounds really bad that it was a 4-1 defeat. It was bad to lose against Watford but it wasn’t a 4-1 game.",
      "And there’s a very good reason why he never mentions Amorim at all. And that’s because these quotes have come from an interview Solskjaer gave to The National in February 2024.",
      "That is, several months before Ruben Amorim was appointed Man United manager, never mind sacked. If he had said what that headline says he did, there would be far graver concerns than the tish and fipsy of the undeniable travails of being Man United boss. The very fabric of space and time would be under threat.",
      "Now. Does it really matter? In this specific case, maybe not. It’s a low-level mischief, really, a way to give a topical hook to some harmless old quotes – albeit that unbeknownst to the journalist tasked with reheating that old interview an even better hook would arrive before the day was done.",
      "But it will never not make us uncomfortable. And the fact it’s all for something as small and twatty as this is worse, in a way, because it just seems even less worthwhile opening up the dangers that lurk in a world where we entirely give up the idea of having to accurately quote the actual words people actually said when they actually said them.",

They might have lost, they should have won, but I think they drew.",
      "The post-match talking heads on Sky were of course ready with their knives out and a glint in their eye, relishing the opportunity to lay in to Arteta. No style, no system, no creativity, and he’s too much of an obnoxious personality. At this stage, Arteta was flailing about angrily on the touchline and discarding superstars like Aubameyang and Ozil. As expected, they didn’t hold back.",
      "Of all people, Jose Mourinho was the guest pundit and, (years later I am very much paraphrasing this), he said something along the lines of “if you can’t see that Arteta is implementing a distinct system and the players that he chooses to play are buying in to it then you are blind”. The other talking heads kinda shut up, smirked, and politely agreed to disagree.",
      "My point is, and I don’t pretend to have a footballing brain the size of Jose Mourinho, but that’s pretty much the feeling I had about Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. Amorim didn’t inherit Fergie’s 1999 treble winners, he inherited Ten Hag’s mediocre band of misfits. Not a terrible side, but poor enough to get the previous manager sacked. Watching them play, the results weren’t great, and crumbs they were frustrating to watch at times (oftentimes they were hilarious to watch), but the longer I watched I could see that he was making progress, the system was taking shape.",
      "Football is always Ideology vs Results, and results usually win in the end, but I think Amorim was hired on an ideology which everyone could see would take a few years to get in place.

He could have worked with what he had to give the team the best chance to win and get points, and slowly progressed to his way of play once all the tools were in place. This is not a charity.

You failed to beat some of the bottom 5 teams this season. You are rubbish at your job.",

That the performances were turning around was more because of the inordinate amount of money and sheer inevitability of talent that brings than anything else.",
      "We’re frankly devastated you’ve binned him.",
      "The ‘trust the process’ structure that worked so well for Arsenal and Arteta works only if your promising young manager actually has the fundamentals and flexibility to thrive – if he doesn’t and that will become apparent relatively quickly, you absolutely need to get rid to not fall into a sunk cost trap. Whatever the ‘haha, second place bottler’ banter merchants like to think, everyone who came across Arteta at every point before and after Arsenal hired him, from his coaching peers and players to the board rooms could see he had the qualities and personality to become an elite coach, he has changed and evolved into one over his tenure and Arsenal are immensely lucky to have him.",
      "But he was able to succeed where Emery didn’t (and I have a lot to say on this if F365 wants to give me a run at a fan article like that West Ham chap got) mostly because Arsenal got their house in order behind the scenes and it is fair to ask, if you don’t believe United have that, whether anyone can succeed.",

      "…There has been a lot written about Ratcliffe, Berrada and Wilcox and their role in the hiring and eventual firing of Amorim. Reports suggest Wilcox and Ratcliffe had begun nudging Amorim on tactical details before the axe fell. Some see that as overreach. If you hire someone welded to a back three, why the surprise when he insists on playing that way?",
      "Initially, I had some sympathy for Amorim. But I think the story goes back to the hiring.",
      "After Ten Hag, the hierarchy clearly fell in love with Ruben Amorim. They liked his charisma, his record, his face, and believed he could be the poster boy for Manchester United for the next decade under INEOS. At the same time, Wilcox spoke about identifying a style of play that would run through the club. We know he favoured a 4-3-3, and it is hard to believe that did not imply a back four long term. United’s history of attacking wide players would hopefully have been part of that thinking as well. That clearly clashed with Amorim’s known devotion to a back three.",
      "My suspicion is that the job came with an understanding. Amorim could start with three at the back while he settled into the league, but over time the team would evolve into a back four. That is how United play, and he would be supported through poor results because this was meant to be a long-term project (something Ratcliffe would keep his word on, publicly backing him for three years in October). Amorim accepted, likely believing he could deal with the change later or even perhaps change their minds through results.",
      "After a year of consistently poor performances in the back three, Christmas was chosen as the point of evolution. AFCON and injuries gave the necessary caveats, meaning no face was lost on either side.",
      "The Bournemouth and Villa games showed improvement. Attacking patterns began to emerge quickly. Then United beat Newcastle and everybody was happy. The team was improving following a change from the coach, who had been supported well by the board. Big money deals to finally fix the midfield were mooted. Champions League was still in sight. You could see where it was meant to go.",
      "Then came Wolves.",
      "Against a historically poor side, Amorim either lost his nerve or pushed back against the hierarchy by reverting to the back three. It failed. United went in behind, he switched to a back four, the team improved immediately, and the game was there to be won. It was not. The damage was done.",
      "From there, reports of arguments and nudging from above made sense. If the agreement had always been to evolve over the Christmas period and Amorim had gone back on it while costing the team points, the hierarchy were entitled to challenge him.",
      "Leeds was the final straw. Persisting with the back three and publicly leaning into the manager versus head coach narrative felt like deliberate provocation.",
      "I think Amorim had been overwhelmed for some time. Fear and ego pushed him toward the system he trusted most. Changing formation while overseeing one of the worst United runs in modern history would have felt like admitting the hierarchy were right all along.",
      "It is easy to see both sides. A potentially generational young coach was hired with the understanding he would initially be supported before evolving the team toward a defined long-term identity. Amorim reneged on that agreement.",
      "And he was never the manager. He was the first Head Coach of Manchester United. Everyone knew that. Saying otherwise in public could easily have been seen as crossing a line. A profitable one for Amorim.",
      "I know it is fashionable to pile on Ratcliffe and Wilcox, but there is at least a chance they did most things right. They picked the right guy, backed him, and worked with him. But he managed to fuck it up.\nMatt",

      "What we are going through now is a transitory period that we have seen so many times before. My problem stems from the day Martin Edwards sold the club to the Glazers. Edwards pocketed the money, walked away and left millions of United supporters in deep trouble. He even has the brass neck to go back and watch games. There is no doubt that when those money grabbing carpetbaggers from America “STOLE” our club the rot well and truly set in.",
      "Then due to greed and incompetence the Glazers wasted all the money they pulled out of the club along with all the debt they placed upon it. So the club was put up for sale because the Glazers had become nervous of the future costs facing them. The stadium was falling down and they owed that much money they were never going to borrow the money for a new stadium.",
      "So what happens? That idiot Ratcliffe comes along and bails them out with over a Billion £’s. You can forget all the propagander about him being a lifelong United supporter. He isn’t. He tried to buy Chelsea first and failed. He tried to buy United but didn’t have enough money to do it. So what we have got is his third option, like most of the players he has bought, not top quality.",
      "He then starts to appoint his “Best in Class” people. Again not top quality. Barrada was at City who had an owner who just threw money at problems. That is why somewhere there are 115 charges to answer. Wilcox another ex City person who had one year at Southampton. Hardly a prime resume. Brailsford, that well known football expert who didn’t last very long. Another who didn’t last as long as Brailsford is Dan Ashworth. He tried to bring us Gareth Southgate. When you look at all these facts it is almost a criminal enterprise with all these false prophets.",
      "Now the conspiracy theorists have come up with another darker side to all this mess. This fact is true. Both Barrada and Wilcox have brought in numerous people they worked with at Manchester City.It is said the club is now rife with ex City employees.

      "No great surprise to see Man United’s far-reaching and widespread search for a former Fergie player to be interim manager dominate today’s proceedings.",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after back-to-back draws against Leeds United and Fulham.",

      "Ruben Amorim has somehow managed to contrive a scenario where he leaves Manchester United with reputation intact despite quite possibly being their worst manager ever. It’s a neat trick for sure, almost as neat as his penchant for turning corners that never led anywhere other than another blind alley or cul-de-sac.",
      "But enough of Amorim. He, like so many other poor hapless souls, is now part of Manchester United’s past. Who is their future? Who is the next manager for the impossible job? The one who this time will definitely be the man to return them to the promised land and then not in fact do that?",
      "According to the latest – and at this point ever-changing – prices over at oddschecker.com, it’s one of these guys. Gentlemen, the very best of luck to you.",
      "",
      "He somehow made Aston Villa the third best Premier League team of 2025 while battling PSR issues. He probably deserves another crack at a massive club, if he can be arsed with the pressure.",
      "We can see this one happening but is the timing right?",
      "",
      "According to reports in Spain: ‘At Manchester United, some directors believe that Xavi could be the ideal man to rebuild the team, especially since his style of play resembles what they have been looking for since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.’",
      "The former Barcelona coach has been out of work since leaving Barcelona at the end of the 23/24 season, when it was reported that he was eyeing an ‘interesting’ club in the Premier League. And the one thing you can guarantee with United is ‘interesting’.",
      "",
      "Very strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen.",
      "Southgate has been pretty clear about feeling mighty comfortable about never taking another managerial job. That hasn’t stopped him being described as a “master of manipulation” and being tipped for the big job, mind.",
      "",
      "Man United passed up the opportunity to pounce on some Chelsea manager antics when Mauricio Pochettino became available. Will they take a different approach this time with another newly available former Chelsea man? He’s certainly among the best currently out of work.",
      "",
      "Only at Manchester United would we get a former striker last seen being terrible at Leicester City on the same list as the actual reigning Champions League-winning manager…",
      "",
      "Emerging news that the PSG coach wants to leave this summer for a new challenge catapulted him into the running for the Manchester United job. Now this would be a coup. Which means it’s probably impossible.",
      "",
      "Absolutely everything about Michael Carrick suggests he should be a very good football manager indeed. A thoughtful player – most notably of course for Man United themselves, which always helps – and now a thoughtful pundit. Unfortunately the bit in between where he was actually a football manager was less good.",
      "We remain powerfully unconvinced that impeccable Knows The Club credentials could override everything else. It would be a spectacular gamble. But we must also consider the possibility that United bring him in as a ship-steadying interim to get them through to the summer; if that happens and he takes charge of 10 games then he’ll be the ‘winner’ in the eyes of the bookies.",
      "",
      "The former Man United midfielder has been named interim boss and that’s always significant. One, because you can never entirely rule out the possibility of him going Full Solskjaer and getting the job on a full-time basis anyway, but as we noted when considering Michael Carrick’s appeal also because as far as the bookies are concerned if he takes charge of 10 games he’ll be settled as a winner regardless of whether he actually gets the full-time gig or not.",
      "Worth also remembering here, of course, that United have a lighter fixture load than normal with no Europe, so it will take longer than might usually be the case to rack up 10 games.",
      "",
      "That FA Cup win with Crystal Palace has taken the Austrian high up all the lists, and now to the top two on the silliest of all. Seems harsh on him, really. In the specific case of this silly club, it helps that he plays the same system as Manchester United. Or maybe it doesn’t, who knows anymore? We think this might be his XI should he arrive in the summer…",
      "",
      "Has reportedly thrown his hat into the ring for a second stint, but only as an interim until the end of the season. United could do worse. So could we. A lot worse. Frankly, we are giddy about this. And it looks very much on.",
      "Man Utd refused to buy seven players requested by Ruben Amorim during the Portuguese head coach’s time at the club, according to reports.",
      "Amorim’s departure looked to be a quick one but Michael Owen bellies there was always doubts behind the scenes.",
      "No great surprise to see Man United’s far-reaching and widespread search for a former Fergie player to be interim manager dominate today’s proceedings.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Dan Ashworth might have celebrated after Ruben Amorim was sacked by Man Utd, but Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox are in trouble.",
      "According to reports, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has indicated his ‘decision’ to INEOS as he is desperate to return to Manchester United.",

      "Well, it’s back to the drawing board for Manchester United after they finally cut ties with former *head coach* Ruben Amorim.",
      "It may have come at least a few months too late, but INEOS have finally made the right call to part company with Amorim, who admittedly forced their hand with a sack ultimatum relating to January signings.",
      "Amorim is the worst Man Utd boss post-Sir Alex Ferguson, but his demise follows a familiar trend set by previous managers, with mid-season exits leading club chiefs to the interim route before they make a permanent appointment in the summer.",
      "This time, however, Man Utd will be making not one, but two, interim appointments. Current boss Darren Fletcher is due to be replaced by a more suitable temporary, who could end up being fellow club legend and former manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.",
      "We must respect INEOS for providing such entertainment by going for the most convoluted and thus funniest route with replacing Amorim, which would become even better if Solskjaer, once he’s back at the wheel, goes the whole hog with his full circle moment by maintaining his current 74% win rate as caretaker to leave Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co. with no choice but to make him United’s permanent boss once more.",
      "This would be the dream scenario for neutrals (and certain Man Utd legends stuck in the past), but INEOS will probably think better of keeping Solskjaer (or another interim) beyond this season.",
      "Instead, they are said to have already drawn up a list of permanent options, with their shortlist said to be led by Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner, who is their ‘top candidate’.",
      "READ: ‘Ruben Interim’ sacked by Man Utd: The inside story of the inside stories, from Wilcox to ‘crazy’ Martinez",
      "Glasner is certainly deserving of a job of Man Utd’s stature following his stellar work at Crystal Palace, and the imminent expiry of his contract would make for a seamless appointment.",
      "The respected Austrian also happens to use the same formation adopted by Amorim and has found a way to make it work in the Premier League to a greater degree.",
      "So, assuming that Glasner is appointed in the summer and that he continues to use a 3-4-3 formation at Man Utd, what would be his starting XI next season?",
      "Well, starting with an easy one, summer signing Senne Lammens would *obviously* remain Man Utd’s No.1 because his fine start to the season has quashed any remaining hopes held by outcast Andre Onana of being handed a reprieve by a new manager.",
      "In front of him, Man Utd have a wider breadth of options at centre-back than in other positions, so it is certainly feasible that they also do not strengthen in this department in the summer.",
      "Therefore, the current cream of the crop would continue under Glaser; Leny Yoro as the right centre-back, Matthijs de Ligt in the middle and Lisandro Martinez on the left. This strong trio would also benefit from Glasner not following Amorim in needlessly tinkering with his back three…",
      "The situation is more complicated at wing-back, and it could see Man Utd pull off a double raid on Crystal Palace to sign £26m-rated Daniel Munoz, thus handing the 29-year-old his “dream” transfer.",
      "Munoz’s immense form at Palace over the past 18 months, as one of the standout natural wing-backs in the Premier League and Europe, indicates he’s capable of making the step up. He would also be an affordable fix for Man Utd as a no-brainer signing.",
      "On the other flank, it would make sense for Glasner to stand by Patrick Dorgu, who was signed as a long-term project and solution to Amorim’s wing-back headache on the left.",
      "Dorgu has not been without his issues at Man Utd, and he is still raw, but he has been one of their better performers in recent weeks, albeit in a different role, and could easily end up realising his potential working under a world-class head coach.",
      "Onto central midfield, and a key reason why Amorim’s 3-4-3 system failed at Man Utd was that he never had the right blend in the middle of the pitch, though this area is set for a revamp in the coming months.",
      "As good as he has been for Man Utd, Fernandes has been somewhat hamstrung in the deeper role alongside Casemiro; he should be sacrificed one year later than ideal as a Saudi Pro League transfer would fund the club’s summer transfer business, while the veteran Brazilian is primed for a bit-part role if he accepts a contract extension on reduced terms.",
      "In their place should and potentially will be Kobbie Mainoo and £100m signing Carlos Baleba.",
      "Mainoo is rightly already being touted as the big winner of Amorim’s demise, and he will be relishing the prospect of an overdue fresh start, while all reports indicate that Baleba remains the most likely candidate to be Casemiro’s long-term replacement in the No.6 role.",
      "Then, like with Lammens, the starters in the No.10 positions are easy to select, with Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha making these spots their own since arriving in the summer.",
      "Mbeumo and Cunha have been head and shoulders above the rest of Man Utd’s attackers this term and are natural fits for the No.10 role in Amorim and Glasner’s system, and they would no doubt blend nicely with Marcus Rashford if/when he returns.",
      "With Amorim being a principle reason why Rashford is not currently playing for Man Utd, it’s hardly surprising that reports of a summer return to Old Trafford for United’s academy product are already circulating.",
      "Rashford’s form for Aston Villa, Barcelona and England has made Amorim look rather foolish, but given the Spanish club’s renowned financial troubles, Amorim-less Man Utd are perhaps the forward’s most likely destination next season.",
      "And he can return to Man Utd stronger for his experiences elsewhere and probably start ahead of struggling striker Benjamin Sesko.",
      "READ NEXT: Man Utd need to forget ‘saviour-manager’ quest and look at Howe and Southgate",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford and other members of the ‘bomb squad’ at Old Trafford will still leave despite Ruben Amorim’s sacking, according to reports.",

      "Marcus Rashford is now ‘highly likely’ to return to Man Utd in the summer after Ruben Amorim was sacked by the Premier League club, according to reports.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo and Dan Ashworth might have celebrated after Ruben Amorim was sacked by Man Utd, but Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Jason Wilcox are in trouble.",
      "Amorim was finally shown the door after 63 largely forgettable games in charge at Old Trafford, with the beneficiaries and casualties of his demise fairly easy to delineate.",
      "",
      "When Amorim referred to Mainoo as “the future of Manchester United” in December, he added that the England international simply “needs to wait for his chance and everything can change in football in two days”.",
      "Mainoo, at a crucial period in his development, had already sat tightly enough for an opportunity which was not forthcoming. Not 18 months have passed since he started a European Championship final, which itself came a few weeks after his match-winning turn in the FA Cup final. Yet only against Grimsby has the 20-year-old been entrusted with longer than 45 minutes in any game this season.",
      "Through such curious treatment Mainoo has kept his counsel – and for one regrettable exception ensured his entourage did the same – with a clean slate post-Amorim surely his reward.",
      "No-one stands to benefit more from the departure of Amorim than the gifted academy graduate whose overdue invite back in from the bitter cold can help address glaring problems in that Manchester United midfield.",
      "It is thought that he could ‘benefit most’ from the interim appointment of Darren Fletcher in what will presumably be a short-term arrangement, with “the future of Manchester United” finally allowed to play a part in the present again.",
      "",
      "It is exceptional work that of the ‘hell of a brains trust’ held responsible for appointing Amorim at Manchester United, the only dissenting voice was dispensed with over a year before his concerns over the suitability of the Portuguese were fully realised.",
      "A penny for Ashworth’s thoughts would be a drop in the ocean considering the £4.1m pay-off he landed after serving a longer period of gardening leave at Newcastle than he did actually working in the fabled Old Trafford power structure.",
      "That difference of opinion over whether Amorim was the best possible fit was ultimately his undoing. Ashworth suggested there might be better appointments out there than a tactically obstinate coach whose ideals clashed with the composition of a squad which could hardly afford to have more money spent on it, especially in the middle of a season.",
      "INEOS disagreed, ousted their sporting director, spent around £250m on signings for Amorim and then sacked him while Ashworth was settling into his new role in charge of ‘strategic oversight’ and ‘building long-term systems’ at the FA, where he established his reputation for precisely the sort of structure-led executive vision Manchester United need – the kind they had and ignored.",
      "",
      "“The Club” might never have been as thoroughly, fundamentally “known” as by the former player, ambassador, reserve team and first-team striker coach, caretaker and full-time manager who has represented them on the pitch or in the dugout 534 times.",
      "It should be with an acceptance that Rio Ferdinand cannot propose, regardless of results or performances, that Solskjaer is offered a blank contract to fill and sign. And that Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt are legally prevented from referring to the Norwegian only by his first name.",
      "But Manchester United absolutely have to put Ole at the wheel again. If for no other reason than the fact Darren Fletcher is taking his turn, Ruud van Nistelrooy had one last season and Ryan Giggs has to be skipped over, even if doing so is as hard as a totem pole.",
      "It is already shameful that Manchester United are back in the same sort of position Solskjaer inherited seven years ago, so they really might as well make the best of it.",
      "And after 14 months of sacrificing their modesty, pride and dignity at the altar of a stubborn philosophical and tactical egotist, Manchester United probably do need a supporter to stroke their hair, tell them they’re beautiful, wait on them hand and foot and regale them with stories about “Sir Alex” for half a season.",
      "It is objectively hilarious that Solskjaer finds himself as the saviour rushing to help someone he actively knows doesn’t see him in the same way, but also completely fair play because it guarantees someone who has previously only ever managed Molde, Cardiff and Besiktas semi-regular work at Manchester United.",
      "",
      "It is almost two years since they sold a 27.7 per cent stake, and with it control over football operations at Manchester United, and it genuinely feels like the Glazers would not have made half as many atrocious decisions.",
      "",
      "He got to do the ‘three trophies’ thing again! Genuinely chuffed for him. But slightly worried he didn’t refer to his greatest career achievement of finishing second.",
      "",
      "There is an argument to suggest Amorim is better off now than at any previous point over the past year or so.",
      "He has certainly somehow engineered a situation whereby taking Manchester United to 15th, bottling a major final against Spurs and spending hundreds of millions to continue overseeing really quite turgid football has nevertheless not damaged his reputation nearly as much as it should, and that he has been as much a victim of the club’s mess than a culprit.",
      "But this can only have been a chastening experience for a man who was among the world’s most promising, exciting, charismatic and captivating young coaches upon his appointment at 39. When Amorim turns 41 at the end of January it will have been a hell of a paper round.",
      "And consider this list of the roles the permanent post-Ferguson managers sacked by Manchester United took up next:",
      "Real Sociedad (six months later)\nNetherlands (five years and two months later)\nSpurs (11 months later)\nBesiktas (three years and two months later)\nBayer Leverkusen (eight months later)",
      "It is bleak reading for a manager who could have had his pick of jobs had he called Omar Berrada’s risible bluff.",
      "",
      "Take your pick of damning quote.",
      "For some, it’ll be the one from October when Ratcliffe said “Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years,” before sacking him within three months.",
      "Back then he said “football is not overnight” and that “we have to be patient, we have a long-term plan, it isn’t a light switch and you can’t run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions”.",
      "Manchester United are fifth in a form table since those comments, which were made when they were 10th.",
      "Others might prefer Ratcliffe’s “best in class, 10 out of 10s” description of those he wanted to put in key executive roles at Old Trafford, which currently include a director of football whose only previous experience in such a job came in a single season in the Championship with Southampton.",
      "In that same interview Ratcliffe did also say that INEOS had “made mistakes in football so I’m really pleased that we made them before we arrived in Manchester United” so it really might be that one.",
      "But there is also an argument for when Ratcliffe said the Manchester United shot-callers would decide “what the style of football is and that will be the Manchester United style of football. And the coach will have to play that style,” before specifically appointing a coach who did not play that style.",
      "Ratcliffe has made an absurd number of gloriously bad calls while sat in the big chair; that he has done so while furiously messaging Wilcox about changing formation and playing Bryan Mbeumo at wing-back makes it no less hilarious.",
      "",
      "And to the man himself, who wields an inexplicable degree of power at one of the biggest clubs in world football because billionaire owners see ‘Manchester City’ on someone’s LinkedIn and automatically believe they have found a cheat code everyone else has overlooked.",
      "Wilcox was academy director at the Etihad for six years and director of football for Southampton in the Championship for one, before he was given the keys to the Manchester United clown car and some scribbled directions which read ‘Step 1, spend millions. Step 5, knock everyone off perch’, with the middle pages torn out and eaten by David Gill.",
      "Of course, Wilcox was a player and coach before that. In fact, he referred to himself as “a coach at heart” during a Q&A in September, adding: “That’s a strength in my role now but also causes me a bit of a problem because I always want to interfere in what the managers are doing.”",
      "The explosive meeting which effectively sealed Amorim’s fate can only really be viewed through that prism.",
      "And while those inside stories on the Portuguese’s demise underline how Wilcox has inherited Ed Woodward’s contacts book and innate control over the narrative – the importance of which should not be overlooked – they also emphasise how inextricably tied he is to Amorim’s appointment, failure and sacking, and how Manchester United picked a 3-4-3 fundamentalist before turning against him for playing too much 3-4-3.",
      "It is one thing backing Russell Martin for a second-tier promotion push and adorning him with a few Premier League loanees and Manchester City academy alumni, and entirely another making decisions designed to help actual Manchester United navigate their way through a crippling decade-long identity crisis to become legitimate elite trophy contenders again.",
      "Wilcox must have discovered that post-haste, not that he will say so publicly. Not that he will say much at all publicly, unless Manchester United are doing vaguely okay.",
      "That was the case around the time of Amorim’s one-year anniversary in charge when, in the midst of a genuinely unprecedented run of three Premier League wins and a draw, Wilcox implored the club to “continue to build the spirit, continue to build on Ruben’s idea. Ruben has got a very clear idea. It’s a lot more flexible, the idea, than what people give it credit for.”",
      "Two months later, Wilcox was one of those who made the decision to sack Amorim in large part because of an inflexibility over his ideas. He will not be able to avoid the axe covered in his own fingerprints forever if the next appointment isn’t a success.",
      "",
      "The streak goes on. De Ligt will still never have started consecutive professional club seasons under the same head coach until 2027/28 at the earliest.",
      "To have had 18 different managers at the age of 26, and to have made more than 42 appearances under only one by virtue of having worked with them at two clubs, is remarkable. At this point it’s De Ligt’s responsibility to maintain that until he retires.",
      "",
      "Fewer spaces, innit? Although they won’t be habitually subbed off on the hour of every game so that’s something.",
      "Manchester United seem likely to go for the caretaker manager option, so we have made things a little easier for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Michael Carrick.",
      "Man Utd refused to buy seven players requested by Ruben Amorim during the Portuguese head coach’s time at the club, according to reports.",
      "Amorim’s departure looked to be a quick one but Michael Owen bellies there was always doubts behind the scenes.",
      "The past is Man Utd’s biggest problem with ex-players and ex-managers dominating the narrative. They should all be blocked.",
      "No great surprise to see Man United’s far-reaching and widespread search for a former Fergie player to be interim manager dominate today’s proceedings.",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after back-to-back draws against Leeds United and Fulham."

      "Now, two more managers have got new January jobs but identifying a clearly achievable goal for either is a far harder task than with Moyes at Everton.",
      "Liam Rosenior has been given a laughable six-and-a-half-year deal at Chelsea having swapped desks in the BlueCo organisation while Darren Fletcher has been handed the reins at Manchester United, albeit it on a temporary basis.",
      "Keeping the seat warm for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is some mission.",
      "Those two jobs are some of the most coveted in England and the world, but which is more appealing? Here’s a look at what Rosenior and the new United boss faces.",
      "",
      "Let’s start with Chelsea.",
      "The Stamford Bridge club are owned by BlueCo, a primarily US-based consortium that was founded in 2022 to purchase Chelsea after Roman Abramovich was forced to sell. They are a multi-club group ownership having also purchased Strasbourg in 2023.",
      "The chairman, and most public figure, is Todd Boehly while Behdad Eghbali is among the directors. While Boehly is often the man blamed for Chelsea’s latest mess, Eghbali is the one calling the shots and reportedly the man who was in constant disagreement with Enzo Maresca.",
      "The MO of BlueCo has always been to buy some of the best young players in the world and then give them long contracts to amortise the costs and comply with PSR. Since BlueCo took over in 2022, no Premier League club has spent more money with around £1.49bn spent.",
      "Given BlueCo only took over in 2022, the ultimate end goal of that project has yet to become clear. Are they looking to sell these players on for profit? Or do they believe they can win Premier League titles in three or four years’ time?",
      "At Manchester United, things are not too dissimilar. In February 2024, Jim Ratcliffe’s INEOS spent £1.3bn to take 29% of the club away from the Glazer family. While the Glazers continue to sit back and watch the dollars flow into their bank account, Ratcliffe has taken over football operations.",
      "He appointed Omar Berrada as CEO, who previously worked for Manchester City owners the City Football Group while Jason Wilcox is director of football.",
      "It is with Wilcox that Ruben Amorim reportedly had mounting disagreements, particularly when it came to transfers and the team’s tactical set-up.",
      "While United’s hierarchy is perhaps not as dictatorial as Chelsea’s, it is expected that any new manager will have to appease Wilcox and Berrada if they are to stay in the job. United’s board also appear to cut their manager a bit more slack. Maresca left after saying he endured the worst ‘48 hours’ of his Chelsea career while Amorim was allowed a 15th-place finish, embarrassing cup exit to Grimsby and describing the team as the worst in the club’s history.",
      "",
      "Squad-wise, Chelsea are marginally better – look at the league table – but there are problems to be fixed for both sides.",
      "United’s is currently a mix of good but ageing players and young talents still lacking experience. Senne Lammens has shored up the long-troubled area of goalkeeper but the use of Ayden Heaven in recent weeks has highlighted how injury-prone United’s main central defenders can be.",
      "In midfield, both Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are not getting any younger and Amorim’s insistence on strengthening this area is what reportedly cost him his job. A new manager may have a higher opinion of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Up front, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo have brought much-needed freshness but Joshua Zirkzee and Benjamin Sesko remain unconvincing.",
      "For Chelsea, they play exactly like what they are – a young squad full of potential but lacking the experience to be consistent.",
      "Moises Caicedo is one of the best midfielders in the league along with Enzo Fernandez, while Estevao looks like a star in the making. Cole Palmer is a former Player of the Year but struggled in 2025 and they have a lot of good if not great options up front in Pedro Neto, Jamie Gittens, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap.",
      "At the back, it is very youth-focused with Tosin Adarabioyo being the oldest member at 28.",
      "All of that is to say that Chelsea’s squad have a lot of potential; it is just about how a new manager can get the best out of that and whether a more seasoned veteran is needed for others to flourish.",
      "MORE ON CHELSEA AND UNITED ON F365\n* Liam Rosenior is BlueCo’s Chelsea yes man, even if he absolutely insists he isn’t\n* Steve Bruce return request is why ex-Man Utd players are helping to keep the club trapped in purgatory\n* Man Utd ‘in favour of a new sporting director’ as Wilcox future becomes unclear after Amorim sack",
      "",
      "When it comes to history, there is no debate. Manchester United are one of the most successful teams in the history of football with the trophy room to show for it.",
      "Chelsea did win trophies before Abramovich’s takeover but they had only been league champions once before the Russian came in. The vast majority of their trophies, especially the more prestigious ones, have come this century.",
      "In more recent years, Chelsea have become the more successful club with two Champions League wins since United last won the trophy and the same number of league titles. A Club World Cup and Conference League trophy completed the set for the London side and there is a reasonable debate to be had that Chelsea have been the most consistently successful English club of the 21st century.",
      "But the lure of United, along with its millions of fans, is the possibility of being the first league-winning manager since Ferguson.",
      "Football managers have often got themselves into this position by having an unshakeable self-belief and so, even if there is plenty of evidence to suggest otherwise, they will believe they can be the one that ‘fixes’ United.",
      "Chelsea may be stronger on paper both in terms of squad and recent success, but it is that aspect that may sway a potential manager over to United.",
      "",
      "If you ask either club what their expectations are, the stock answer is ‘win the league’ because neither can be seen to be aiming for anything less. But in reality, a few spots below the top place would enable a manager to stay in post.",
      "Of the two, the bar would appear to be higher at Chelsea. They have qualified for the Champions League in five of the last seven seasons and so simply finishing top four is perhaps not good enough. For Liam Rosenior arriving in mid-season, ensuring that is a must for this campaign but that expectation will be raised next year.",
      "For a United manager, Champions League qualification, and the money that comes with it, would be a seen as success having done so just once in the past four years. Fletcher or Solskjaer stand a good chance of doing that with the club three points off Liverpool.",
      "How they go about that also comes with expectations. Chelsea have a mode of business that relies on a manager getting the best out of young players and so Rosenior will have to accept that. The good news is that they are willing to get their chequebook out, albeit not for established world stars.",
      "For United, it remains to be seen how much influence Wilcox and Berrada will seek to have post-Amorim with the Portuguese mostly given carte blanche. Until he didn’t. Transfer-wise, it seems to be a case of you will get what you’re given for both clubs.",
      "",

      "Roberto De Zerbi is very interested in becoming the next permanent manager of Manchester United, with sources indicating the Marseille boss sees the Old Trafford role as an ideal next step in his career – and we can reveal the Italian is ready to leave France at the end of the season if offered the job.",
      "The 46-year-old, who previously impressed in the Premier League with Brighton & Hove Albion, is said to be enthusiastic about a potential move. Insiders claim De Zerbi feels ready for a major challenge and is particularly drawn to the prospect of another stint in English football, where his attacking philosophy earned widespread acclaim.",
      "Manchester United‘s current approach plays perfectly into this scenario. Following the dismissal of Ruben Amorim after just 14 months in charge, the club has opted for an interim solution for the remainder of the season, delaying a permanent appointment until the summer. This timeline suits De Zerbi’s situation at Marseille, where he remains under contract until 2027, but would be open to discussions if a prestigious opportunity arises.",
      "However, they do face some competition as sources have stated that Tottenham have De Zerbi down as a candidate to replace Thomas Frank. The Danish manager will be assessed at the end of the season, and if they do not feel enough progress is made, Spurs could also be in the market for a new manager. The Italian is amongst the thoughts of those at the club.",
      "De Zerbi’s name, though, also carries significant weight within United’s decision-making structure under INEOS.",
      "He was interviewed by Manchester United representatives in 2024 as they considered alternatives to Erik ten Hag, highlighting long-standing admiration for his methods. That internal support persists, with sources suggesting key figures at Old Trafford continue to view him as a strong candidate capable of implementing an exciting, progressive style of play.",

      "During his time at Brighton, De Zerbi guided the Seagulls to their highest-ever Premier League finish and European qualification, showcasing his ability to maximise resources and develop players.",
      "Pundits have echoed this praise, while my sources now state he is seen as a top choice to succeed Amorim at Old Trafford alongside Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner.",
      "I reported on Monday how the Austrian was seen by INEOS as the outstanding choice to succeed the Portuguese. And while he too favours a three-man defensive line, he has shown more tactical flexibility and is not adverse to reverting to a 4-3-3 system, which many feels suits the players within the Old Trafford squad.",
      "While other names have emerged as contenders, De Zerbi’s prior Premier League success and existing backing inside the club position him prominently on the shortlist.",
      "For United fans frustrated by recent turbulence, the idea of De Zerbi’s bold, possession-dominant approach could signal a fresh era.",
      "As the club stabilises under interim management, all eyes will be on the summer when the pursuit of their next leader intensifies. Strong sources state that the feeling appears mutual – De Zerbi is ready and willing to answer the call.",

      "However, the 40-year-old’s dismissal has seen him offered a bucket-load of sympathy in the Portuguese media, with several publications directing their anger at both the players and those behind the scenes – and in particular Wilcox.",
      "Despite that, the removal of Amorim as manager appears to have come too late to prevent Joshua Zirkzee from pushing through his wish to leave Old Trafford.",
      "Per our sources, Roma have been informed by the Dutchman’s representatives that he still wants to move to the Italian capital, and with fresh talks over a deal planned this week."

Instead it’s always culture, identity, heritage. Anything except the people who are actually running the club.",
      "“This is Manchester United Football Club” gets repeated like it’s an argument in itself. It isn’t. Saying it over and over doesn’t magically fix years of bad decisions, poor structure, and constant churn. It just shifts the blame somewhere safer.",

      "United don’t lack identity. They lack people being honest about where the real problems sit.",

If Amorim is considering applying for a position at Morrisons, I’m not sure he’s ready to take that step up quite yet. After all Morissons is a fairly well run company with competent senior management. Amorim’s lack of experience dealing with competent senior management in the UK could count against him.",
      "In my opinion it would make more sense for Amorim to spend a year managing at a company like Snappy Snaps and then making the step up to Morrisons. There’s no way he could go straight from the Manchester United Clown Festival to working for a serious organisation like Morrisons. The senior management talent gap between Man U and Morrisons would be too big for him to negotiate at this stage in his career.\nBen Teacher",
      "",
      "It seems to me that there are two very clear truths in this latest chapter of the United show.",
      "Firstly, that the in-job performance of Ruben Amorim – over the entirety of his red devil reign – is irredeemably and unforgivably abysmal, and he should have been sacked because of that. In almost fifty league matches, he only won three times by more than one goal. He leaves with a negative six goal difference. That is hilariously bad, and should have seen any manager in world football – much less one at a ‘big club’ – looking for new work.",
      "Secondly, he’s clearly been fired not because of the above, but because he offended one or more snowflakes in the United hierarchy. And that’s the worst bit for me. We were told, after being at the whim of the Glazers’ utter disregard for football for a decade, that INEOS were serious people, who’d bring in best-in-class professionals. But the way this has transpired screams to me of insecure men who’ve been promoted above their ability and can’t take the finger being pointed back at them.",
      "Very few managers last even as long as he did. United as a club desperately need to get away from the ‘saviour-manager’ and just get a good coach in, who can make the most of what is available. There is not another Fergie out there. But that doesn’t mean that this team, and this squad, shouldn’t be playing much better and delivering much better results than it is.",

      "Man U are at least 2 managers away from anything close to their former glories, and have been since Ferguson left. It won’t happen for many obvious reasons, but they need 3+ seasons of something more like a Brentford/Brighton/Bournemouth style model to lay some stability and foundations for a proper rebuild before they start chasing elite managers/players. Had Amorim been a bit less wedded to his system, he might well have fit the bill here. They need to do it soon too, before they are forced to by those noodle and tractor partners finally removing their sponsorship deals.",
      "Ian H makes a good point regarding bulletproof and overly controlling hierarchies too, which brings me to my last point – I’ve heard Unai Emery’s name touted a lot today. Why would he leave a club that he has purring largely because he has Fergie-like levels of control, for 2026 Man U where he will have very little and an inferior squad?",
      "Sporting directors are a great idea in theory, but there’s a finite supply of managers period, let alone enough who are willing to cede that much control, fit whatever the chosen playing style is, AND bring success. Emery is living proof that something closer to the old ways can still work.\nRHT/TS x",
      "",
      "With the sacking of Amorim all attention is now focused on who is likely to be the next Man United manager. Several names have emerged including Xabi, De Zerbi and Glasner.",
      "I urge United to give due consideration to appointing Gareth Southgate. At this stage of the game, I can say with maximum confidence that nobody knows English football better than the man himself, that’s Southgate. He has acquired and exhibited thorough knowledge and understanding of the EPL, clearly manifest in his roles as player, club Manager and National team Manager.",
      "The point must further be made that Southgate has demonstrated flexibility, willingness and ability to make changes and deliver effective tactics, evident in taking England to the finals of the Euro competition. A sine qua non for achieving success in football is the relationship between the Manager and the players. The Manager and players interrelationships, by and large, impact the performance of the team.",
      "Needless to say that Southgate continuously and unabatedly established good rapport with the players he managed. The arrogance and stubbornness of some previous United managers never featured in Southgate’s management philosophy and practices. He is the right man for the job.\nProfessor (Dr) David Achanfuo Yeboah",
      "",
      "If some papers had Chelsea moving for Eddie Howe at the weekend, I wouldn’t be surprised if there is more noise about Utd moving for him as that makes more sense and would potentially be a decent fit.",
      "The time could be right in the summer for all parties to move on – Newcastle would like a manager to help them take the next step to the truly elite level, a lot of the squad are ageing and running down contracts so a rebuild is coming – after last summer I’d prefer if it wasn’t Howe calling the shots on transfers and we’re yet to see what the relationship with the new DoF will be.",
      "I’d rather Howe left on his terms than be sacked given what he’s done for the club – he’ll always be a legend. I’d love to see him develop and change at Newcastle and prove the doubters (including me) wrong but football rarely rewards romanticism.",
      "As a Newcastle fan I think we are at a tipping point where Howe will have lived long enough to become the villain. The majority of fans are onside but there is a growing minority who are now sensing that tactically he’s peaked and he cannot escape the blame for such a lot of money (£100m+) spent on dross like Ramsey and Elanga. His focus on building an entire team of athletes/runners with no guile or flair becomes more obvious with time, but he could achieve a real bounce at Utd and get them back up the table.",
      "Howe’s approach would suit Utd’s fans and to a large degree could work with the players they have. Cunha, Mbuemo and Sesko were all wanted by Howe in the summer so he has already done his homework and won’t need a massive squad overhaul.",
      "Howe’s man-management style could work at United who I don’t think have had since Ole a manager who was really in tune with the players. If Bruno F is onside he’s an excellent player and Utd have the kind of sh*thouses Howe likes to have.",
      "Where it gets murkier is whether the Utd players are prepared to work as hard as Howe demands, and whether they have the legs/athleticism to play this ‘Intensity is our Identity’ way. Howe will also want the kind of control he’s gained at Newcastle on transfers, which seems to be where Amorim eventually crossed the line to be sacked, but he wouldn’t need the root and branch change Amorim wanted.",
      "I don’t think Howe will move mid-season. Despite a lot of quite poor performances Newcastle are well placed in all four competitions – can progress in the CL to the play-offs, home draw in the FA Cup, tough two legged tie with City in the Carabao but they are not invincible, and a few decent results will see them climb the table quickly.",
      "If it were summer or end of season I could see this happening. It might still if Utd find an interim like Fletcher or someone else until May and then chase Howe in the summer.\nJames, Leeds",
      "",
      "Let the deluge of memes and bile flow but at the heart of it, Amorim has played Sirs Jim, Wilcox and Berrada like three tarnished magnets on a tactics board. And to the tune of a massive payout no less. An absolute masterclass of an exit… possibly inspired by what transpired New Year’s Day in West London or what unrequited opportunity could now beckon in East London (one Portuguese legend for another), who knows.",
      "Anyhow if he hasn’t already, Ruben could enter storied Manchester folklore by Robin Hooding some of that sweet, sweet bunce back to the soup lady and SAF and all the poor folks Ratcliffe kicked to the curb in the name of efficiency and club virtue.\nEric, Los Angeles CA (Just how springy is a Darren Fletcher bounce ?)",
      "",
      "With so many teams struggling to string together a run of performances (like Villa’s recent surge shows), it’s clear that even 6th place, only 4 points above 15th, is pretty underwhelming, given the summer investment and all that extra time to train and prepare while not playing in Europe. It’s hard to empathize with Amorim, who said earlier this season that he was the coach. He also said not even the Pope could change his mind.",
      "But you do have to wonder how much ‘meddling’ into team selection and tactics was coming from the shadows of the ‘back room’ staff. Especially those that never have to front up to the cameras. Apparently, it’s pretty common for Directors of Football to speak publicly in many other major leagues.",
      "Regardless, it’s such a poor look on the sports guru that is Sir Jim. All his marginal gains, by cutting staff, staff lunches, etc., while squandering millions on managers and sporting directors. Results looking pretty bleak for a ‘Top 6’ club. Nothing marginal there.",
      "When checking whether the ’new manager bounce’ is a thing, one report indicated it works in about 75% of cases, with teams averaging 1.4 to 1.8 points more over the next 5 or 6 games. If true, perhaps teams should change managers every 6 games.",
      "But for firing Amorim in essentially the same week as Chelsea canning Maresca will create such a wonderful litmus test of how these two basket-case clubs fare over the rest of the season. Chelsea has form (under the old regime) for replacing managers and continuing to excel. Utd, not so much – possibly a proper new manager slump. Interesting days ahead.\nPaul McDevitt",
      "",
      "I was disappointed to see a major absence in the winners and losers column this week: Mainoo.",
      "Surely, if anyone is a winner from Amorim’s delightfully acrimonious departure it’s him (and maybe Amad if he can be released back to an attacking role again). You’d have to expect that it means he can finally get games without having to go to Italy or Turkey where everything will come with an asterisk.",
      "Second – and while I say this with a wink, you know I want it too – Rashford. We know Barca will not be able to find the money for him, in spite of him being loved by Flick and doing good work. So when he comes back, maybe it’s to a manager that actually knows how to use him. Would boil so much piss of course, which is a bonus.\nBadwolf",
      "",
      "While I’m all for your clickbaity lists, ranking Erik Ten Hag fourth behind Solskjaer is interesting. I mean, everyone is entitled to their opinion and no one is denying that Ten Hag’s second season was awful and even the FA Cup fig leaf did not preserve any modesty, but factually – looking at win percentage – at 51.8% Ten Hag is only second to Mourinho and this includes results from his second season.",
      "A second season where due to injuries we started with 29 different back fours in 38 games in front of a new, error-prone goalkeeper. One might plausibly say that such intense disruption in defense in front of a goalkeeper who is new to the country, league and club prevented the goalkeeper from settling in and added to the nerves and confusion in an ever changing defence and the real question is with such chaos and negativity, how did he still manage to finish in the top half with 60 points (which incidentally is better than Amorim was on course to get with 31 points from 20 games)?",
      "Don’t get me wrong, Ten Hag wasn’t the perfect manager. I didn’t like his public criticism of Sancho, even if it was possibly merited. His reliance on certain players who weren’t performing was an issue and his scouting was mediocre.",
      "This said, during his second season the problems were massively overblown considering the injury crisis we faced and, where at other clubs leeway seems to be given for injuries, the circus surrounding Man Utd, the negativity, the constant will he/won’t he be sacked all took on a life of its own really and sucked the confidence out of the players.",
      "Ultimately, something needed to change and that change was the manager, but the idea that Solskjaer was a better manager than Ten Hag is absurd, especially when Ten Hag won two trophies compared to Solskjaer’s zero – the FA Cup Final being particularly impressive against league winners Man City.\nDaniel, Cambridge"

      "Man Utd had a number of players facing an uncertain future before Ruben Amorim's sacking and the change in the dugout raises the prospect of potentially more upheaval while also opening the door for others to fight their way back into the first-team picture at Old Trafford",
      "By Dan Khan & Zinny Boswell",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 14:36, UK",
      "Change is afoot at Manchester United after the sacking of Ruben Amorim - but what does it mean for their high-profile players? Here we assess what the future may hold for Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford among others.",
      "Few players are expected to be impacted by the exit of Amorim quite as much as the 20-year-old midfielder, who has been on the fringes this season and frustrated with his role under the departed head coach.",
      "Mainoo is one of the few players in the squad yet to start a league game this season and he faced an uncertain future at United because of Amorim's refusal to give him a chance which has been a challenging situation for a player so early in their career.",
      "The academy graduate asked to leave on loan in the summer in search of more playing time ahead of the World Cup but has never communicated a desire for a permanent exit which suggests he wants to stay and fight for his Old Trafford career.",
      "United have no intention of letting Mainoo leave - on loan or in a permanent deal - because there is a widespread desire for him to stay at the club and keep improving. Before Amorim arrived, Mainoo was a key player and scored in the FA Cup final win over Man City.",
      "Amorim insisted he rated Mainoo and put his struggle for minutes down to him competing with captain Bruno Fernandes to play as the more advanced of the two central midfielders in his 3-4-3 formation.",
      "The hope for many fans will be that common sense prevails, and Mainoo is restored to the midfield once he returns from injury. All the noises suggest both player and club want to continue together as long as he gets adequate game-time.",
      "Surely whoever takes over will not persist with the same shape quite so stubbornly as Amorim, which should in theory open the door for Mainoo to reinstate himself in the team. Then it will be up to him to perform.",
      "Amorim was also essentially the driving force behind convincing Fernandes to stay at United in the summer when Al Hilal tried to sign him. The Portuguese has also since revealed he was hurt by the club hierarchy's handling of that situation in the summer.",
      "In an interview with Portuguese media in November, Fernandes said he felt the club bosses wanted to cash in on him but lacked the courage to defy Amorim.",
      "That tallies with what Fernandes told British media in October, but nonetheless the decision to air his unhappiness with his employers so publicly raises questions about the state of their relationship.",
      "If Fernandes still feels unwanted or underappreciated come summer and another offer like the one from Al Hilal materialises there are no guarantees Amorim's successor will have the same ability or desire to convince the captain to stay.",
      "The Portugal international has said he will not talk to anyone about his future until after this summer's World Cup. By then United will hope to have a new permanent head coach. That appointment could be decisive for Fernandes' future.",
      "The 31-year-old's contract at United expires in 2027 and includes the option of an additional year. Fernandes has shown no signs of slowing down in his 30s but clubs tend to be more reluctant to offer long-term extensions to players of his age.",
      "The England international has revived his career on loan at Barcelona this season under Hansi Flick after Amorim exiled him at Old Trafford. That loan agreement includes an option for the Spanish club to sign Rashford for £26m but it remains to be seen if they will use it.",
      "Barcelona are delighted with Rashford's performances but are unlikely to discuss a permanent move until the summer. They still have financial problems and have to consider if the money is there to keep paying his wages in their entirety as well as the transfer fee.",
      "Rashford's future at Barcelona also hinges on what happens to 37-year-old striker Robert Lewandowski at the end of the season when his deal expires. The England forward's ability to play as a No 9 could come into the club's thinking around keeping him.",
      "Despite having more than two years left on his contract, Rashford remains unlikely to have any future at United. It remains to be seen how the player or club bosses might react if the next permanent head coach wanted Rashford back at Old Trafford.",
      "Everything seems to rest on Barcelona. United will hope they don't have to find the forward a new club once the summer transfer window opens with very few sides able to afford his reported £325,000-a-week salary.",
      "Roma are interested in the Netherlands international and have been preparing a proposal to take him on loan with an option to buy this summer but Sky in Italy are reporting that the change in the dugout at Old Trafford has slowed things down.",
      "Any decision over potential exits are expected to be pushed back until United make a decision over the head coach position - whether it be a permanent replacement or an interim until the end of the season - to let them evaluate the squad.",
      "Zirkzee struggled for game-time under Amorim this season and only regained his place in the team due to players being unavailable because of AFCON or due to injury but has remained patient and is seen as a positive influence in the changing room.",
      "Amorim's view that Zirkzee is more suited to being a No 10 than a striker has been one of the key reasons behind his struggles to get into the team with so much competition for those positions.",
      "If the interim head coach sees things differently that could open the door for Zirkzee to play more with Benjamin Sesko, the only out-and-out striker in the squad at Old Trafford, who is yet to nail down that position after a slow start.",
      "The Brazilian became one of Amorim's most trusted players after initially being dropped from the team entirely and with his contract up in the summer there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding his future.",
      "United do not plan to trigger the one-year option in Casemiro's contract because his wages are too high and do not fit into the structure they are trying to implement at Old Trafford.",
      "However, given his importance to Amorim there may have been more of a desire to find a solution and renegotiate his terms if the Portuguese had not been sacked. As things stand, there have been no fresh talks over a new contract.",
      "United's priority this summer is signing at least one top midfielder which is expected to push Casemiro down the pecking order at United and it remains to be seen how happy the 33-year-old would be to stick around to play less and earn less.",
      "Another big factor will be the view of the new permanent head coach on Casemrio. If nothing is agreed until the summer, the timing could see the Brazilian depart as a free agent before Amorim's successor even has a chance to make a call.",
      "Amorim's arrival was supposed to be good news for the Uruguayan given his success working with the Portuguese at Sporting, however it never worked out like that.",
      "Ugarte never regained the trust of his old head coach at Old Trafford and remains a peripheral figure. If things don't turn around for the 24-year-old under the interim in the second half of the campaign, he will have had two disappointing seasons at the club.",
      "That would put his future in further doubt with plenty of speculation already linking him with a potential move to Turkey in January.",
      "With so much upheaval at United this month, there is a realistic chance that Ugarte will get one more chance to prove himself, but it does feel as though time is running out for him.",
      "The 32-year-old centre-back is out of contract in the summer and so far there has been no clarity around what the future holds for him.",
      "Injuries have kept Maguire out for much of the season but he continues to show his worth when fit, most obviously with his winner at Anfield in October.",
      "The former United captain's resilience and leadership made him a valuable member of the squad to Amorim - but there is no telling how his successor will view Maguire.",

      "\"I best speak to Sir Alex.\"",
      "It has been a quick turnaround for the former United midfielder, who has spent the last six months coaching the club's U18s.",
      "After Monday's sacking of former head coach Ruben Amorim, he was asked by United's hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada, to take the first team's training sessions and prepare them for Wednesday, an opportunity Fletcher could not say no to.",
      "\"It was shock, pride, I best speak to Sir Alex [Ferguson] - they're the things that first went into my head.",
      "\"I phone Sir Alex on all the big decisions that I make in general really in football - his words echoed what my thoughts were, that you do what's best for the club and that's always been my intention.",
      "\"It's beyond my wildest dreams that I'd be sitting here leading a Manchester United team. It's been thrown upon me and probably a good thing because I've not had time to think.",
      "\"If it would have been said to me and planned I might have slept on it and things like that, so the fact it's been thrown on me has helped me to react quickly and do things that come naturally. Luckily I know the club, I know the people and I know the players.\"",
      "For Fletcher, he began his affinity with Manchester United at the age of 11. After having an illustrious career as a player winning multiple Premier League titles, a Champions League and FA Cup, he rejoined the club in 2020 and has had several roles since.",
      "Whether that was as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick's coaching staff, becoming a technical director when Erik ten Hag became manager or now coaching in the youth set-up, Fletcher has truly seen it all in recent years but his aim has always been a clear one.",
      "\"It's never been about me,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"It's always about me giving back, doing the best that I can to help everyone, help the players, club, staff. Help them become better, which ultimately will help Manchester United become better and that's always been my goal and responsibility since being back here.\"",
      "When asked what the mood has been like over the last few days among the first team during training, Fletcher described it as \"mixed\".",
      "It was only Monday morning they saw Amorim leave Carrington before Fletcher took charge. It is also easy to forget with the Amorim sideshow that this is a team who have not played truly well in a long time.",
      "Two wins in their last seven games - with some disappointing performances against the likes of West Ham and Wolves within that - December and January has felt like a tough period for these players with few highs other than a win against Newcastle.",
      "Despite Fletcher knowing many of those in the squad, he has tried his best to speak one-on-one with players he has not come across as much during his return to the club. Two of those included Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens.",
      "However, one player he does know well and was particularly close to Amorim is captain Bruno Fernandes. Fletcher thought it was especially vital to take him aside.",
      "\"I've got a great relationship with Bruno and is somebody who I respect massively. He's been unbelievable player for Manchester United and an amazing leader,\" Fletcher said.",
      "\"Like anybody, Bruno was disappointed. He wants to do well for every manager. Bruno has been disappointed when every manager he's worked with left the club and I know him and Ruben had a good relationship.",
      "\"But a bit like me, Bruno knows his responsibility as a captain - to help all the players, to help and do the best for the club. He is a great leader, a great sounding board.\"",
      "Although Fletcher does not know how long he will remain in charge of Manchester United - he admitted those conversations will happen after Wednesday night's game against Burnley.",
      "But regardless, Fletcher aspires to be a head coach one day and he has the opportunity to make a huge impression.",
      "Having sat in many of Amorim's news conferences, it always felt he cared more about the opposition than what his side would do to exploit them.",
      "I asked him after the 1-1 draw with Wolves why he reverted to a back three after a big win against Newcastle just a few days before with a back four, and he told me it was due to wanting to match Wolves with a similar system.",
      "That is not Manchester United.",
      "When it came to playing style, when Fletcher described how he wanted his side to play on Wednesday night, it was refreshing to hear perhaps somewhat cliché but key phrases like \"being positive\" and wanting his side to \"express themselves\".",
      "That is a United side we have not seen in a long time.",
      "Fletcher said: \"Football nowadays, formations are fluid in and out of possession in different phases, that's the way the game is played now. I want to see the players play with enthusiasm, energy and be really positive when they get the ball. Don't hide.",
      "\"That they play as a team, they play with togetherness, they play with spirit and energy of Manchester United - go express yourself and enjoy yourself and go and try and win the game. These are all the things that I'll be expecting from the players.\"",
      "It has been a chaotic week to say the least for those at Manchester United, but it was impressive to see how Fletcher handled his first news conference as a head coach and how he came across when I sat down with him.",
      "Whether it is just a one-time wonder for now or maybe the start of many, United seem to have a custodian of the club who just simply gets it.",

Burnley also sit bottom of the league for xG supremacy, posting a damaging -1.07 per 90. In simple terms, they're being comprehensively outplayed almost every week.",
      "Shot volume reinforces the same message. Burnley face more shots than any other Premier League team and concede more big chances than anyone else. This looks a fantastic opportunity for Manchester United's attackers to flex their muscles and the 7/4 with Sky Bet on them on the -1 handicap market looks an interesting angle to explore."

      "By Adam Smith and Nick Wright",
      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 11:16, UK",
      "Gary Neville has said the next Manchester United manager must suit the DNA of the club, so who fits the bill? As their hierarchy begin talks with prospective candidates, Between the Lines returns with a look at how their options stack up.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been put in caretaker charge as Manchester United search for a replacement for Ruben Amorim and Neville insists it's time to return to the club's traditions following a string of \"experiments\" after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "\"You can't say these managers are not good coaches but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies and none of them really fit the Man Utd way.\"",
      "So, with Oliver Glasner, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Enzo Maresca, Xavi, Mauricio Pochettino and Zinedine Zidane among the names being linked to replace Amorim, which prospective candidate's playing style fits best with the club's identity?",
      "Neville referenced a video circulating online in which Sir Bobby Charlton describes Manchester United's DNA. \"Adventurous, exciting football, playing young players, entertaining the crowd,\" he said.",
      "Charlton traces it back to Sir Matt Busby, under whom Manchester United won five domestic titles and a European Cup in the 1950s and 60s with a youthful side playing attacking football.",
      "Ferguson harnessed the same traditions as United emerged as the Premier League's dominant force under his management, using a front-footed approach emphasising wing play and quick attacks.",
      "The club moved away from those principles post Ferguson, typified by the appointment of a manager, in Amorim, whose devotion to an incongruous back three became a bone of contention.",
      "And Neville is adamant about what the next man should bring. \"Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "To create a template for Manchester United's DNA, we used 15 style metrics from Ferguson's final season in charge in 2012/13, when he secured the last of his 13 Premier League titles as manager.",
      "Manchester United's triumph that season was clinched in characteristically offensive style. Using a 4-2-3-1 formation, they scored 11 goals more than any other side, placing an emphasis on attacking speed, width and crossing.",
      "When comparing prospective candidates and selected managers by their numbers in the same 15 metrics in league games managed, it is former Chelsea and Spurs boss Antonio Conte who ranks as the best statistical fit for United's DNA.",
      "The Napoli boss, who has been previously linked with the Old Trafford job, has a suitability score of 78.89 out of 100, based on his work with Chelsea and Spurs, putting him just ahead of former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, who is currently managing the Portuguese national team.",
      "Stuttgart's Sebastian Hoeness is next on the list, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer fourth, with a suitability score of 77.74 out of 100. Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone completes the top five, just ahead of Chelsea legend Frank Lampard, now in charge of Coventry.",
      "Marcelo Bielsa, Carlo Ancelotti and Michael Carrick also make our top 10.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva is 11th and Aston Villa manager Unai Emery is 12th - just ahead of three other managers who have been linked with the vacancy in former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane, Mauricio Pochettino and England's Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Recently-axed Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca, who has also been linked, sits 20th in our list, with a suitability score of 67.52 out of 100.",
      "Pep Guardiola was a reported target for Manchester United before his appointment at Manchester City back in 2016 but interestingly, he sits bottom of our 32-man list, with a stylistic suitability score of just 50.77 out of 100.",

      "Manchester United sack Ruben Amorim in wake of rising tension at Old Trafford; Amorim dismissed after meeting with Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox; Darren Fletcher to take charge of United for Wednesday's game at Burnley; Amorim departs after 14 months in charge",
      "Tuesday 6 January 2026 19:53, UK",
      "Manchester United have sacked head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Amorim was subsequently dismissed following a Monday morning meeting with Wilcox and Omar Berrada, United's chief executive.",
      "United are understood to have concluded that Amorim's position had become untenable.",
      "Neville said that he was \"stunned\" that during the course of Amorim's reign, Man Utd continued to play so poorly in his back-three system. \"That's a failing upon the manager, the players and the club, in terms of not recruiting properly for it.\"",
      "He has called on Man Utd to now seek out a replacement who can play in the traditional style of the club.",
      "\"The experiments have got to stop. Man Utd have got to appoint a manager that fits the DNA of their club. Ajax will never change for anybody, Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don't believe Man Utd should change for anybody.",
      "\"The club have to find a manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking, aggressive football.\"",
      "Amorim sacked - more reading and in-depth analysis:",
      "Amorim, meanwhile, is understood to feel he was not getting the backing of the club hierarchy and is frustrated by what has happened.",
      "The repeated use of the word \"manager\" in his final news conference was significant.",
      "Amorim accepts that the results were not good enough and acknowledges that he had the worst win rate of any manager at United since Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "But he also felt confident that he could achieve Champions League football this season if he remained in charge and that their form would improve with the return of players from Africa Cup of Nations duty.",
      "Amorim felt United needed one or two experienced signings this January transfer window, in particular an experienced Premier League striker.",
      "Whilst differences of opinion over transfer policy wasn't the ultimate deciding factor in his departure, it did play a part in the breakdown of relationships with his bosses.",
      "Amorim felt that if he were given more resources now, that would guarantee Champions League football and even bigger financial returns. United's hierarchy have always been adamant they would not take that risk and will shun any return to short-term transfer decisions.",
      "Amorim has told friends he struggled to cope with the noise from outside the club, which he feels undermined the job he was doing.",
      "Whilst he is adamant that the job wasn't too big for him, he was surprised by how political and difficult the role is at Manchester United, and feels it is an impossible job to prepare fully for, because no one understands the unique challenges until they are in place at Old Trafford.",
      "The Portuguese coach feels he had less and less input into footballing decisions as time went on. Whilst he feels he always tried to be true to himself, he accepts that his often emotional response in front of the media was to his detriment.",
      "Amorim departs after 14 months in charge, with his final game the 1-1 draw at Leeds on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's dismissal was announced by Man Utd shortly after 10am on Monday.",
      "In a statement, United confirmed \"the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"",
      "Man Utd then return to Old Trafford on Sunday for an FA Cup third-round tie against Brighton.",
      "Amorim was appointed at Old Trafford in November 2024 on a two-and-a-half-year contract, which was due to expire in June 2027.",
      "But in an apparent pointed message to the Old Trafford hierarchy following Sunday's draw at Leeds, he said he saw himself as manager.",
      "\"I notice that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United.\"",
      "That outburst followed cryptic suggestions to the media just before Christmas that he had not received the backing he anticipated in the transfer market.",
      "\"I have the feeling if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3, we need to spend a lot of money and we need time,\" he said. \"I'm starting to understand that is not going to happen.\"",
      "Amorim subsequently fielded a back four for the first time in Manchester United's win over Newcastle on Boxing Day, but reverted to a back three for the dismal 1-1 draw against Wolves.",
      "The damning stats that contributed to Amorim's sacking...",
      "August 17: Man Utd perform well but lose 1-0 to Arsenal in the opening game of the season.",
      "August 27: Man Utd suffer a humiliating defeat at League Two side Grimsby in the Carabao Cup as Amorim is mocked for using a tactics board in the dugout.",
      "September 19: Amorim says \"not even the Pope\" could make him change system after overseeing their worst league start in 33 years.",
      "September 27: Pressure increases on Amorim as Man Utd are beaten 3-1 at Brentford, their third defeat in six league games.",
      "October 8: Sir Jim Ratcliffe says he wants to give Amorim three years in charge to prove himself.",
      "October 19: Harry Maguire heads in a late winner at rivals Liverpool to earn back-to-back wins.",
      "November 24: Man Utd's five-game unbeaten run ends with a 1-0 defeat at home to Everton as Amorim persists with a back three despite playing against 10 men for 75 minutes.",
      "December 15: Gary Neville hails Man Utd's performance in epic 4-4 draw at home to Bournemouth.",
      "December 19: Kobbie Mainoo must \"fight for his job, says Amorim, who hints at January transfers.",
      "December 26: Man Utd finally change system as Amorim deploys a four-man defence in a 1-0 win over Newcastle.",
      "December 29: Amorim says he couldn't change formation sooner because of \"media pressure\".",
      "December 30: Amorim reverts to a back three in Man Utd's next game, a 1-1 draw at home to rock-bottom Wolves, with Gary Neville saying the team has \"gone backwards\".",
      "January 4: Following their 1-1 draw at Leeds, Amorim claims that he joined Man Utd to be their manager, not their head coach.",
      "January 5: Man Utd sack Amorim.",
      "Tommyboyj98When is a manager going to be backed fully and allowed to leave his stamp on the club? Sacking and hiring managers every 18 months is a joke!",
      "PhilThe next Manchester United manager has to be Eddie Howe, you just need to look at the improvement and impact he has on players.",
      "OliCrazy decision from the Man Utd board. Had to feel like it was coming, though. Can't speak about the higher ups like that these days.",
      "BigTezWho to get is the issue - who would want it? Amorim was not good enough, full stop. But this board, Berrada, Wilcox and Jim also need to take responsibility for this shambles.",

      "Wednesday 7 January 2026 06:03, UK",
      "Liam Rosenior will watch his new team in action for the first time since being named Chelsea manager when they make the short trip to Craven Cottage to face his former club Fulham on Wednesday night. A watching brief, but there is little time to bed in.",
      "Chelsea have seven more matches to play in January even after this one, in four different competitions, with London derbies in both the domestic cups and a Champions League trip to Napoli thrown in. All while navigating the Premier League.",
      "It is called being thrown in at the deep end after stints at Hull and Strasbourg so perhaps taking the chance to watch this one from the stands is understandable, particularly after Chelsea picked up a memorable point away to Manchester City on Sunday.",
      "That last-gasp equaliser gives them a bit of momentum but Enzo Fernandez's scrappy finish was nothing compared to what Harris Reed treated the Cottage to earlier that afternoon. His even later leveller against Liverpool was a goal-of-the-season contender.",
      "Such drama is never too far away between these teams. In August, of course, Josh King had a goal controversially ruled out following an erroneous VAR check. How Fulham would love a measure of revenge by ruining Rosenior's return to take over their rivals.Adam Bate",
      "Ten games unbeaten. That is the run that Manchester City are on right now in all competitions; it is just that it does not feel quite so positive after their eight-game winning streak has ended with back-to-back draws, allowing Arsenal to pull clear again.",
      "The draw at the Stadium of Light, where Sunderland remain unbeaten this season, was one thing. Dropping two points in stoppage time at home to Chelsea was another. Pep Guardiola's side paid for their profligacy. It was sloppy. Not the mark of champions.",
      "But with Arsenal still to come to the Etihad Stadium in the spring, the onus is on City to regroup quickly and reduce the gap to three points ahead of the Gunners' game against Liverpool on Thursday. Beating Brighton at home - and preferably well - is now a must.",
      "While it felt like just a rare off night for Erling Haaland, it was perhaps a little concerning that the congested fixture list might be catching up with Rayan Cherki after his brilliant run of form. Maybe this is an opportunity for Guardiola to freshen things up in attack.",
      "Take liberties and Brighton can take advantage. After the ignominy of failing to beat West Ham twice in a month, they did win against Burnley last time out. Fabian Hurzeler's side came from behind to beat City in August. Do the double and it could be title race over.Adam Bate",
      "There is always a fascination with how teams perform after the exit of a divisive manager - sorry, Ruben, head coach - so there will be plenty of eyes on Turf Moor in one of the two later kick-offs on Wednesday evening where Manchester United return to action.",
      "Darren Fletcher has been appointed as United's interim boss, perhaps even interim to the interim boss. Will he take a minimalist approach to the role or overhaul the formation? Will he pick his son? Will he pick both sons? And will any of it actually work?",
      "In truth, Fletcher's options are limited given the list of absentees at United. He cannot even make the statement move of recalling Kobbie Mainoo with him out injured. But any kind of response to Amorim's departure - positive or negative - will bring intrigue.",
      "For Burnley, a club that now appears to be enduring rather than enjoying their Premier League return, this has to be regarded as an opportunity. Scott Parker did not like what he saw at Brighton last time out but United under the lights is a very different occasion.",
      "A record of two points from 11 games is the worst in the Premier League over that period. Burnley are still just about within touching distance of the teams above them but the turnaround will have to come quickly to save them. This would be a good time.Adam Bate",
      "Everton's mixed form at their new stadium continues after conceding four at home for the second time in four matches as they were beaten 4-2 by Brentford at the weekend. A repeat of anything like that against bottom club Wolves would spark serious scrutiny.",
      "David Moyes' side have actually picked up as many points away from the Hill Dickinson Stadium this season as they have inside it, their recent win at Nottingham Forest being their fourth of the season on the road. Doing it without Iliman Ndiaye was impressive.",
      "But if Everton are to bounce back then they will need others to step up, so amid the wreckage of that Brentford defeat it was encouraging that both misfiring strikers scored, while Jack Grealish bagged his first assists since August - against Wolves.",
      "That 3-2 win at Molineux feels an age ago now for the visitors, who are surely doomed for the drop. But Wolves boss Rob Edwards is entitled to feel a corner has been turned after a deserved point at Manchester United and that long-awaited win over West Ham.",
      "With teenage sensation Mateus Mane reenergising the Wolves supporters, it is Wolves who - improbably - come into this match with more momentum and certainly under less pressure. Back-to-back wins really would put Moyes' team under the spotlight.Adam Bate",
      "Crystal Palace are navigating a difficult period at the moment, with Oliver Glasner currently on the worst run since he was appointed to the role in February 2024 after going seven games without a win.",
      "The Eagles have plummeted from fourth place in the Premier League on December 10, to 14th as things stand following the 2-0 defeat to Newcastle last time out.",
      "Facing a high-flying Aston Villa, who are level on points with Manchester City in second, should fill them with dread but Palace can take comfort and confidence from their recent encounters with Unai Emery's side.",
      "Unbeaten in their last six meetings with Villa across all competitions, Palace have been a constant thorn in the side of Emery and addressing their current rut with a win at Selhurst Park on Wednesday could add to this trend.",
      "On paper, it should be a routine win for Villa against a team low on confidence and form. But football isn't played on paper.",
      "The Eagles are due a win and Villa should be wary of a familiar foe getting the better of them again.Patrick Rowe",
      "After a promising start to life at Tottenham, one that had Spurs up in third after taking 17 points from the first nine games, Thomas Frank appears to have lost his way this season. Perhaps he will share some wine - and that sentiment - with Andoni Iraola.",
      "At least Iraola has credit in the bank and slightly lower expectations to deal with. Frank is facing more immediate discontent at Spurs, not least because of the style of play. The hope was that they were getting a details man, someone who would improve set pieces.",
      "Not only has the rest of the Premier League caught up with Frank in that regard this season, but his Tottenham team are not doing nearly enough in open play. In fact, they have not even scored a goal from open play in their last six games in all competitions.",
      "Newcastle will aim to win a third consecutive Premier League game for the first time this season when they host Leeds. Bruno Guimaraes is leading their resurgence.",
      "It is nothing new to see the 28-year-old inspiring the side, of course. But he has notably increased his attacking contribution this season. His goals in the wins over Crystal Palace and Burnley took him to seven in 19 Premier League games so far.",
      "He is their joint top scorer, alongside Nick Woltemade. With half of the campaign still to come, he has already matched his highest goal total in a full season for Newcastle.",
      "Guimaraes continues to play an invaluable role out of possession in Eddie Howe's midfield. But his increased attacking threat can be seen in his numbers for shots as well as goals. Guimaraes's averages this season have hit new highs.",
      "Newcastle's attack has been boosted by the return to fitness of Yoane Wissa, whose competition with Woltemade for the No 9 spot can only help. But if they find themselves in need of a goal against Leeds, their captain is the most likely candidate to step up.Nick Wright",
      "Igor Thiago's hat-trick against Everton on Sunday took him to 14 Premier League goals this season. He is the only player who even gets close to Erling Haaland in the scoring charts. Sunderland will be out to stop him at the Gtech Community Stadium.",
      "The Black Cats know how ruthless he can be. Thiago scored with his only effort on goal at the Stadium of Light in August, when Sunderland had to come from behind to win 2-1. But they can approach the task with confidence after a string of fine defensive displays.",
      "Sunderland have only conceded twice in their last five games. They were breached from a set piece at Spurs on Sunday but before that game they shackled Haaland impressively, inspired by centre-back duo Nordi Mukiele and Omar Alderete.",
      "Mukiele and Alderete rank as two of the signings of the season and there are candidates elsewhere in the Sunderland team too. Granit Xhaka has had a transformative impact in midfield. Goalkeeper Robin Roefs has arguably been even better, conceding five goals fewer than he should have, based on the quality of chances faced.",
      "Sunderland will need all four of those players to continue in the same vein against Brentford and the in-form Thiago. But, similarly to the Bees, with whom they are now vying for a European place, they have been quick to show they belong at this level.Nick Wright",
