      "Manchester United have triggered Matheus Cunha's £62.5million release clause with the Wolves star now set for a medical. The Red Devils failed with an audacious opening offer, but have agreed to the terms set out by the Midlands side.",
      "Personal terms had already been agreed and the Brazilian is now closing in on a move to Old Trafford. Cunha starred in Wolves' successful battle to beat the drop this season.",
      "He scored 17 goals and add six assists to earn Wolves' Players' Player of the Season award. United have long been linked with a move for the 26-year-old, with boss Ruben Amorim desperate to boost his attacking options.",
      "The Red Devils registered the fifth-lowest amount of goals in the Premier League this term. Amorim has selected Cunha as one of two key deals he wants to get done, with Ipswich's Liam Delap being the other.",
      "United appear to be keen to move quickly to secure the Wolves man. But they were made to work after seeing an audacious opening offer roundly rejected.",
      "According to The Athletic, United requested to pay Cunha's release clause over five years rather than the required two. Wolves resisted that approach though and stood firm, formally rejecting that opening offer.",
      "After that rejection, United decided to meet the terms, with an expectation on all sides that an agreement is close. And Cunha himself also appears certain that a deal will be reached between the two clubs.",
      "\"Talking about him is easy, I think he's a great coach and I wish him nothing but the best,\" Cunha told CNN Brasil via Daily Mail. \"I hope he conquers the world as he did Portugal,\" asked if they could do that together, he added: \"Well, God willing, we'll always do our best to help.\"",
      "Amorim is keen to bring in a new No.10 to play behind the striker in his 3-4-2-1 system. According to the BBC, the release clause in Cunha's contract is required to be paid in full after the 2026/27 season.",
      "United boss Amorim has warned that his club may struggle to complete deals this summer due to their financial situation. He said: \"We have a plan that is to bring [in] some new players.",
      "\"Our big plan is to improve the team we have and improve the academy as that is our future, as it was in past. It’s not going to change so much. We have financial fair play rules, so we are not allowed to do so much this summer.",
      "“The important thing is to stick together. We are going to struggle and it is not going to be everything right away. I have a feeling the team is improving and that is the most important thing.”"

      "Ruben Amorim brutally made it clear to Alejandro Garnacho that his Manchester United career is over in front of his team-mates. Amorim has grown increasingly frustrated with the Argentine winger and has decided to move on from him this summer.",
      "Garnacho did reach double figures for goals and assists but it was a frustrating season for the 20-year-old, who found his game-time curbed by Amorim. He played just 19 minutes of the Europa League defeat to Tottenham and was left out of the squad entirely for the final day win over Aston Villa.",
      "The winger had been a key player in United's FA Cup win last year, scoring in the final against Manchester City. He still has another three years to run on his contract, but Amorim has all but confirmed he will not play again.",
      "Amorim has previously shown his frustration with Garnacho, when he dropped the Argentine for the victory at Manchester City on 15 December. That decision was put down to performances in training, with Garnacho later returning to the fold.",
      "But the embattled United boss has now made it clear that the winger no longer features in his plans. Amorim held an end of season meeting with his squad on Saturday at the club's Carrington training ground.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, Amorim singled out Garnacho in front of his team-mates to effectively end his Old Trafford career. The United boss is said to have been so angry that he effectively told Garnacho to 'pray' he can find another club rather than have to return for pre-season training at the start of July.",
      "He is alleged to have said: \"You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.\" The tone of the comment left Garnacho and his team-mates in no doubt that the academy product's United career is over.",
      "Garnacho is understood to have upset Amorim by complaining about his game-time in the Europa League final defeat to Spurs. He said after the game: \"Obviously it’s hard for everyone. Our season was s***. We didn’t beat anyone in the league. We lacked a lot of things.",
      "\"When you don’t score goals, you always need more. Until we reached the final, I played every round. And I played 20 minutes today – I don’t know. I’m going to try to enjoy the summer and see what happens next.’ Garnacho’s brother also accused Amorim of ‘throwing him under the bus.\"",
      "Although Garnacho has joined United’s post-season tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong, the club are said to be concerned that Amorim’s stance may have devalued the winger. For his part, Amorim is refusing to comment on the discussions he has held with his players.",
      "\"He is a Manchester United player that is not in the squad today, but he continues to be a Manchester United player. I will speak with my players but the focus is the last game. I don't know what is going to happen but we have a plan,\" Amorim said after Garnacho was dropped for the win over Villa.",
      "\"We were prepared for both situations, with Champions League and without. We have an idea of the type of squad we want but we still have the last game. We have time to address all these situations.\""

      "Alan Shearer laughed that he will \"never say a bad word\" about Manchester United again after their victory over Aston Villa helped his beloved Newcastle United secure a spot in the Champions League. The Magpies clinched fifth place on the final day of the Premier League season, narrowly securing their return to Europe's top club competition.",
      "For most of the final day of the campaign, it looked like they were going to have to settle for the Europa League, after falling 1-0 behind at home to Everton. However, when United took the lead against Villa through Amad Diallo in the 76th minute, the Magpies were lifted back into fifth position, despite trailing the Toffees.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went on to secure the three-points through Christian Eriksen, who dispatched a penalty in the 87th minute to double United's lead. Despite eventually succumbing to defeat to Everton, Newcastle players and supporters erupted into celebrations not seen since they won the League Cup at Wembley after it was confirmed that they would be back in Europe's top-tier competition next season.",
      "Despite being a vocal critic of the Red Devils in the past, particularly this season, Shearer has promised to keep his criticism of United to himself, to say thank you to his former rivals.",
      "While speaking on the Rest Is Football podcast, co-host Gary Lineker said: \"You had a very nervy afternoon, Alan.\" Shearer responded: \"I will never have a bad word said against Manchester United again,\" prompting laughter from both.",
      "Lineker quipped: \"Who would have thought that they'd bail you out?\" to which Shearer confessed: \"And a certain decision that might've helped.\"",
      "He was referencing the moment of controversy at Old Trafford, which saw a goal from Morgan Rogers disallowed, after he was deemed to have kicked the ball out of the hands of United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir.",
      "Despite replay footage showing the Turkish shot-stopper had no control of the ball, VAR could not intervene to award the goal, as official Thomas Bramall had blown the whistle before the ball went into the net. The hugely controversial moment prevented Villa from taking a 1-0 lead, and, ultimately, stopped them from qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "However, it was a blessing for the Magpies, who will compete in Europe's elite competition for the second time in three years. It may also go some way to retaining star man Alexander Isak, who has been linked with moves to the likes of Arsenal and many others.",
      "Talking about the controversial result, Shearer, who had many battles against United during his career, said: \"Who would have thought it? Man United doing the Toon a massive favour.",
      "\"I mean they've been rotten all season, haven't they? They deserved to win yesterday. Villa were really poor and lacked so many things. They couldn't complain in terms of United deserving to win but they could complain against the decision that went against them.\"",
      "Directly after their season wrapped up, United boarded a flight to Malaysia for a post-season tour. Their itinerary includes a match in Kuala Lumpur on May 28 and another in Hong Kong just two days later.",
      "The victory over Villa was a positive end to a chastening season for the Red Devils. Their win over Unai Emery's side lifted them up to 15th position, which saw them finish the campaign with 11 victories, nine draws and 18 defeats. Nevertheless, this season goes down as their worst in the Premier League era and as one of the most miserable in their history.",

The Brazil international is on the verge of leaving Molineux for Old Trafford in a deal worth £62.5million, and has given thanks to his compatriots with a parting gift each.",
      "Both players shared photos of the gifts on Instagram. Gomes also shared the personal message he received from Cunha, whose exit is expected to be made official sooner rather than later, as well as footage of Andre receiving his own gift.",
      "\"‘Thank you for all the moments, you will always be in my heart,\" the message read. \"I will always be in love with you and your family. I love you.'\"",

      "The £62.5m fee represents Cunha's release clause, which he agreed upon signing a contract extension with his current club midway through the season. United are expected to pay the sum across several instalments rather than all up front,",

      "United had another potential route back into Europe after reaching the final of the Europa League. They fell short against Tottenham in the final, though, meaning Ange Postecoglou's side will play in next season's Champions League and Amorim's men won't have European football of any flavour.",

      "“I closed that chapter, I’m excited, I’m nervous, I want to work towards the next season. I don’t have that feeling to disconnect. I had the feeling to close the season, but now it’s a new season. I don’t need rest.”",
      "There will be precious little time for the United boss to spend on the sunlounger this summer - not when a major rebuild is required. Failure to beat Tottenham in the Europa League final closed the door on the Champions League and with it a potential £100million windfall.",
      "But a £62.5m deal to bring in Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is close to being rubber-stamped, while they continue to be linked with more forwards in the shape of Ipswich’s Liam Delap and Bryan Mbeumo of Brentford. Landing that trio would stretch United’s PSR restrained spending to the limit.",
      "And Amorim’s admission they “cannot do much” to improve their squad after their worst campaign since they were relegated in 1974 suggests doing so may currently be beyond their means. Hence why United are ready to listen to offers for any of their players, despite Amorim’s insistence skipper Bruno Fernandes is vital to his plans.",
      "“Omar (Berrada, the chief executive) is here, he can explain better than me,” Amorim said. “We always prepare two plans: one with Champions League, one without Champions League.",
      "“Without Champions League, we don’t need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan that is to bring some new players, of course. But our big plan is to improve the team that we have, is to improve our academy, because I think that is the future. It was the past, so can be the future.",
      "“It’s not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules. We are not allowed to do much this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.",
      "“It’s important to stick together. We are going to struggle, it is not going to be everything right away but I have a feeling and I see the team improving and that is the most important thing.”",
      "A leaner, meaner squad is the plan. And Amorim once again claimed the lack of European football may prove to be a blessing in disguise.",
      "“I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform well, to perform better, to prepare better for the games, to build that work that we need for the future,” he reasoned. \"I think it’s a good thing for us to take advantage, not to have European games.”",
      "He better be right, otherwise those alarm bells will soon become too loud to ignore.",

Ratcliffe has made it clear that he believes he inherited an inefficient club which has been wasting money across the board.",

But Brennan Johnson’s scrappy goal was hugely damaging for the club’s shaky finances and Amorim, who will now have a task convincing new recruits to join in the summer transfer window.",
      "United reacted by making it clear they would listen to offers for any of their underperforming squad, who have now jetted off to Malaysia for the first of two money-spinning post-season friendlies. But that wasn’t the first flight for Amorim, who travelled to Monaco on Friday to attend a high-profile meeting with the club’s owners and executives.",

Amorim left having received backing from Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the other club bigwigs, but he is under increasing pressure to deliver following a miserable start which has seen him win just 16 of his 42 games in charge.",

      "Manchester United have got a massive summer ahead of them after their disastrous season came to a close. The Red Devils rounded off the campaign on a slight high note after beating Aston Villa 2-0 on the final day, but they finished in 15th place after 18 losses and there is much work for Ruben Amorim to do.",
      "Amorim addressed supporters after the Villa game to apologise for a woeful season that also saw them beaten by Premier League rivals Tottenham in the Europa League final - and promised that \"the good days are coming\".",
      "The Red Devils have already started to make moves on both incoming and outgoing moves ahead of next season after confirming Jonny Evans, Christian Eriksen and Victor Lindelof would all depart on free transfers, while the likes of Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho are expected to leave.",
      "Meanwhile, Matheus Cunha is set to be the first name through the door as part of United's rebuild. Amorim will need plenty more names to arrive if he is to restore United to their former glory.",
      "Garnacho's future at Old Trafford looks increasingly uncertain after he was benched for the Europa League final and then left out of the matchday squad entirely for the last game of the season against Villa.",
      "Tensions appear to be growing between the player and Amorim after he scolded his manager's decision - before his brother accused the coach of \"throwing him under the bus\".",
      "Now it seems Napoli could be ready to rescue him from his difficult spell after the Italian side won the Serie A title last week.",
      "According to the i Paper, Napoli sporting director Giovanni Manna will soon meet with United officials to begin the negotiation process over Garnacho after missing out on him in January.",
      "The Naples outfit had a bid of £40m rejected in January, with United valuing him closer to £70m, but the Italian team could have better luck in striking a bargain after a tough season for the Argentine.",
      "One player Manchester United are hoping to sign is Ipswich's Liam Delap, but they will have to do battle with a number of clubs amid stiff competition for his signature.",
      "Delap is hot property this summer after a superb spell with the Tractor Boys, scoring 12 times in the Premier League.",
      "Liverpool and Chelsea are among the teams said to be interested alongside United - but those contenders won't have to wait long before Delap decides on his future.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs reports that Delap is set to decide his next move before he heads off for the Under 21 Euros with England.",
      "The report says United have already held initial discussions with the player, who wants to play European football - though game time is more important for him as he bids to make England's World Cup squad next season.",
      "It adds that Delap would like to return to the North West to play his football, having grown up in Derby and Manchester.",
      "United are edging closer to confirming their first transfer of the new season after reaching agreement to sign Cunha from Wolves, handing him a long-term contract until 2030 with the option of an additional 12 months.",
      "The Red Devils are set to pay the Brazilian's £62.5m release clause, adding some much-needed firepower to a group of players that scored just 44 goals all season - the fifth lowest of any team in the Premier League this season.",
      "Cunha is understood to have been offered the No 10 shirt at Old Trafford - meaning that number will be stripped from Marcus Rashford, who is likely to leave the club in the summer after his loan spell with Aston Villa.",
      "And now the Brazilian has sent a message to Wolves fans following the end of the season - which appears to be a goodbye message.",
      "\"Wolves, what can I say to you?\" he said. \"What an incredible season. We didn’t get to where you deserve to be, but we did everything we could to make you proud. I love these guys.\"Individually, it was the best season of my life. All of this was only possible because of all the dedication and love I have for this club. I became the Brazilian with the most goals in a Premier League season, along with @roberto_firmino and @gabriel.martinelli. \"I made mistakes and got things right, but always because I lived this club so much. All I ever wanted was to do the impossible for Wolves. Another one is over.And thank you all for all the affection.\"",

      "Simone Inzaghi could leave Inter Milan this summer as he's eyed by Saudi Arabian clubs. The Italian will manage in a second Champions League final in three seasons this weekend, which could prove to be his swan song.",
      "Inzaghi has just seen Inter narrowly miss out on the Serie A title whilst they also came unstuck in the Copa del Rey final. In Europe though the Italians have continued to claim some major scalps, downing Bayern Munich and Barcelona en route to the final.",
      "PSG stand between Inter and a first European triumph since 2010 but Inzaghi will have to make the club more than the sum of their parts when he comes up against the heavily funded PSG outfit led by Luis Enrique.",
      "Inzaghi has not enjoyed the same financial might as other managers around Europe and could yet be tempted by a switch to Al-Hilal. The Saudi outfit have huge riches and are keen on having the Italian as their manager, reports The Times, which would see him benefit from a near open cheque book.",
      "Manchester United and Chelsea have been linked with moves for Inzaghi in the past but he has chosen to remain in Italy. Having had to work within financial constraints the Inter boss may welcome the chance to pursue the players he wants.",
      "The Former Lazio boss previously claimed he leads one of Europe's best teams at the San Siro with Inter continuing to challenge for honours throughout his tenure, but has remained open minded as to his future moves.",
      "Inzaghi said: \"It’s very interesting football, all coaches like it. I don’t deny that there have been possibilities over the last few years, even when I was at Lazio, but I was happy at Lazio and I’m happy at Inter. I like it (English football), it intrigues me, but I’m at one of the best teams in Europe and I’m happy here. Nobody can be certain about the future, though.\"",
      "Whilst working in Italy Inzaghi first claimed the Coppa Italia with Lazio before moving to Inter, where he won the Italian Cup on two more occasions. He's also won Serie A but wasn't pursue by the Red Devils when they went looking for Erik ten Hag's replacement.",
      "Inzaghi can claim European Cup glory this weekend and told UEFA: \"It would be the crowning achievement of a great job that started four years ago. We know it will be a very important final and we are desperate to make our fans really happy. We will give it our all.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha is expected to sharpen United's attack in a £62.5million move from Wolves while United have identified Ipswich Town goalscorer Liam Delap to come in as their starting striker.",
      "Cunha and Delap both have release clauses totalling £92.5m, which have influenced United's swift decision-making. However, the club will have to generate funds through sales to facilitate other moves in the transfer market.",

      "At a pre-match press conference for United's post-season tour match against the ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur, Amorim was asked about the impact of no Champions League football for the 2025-26 season.",
      "“Omar (Berrada, the chief executive) is here, he can explain better than me,\" Amorim said. \"We always prepare two plans: one with Champions League, one without Champions League.",
      "\"Without Champions League, we don’t need a big squad, we can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan that is to bring some new players, of course.",

      "With that in mind, departures are likely to outweigh the number of new arrivals this summer. Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave and Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales.",
      "Amid a lack of European football next season, United will not need to manage a squad as big as they have this season, meaning they are unlikely to require the same number of incomings as outgoings.",
      "Nevertheless, there is no doubt that head coach Ruben Amorim needs to add fresh blood and injections of quality, particularly in attacking areas. United struggled for goals domestically this season and desperately need to improve their attacking output ahead of next term.",
      "It is looking increasingly likely that Wolves ace Matheus Cunha will be drafted in as the club's first signing of the summer. The Brazilian has been identified to fill one of the two playmaker positions and United are expected to trigger his £62.5million release clause.",
      "Having played as a No.10 at Molineux, the former Atletico Madrid man is a suitable fit for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. The United boss wants an increased attacking presence buzzing around the central striker and Cunha fits the mould.",
      "As for bolstering the No.9 position, United have also made good progress with their identification process, long since pinpointing Ipswich Town's Liam Delap as an option.",
      "The 22-year-old, who joined Ipswich from Manchester City last summer, plundered 12 goals in his first full season as a Premier League player, despite operating in a team that won just four games all season and was relegated to the Championship.",
      "Available for £30m via a release clause that has become active as a result of Ipswich's relegation, Delap is no stranger to United technical director Jason Wilcox from the time they spent together at City. Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna confirmed last Friday that Delap is increasingly likely to leave Portman Road this summer.",
      "Already planning to spend north of £90m on two Premier League-ready players to strengthen their attack, United have also been credited with interest in Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo by multiple outlets in the last day or so. The Cameroonian has enjoyed an excellent season for the Bees, scoring 20 Premier League goals.",
      "The jewel in Brentford's crown, Mbeumo, who was signed from French club Troyes in 2019, was only outscored in the Premier League this season by Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak (23) and Erling Haaland (22). He also registered seven assists.",
      "Capable of playing from the right wing or up front, Mbeumo is a suitable fit to operate close to Delap in the right-sided No.10 position. He also has the athleticism United so desperately need to add in this summer's window.",
      "Reportedly valued at around £50m, there is no doubt United will have to maximise the seller's market to go after Mbeumo's signature.",
      "The prospect of Mbeumo, Cunha and Delap all being signed in one window is an ambitious thought. However, it is not beyond the realms of possibility if United manage to offload the likes of Rashford, Garnacho, Sancho and Antony.",
      "United need to strengthen other areas beyond their attack, such as the centre of midfield, but bolstering their forward line is poised to take initial priority this summer. The club can ill-afford to be as limited up front again next term.",
      "Should Mbeumo, Delap and Cunha be signed this summer, they should form United's strongest attack, forcing Bruno Fernandes into a more reserved role and Amad the right wing-back berth. The aforementioned duo are two players the Reds must retain this summer amid their increased importance.",
      "There is also a case for United to strengthen in goal and possibly at wing-back. For now, though, bolstering the attack has to take priority.",
      "United's strongest line-up with three new signings: Onana; Yoro, De Ligt, Martinez; Amad, Ugarte, Fernandes, Dorgu; Mbeumo, Cunha; Delap."

The supporters' club has been going for the best part of 50 years, so Kuala Lumpur will not be short of United fanatics during their stay here.",

      "Hello and welcome to the Manchester United transfer blog on Tuesday, May 27.",
      "The 2024/25 Premier League season is over and after what has been a season to forget for United, they at least ended it on a high. goals from Amad Diallo and Christian Eriksen - in what was his final match for the club - gave Ruben Amorim's side a 2-0 win over Aston Villa.",
      "Eyes for United will now quickly turn to next season. It is expected to be a busy transfer window for the club, with them already linked with several players.",
      "Amorim has freshly spoke on summer plans and the challenges that will be faced at the start of United's post-season trip to Asia.",
      "The club are said to be closing in on a deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha who has a £62.5 million release clause in his contract at Molineux. It is said that a verbal agreement is in place between the club and the player.",
      "Elsewhere, strikers Viktor Gyokeres and Liam Delap continue to be linked. The latter has been holding talks with interested clubs over a potential summer move.",
      "In terms of outgoings, there has been a lot of talk over the future of Alejandro Garnacho with the winger not even in the squad for the clash against Villa.",
      "Keep across all the United transfer updates and latest news in our dedicated blog below...",
      "Manchester United have now met the terms of Matheus Cunha's contract and Wolves have given permission to conclude the deal, according to The Telegraph.",
      "It had been reported that United wanted to split Cunha's £62.5million release clause across five years, but Wolves rejected that proposal and United have agreed to pay it over two years, as stated in his contract.",
      "United have now been given the green light to start a medical and get a deal over the line for Cunha's arrival.",
      "Mannchester United are leading the chase for highly-rated Southampton centre back Harley Emsden-James, as per the Daily Mail.",
      "Emsden-James, 16, has been impressive for Saints this season and United believe they have won the race, with Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal among the others interested in his signature.",
      "Manchester United are expected to receive around £300,000 if Real Betis win the Conference League on Wednesday, it has been claimed.",
      "Manuel Pellegrini's Betis face Chelsea in the final in Wroclaw and United no doubt have one eye on Antony's progress.",
      "The Brazilian has impressed since his loan move from United in January, scoring nine goals and adding five assists in 25 matches for Betis.",
      "As part of his loan move, United and Betis agreed on a number of bonuses should Antony reach them, according to ABC.es.",
      "One of them is that Betis have got to fork out £300,000 to United if they win the Conference League final against Chelsea.",
      "It was conditional on Antony playing more than half of their matches in the competition since his arrival, but he has featured in every one and is expected to have an important role in the final.",
      "Manchester United have made contract with Wolves to submit an opening offer for Matheus Cunha, according to The Athletic.",
      "United have asked to pay Cunha's £62.5million release clause across five years, but Wolves expect two years, as stated in his contract.",
      "Personal terms have already been agreed for the 26-year-old forward and the move is still expected to happen.",
      "While Hojlund has flattered to deceive at times for United, it may not be the case that Ineos accept the offer from Inter for the forward.",
      "Inter Live add that they would be looking to complete a loan deal with an option to buy.",
      "From United's perspective, that deal is unlikely to suit them as they are in need of funds now to complete their rebuild rather than later.",
      "Paul Mitchell, who was linked with a move to United as the club's new sporting director before Ineos moved for Dan Ashworth, will be departing Newcastle ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Explaining his departure in a statement, Mitchell said:",
      "I'd like to thank everyone at Newcastle United for their support over the last year, including Eddie Howe, Becky Langley, the players, staff, owners and fans. It has been an honour to be part of the club and to work with some incredible people. I'm leaving at a time that is right for me and the club, particularly with Darren Eales - someone who I have worked so closely with in my career - moving on soon. The club is in great hands on and off the pitch, and is in a fantastic position to continue building. I'd like to wish everyone connected with Newcastle United a bright and successful future.",
      "Newcastle responded by adding:",
      "Paul leaves with the club’s best wishes and the Board would like to express its sincere thanks to him for his professionalism and diligent service.",
      "According to Inter Live, the Champions League finalists have agreed they will try and sign Rasmus Hojlund in the summer transfer window.",
      "The Dane has struggled in Manchester this season but Inter remain big fans of him since his days at Atalanta.",
      "It is believed that Hojlund's contract demands of £3.35m per year are seen as affordable and Inter are willing to test United's resolve.",
      "Having not decided to extend his stay at Al Nassr yet, Ronaldo has been tipped to leave and join a club competing in this summer's Club World Cup.",
      "Discussing the prospect of Ronaldo's future, bet365's Sports and Trading expert Steve Freeth said:",
      "The Club World Cup is just around the corner and with the organisers undoubtedly looking for a headline act and with the player showing no signs of hanging his boots up, it would be just like Ronaldo to enter the stage in the United States next month. The big question, and a puzzler for our traders, is which club will he represent, especially as we've set the date for 14th June, the start of the tournament, while his existing contract doesn’t expire until the end of the month. Seeing Ronaldo and Messi in tandem for Inter Miami would be something special, while Sergio Ramos is at Monterrey and could also be an attractive proposition. Either way, Cristiano Ronaldo remains box office.",
      "Currently, remaining at Al Nassr on June 14 is the most likely option with the bookmaker. However, moves to Sporting, LAFC and Al Hilal are also fancied.",
      "You can view the full market HERE.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Real Madrid and Benfica are set to meet this week to discuss the transfer fee for Alvaro Carreras this summer.",
      "It is understood that a release clause at approximately £42m is included in the full-back's contract in Portugal.",
      "As part of the deal that saw Carreras leave, United included a 'significant sell-on clause' which would be triggered if the Lisbon club sold the defender.",
      "Any extra money at this stage will be music to the ears of United and Amorim as he looks to rebuild his squad.",
      "Fernandes' comments about his United future following the Europa League final stirred concern among supporters last week and news of an ultimatum being offered will worry fans further.",
      "However, there could be some hope to be had when we look back at what Fernandes said last week.",
      "I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go. I'm eager to do more, to be able to bring the club the great days. In the day that the club thinks that I'm too much or it's time to part ways, football is like this, you never know it. But I've always said it and I keep my word in the same way. If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is, and football sometimes is like this.",
      "With Amorim already stating publicly he wants to keep Fernandes, the hope will be that the captain shall choose to stay despite the money being offered by Al Hilal.",
      "Amorim has insisted this morning that he wants to keep Fernandes at Old Trafford despite the interest which is building from Al Hilal.",
      "Speaking to the media in Malaysia, Amorim said:",
      "We already talk about that many times. You can see by the performance, the leadership, the passion he has for the game, it’s really important. Especially in these kind of moments. The last game the team was without pressure, they performed quite well, everybody wants the ball. But we had some difficult moments and in those difficult moments you can see that Bruno is the guy that takes responsibility. He should be (taking responsibility) because he’s the captain, he’s experienced, he’s really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team.",
      "According to GiveMeSport, United captain Bruno Fernandes has been handed a major ultimatum ahead of the transfer window opening.",
      "It is understood that Al Hilal have handed Fernandes a £700,000 per week contract offer and want to know by Thursday whether he would be willing to accept those terms.",
      "If he is, then the Saudi Pro League club will look to hold transfer talks with United for his signature.",
      "According to The Telegraph, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are looking at Cherki this summer.",
      "It is thought the midfielder is seen as the Blues' alternative to Florian Wirtz who was deemed too expensive.",
      "City are currently working out whether his temperament is suited to the Premier League.",
      "For United, if City are interested in the Frenchman, this is a hammer blow for them as they could struggle to compete with the package that the Blues could offer him.",
      "Amorim has insisted that United fans should not expect much from the summer transfer window due to their tight funds and lack of Champions League football.",
      "Cunha and Delap remain the two top targets but who should United look to sign if they can make some sales.",
      "Well, one man who seems like a gamble worth taking is Rayan Cherki, the Lyon attacking midfielder who is available for approximately £20m this summer.",
      "However, there could be a problem with that plan emerging as we speak...",

      "In that earlier report from ESPN was another interesting claim.",
      "They say Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze are also on Man United's radar with Ruben Amorim seeking to bolster his attack.",
      "The two wingers have been standout performers in 2024/25.",
      "According to ESPN, Man United have the framework of a deal to sign Liam Delap from Ipswich Town agreed. They only wait on the player's final decision over his next club.",
      "They say Ipswich have been contacted and know of the club's intention to pay his £30m release clause should he give the green light.",
      "Wolves midfielder Andre has wished fellow Brazilian and club teammate Matheus Cunha the best, 'wherever' he ends up.",
      "The attacker is on Manchester United's shortlist and with his £62.5m release clause, speculation has intensified over a summer deal being wrapped up quickly.",
      "Read the full story HERE",
      "So, we're in a position where Matheus Cunha is expected to enhance Man United's attack, meanwhile Liam Delap is another attacker being looked at.",

      "United have been keeping tabs on the prolific goalscorer since Ruben Amorim arrived at Old Trafford in November. However, they face fierce competition from the Gunners, who will be able to offer Champions League football next season.",
      "During a press-conference, organised by Radio Renascenca's Bola Branca, Salgado Zenha discussed the Lions' ambitions for the upcoming transfer window. Inevitably, he was quizzed about Gyokeres and simply replied: \"Gyokeres? He has three more years on his contract.",
      "\"At the moment, there are no offers. He has three more years on his contract. I think the answer has been given.\"",

      "Manchester United are heading into the summer transfer window expecting plenty of change to occur in their squad.",
      "This season has been one which has been particularly poor for the Reds as they struggled to perform across all competitions. The Europa League was their one solace but that ended in disaster at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur in the final.",
      "Now, United must rebuild for next season knowing they will not be competing in Europe. As such, Ruben Amorim has admitted that the Reds will be operating with a smaller squad which could play into their hands if they make the right deals this summer.",
      "The pre-season transfer window opens early for a ten-day period on Sunday to allow those competing in the Club World Cup to complete deals. United can also take advantage of this and do some early business of their own before the transfer fun really begins next month.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three deals United could complete this week.",
      "The obvious incoming that United will look to complete this week is the arrival of Wolverhampton Wanderers forward Matheus Cunha. The Brazilian bid an emotional farewell to the Wolves supporters following Sunday's draw to Brentford and he seems destined to move to Old Trafford.",
      "Cunha is believed to have been happy to join United despite the lack of European football this season and his £62.5m release clause can be triggered without the need to sell players. MEN Sport understands the 26-year-old is one of two players who are available to be bought straightaway by United.",
      "Ipswich Town's Delap is the other player that United can purchase without the need to sell. Following the Tractor Boys' relegation from the top flight, United are able to snap him up for a reasonable £30m.",
      "Unlike Cunha, Delap is observing his options elsewhere and the Reds are aware that Chelsea and Newcastle are also keen on him. Ineos see the 22-year-old as a perfect addition to their frontline with his age and previous Premier League experience working in his favour.",
      "However, if he chooses to move elsewhere, United will need to go back to the drawing board.",
      "Now this is a deal that United supporters will not want to see happen this week but Al Hilal are reportedly pushing to get it done. GiveMeSport reports that the Saudi Pro League club want an answer from Bruno Fernandes by Thursday over whether he would accept a £700,000 per week contract.",
      "This works out at £36.4m per year but once added incentives are included, Fernandes could be making a whopping £65m annually. Fernandes has said he will only leave United when the club decides to 'cash in' on him and Amorim insisted on Tuesday that he wants to build his squad around the Portuguese midfielder.",
      "But, that is a life-changing sum of money and considering Al Hilal's desperation to sign Fernandes before the Club World Cup next month, this could be a deal that is signed off this week should it be given the go-ahead."

      "Reports suggest that the Brazilian is closing in on a £62.5 million move to Manchester United, with the club triggering a release clause in his contract. Cunha is said to have agreed a five-year deal with the club with the option of an extra year.",
      "Cunha has been a standout player for Wolves this season, scoring 15 goals in 32 appearances for the side who flirted with relegation in the first half of the season. After the final game of the season against Brentford he appeared to say his own goodbye to the fans at Molineux.",
      "He has since sent a heartfelt message on social media thanking the club as he was awarded the annual player of the season award.",
      "The forward has now sent another message to hint that his time at Wolves is coming to an end. On what is his 26th birthday, the official Wolves Instagram account has shared a video of Cunha’s interaction with fans following the final game of the season, where the crowd are signing his song.",
      "In the caption they wrote: “The birthday boy. Matheus Cunha on my mind.” along with cake and music note emojis.",
      "Cunha then responded in the replies by writing: “I can’t thank you enough for so much.” He added a red heart and fire emoji.",
      "He has also shared the video onto his own Instagram story.",
      "The message is the latest hint that a move to United may be getting closer. Cunha joined Wolves from Atletico Madrid, originally on loan in January 2023, before the move was made permanent the following summer."

      "Real Betis head coach Manuel Pellegrini has admitted that Antony told him he wanted to enact revenge on Manchester United for letting him leave in the January transfer window.",
      "The United winger endured a difficult spell at Old Trafford, having been signed to much fanfare by Erik ten Hag. When the former Ajax manager was sacked in October, Antony's days seemed limited after Ruben Amorim was appointed.",
      "Amorim has stuck rigidly to his 3-4-2-1 system at Old Trafford, which uses wing-backs instead of wingers. Antony was tested in the wing-back and No.10 roles that Amad excelled in, but it soon became clear that the Brazilian would not fit the Portuguese head coach's vision.",
      "In January, Amorim quickly arranged a loan move to Seville for Antony and the 25-year-old has not looked back. He has bagged nine goals and five assists for Real Betis and has also been instrumental to their run to the Conference League final, where they will take on Chelsea tomorrow.",
      "Ahead of the game, Pellegrini was asked about Antony's return to form, and the ex-Manchester City and West Ham United coach admitted that revenge was motivating the United loanee. \"I can be proud of helping Antony,\" the 71-year-old told the media.",
      "\"He told me he was not playing at Manchester United and was not happy. He wanted 'revenge' and to show what he can do.",
      "\"It's difficult with a €100m (£83.9m) price tag. Antony is a very good player.",
      "\"I am absolutely sure that this is a huge time for him to continue improving his career.\" MEN Sport understands that United see Antony as a prime candidate to be sold in the summer transfer window.",
      "His improved form for Real Betis is unlikely to influence a return to Amorim's starting line-up. Pellegrini's men are thought to be interested in signing Antony again in the summer but would prefer a loan move which is not seen as a viable option for the Reds."

      "This week, Semedo has been linked with United too as the right-back and current Wolves captain nears the end of his contract at Molineux. The 31-year-old could be seen as an option to allow Patrick Dorgu to play exclusively on the left flank and while Noussair Mazraoui has been favoured in the back three, Semedo could be seen as a good squad player to challenge Diogo Dalot.",
      "Taking to Instagram on Bank Holiday Monday in the UK, Semedo admitted that his future was not certain amid speculation that United want him. He wrote: \"Just want to thank you all for yesterday [Sunday] and for all your support during this season.",
      "\"It was a season with highs and lows, tough periods and great moments as well and that would be impossible without you guys supporting us during the year. We accomplished the main objective for this season but we have to set our ambitions as a club and go fight for them because trust me, all together we can do it.",
      "\"Time to rest, think and take a big decision with my family. I love you.\"",
      "Among his teammates to reach out was Cunha, who liked the post, as did Semedo's fellow countrymen Dalot and Bruno Fernandes. Football Transfers understands that United's interest in Semedo could escalate quickly if he decides to leave the West Midlands club on a free transfer.",
      "The Reds are thought to be keen to act on Semedo in the 'coming weeks'. The summer transfer window opens briefly on Sunday, June 1, before closing until June 10 and reopening on June 16 before closing for good on September 1."

      "There are hardly any positives to take from 2024/2025. Bruno Fernandes and Amad were the standout performers and emerged with credit, but the majority of the players in the squad majorly underperformed and outgoings could reach double digits in the summer transfer window.",
      "United fans were desperate for the end of the season to arrive. It's been a painful period for supporters, and some extraordinary interviews have been given because of bad results.",
      "So, here are the five most shocking quotes from a nightmare campaign at United...",
      "United suffered a 3-1 defeat to Brighton at Old Trafford in December, which condemned them to a fourth loss in five home games, and Amorim made national headlines after the game.",
      "Amorim had picked up just 11 points in the 11 league games he'd managed since his appointment in November and he shocked journalists by saying his side were \"maybe\" the worst team in the club's history.",
      "In a stunning press conference, Amorim said: \"In the past 10 games in the Premier League, we won two. Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me.",
      "\"We are getting a new coach who is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that. We are the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know you want headlines, but I am saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go: your headlines.\"",

      "Luke Shaw pointed the finger at his teammates after the Europa League final defeat, suggesting publicly that some members of the dressing room are not good enough for United.",
      "Shaw's comments were common sense but it was damning to hear them spoken out loud.",
      "\"It's hard to put into words the season, but I think for a club like Manchester United it's not really good enough,\" said Shaw. \"I think definitely me, and I think all of us have to question ourselves tonight.",
      "\"Are we good enough to be here? Because this club, this season, it's not acceptable. We know that and it's down to us. I think it's really tough to take. I think we have to look at ourselves. Something has to change.\"",
      "Christian Eriksen said farewell to Old Trafford on the final day of the Premier League season. He volunteered to chat, which promised to be good value considering he could speak freely.",
      "Eriksen is about to walk through the exit door and can say anything he likes about United.",
      "“I think, unfortunately, there’s been a lot of lows this season with the games, and obviously the final was the missing piece. It’s football,\" he said, before producing a zinger relegation quote.",
      "“For me now, I think people are lucky that we are where we are, not relegated with the team with the season we’ve had, so it is also a bit of luck you have to acknowledge. Next season it has to be better, and I’m sure it will be. I’m looking forward to watching it from the sides.”",
      "United should probably be thankful for Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton.",
      "In December, Sir Jim Ratcliffe showed his true colours when he discussed the increase of ticket prices.",
      "In Ratcliffe's United We Stand interview, he said of the anger at the ticket price rises: \"I understand that. I was brought up on a council estate in Manchester, I absolutely get that.",
      "\"I don't want to end up in a position where the genuine local fans can't afford to come, but I do want to optimise the ticketing. We need to find a balance. And you can't be popular all the time either. Here, we're talking about three per cent of the tickets. That's not the issue.",
      "\"The issue, as you say, is whether this is the thin edge of the wedge. I don't think it makes sense for a Manchester United ticket to cost less than a ticket to see Fulham.\"",
      "Told that wages are higher in London, Ratcliffe continued: \"I get that. I'm not sure there's an answer that keeps everybody happy, but we need to keep the majority happy.\"",
      "Ratcliffe's comments certainly didn't go down well among supporters and he was subsequently confronted outside Craven Cottage, with an angry fan telling the British billionaire he was \"worse than the Glazers.\"",
      "United were hammered 3-0 by Liverpool at Old Trafford at the beginning of September.",
      "Ten Hag got into a fiery argument with a reporter who questioned his tactics.",
      "Ian Ladyman from the Daily Mail asked Ten Hag what made him so sure it was the players that were the problem and not his coaching, to which the Dutchman responded: \"So, what do you mean? Tell me then, maybe you can explain me which mistakes we make regular?”",
      "Ladyman said: “Constantly turning over the ball in your own half, playing the ball out from the back, getting mugged, chances coming off the back of it, counter attacks where you are outnumbered, giving up endless chances.”",
      "Ten Hag replied: “You are sure? I don’t think so,\" and Ladyman responded: “Absolutely.”",
      "Ten Hag added: “I don’t think otherwise we would win trophies as we did and to beat big opponents, so I am sorry for you.”",
      "The journalist responded: “With the greatest respect, you did brilliantly against Manchester City in the final, you almost lost to Coventry in the semi-final I mean come on let’s have a realistic view of what happened.”",
      "Ten Hag ended the exchange with: “I think we won, after City, the most trophies in English football, so I’m sorry for you.”",
      "Many believed Ten Hag was crumbling under pressure and sounded out of touch with reality."

Players who genuinely want to be at Old Trafford are what they should be looking for.",
      "Regardless of talent levels or ability, character and mentality can be equally important. Former United manager Erik ten Hag, back in August 2022, highlighted the importance of recruiting the right characters, assessing the impact they would have on the dressing room.",
      "The Dutchman said: \"Of course you analyse your squad … what are the weaknesses, what are the strengths and where can we improve? Which players are on the market?",
      "\"But it's also really important that you know the characters of your current squad and also the players that you bring in…what characters and behaviour they have. And what the effect, or probable effect, they will have in the dressing room.\"",
      "Of course, United need to add quality to their squad this summer, and getting a deal over the line for Matheus Cunha will do exactly that. And the fact he is keen to join United in their current situation is a big positive.",

      "Fifteenth in the Premier League and trophyless officially marks the worst Manchester United season in 51 years. In the end, their league position was better than anticipated.",
      "The unexpected final-day victory over Aston Villa saw United end an eight-game winless league run and rise to a flattering 15th. They even broke the 40-point mark.",
      "Although there is a post-season tour of Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong to navigate over the next week, the domestic season could not have ended quickly enough for United. Progression in the Europa League made the season salvageable but United lost to the worst Tottenham team since they were last relegated.",
      "Here are how the United players rated in 2024-25:",
      "Andre Onana",
      "It is easy to forget how secure Onana was in the first three months. That changed after Arsenal cornered him and he committed too many clangers, with the nadir away to Lyon. 4",
      "Altay Bayindir",
      "Played ten times and was the hero of the FA Cup triumph at Arsenal but he was almost always unconvincing, including in the only Premier League match United won with him in net against Aston Villa. 4",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "Started to make some headway in March and early April but his form before then was nondescript. United missed him when he was injured but they need a new right winger. 4",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "One of United's most consistent performers. Mazraoui missed one game through illness and played in seven different roles. He is lacking in attack but is a valuable squad player in defence and provided value for money. 7",
      "Harry Maguire",
      "On an individual basis, possibly his best campaign with United. Maguire scored huge goals, was more often than not solid defensively and has become a captain without the armband. 7",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Struggled in his first six months but found form in March before he sustained injury at Nottingham Forest at the start of April, which effectively ended his season prematurely. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Did not debut until December after he recovered from a metatarsal fracture but Yoro grew in confidence during the run-in and is an established starter in the back three. An encouraging first year. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez",
      "Had a sloppy first half of the season but found form in January with some big goals and big moments. Then his season was over in February due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. 5",
      "Victor Lindelof",
      "Started 12 games in his least-involved season. Outstayed his welcome after United ill-advisedly triggered the one-year extension in his contract and United have paid millions to service Lindelof. 3",
      "Jonny Evans",
      "Barely qualifies as he started six games and made one substitute appearance in the final five months of the campaign. Was excellent in the goalless draw with Aston Villa. 4",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Amorim turned to him in the final month and that faith was misguided. Shaw missed seven months of football and was shoddy in the Europa League final. 3",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "The mid-season arrival had an enterprising few weeks in March and April but he suffered from Dalot's injury and failed to have any impact in United's remaining matches, despite starting regularly. 5",
      "Manuel Ugarte",
      "Had a handful of decent games and scored a couple of good goals but, for a 24-year-old, he has seldom looked ready to anchor United's midfield. His form was so poor in recent weeks he was benched for the Europa League final. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "Went from redundant to relevant in the Europa League knockout stage, when he was totemic. That skews the perception of Casemiro, who had a forgettable domestic term. 5",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Another injury-prone season was almost salvaged with a few goals and a start in the Europa League final. Then Mount reminded everyone in Bilbao why he and United have always looked a mismatch. 4",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Lost his starting place a long time ago. He will always have the Lyon equaliser from his second full campaign but this has been one to forget for a player whose future is uncertain. 4",
      "Christian Eriksen",
      "Started 19 games in a season that was destined to be his last at United. Eriksen scored five goals but his only one in the league was the final-day penalty against Villa. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "The turning point for Fernandes was his red card at Wolves on Boxing Day. Before then, he looked like another United player who had eased up after signing a new contract. In 2025, he has been such a driving force that comparisons with Bryan Robson are legitimate. 8",
      "Amad",
      "Might have been United's player of the season but for his two-and-a-half-month lay-off between February and May. Tallied 11 goals and came up with memorable moments against Manchester City and Southampton. 8",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "Has become a borderline cult hero since his 33rd-minute withdrawal against Newcastle. Zirkzee rallied in 2025 and produced good performances in a more withdrawn role. But he is not a striker. 5",
      "Alejandro Garnacho",
      "Not got anywhere near the highs of 2023-24 in a season of personal lows. Garnacho has done decently for a 20-year-old adapting to a new system but he has often been juvenile and crossed his head coach one too many times. 6",
      "Rasmus Hojlund",
      "After his matchwinning goals in Plzen on December 12, Hojlund scraped three goals in 35 matches. Hojlund scored 10 goals and only four of them were in the Premier League. Drained of confidence and not good enough. 3",
      "Players must have started at least five games to be eligible for a rating. Loanees are excluded."

We have a lot to do this summer and we have to prepare the team. People will expect us to be on the top at Man United but I don’t want to think about a big target.",
      "“I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage, to perform well and prepare better the games. To build that core we need for the future. So I think it’s good for us to take advantage of not having European games.”",

      "Manchester United decision-makers Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox are reportedly set to meet with Ruben Amorim soon, and the club’s ‘desperation’ will see the future of Marcus Rashford made a ‘major talking point’.",
      "Rashford played just six games under Amorim after the United boss took charge of the club at the back end of 2024. The forward then began to get left out of squads, with his manager not happy with his efforts in training.",
      "That was despite him scoring three goals in those first six games, and with things not looking to be improving for Rashford as the January window opened, he headed out on loan to Aston Villa.",
      "The majority of reports on his future have suggested that United will not be the club he represents any longer, but they may be backed into a corner on that.",

      "Getting Amorim to ‘patch up his differences’ with the forward ‘is believed to be on the agenda’.",

      "United’s desperation seemingly comes from the view that they may not be able to sign many high-quality players this summer. While Matheus Cunha is joining, he is coming from a club who have no European football, so it’s not a huge problem to him that United don’t either.",

      "We had a lovely Bank Holiday afternoon poring over the F365 tables now 2024-25 is in the bag. Don’t pretend you were having more fun with your family and friends…",
      "After all, we’ve got 21 different tables, and within those, plenty of nifty filtering options and all sorts of other user-friendly features. You just don’t get that in the pub or out in the fresh air.",
      "So here are 16 Conclusions drawn from those very tables…",
      "1) Let’s start with the one that really matters: the actual league table. In short: Liverpool are the best team in the country; Arsenal are Arsenal; Nottingham Forest caught us all out; Manchester United and Tottenham are each a genuine disgrace; and the gap between the Premier League and the Championship, evidently, is getting bigger. Need we go on? Well, yes, apparently we do…",
      "",
      "2) Why are Liverpool the best team in the country? The ridiculousness of Mo Salah has something to do with it, and the Egyptian will be a largely responsible for their collective creative genius. The Reds have scored 66 of their 86 goals from open play, 16 more than third-placed Arsenal in that metric. Liverpool have topped the big chances created table for the last five years now, but not like this. Having created 112 big chances, they are 19 clear of second-placed Chelsea, who might have felt like telling their critics to ‘eff off’ but perhaps their passage into the Champions League might have been more serene had they not been so wasteful.",
      "3) Nottingham Forest, in sharp contrast, have been razor sharp in front of goal. Only West Ham and the three relegated teams created fewer big chances than Forest (58). They outperformed their xG by five goals (4.85 actually, but…) which is creditable. But, sustainable?",
      "",
      "4) Forest faded, but Manchester United and Tottenham unashamedly downed tools in the Premier League once they realised their best chance of rescuing a wretched season lay in Europe. The form table leaves Spurs second-bottom over the last six games. The only reason they aren’t bottom is because they scored one goal more than Ipswich in that time. If we go back even further, over a 10-game period, they’re still second-bottom.",
      "Still, Ange Postecoglou’s gamble paid off and Spurs fans right now aren’t likely to give a shiny sh*te while they bask in Europa League glory. Especially while they can reasonably claim to have had a better season than Arsenal despite being hilariously crap for the last quarter of it.",
      "",
      "5) Spurs and United weren’t rubbish for a lack of the ball. In terms of possession, they are fifth and sixth respectively. So what the f*** were they doing with it? In United’s case, nothing much. Only Everton and three relegated sides scored fewer from open play, while 11 teams created more big chances. Further proving that possession means nothing, Forest are Europe-bound despite having had the ball less than anyone bar Everton and Ipswich.",
      "",
      "6) If Ruben Amorim wants an easy way of improving United, he might simply tell his players they kick off an hour before they actually do. Because if matches ended at half-time, they would have been relegated.",
      "",
      "7) Similarly, thanks to the table that allows us to break matches into 15-minute intervals, it is possible to pinpoint the particular period where Spurs go full Spurs. They start well. Only Forest are better through the opening quarter of an hour. And from 16-30 minutes, they’re seventh. Then they remember they are Tottenham and plummet to 18th between the half-hour and 45-minute mark.",
      "",
      "8) Fulham have been unfathomably fun. No team is more reliable for your both teams to score acca, and the Cottagers have pissed on the chips of their top-half opponents to such an extent that only Liverpool have taken more than the 30 points amassed by Marco Silva’s side. What makes them such a head f***, though, is the fact that only the relegated sides have a worse record against bottom-half sides.",
      "",
      "9) Everton are also proper weird. Away from home against top-half opposition, they won 17 points and in that respect there isn’t a better team in the Premier League. But on the road against bottom-half teams, only Southampton have taken fewer than the Toffees’ seven points.",
      "🚨 2024/25 Premier League Winners: Liverpool, Salah, Newcastle, Forest, Chelsea, Moyes and more",
      "",
      "10) If Mikel Arteta is looking for reasons why Arsenal were Arsenal, the most obvious one is they drew too many games – 14. Only once in the Premier League era have they drawn more matches and that was in a 42-game season. They suffered the same number of defeats as runaway champions Liverpool, but too often failed to turn one point into three, resulting in a 10-point deficit, even after Liverpool swapped boots for flip-flops upon sealing the title a month ago. Fair play to the Reds for highlighting their dominance by chucking in the last month, during which time only Wolves, Ipswich, Southampton and – obviously – Spurs have taken fewer points.",
      "",
      "11) Back to Arsenal: for a team with title ambitions, their home form has been sketchy (fifth-best in the league) but on the road against top-half opposition, they’ve won only once and taken the same number of points as Man Utd. Which, as we know, is the polar opposite of title-winning form.",
      "",
      "12) Changing managers doesn’t always have the desired effect. Just ask Man Utd. But sometimes it definitely does. Everton dismissed Sean Dyche in January while languishing in 16th. In the table since David Moyes returned, the Toffees are eighth.",
      "Similarly, Wolves were second-bottom with nine points – 0.6 ppg – when Gary O’Neil was given the elbow in mid-December. Since Vitor Pereira came in, that table has them 12th with 1.5 ppg.",
      "🚨 2024/25 Premier League Losers: United, City, Arsenal, relegation farce and more",
      "",
      "13) Don’t turn your backs on Bournemouth when the clock ticks over to 90. The Cherries have scored 10 goals in added time during their record-breaking season, including a couple at Everton in August to turn a deficit on 90 to a victory at full-time.",

      "— AFC Bournemouth 🍒 (@afcbournemouth) August 31, 2024",
      "14) No one needs telling that trailing to Tottenham usually means nothing. But don’t go ahead against Brighton and think it’s job done – those Seagulls will still nick your chips and unload on you as they go.",
      "15) Pep Guardiola, much like Sir Alex Ferguson, likes his teams to put their foot down come January. But Manchester City coughed and spluttered so much through the first half of the season, the Premier League’s best record in 2025 was unable to save their season.",
      "",
      "16) Tables are fun, aren’t they?",
      "Spurs should not be blamed for reconsidering the future of Ange Postecoglou, while Manchester United really ought to give Ruben Amorim another think.",
      "Oliver Glasner got into the mind of Pep Guardiola to end the major trophy drought of Crystal Palace and make a fair few people look foolish in the process.",
      "Chelsea playmaker Cole Palmer ended his long goal drought, and deservedly so. This was his game, everyone else including Liverpool was just living in it.",
      "Liverpool wrapped up their long-inevitable Premier League title success as they entirely overwhelmed a predictably hapless and hopeless Spurs.",
      "It was not a classic between Manchester United and Man City but Bruno Fernandes tried his best and Pep Guardiola kept things interesting after the game.",
      "Declan Rice rescued Arsenal twice and then absolutely nailed them after their draw with Manchester United. But Gary Neville is not bothered about all that."

      "2024/25 was rubbish, was it? Here’s why it’s been the best season since Leicester won the Premier League in 2015/16.",
      "Send your views – preferably on anything but VAR – to theeditor@football365.com…",
      "",
      "Whistle blower\nAlright then. A few thoughts on the Man Utd/Villa controversy. I’ve caught up now having been out playing cricket and reading/hearing about what was happening from the BBC live feed, fielders, mates on WhatsApp. Whilst umpiring. Good job there were no vociferous LBW appeals.",
      "Law 12 states a goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball with the hand when: ‘The ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface or by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper has made a save’…",
      "What an earth does the second half of that sentence mean. ‘by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds…’ Genuinely, can anyone explain that to me? If that ball is in contact with the back of a keepers hand they’re deemed in control? If it’s touching the elbow? Why do they makes the laws so ambiguous? I wouldn’t expect my keeper to get away with Bayindir’s error, so (along with seemingly the majority of others) thought the goal should have stood. However…",
      "That, alone, has not cost Villa a CL spot. In fairness as well, I’m not sure McGinn or Emery claimed afterwards that it did. The complaint to the PGMOL seems a little churlish, but it is only a ‘complaint’. Or, if viewed differently, a suggestion of how to improve things.",
      "Villa are not asking for anything specific in regards to that inicident. In the 90 minutes against a poor Man Utd team Villa were awful. They froze when in mattered most. (Palace and Olympiacos anyone?). Martinez’s madness is a fitting way for him to end his Villa tenure. What on earth was he thinking? Hojlund had so much to do still. Hojlund!",
      "Villa have missed out on goal difference having drawn twice with Ipswich and conceded late late goals far too often (Bournemouth at home, City away, Forest away… I could go on). There are plenty of moments over 38 games where Villa could have done better. The thing is though, both things can coexist. I.e. that decision could have cost us CL football whilst, at the same time, Villa didn’t turn up and should take a look at their own performance in that game and over the season.",
      "Anyhoo, three years in a row in Europe ain’t too shabby. I would imagine Villa will be amongst the favourites in the Europa League as well. What’s that Unai? Oh, you have, have you?\nGary AVFC, Oxford (Never a dull moment with Emi!)",
      "MORE: Emery ‘owes the referee a drink’ for screwing Aston Villa as ‘man child’ ruins Villans legacy",
      "",
      "The VAR debate rages on\nSo with due deference to Villa fans who will doubtless still be traumatised, I don’t think the refereeing f*ckup was that bad.  Bayındır was clearly very very close to having both hands on the ball, and there’s so few “player kicks the ball out of the keeper’s hands” incidents that I’m not sure how the ref is supposed to be able to tell whether it’s a foul or a fumble if they’re even slightly unsighted.",
      "I do completely understand Villa’s point about having a very new-to-the-PL ref who hasn’t got much experience of VAR when two experienced refs are assigned to the meaningless Liverpool and Arsenal games – a more experienced ref might have held on two seconds before blowing.",
      "The issue is VAR’s ironclad rules about what it can’t be involved in, particularly the absolute cut off when the whistle goes again.  Going back to the Liverpool Spurs fuckup, surely everyone would be okay with Spurs kicking off, the VAR officials screaming in their ear they should have awarded a goal, the ref blowing dead and giving the goal?",
      "We’ve seen a ton of really dodgy decisions this year where the ref has given a yellow and suddenly VAR is entirely excluded.  There’s also the daftness where once VAR is looking at an incident, it can only give pens, reds or no foul.  Surely once you’ve got VAR involved they should be allowed to give the correct decision, rather than “whoops, not my department”.",
      "I realise more VAR is probably not what anyone else wants, and I realise there is a safety aspect to making sure everything stops when the ref blows up, but surely there could be some flex here?  I also realise there is a certain level of “can’t we just have some common sense”, but I think there’s some helpful flexibility available here.",
      "I feel for the refs having to ref the rest of a game knowing they’ve made obviously bad decisions and can’t correct it because the rules say it’s the wrong kind of mistake.\nDan, Plastic LFC",
      "",
      "What a VARce\nWell done VAR once again for interfering and screwing up and costing two clubs a fortune.",
      "Firstly, having enjoyed a full season without the Stockley Park idiots, we then have to welcome them for the Champo final at Wembley. Without VAR, the Blades second goal stands as the ref allowed the goal, and in all probability, we go up to the Premier League. But no. In steps VAR and overturns the decision (correctly) and we manage to screw it up by sitting back and allowing Sunderland to win the game. Cost to United – around £130m as an estimate.",
      "Then we get the farce at OT when VAR cannot step in because the schoolboy running the game blew his whistle before Villa scored. What is the point of having VAR if a clearly wrong decision cannot be rectified? If that goal stands, then the probability is that Villa either win or hold out for a draw. Cost to Villa – around £100m as an estimate.",
      "That’s two incredibly expensive decisions influenced (or not) by VAR. They should be made to re-imburse Villa and should be barred from all future play off finals where teams are used to not having the interfering prats doing all they can to rule out goals. Leave it to the ref and the lino’s.",
      "At first, pretty peeved that we didn’t make it 10th time lucky in the play-offs (lost the previous 9), but on reflection, I think we may have swerved another season of misery and frustration dealing with VAR decisions. Good luck to the Black Cats – they are going to need it – but I think I’d rather enjoy the game than put up with the VAR nonsense.",
      "Either scrap VAR or fix it, because at present what we cannot cure, we have to endure.\nBladey Mick (Happy days are here again)",
      "",
      "Sadly, VAR\nDear all,",
      "Another Premier League weekend, the last until August, but, sadly, VAR dominates a lot of the conversation. It even leaked into the Championship play off final and the decision to use it just for one game should be coming under a lot more scrutiny than it has so far.",
      "However, for those criticising individual decisions, and the whole VAR circus, no matter how justifiably, I would like to remind you that last summer, one Premier League club instigated a vote on whether the whole thing should be abandoned, at least until it could be overhauled and reformed, a proposal which was defeated by a margin of 19-1.",
      "In other words, if you support a Premier League club, and your team isn’t called Wolves, your club voted to retain the whole wretched procedure, ending up with some of the nonsense we’ve seen this past weekend. It is overwhelmingly tempting to use the phrase ‘We told you so’, so I will. You voted for it, this is the result.",

      "What did people prefer as the alternative? Another Man City procession? Another season of the big boys sharing out the domestic cups between them?",
      "No, this has been the most refreshing season since Leicester won the league.",
      "Liverpool have been imperious in the league from start to finish (until they hit the beach for the last few games) and topped the Champions League group stage above all 31 other teams. No one saw that coming did they.",
      "Newcastle broke their 50+ year drought in the Carabao Cup amid emotional scenes you’d have to have a heart of stone (or be a Mackem) not to have enjoyed. Palace win the first trophy in their long history, seeing off City in the FA Cup final. And to top it off Spurs broke their 17-year drought by clinching the Europa League in an all English final.",
      "We’ve also seen the rebirth of one of the most storied clubs – Forest – as a force at the top end of the table.",
      "And let’s not forget the shambles that is the modern day Manchester United – don’t tell me that hasn’t been entertaining, albeit in a macabre, sadistic way.",

That replay confirmed my memory of watching the game live that Salah’s shot was far from special.  He struck the ball straight at the Palace keeper and it took a big deflection off a defender into the goal.",
      "Why did every single match report praise Salah for “brilliantly” setting a new record with absolutely no mention of his good luck with the deflection, nor the fact that Palace ended one place lower in the league as a direct result?",

      "He got a boo 2 weeks back for being perceived to have led on the clubs and fans. Klopp (decent man) came in and said his piece to admonish the fans, and Trent received the treatment he deserved (on the balance: minor boos for walking as a free agent; and extended laudatory applause At introduction and at end of game).",
      "It was also really heartwarming to see both Palace and Liverpool giving each other guards of honor. Both teams congratulating and applauding the achievement of the other team.",

      "But then it happened, the wood work shook, the incredible fans roared, and we somehow managed to get over the line for penalties, and then the nervousness left. You could tell from the expressions and body language that only one team was going to win it from that point forward.",
      "All that was left was for the Aberdeen FC social media team to drop one of the funniest memes I’ve seen for a while (yes recency/affiliation bias) and for the rest of the weekend to disappear in a red fug.\nTuna Stubbs, Aberdeenshire",

      "It may well have been the worst season in Manchester United history but a bloody good one in general for those fortunate few who have managed to escape Old Trafford.",
      "Here’s a team of former Manchester United players, including those out on loan who have surely played their last game for the club, who would give Ruben Amorim’s lot an absolute hiding, even with some square pegs in round holes in the seemingly unworkable 3-4-3 formation.",
      "",
      "GK: Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace)\nThere have been plenty of calls across the season for Manchester United to re-sign David De Gea, in a majestic combination of amnesia and arrogance given he was really quite terrible before he left the club and almost certainly wouldn’t want to leave his cushty gig for Conference League qualifiers Fiorentina to tend a goal barraged by opposition players behind a more deplorable United side than he had to endure in his time at Old Trafford.",
      "We accept that he probably wouldn’t have been as bad as Andre Onana, but Dean Henderson would have been a marked improvement. He made the most of his good fortune in the FA Cup final to play a huge hand in helping Crystal Palace to their first trophy and has been consistently excellent all season.",
      "",
      "CB: Aaron Wan-Bissaka (West Ham)\nHe’s been a near ever-present for West Ham and we suspect that would also have been the case had he stayed at United. Arguably West Ham’s best player this season and inarguably their most consistent.",
      "Often criticised at United for failing to get forward enough from right-back, Wan-Bissaka’s seven Premier League goal contributions is comfortably more than any Red Devils defender/wing-back, with Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez closest on a paltry three.",
      "",
      "CB: Willy Kambwala (Villarreal)\nThe United academy graduate was very much an outsider at the start of his first season in Spain, featuring just once in the opening 17 La Liga games, but has forced himself into the side in the second half of the campaign, starting 12 games and playing in all-but three, at the expense of fellow Old Trafford defector Eric Bailly, to help Villarreal back into the Champions League.",
      "",
      "CB: Alvaro Carreras (Benfica)\nPresumably in a bid to drum up some sort of positivity after a God-awful season that’s set to precede a limited summer transfer window, Real Madrid being on the verge of completing the £42m signing of Carreras from Benfica is being widely reported as a ‘huge boost’ to United owing to their sell-on clause of around 40 per cent.",
      "And sure, they could absolutely do with that cash, but that’s a well-discovered silver lining of a transfer for a left-back-cum-centre-back that United have been crying out for all season whom they sold to the Portuguese side for just £5m a year ago.",
      "",
      "RM: Antony Elanga (Nottingham Forest)\nAfter Elanga covered 85 metres of the City Ground pitch in just nine seconds, taking seven touches, the last of which was a perfectly directed shot into the corner to beat Andre Onana, a report detailing the United chiefs’ ‘reservations’ ahead of sanctioning his £15m departure to Forest came to light.",
      "They weren’t convinced Elanga could ‘parlay his phenomenal physical talents into breaking down stubborn defences’. Less than three weeks later the club were considering a summer move to re-sign him.",
      "",
      "CM: Scott McTominay (Napoli)\nWe’re not going to pretend we ever thought Neapolitans would be visiting a McTominay shrine at the end of a debut season which has seen the Scot named Serie A’s Most Valuable Player after winning the Scudetto, and it’s obviously far more absurd in hindsight for United to have sanctioned his £25m exit, but it always felt weird that they were turning their nose up at an experienced academy graduate who had scored seven Premier League goals from midfield in his final season at Old Trafford.",
      "All of his ‘pure profit’ cash being spent on half of Manuel Ugarte adds unnecessary salt to the wound.",
      "",
      "CM: Fred (Fenerbahce)\nIt would have been almost too perfect after McTominay won his title for Fred to have done the same at Fenerbahce after years of the pair being castigated as one ‘McFred’ at the base of Manchester United’s midfield.",
      "Fred and Fenerbahce fell short to the behemoth Galatasaray, but the Brazilian has managed five goals and six assists from midfield as a key part of Jose Mourinho’s side.",
      "",
      "LM: Antony (Real Betis)\nHe’s now got as many assists (5) in less than four months at Real Betis as he managed in two-and-a-half years at United and will match his Red Devils goal tally (12) if he scores a hat-trick in the Conference League final against Chelsea on Wednesday.",
      "After two goals and an assist in the two-legged semi-final against Fiorentina and scoring in his final league game, having barely ever registered in the minds of opposition managers preparing to face United, Antony will be the player Enzo Maresca will be most wary about ahead of that game.",
      "",
      "RAM: Mason Greenwood (Marseille)\nA predictably fraught relationship with tough taskmaster Roberto De Zerbi has led to suggestions Greenwood could leave at the end of the season, but Marseille will be loathe to lose a guy who has topped the Ligue 1 goalscoring charts, level on 21 with Ousmane Dembele.",
      "",
      "LAM: Marcus Rashford (Aston Villa)\nVery, very funny that he ends the season with more Premier League goal contributions for United (5) than both Rasmus Hojlund (4) and Joshua Zirkzee (4) having not played a game for them since December 7, and having seen what he produced for Aston Villa since his January loan we have little doubt that a 20+ goal season will be in the offing next term no matter where he goes.",

      "\"We always prepare two plans,\" said the Portuguese at the start of the club's preseason tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong. \"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad.",
      "\"We can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan, that is to bring in some new players, but our big plan is to improve the team we have, to improve the Academy.",
      "\"It was the past, so it can be the future. It can't change much because of Financial Fair Play, we are not allowed to do much, even with the Champions League, so we are prepared.\"",

      "\"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter,\" he said. \"It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for the hard questions, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",

      "\"So, I don't need rest, I just need to prepare for the next season.\"",

      "\"Again, when are you are in Man Utd, people are going to expect us to be on the top, but we have to understand the context, so I do not want the team to think of a big target, just the small target of winning the first game, then we pass to the second game.\"",
      "Meanwhile, not participating in Europe next season could be a positive for United as Amorim looks to build team unity going forward.",

      "The forward has enjoyed a standout season at Wolves, scoring 17 goals and providing six assists across 34 appearances.",
      "\"What happened [on Tuesday] is that United contacted Wolves and said they would like to trigger the clause but would like to pay the £62.5m in five instalments. Wolves turned around and said you've got to read the contract, it's there in black and white - we signed a new contract with the player in January, these are the terms of the contract, if you want him, the £62.5m needs to be paid in three instalments over two years. United have gone back to Wolves and said they'll accept those terms.",
      "\"United don't want to waste any time, they are pushing ahead to sign him and Wolves have said fine that's all good, you've triggered the release clause, we will now give you permission to speak to the player and also for the player to have a medical.",
      "\"So if all goes well with the medical, Matheus Cunha will become a Manchester United player.",
      "\"A lot of people who don't support Manchester United are asking, 'Where's the money coming from? We thought United were in trouble financially, we thought they'd missed out on the Champions League, potentially £100m, how come straight away they can afford to sign Matheus Cunha? Well obviously the £62.5m is not being paid in one lump sum, like most transfers it's being paid in instalments and it's going to be three instalments of £21m.",
      "\"Now for a club the size of Manchester United you would have to say that is affordable, of course they have got financial fair play PSR concerns like all other clubs, of course players will be leaving Manchester United this summer as well but Cunha won't be the only signing. I think they will make other signings, but the signings really have to work because you speak to a lot of people in football and they will tell you Manchester United's recruitment has just not been good enough.\""

      "Antony was the subject of allegations of domestic abuse by three women in September 2023, though he was not arrested or charged in either Brazil or the UK and denies the allegations.",
      "The case in Brazil closed in August 2024 but the Greater Manchester Police investigation into alleged incidents said to have occurred in the UK remains open.",
      "Ten Hag said in January last year that Antony's \"off-field issues\" had impacted his form, and on the eve of Betis' Conference League final against Chelsea, the winger teared up when speaking about the effect it had on him.",
      "\"I went through some very difficult times there that ended up affecting me a lot. But I am very grateful even for these difficult moments that I went through. Today, I feel much more mature, much more prepared, I feel much better.",
      "\"It was a moment when I thought about stopping playing. I no longer felt that desire to play football because of everything I was going through, because of all the accusations and because I had remained silent for so long.",
      "\"[My career] has changed a lot [at Betis]. It changed a lot because I needed to find myself, for everything I went through there in my personal life. I wanted to do things, but it seemed like it wasn't happening because I wasn't happy, I wasn't feeling that desire to play football anymore, and I needed to find myself.",
      "\"Playing football was always something that I loved and I went through difficult times when I didn't feel that pleasure anymore.",
      "\"I would always talk to my brother, I used to say, 'I can't do it anymore, I can't do it anymore'. He said: 'Hold on a little longer and things will change'.",
      "\"I even get emotional because it was very difficult for me. Only I know what it was like inside the house, not even having the strength to even play with my son, having days without eating, staying in my room.",
      "\"It was very complicated but with the help of my family with the help of God, I managed to turn things around. I'm already very happy here.\"",
      "Antony has scored nine goals and produced five assists in 25 appearances for Betis, becoming one of the standout players in Spain during the second half of the season.",
      "They have lost just four times since he arrived, helping them to finish sixth in LaLiga and reach the Conference League final as they bid for their first-ever European trophy.",
      "Antony praised head coach Manuel Pellegrini for helping him rediscover his form in his usual position on the right wing.",
      "\"From the first conversation I had with him, he gave me incredible confidence, he made me feel very comfortable,\" said Antony.",
      "\"And when I got here, the conversation we had was very positive. He told me: 'I know your potential, you didn't join the national team for nothing, you didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, you know what a player you are, you've been through difficult times and you have your responsibilities, you have your part of the blame too'. But he made me feel very comfortable.",
      "\"He always gave me a lot of confidence and he always told me: 'I don't want you to make 20 plays, I want you to make five, six with the aim of scoring, an assist, that will already help me a lot.",
      "\"I took all that advice and Pellegrini is a coach that I'm very grateful to.\"",
      "Antony joined Betis on a straight loan deal with his Manchester United contract running until 2027, with a club-held option of a further year.",
      "Antony admitted he has some regrets about his time at Manchester United and said he doesn't know what the future will hold.",
      "\"I have the feeling that I could have done more with the United jersey but I'm also very grateful for everyone's affection that I had there,\" he said. \"I even have a lot of contact there.",
      "\"It was a difficult moment that I went through, and today I'm smiling here and I'm happy.",
      "\"I always say that I'm doing my part. I'm playing football, I'm happy and I'm doing well. I don't know about the future.",
      "\"I'll keep doing my part so that when the transfer window opens, my agents are working on it. But now my focus is on doing well and we'll see what happens in the future.\"",

      "After the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season, we look at the trends and themes that defined the campaign, including the Champions League scramble, a Man City collapse (then recovery), a record-breaking Mohamed Salah and the rise of fast breaks",
      "Monday 26 May 2025 17:53, UK",
      "Liverpool are champions. Chelsea, Newcastle and 17th-placed Tottenham joined Arsenal and Manchester City by qualifying for the Champions League. And the three promoted teams went straight back down to the Championship. Again.",
      "As the dust settles on the 2024/25 Premier League campaign, we pick out some of the themes, trends and quirks that defined the season, from the top-five race to a widening gap at the bottom.",
      "The Premier League's title race and relegation battle were settled weeks in advance of the final day but the fight for Champions League qualification kept things interesting.",
      "Only three points separated third-placed Manchester City and seventh-placed Nottingham Forest going into the last round of games. Cue an almighty scramble to get over the line.",
      "The Premier League secured an extra spot in the competition thanks to its UEFA co-efficient and Newcastle were the beneficiaries, finishing fifth despite a final-day loss at home to Everton.",
      "Chelsea also made it, finishing fourth thanks to their victory over Forest, who had to settle for a Conference League spot, while Aston Villa's controversial loss to Manchester United left them sixth.",
      "Seventeenth-placed Tottenham took the number of Premier League teams in next season's Champions League to six with their Europa League final win, giving Ange Postecoglou a potential lifeline.",
      "But those who missed out are left to count the cost financially. Forest's seventh-placed finish still qualifies as overachievement but feels painful given how much of the season they spent in the top five spots.",
      "Villa, meanwhile, have to settle for a Europa League place which is likely to impact their summer spending plans, although glass-half-full Villa fans might say it gives three-time winner Unai Emery a better shot at winning silverware.",
      "Pep Guardiola's arrival at Manchester City prompted a stylistic revolution in the Premier League as teams embraced his short passing and patient build-up play. But has his influence waned?",
      "This season saw a growing emphasis on direct attacks and quick counters, typified by sides like Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth and Nuno Espirito Santo's Nottingham Forest.",
      "The increasing emphasis on direct play can be seen up and down the Premier League and it is reflected in the numbers. Fast breaks are happening more often than ever before.",
      "At 2.04, the average number of fast breaks per game is more than three times higher than it was in 2017/18 as teams increasingly favour speed and directness.",
      "Mohamed Salah left it late but his 84th-minute equaliser against Crystal Palace on the final day took him to a record-equalling 47 Premier League goal involvements.",
      "He is one of only three players to hit that total in the history of the competition and it is important to note that the others, Alan Shearer and Andrew Cole, did so in 42-game seasons.",
      "Salah was the Premier League's outstanding player and his importance to Liverpool's title triumph shines through in the number of points his goals and assists won the side.",
      "Injuries have been a common theme this season, with players missing over 25,000 days due to setbacks. That is the equivalent of 70 years.",
      "Hamstring problems accounted for more than 21 per cent of all the days lost from injuries in the Premier League, with knee injuries a long way behind as the second-most impactful category.",
      "Arsenal lost all of Bukayo Saka, Kai Havertz and Gabriel to long-term hamstring problems. Havertz took three months to recover, Saka needed four - and Gabriel is still out.",
      "Marcus Rashford's hamstring injury ruled him out of Aston Villa's run-in, while Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson missed a large chunk of the season too.",
      "Why are they so common? Well, workload could be one reason.",
      "For some sides, there are more matches than ever before due to extended European campaigns coming after Euro 2024. How Manchester City and Chelsea manage the Club World Cup this summer will come under the microscope too.",
      "But the intensity of the Premier League is also going up. After a few years of a steady climb, it has increased at a much sharper pace.",
      "England's top flight is more watchable than ever in that regard but can its own players - and specifically their hamstrings - cope?",
      "Rory Delap's legacy lives on - and no, we're not talking about the goalscoring exploits of his son Liam at Ipswich.",
      "This season has seen the long throw come back into fashion. Four seasons ago, chucking the ball into the box was a rarity, with long throws coming at an average of around three a week. Now we are averaging around 10 every matchday in the Premier League as more and more teams add to their set-piece arsenals.",
      "English sides have even taken their long-throw exploits into other competitions. Arsenal's Thomas Partey had 11 long throws in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Paris Saint-Germain, while Crystal Palace caused Manchester City all sorts of problems via Chris Richards' throws in the FA Cup final, seeing one goal disallowed from this method.",
      "Brentford have led the way on set-pieces this season, scoring six out of the eight goals scored from long throws in the Premier League. Bournemouth and Leicester also struck from them in the back end of the season.",
      "Remember, Thomas Frank's side have also added goals from kick-offs to their methods of scoring. Set-pieces are not just corners and free-kicks, you know…",
      "Going into the final round of games, Premier League teams had lined up in a 4-2-3-1 on 408 occasions - 112 more than in the previous season.",
      "On average, this setup featured in 54 per cent of starting formations, marking the highest usage rate for any system since 4-4-2 registered 54 per cent in 2008/09, before plummeting to just 12 per cent by 2013.",
      "No other system came close to 4-2-3-1 this season. The 4-3-3 was used 114 times, plummeting from 172 last year, while Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 appeared 117 times - overtaking 4-3-3 to become the second-most popular formation.",
      "Many fancied Manchester City to retain their crown and win a fifth consecutive Premier League title at the start of the season but their challenge collapsed during a period of unprecedented turbulence between November and December, when they won one game in nine.",
      "Pep Guardiola's side went from having a statistically-calculated 95 per cent chance of winning the title in September to having a one per cent chance only three months later.",
      "Rodri's ACL injury, suffered against Arsenal in September, was undoubtedly a key factor in the collapse but a broader rebuild has already begun. City recovered to clinch a Champions League spot but major improvement will be needed to get back to their previous level next term.",
      "Of the 10 games played on the final day of the season, only two ended as home wins. Home comforts just are not what they used to be.",
      "Home advantage continued to decline this season, with only 40.8 per cent of games won by the home team, compared to 34.7 per cent won by the away team.",
      "With the exception of the period when games were played behind closed doors during lockdown, the percentage of home wins in England's top tier was lower this season than in any previous campaign dating back to 1888, continuing an intriguing trend.",
      "Is this the season the 'Big Six' concept died?",
      "Their cumulative total of 378 points was their lowest since the clubs all finished in the top six for the first time in Premier League history in 2010/11.",
      "Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea comprised the Premier League's top four, but the two others, Manchester United and Tottenham, finished 15th and 17th, respectively.",
      "The same data still has Manchester United and Spurs in the bottom half, at 11th and 14th.",
      "It might be time to reassess the so-called 'Big Six'.",
      "Of course, it is not just about the Premier League itself. This season also saw several teams end long trophy waits.",
      "Newcastle celebrated their first major trophy in 70 years by beating Liverpool to win the Carabao Cup.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first piece of silverware in the club's 119-year existence by beating Manchester City to lift the FA Cup.",
      "Then there was Tottenham, ending a 17-year wait as they put their domestic struggles to one side to claim Europa League glory by beating Manchester United in the final.",
      "For the second consecutive season, all three promoted sides went straight back down.",
      "For Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton, read Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester.",
      "It is a phenomenon that had only occurred once before in Premier League history, back in 1997/98, and it underlines the widening gap between the Premier League and the Championship.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester recorded the lowest combined points total by the three relegated teams of any season in Premier League history",
      "The graphic below shows how net spend typically correlates with survival but this season proves it might not save you.",
      "Southampton, Ipswich and Leicester had a far higher average net spend than Sheffield United, Burnley and Luton last season but it still was not enough to keep them in the division.",
      "Good luck, then, Leeds, Burnley and Sunderland. Recent evidence suggests you might need it."

      "Monday 26 May 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Aston Villa have made an official complaint to the PGMOL over the selection of referee Thomas Bramall for their Premier League final-day match against Man Utd, which Champions League-chasing Villa lost after having a goal controversially ruled out.",
      "The defeat saw Villa finish sixth in the league, meaning they missed out on Champions League football next season when just a point would have seen them secure the top-five finish necessary to qualify.",
      "After the first-half sending-off of goalkeeper Emi Martinez, Villa's 10 players thought they had taken the lead in the second half when Morgan Rogers poked the ball free from Altay Bayindir and curled the ball into an open net, only for Bramall to disallow the goal for an alleged foul on the United goalkeeper.",
      "The referee awarded a free kick to United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession, only for replays to show he did not have both hands on the ball when Rogers poked it away. Because Bramall blew his whistle before Rodgers' shot crossed the goalline, VAR was unable to intervene.",
      "Villa were down to 10 after Emi Martinez's red card late in the first half, but thought they went ahead midway through the second with the game still at 0-0.",
      "Under little pressure, Man Utd keeper Altay Bayindir made a mess of sliding onto the ball in his box. Villa's Morgan Rogers dislodged the ball before swivelling and firing into the empty net, seemingly giving the visitors the lead. At the time, the goal would have seen Villa climb into the Champions League places with less than 20 minutes left on the final day of the season.",
      "The goal was disallowed by referee Thomas Bramall, who adjudged Rogers to have kicked the ball out of Bayindir's grasp. However, replays show the United 'keeper had lost possession before Rogers' intervention.",
      "Because Bramall blew the whistle before the goal was scored, VAR could not intervene and the goal did not stand.",
      "Amad Diallo scored for Man Utd three minutes later before Christian Eriksen's penalty doubled United's advantage in the 87th minute. The 2-0 loss at Old Trafford meant Villa missed out on Champions League qualification on goal difference, while a point would have been enough to lift them into fifth following Newcastle's 1-0 defeat to Everton.",
      "On Sunday evening Villa confirmed a complaint had been made, saying: \"Aston Villa can confirm the club has written to the PGMOL to raise concerns over the selection process of match officials following today's game with Manchester United at Old Trafford.",
      "\"With such high stakes surrounding today's fixture, the club believe a more experienced referee should have been appointed. Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr. Bramall was the second least experienced.",
      "\"The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers' goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "\"As per the standards that have been established over the course of the season, a decision to whistle early is clearly inconsistent with current refereeing guidelines. VAR exists to ensure that these types of situations receive the scrutiny they deserve. Unfortunately, the technology was not allowed to serve its purpose.",
      "\"Ultimately, we acknowledge that the outcome for us will not change, but we believe that it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure that high stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure that the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.\"",
      "Bramall has officiated 11 games in the top-flight of English football this season and 17 other match officials have taken charge of more fixtures than him throughout the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "\"The complaint is not about the decision,\" Villa's director of football operations Damian Vidagany said post-match. \"The complaint is about the selection of the referees. One of the most inexperienced referees for one of the most difficult matches of the season involving another four or five teams.",
      "\"It's not about the decision. The decision is clear. It's a mistake. The referee apologised for the mistake. We can do nothing. The problem is why the experienced international referees were not here today.\"",
      "\"The referee's call was a free-kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession,\" read a Premier League match centre statement on X.",
      "\"The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\"",
      "\"The goal (being) disallowed was the key moment but overall they deserve it more. We were resilient with one player less and we could score one goal. It was a good opportunity to continue being resilient and keep the result.",
      "\"I speak to the referee and he knows it (was a mistake). But I don't want to speak about VAR.",
      "\"We go to Europa League but we were close to Champions League. Our objective (at the start of the season) was to be in Europe, and we have to be happy and proud with what we did.\"",
      "Villa captain John McGinn has slammed the \"incredible\" decision to rule out Rogers' goal at Old Trafford during the 2-0 defeat which cost the visitors a spot in the Champions League.",
