      "Bruno Fernandes' days as a Manchester United player could be numbered with Al-Hilal offering huge sums to lure the player to Saudi Arabia. The skipper has excelled since the appointment of Ruben Amorim, but a move is not out of the question.",
      "Around £100million could come United's way if they choose to cash in, whilst the player himself could land weekly sums of £700,000. The Saudi outfit want to add a star name to their squad before the Club World Cup this month - and will spend big to do so.",
      "Their interest in Fernandes has been ongoing and it leaves the player and his club with a decision to make. Amid the need for a rebuild, Unitedr could massively benefit from the cash injection.",
      "Fernandes will also turn 31 later this year and there continues to be question marks over whether he truly fits into Amorim 's system once he gets the players he wants.",
      "His output this season has been sensational, albeit largely in a losing effort. United have endured a dire campaign and they missed out on Europe when they were beaten in the Europa League final. That has placed even more strain on the club's financial situation.",
      "However Amorim has told United chiefs to find other ways of making money rather than selling their star man, despite the player himself seriously considering the offer he has in front of him.",
      "Amorim claims, through conversations with Fernandes, that the Portugal star wants to stay put. He said: \"Of course I am the manager, the coach, but sometimes it is the decision of the player, but of course I talk with him, I explain things and I just have that feeling. When you talk to someone, you have that feeling if he wants to stay.",
      "\"Of course in a lot of games this season he was so frustrated, but he knows what we are doing. The feeling that I have every time I speak to him is he wants to continue for sure at Man Utd. But you never know.\"",
      "Fernandes has been spotted dining with Portugal pal Joao Cancelo - who has been dubbed a \"secret agent\" by fans as the former Manchester City full-back looks to convince the United star to join him at Al-Hilal, where fellow Portugal international Ruben Neves is also in the squad.",
      "Well his agent Miguel Pinho has been in Riyadh for talks with senior Al Hilal individuals and those in Saudi see it as a positive sign that discussions have been held.",
      "Paul Scholes is among those who admits the sort of sums being offered cannot be turned down. He admitted: \"When you’re getting £100m for him you snap their hand off and take it.”",
      "Fernandes has admitted he would leave Old Trafford if United decided it was in their best interests to cash in. “If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it is what it is,” he said. “And football sometimes is like this. I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go.\"",
      "His social media activity has also served to fuel the rumour mill. He recently posted a Portuguese quote on his social media account which translates to: “If you tried and failed, congratulations! There are people who don't even try.”",
      "Well they are are lining up Sporting Lisbon’s attacking midfielder Pedro Goncalves as the man to fill the void that could be left by Fernandes. The Red Devils would have the finances to meet Sporting’s £70m valuation of Goncalves if they do cash in.",
      "Goncalves plays in a more advanced role than Fernandes after Amorim transformed him into a potent attacking midfielder throughout their time together in Portugal. He can also play out wide, which gives the team more versatility.",
      "The £100m they would receive would also help them improve other areas of the pitch. Meanwhile the £62.5m capture of Matheus Cunha from Wolves goes someway to replacing the goals and assists provided by Fernandes - and there's an argument that the Brazilian better suits the 3-4-3 system in Manchester.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "It has been reported that the Saudi offer will only last for so long and Al-Hilal want an answer within days. Their lucrative bid will be rescinded if they do not hear back soon, putting Fernandes and United on a timer.",
      "The United skipper has met with Al-Hilal's full-back Cancelo, formerly of Manchester City, and national team-mate with Fernandes. A snap of them at a group meal in a restaurant has seen speculation soar that a deal could be sorted within days with Cancelo playing his part.",
      "The ex-City man was 31 last Tuesday and a birthday cake with candles was presented to him at the restaurant as he celebrated at the weekend. Fernandes was by his side having made the trip back from United's post-season tour of Asia.",

      "Liverpool legend Graeme Souness has warned Manchester United \"there'll be more Alejandro Garnachos\" if they don't change their culture at the club. Garnacho appears to have fallen out with manager Ruben Amorim after being benched for the Europa League final defeat against Tottenham - and left out altogether for the final day clash against Aston Villa.",
      "Garnacho is the latest player to have clashed with Amorim after Marcus Rashford, with both players struggling to deliver on their promise after being dropped by Amorim at various points this season.",
      "Rashford is almost certain to depart if United can identify a club who will pay their £40million asking price, while Garnacho is also expected to leave after Amorim reportedly told him he must \"pray\" he could find a new team. After their Europa League loss to Spurs, Garnacho admitted his frustration over not being picked and said the team's season was \"s***\".",
      "Souness - who played 354 times for the Reds before managing them for three years in the 1990s - feels both players are examples of a poor culture in the dressing room and said there was \"too much money and respect\" influencing young players.",
      "\"The fact Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave Manchester United underlines why I have persistently said he is a classic example of a young player who has had too much too soon,\" he told the Daily Mail.",
      "\"That's too much admiration, too much money, too much respect from within the football club and too much from outside, from the public. It puts players like him in a headspace that is detrimental to their growth as a human being and as a football player. It's compounded by the fact he is at Manchester United where a player's profile, even before he has even appeared regularly for the club, is bigger and wider than with any other club in the country.",
      "\"Marcus Rashford, has one season of scoring 30 goals and what does the club do? Give him over £300,000 a week. Look at how that has worked out.\"",
      "Souness claimed there weren't enough experienced leaders in the dressing room to help Garnacho stay grounded and cited Cristiano Ronaldo as a player who the youngster could have benefited learning more from. He insisted when he was a player, he felt \"insignificant\" despite being club captain, because manager Ronnie Moran kept them on their toes.",
      "\"You often hear United managers talk about the culture being wrong. Who does Garnacho have to look up to in that dressing room, that is setting an example? Someone he would want to become. They had the best example in the world and let him go: Cristiano Ronaldo. He would have been worth keeping for the example he set. Staying on after training, dedicating his lifestyle to the sport.",
      "\"At Liverpool you were never allowed to have a big head on your shoulders. That's why I cite Ronnie Moran as the greatest influence on my career. I was captain of Liverpool, but I felt insignificant. Statistics tell you we were pretty good, but Ronnie never let us become 'Billy Big Heads'.\"",
      "Garnacho is now being linked with a move to Chelsea after returning from the club's post-season tour to Asia. The 20-year-old made it clear he was unhappy to travel after uploading a picture of the airport runway after getting back home, with the caption: \"Finally\".",
      "Napoli have also been mentioned as an interested party in the player who managed 10 goals and nine assists in all competitions for United this season.",

      "Manchester City have opted against including James McAtee in their squad for the Club World Cup as their neighbours Manchester United continue to circle. The snub could prove telling as the academy graduate weighs up his future.",
      "City will jet halfway across the world to play in the tournament but won't go with McAtee, who instead has been added to England’s pre-tournament training squad ahead of the U21s Euros in Slovakia.",
      "McAtee has enjoyed moments in a City shirt, but is still very much establishing himself. He scored an FA Cup hat-trick several months ago and has also contributed in the Premier League, but won't get the chance to rub shoulders with the squad's senior stars at the FIFA tournament.",
      "As a result potential suitors are beginning to circle and one of those is the Red Devils. Selling direct to the Old Trafford outfit would prove a hugely controversial move, especially as McAtee is tipped to have a bright future.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that Guardiola's decision to overlook him could spell the end of his time on the blue side of Manchester. The Catalan has been honest about the state of affairs and whilst he wants to keep the 22-year-old, he would understand his desire to play regularly.",
      "He said in April: “For the age, I’d like him to stay. But I understand players want more minutes. He can play different positions but I don’t know how the squad will be and we will see.”",
      "Another factor at play is that McAtee’s contract expires in 2026 - leaving the City hierarchy to either hand him a new deal or cash in before he becomes a free agent. The academy graduate has excelled on loan in the Championship previously, but would command a higher move were he to head away from the Etihad.",
      "McAtee himself is keen on a move to the Bundesliga, where he's been linked with the likes of Bayer Leverkusen. He's seen first-hand how young English players have thrived in the Germany environment with Jadon Sancho and Jude Bellingham among them.",
      "Letting McAtee leave would represent a risk for Guardiola, who has copped criticism for allowing City's academy products to leave before giving them a proper shot. Several of them have gone on to excel elsewhere, Morgan Rogers among them.",

I think the recruitment team for Manchester United would have seen, and the coaches here would have seen, what he did to Man United at Old Trafford.

      "Manchester United's potential new signing Matheus Cunha has a track record of being the catalyst for change at his former clubs, something that could prove invaluable to the Red Devils. Cunha, 26, is seen as the kind of player who can turn a team's fortunes around – a quality Manchester United are in dire need of after a disappointing Premier League campaign and their loss in the Europa League final.",
      "It appears the Wolves star is set to be Ruben Amorim's inaugural acquisition this summer, barring any unforeseen hitches. Negotiations are currently ongoing between United and the Midlands club regarding the payment structure for his £62.5million buyout clause.",
      "His time at Bundesliga outfit Hertha Berlin, which he joined in January 2020, saw him rise to cult status among fans. He was also credited with playing a pivotal role in saving the club from relegation, according to Hertha writer Marc Schwitzky.",
      "“Cunha played his way into the hearts of the Berliners,” Schwitzky told The Athletic in January 2023. “He came in January 2020 when the team was completely down and was possibly the main factor in them not being relegated.",
      "“Normally, it is a problem when a team has no offensive flow, but for Cunha, exactly this freedom was perfect, he blossomed completely.",
      "“Many games of the second half of 2020-21 became a Cunha show. Again and again he led the way with spectacular scenes, he didn’t seem to care about all the pressure of relegation, he was just happy to be able to play so much.",
      "“He also started the 2021-22 season fantastically, in the first 10 games he was directly involved in nine goals. But then he fell into a dip in form that he couldn’t get out of.”",
      "Cunha's temporary loss of form led to tensions with Hertha's then-coach Bruno Labaddia, who questioned his tactical discipline – with discipline in all its forms being a recurring theme in Cunha's eventful career.",
      "Despite his obvious talent, Cunha's temperament has been a cause for concern. While netting 17 goals and providing six assists for Wolves across all competitions this season, he also faced behaviour issues.",
      "The 26-year-old was handed a two-game ban in December after appearing to elbow an Ipswich Town staff member before removing the same staffer's glasses. In March, he was also suspended for four games after headbutting Bournemouth's Milos Kerkez and being escorted down the tunnel during an FA Cup tie.",
      "Ex-England striker Gary Lineker is just one who has sent a warning to United, claiming that Cunha could suffer from \"lacking team principles and work ethic\".",
      "\"He's an incredibly talented player. There's a slight question mark against Matheus Cunha in terms of managers,\" Lineker said on the Rest is Football podcast recently. \"He's either brilliant or he can be accused occasionally of lacking team principles and work ethic.\""

      "Bruno Fernandes once quit his former club Udinese because they were underperforming - a move that mirrors his current situation at Manchester United. The Portuguese international has reportedly become a top target for Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Despite being under contract until the summer of 2027, Fernandes’ agent recently met with Al-Hilal officials at the Four Seasons Hotel in Riyadh, where there were positive talks between the two parties stretching late into the night.",
      "The Saudi club are understood to have made the United captain a lucrative offer. Yet, they reportedly informed him that it is a one-time opportunity as they look to sign him within the next fortnight so he is eligible to play at the Club World Cup.",
      "Reports also state the 30-year-old is seriously considering leaving Old Trafford in a staggering £100million transfer after a dismal season under head coach Ruben Amorim, where United endured their worst ever Premier League finish.",
      "While it is still not clear whether Fernandes will part ways this summer, he once left Serie A side Udinese for similar reasons. The playmaker moved to Italy aged 17 and spent five years in Italy, initially at Novara before a move to Udinese in 2013.",
      "But after an impressive first season with the side, his manager Francesco Guidolin decided to step back from coaching, which played a key role in Fernandes leaving for Sampdoria in 2016. In a stark parallel to his time at United, Fernandes recalled that Udinese team having quality players but not being able to produce what was expected of them.",
      "He said in an interview with Cronache di Spogliatoio via Get Italian Football News: “The three years I spent at Udinese were not easy in terms of the team because we didn’t have great campaigns, except for the first one where we had a great squad. We had a strong team, but we weren’t able to achieve what was expected of us.",
      "“Then in the second and third year they decided to change manager after so long with Guidolin, and it didn’t go very well. Guidolin had managed to get the most of my abilities, and made me understand that I had to train more, but he had faith in me.”",
      "Fernandes, who joined United in January 2020 from Sporting CP, made the emotional admission years later that his time in Italy left him wanting to quit football altogether. It was there, whilst playing for Udinese, that he got extremely homesick and lonely, which forced him to reconsider his career path.",
      "Discussing his time in Serie A, he told the Players' Tribune: \"I was all on my own at 17 in a new country. I didn’t speak the language, and I didn’t know anyone, and let me tell you, it was hard. It was unbelievably hard and lonely. There were times when I wanted to quit, absolutely.\"",
      "Fernandes revealed it was his father who instilled a mentality in him to constantly strive for improvement, and admitted he would not have \"survived\" playing in Italy were it not for that attitude.",
      "After a season at Sampdoria, Fernandes returned to his homeland for Sporting, where he thrived before United came calling. He has comfortably been the Red Devils’ best performer since then, winning their Player of the Season award four times, including this campaign.",
      "Old Trafford chiefs are understood to be relaxed about his current situation, wanting to keep their talisman while still being prepared to entertain bids for any player. The club's failure to secure Champions League football by losing the Europa League final has only heightened their need to sell players in order to rebuild the squad while still complying with Financial Fair Play and Profit and Sustainability Rules.",

      "Some players need an arm around their shoulder and others need to be shouted at.",
      "The modern-day player tends to fall into the first category and Manchester United's first summer signing, Matheus Cunha, hasn't been afraid to admit that he needs to feel \"affection.\"",
      "Cunha reached a low point while at Atletico Madrid and he credits Wolves for breathing new life into his career. “Sometimes all we want in life is affection,” said Cunha in a fascinating interview with The Guardian in March.",
      "\"People think we have everything, but we’re human beings, too. We need a bit of understanding – we have our difficulties. Wolves gave me that joy back. The fans [have given] me a lot. The status I have today, the player I am now and the happiness I’m feeling, it’s because of them.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim's man-management should get the best out of Cunha. Amorim builds personal relationships with his players and the Brazilian should respond well to his approach.",
      "Cunha initially struggled at Wolves under the old-school Julen Lopetegui, but the appointment of Gary O'Neil helped him play with a smile again. \"Gary understood me completely,” Cunha said. “He came in and said: ‘Man, I think you’re an incredible person, but you need affection.",
      "\"And I’m going to give you affection. I’m going to complain when I need to complain, but I’m almost going to be family for you'. When someone sees something in you beyond the player, it touches you. These conversations and these lessons were of great importance in my life.”",
      "Cunha can speak Portuguese, English, Italian, French, German and Spanish fluently, which means he'll transcend the dressing room at Carrington, and he seems like a certainty to become popular among his peers.",
      "Former teammates have spoken about Cunha being a 'joker' around the training ground. Cunha has a strong personality and ticked a lot of boxes when United completed their due diligence.",
      "United believe Cunha is a brilliant addition on and off the pitch. He is passionate and extremely competitive, typical South American traits, and he won't need any time to adjust to the demands of the Premier League.",
      "The transfer made infinite sense and United deserve credit for getting the deal confirmed on the opening day of the transfer window, albeit Cunha still needs his visa to be completed.",
      "Cunha could have left Wolves in the January transfer window, but he wanted to stay and ensure they avoided relegation, which says a lot about him as a person. “I had a lot of offers but I wouldn’t feel well if I had done it,” he said.",
      "\"Some things you can’t control but I couldn’t leave the club in the middle of the season, in a difficult situation, in the relegation zone. Now, we’re close to achieving our goal [of staying up]. But I’ve made it clear that I need to take the next step. I want to fight for titles, for big things. I have potential.”",
      "Cunha has just celebrated his 26th birthday and he moves to Manchester as he enters the peak of his career. He is a proven Premier League star, but there is a strong feeling that there is still more to come from him.",
      "That is an exciting prospect considering no Brazilian player in Europe has scored more league goals than Cunha (27) since the start of last season, with the likes of Vinicius Jr, Raphinha and Rodrygo all behind him."

      "The 30-year-old is United's most influential player and Ruben Amorim is keen to keep Fernandes and build the team around him.",
      "However, £100million is a lot of money in a market where United have to make sure they comply with profit and sustainability rules",

      "He missed a large chunk of this season through injury but bagged 18 goals and 17 assists under the United boss in Lisbon last season.",
      "Sporting value Goncalves at £70m but it might be a price worth paying.",
      "Eze has just enjoyed a stellar season at Crystal Palace which culminated in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and booking their place in next season's Europa League.",
      "The 26-year-old scored 14 goals and registered 11 assists in all competitions and has long been on United's radar.",
      "He is said to have a release clause of £60million plus add-ons and he would be a transformative signing for any Premier League side.",
      "United's cross city rivals Manchester City are interested in a move for the Lyon playmaker who United know all about.",
      "Two of the 21-year-old's 12 goals this season came in either leg of United's dramatic quarter-final win over the French side in the Europa League, while he also bagged 20 assists in all competitions.",
      "He is leaving Lyon this summer and is said to be available for between £20-25million. That appeals to City as they look to sign a replacement for Kevin De Bruyne and it should appeal to United, too.",
      "Sancet missed Athletic Bilbao's Europa League semi-final defeat to United and his impact on the Spanish side was sorely missed.",
      "The Spanish international scored 17 goals in all competitions for the Basque outfit and, at 25, his best years are still ahead of him.",
      "He is a wildcard option and would likely be expensive given he has seven years remaining on his current deal at San Mames but he is certainly a player to consider."

      "It would be a huge blow to lose Fernandes and Cunha would have to step up to help fill the void. Fernandes has been a consistent source of goals since he signed from Sporting Lisbon in 2020, and Cunha will be a great signing if he can have half the impact of the Portugal international.",

      "Napoli were entertaining bids in the region of £70million for Osimhen before talks collapsed with Chelsea. Around £30m and Hojlund would reportedly be entertained for a sensational swap deal.",
      "There is also the issue of Osimhen's wage demands. They are rarely a problem in football, but the striker's demands were too much for Chelsea last summer and could be a stumbling block again.",
      "Osimhen is said to be demanding huge wages and Ineos have lowered the wage bill since gaining control of football operations, so he would have to compromise to sign for United.",

      "The 26-year-old has now jetted off to South America to join up with the Brazil squad ahead of their World Cup qualifiers against Ecuador and Paraguay but his move to Manchester is expected to be announced in the coming days.",
      "It was revealed in April that Cunha was United's number one target to fill one of the attacking midfield spots in Ruben Amorim's preferred 3-4-2-1 formation and the club have moved quickly to secure his signature.",
      "United have activated his £62.5million release clause and his 17 goals and six assists for Wolves this season make him an exciting addition to the club's attacking options.",
      "But with Cunha's arrival pretty much signed, sealed and delivered, the question now is what United's next transfer this summer will look like.",
      "One of United's next priorities will be sorting the future of captain Bruno Fernandes, one way or the other.",
      "United would ideally like to keep their player of the season and the task of trying to replace not only the influence Fernandes has on this United side, but also the 19 goals and 20 assists he registered this season will not be easy.",
      "United need clarity over Fernandes' future. If he is staying then they will build the team around their talisman. If he is leaving, then they need to find a quality replacement as soon as possible.",
      "As of now, United's immediate priority in the transfer market is to sign a new forward. United had eyed up Liam Delap as their new forward for next season, with his £30million release clause and age profile making him an attractive proposition.",

If Chelsea pay the £25million obligation in Sancho's loan then that will recoup £92million straight off the bat.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told he can leave United, with Chelsea and Napoli said to be interested, while Tyrell Malacia is surplus to requirements after an underwhelming loan spell with PSV.",
      "Casemiro is in the last year of his contract and could be sold this summer, while Kobbie Mainoo could also be moved on if he does not sign a new deal this summer.",

United have agreed to pay his £62.5million release clause and are now locked in talks over how to structure the payments.",

      "Alongside Cunha, United want to strengthen their attacking pool by recruiting a striker. Ipswich Town's Liam Delap had been identified as their primary target but he is now closing in on a move to Chelsea, meaning United will have to look elsewhere for a goalscorer.",
      "At this juncture, United are not understood to have settled on an alternative. Signing a reliable striker has to be United's top priority this summer, making links with Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli ace Victor Osimhen understandable. However, United may find it difficult to recruit the goal-getter they are in need of as a result of failing to qualify for next season's Champions League.",
      "Elsewhere, United are expected to try and recruit a goalkeeper to challenge Andre Onana for the No.1 spot, while the addition of a midfielder is also on their to-do list.",
      "However, much of what United will be able to do on the subject of incomings will rest on outgoings. It is no secret they need to generate funds via player sales this summer, and departures could reach double figures. They have also got to be mindful of the financial rules.",
      "\"It's not going to change so much because we have the financial fair play rules,\" Amorim told the media in Malaysia. \"We are not allowed to do much in this summer, even with Champions League, so we are prepared for that.\"",
      "However, United plan to raise funds by selling attackers Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony. Garnacho has been informed he can leave at the right price and Rashford, Sancho and Antony have been identified as priority sales.",
      "Rashford is available for £40m, Antony will be available for around £32.5m and Chelsea, who signed Sancho on loan last summer, have an obligation to buy him for a fee that could be as high as £25m. However, the Londoners can pay a £5m penalty not to sign him on a permanent basis.",
      "In addition, no other member of the squad is safe from being pointed in the direction of the exit. Bruno Fernandes is currently the subject of interest from Al-Hilal and it remains to be seen if the Saudi Arabia side will table a bid matching the £100m figure that has been touted. The United captain is understood to be considering the move.",
      "Meanwhile, United also want to sell forgotten left-back Tyrell Malacia, who has spent the second half of this season out on loan at Dutch side PSV Eindhoven. A decision on Casemiro's future could go either way after Amorim indicated the Brazilian had changed his mind amid the role he played in helping United reach the Europa League final."

It’s like they’re just pretending everything is normal when it’s an absolute bin fire. This is no way to run a business and certainly not a football club.",
      "It doesn’t take the wisdom of Solomon to realise a) earning £7.8million from a trip to Malaysia is peanuts which they routinely fritter away on poor players and which they could surely drum up through a commercial deal for United-endorsed pressed duck feet or something, b) they’ll ruin the brand further by losing games and playing poorly, c) the players will be exhausted and humiliated by being beaten, which means they’ll not be rested or inspired for a new season, meaning more failure, and d) there’s a limit to how much you can charge to see such a terrible team, putting off more fans than they can attract, making them feel resentful towards the club. Things are going downhill and fast, aided by Airhead Jim’s lack of basic business acumen.",
      "The club clearly sees the players like donkeys at the beach, forgetting that they are actually human. Does anyone think the best way to get over an appalling season is to get booed off in Malaysia? Actually booed off in Kuala Lumpur by people who had paid up to £260 to witness these sweating bodies being hopeless. These have been loyal followers, prepared to pay to see the club, even in the knowledge it likely won’t be the first team.",
      "That is no way to enhance your brand, to say the least. Do you think they’ll keep buying merchandise in these circumstances? You do, don’t you, Ratcliffe, you fool.",

The manager obviously doesn’t have any confidence, saying, “We don’t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game – that is what happened. I always feel guilty for the performance of the team since the first game I was here,” as he continues his ‘please sack me’ campaign in earnest.",
      "This sort of overseas tour fails to see that every season is just one part of every year; what you do in the summer influences what happens in the new campaign. Players don’t just reboot in mid-August and start fresh again and I really don’t think this is appreciated. Given that pre-season will start in mid-July and internationals are in the second week of June, they’ve all got about four weeks’ rest, unless Stupid Wurzel has got another trip planned, probably to the Arctic to play Eskimos.",
      "They obviously need a good rest and a re-set, not flogging even harder. They’re no good and don’t play well together, but it’s not a lack of games to blame. The football matters. It should be at the core but it seems almost incidental. Losing to sides you should easily beat just makes everything, on all levels, worse. Just playing terribly in more games isn’t going to make them improve. Even winning occasionally has proved to be nothing but a blip in a long-term trend.",
      "Failure is endemic and needs correcting from the boardroom to the pitch. And to do all this just after the season ended seems more akin to punishment. And don’t forget, players need to be sold and desperately. Given how mediocre they are, exposing their inadequacy is probably a bad idea if you want to get rid of them (and why wouldn’t you?) and want to get a decent price for them.",
      "They already have little or no leverage as it is; getting beaten in Malaysia just makes it easier for buyers to drive down the price, giving them less money to replace them with. How did this stupid actually become a billionaire?",
      "These things don’t take a degree in Business Studies to work out. It seems there is no limit to some people’s ability to see black as white as they go about their business, doubtless wondering who broke all the china in the shop and sh*t up the walls, completely unaware it’s them.",
      "It’s clear the people involved in driving this juggernaut don’t know where they’re going, haven’t even got a driving licence and are wearing a blindfold. Put more prosaically, they’re sh*te. The trouble is, they don’t realise, even as they plough the juggernaut into the sea. They think they’re great and can do no wrong, even as the once-great edifice crumbles to dust at their feet. Their delusion is total. But you can’t tell stupid people they’re stupid because they’re too stupid to understand.",
      "Their obsession with generating money is making them worse and effectively crippling them. I repeat, £7.8 million, that’s all they’re generating by doing this. That’s 10% of an Antony. It’ll pay a player’s wages for approximately four months. In return they get a knackered, demoralised squad and a devalued, reviled brand. Is it worth it? Only a fool would say yes. But that’s exactly who is in charge. Shambolic."

      "The pre-season target was safely ticked off by January thanks to a bizarre run of stunning home form (combined with honking away form) that was followed by a spell of stunning away form (combined with honking home form).",
      "That led us to a largely facetious mid-season challenge but wouldn’t you just know it, Brentford went and took it seriously and achieved it anyway.

Having done exactly what he told us all he would do at the start of the season, Ange Postecoglou crafted one of the greatest narrative arcs in Barclays history and only the dreariest, most soulless of creatures, only someone entirely devoid of human emotion, would now want to cut this short without finding out whether season three actually can be better.",
      "Daniel Levy is apparently that man. He is, to paraphrase Stewart Lee, a man so lacking in imagination that if locked in a room containing nothing but a tea cosy would not even have the curiosity to discover whether it could make a serviceable hat.",

      "But at the same time he has absolutely earned the right to fail on his own terms now and the fact Levy seems so determined to let all the air out of the balloon so soon after Spurs fans got the one thing they have craved above all else for at least a decade is just maddeningly yet entirely Spurs.",

      "Four wins from the last 17 games of the season when there were no mitigating factors of competing priorities was a miserable effort, especially when the last three of those wins were against Leicester, Man United and West Ham. Winning at Arsenal, again, was admittedly a good bit.",
      "There were arguably some encouraging signs in the final weeks of the season, but eight points from the final six games isn’t that great really, and when all those points come from games against Southampton, Tottenham, Man United and Ipswich it becomes an even flimsier looking foundation for significant growth.",

      "Wolves being Wolves, every chance now that it’s that part of the run-in rather than the six straight wins that preceded it that they now carry into next season, leaving us already worried about the 25/26 target we’ve given them: ‘Start properly, don’t require managerial change by November‘",

      "According to reports, Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal think an ‘agreement is close’ for Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes amid one ‘key factor’.",
      "Fernandes was Man Utd’s best performer in a disastrous 2024/25 campaign and he’s one of the few players who can hold his head high after their 15th-place finish in the Premier League.",
      "Despite this, Man Utd could sell Fernandes in the coming days as he is being pursued by Al-Hilal as they look the finalise their squad for this month’s Club World Cup.",
      "Man Utd’s dire performances in the Premier League and loss in the Europa League final leave them with a limited summer budget and they likely need to sell to buy.",
      "So, while it would be incredibly difficult for Man Utd to replace Fernandes, his sale for £80-100m would significantly ease their financial troubles and enable Ruben Amorim to sign more upgrades suited to his 3-4-3 system.",
      "READ: Six reasons Man Utd should replace Ruben Amorim with Arsene Wenger…",
      "Fernandes has largely remained coy when asked about his future, but recent reports have indicated that he is open to a move to the Middle East outfit.",
      "It’s been said that co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe ‘risks a fallout’ with ‘seething’ Amorim if Fernandes is sold, while another recent report claimed he is ‘very close’ to an exit.",
      "Now, journalist Ben Jacobs has provided a clear update, claiming Al-Hilal chiefs believe they are “close to an agreement” with Fernandes following “positive” discussions with his representatives.",
      "Jacobs also claims that one ‘key factor’ will be behind his final decision, and a deadline has been set.",
      "Jacobs tweeted: “Al-Hilal now believe an agreement with Bruno Fernandes is close after a week of positive meetings.",
      "“Fernandes is currently deliberating with his family. A key factor in whether Fernandes agrees will be if the move is also right for his family. It will be more than just a football decision. Hilal want a final answer by Friday.",
      "“No formal approach or bid yet to Manchester United, but Hilal’s belief is a sale will be sanctioned if Fernandes asks to leave. #MUFC still insist they don’t want to sell their captain”",
      "Reporter Graeme Bailey has already revealed that Al-Hilal are “pushing the boat out” for Fernandes, with £100m “a lot to turn down”.",
      "“Al-Hilal are going for this. Inzaghi, Ronaldo and now the Premier League’s finest,” Bailey said.",
      "“I am told that Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal to get Bruno. There is a real belief within the corridors of power in Saudi football that they can get Bruno.",
      "“They are offering him wages only Ronaldo and Benzema have surpassed, they really are pushing the boat out.",
      "“United have told Bruno he isn’t going…but 100 million would be a lot to turn down for a player of his age, no matter how important.”",
      "Man Utd are prepared to sell another starter to Saudi Arabia this summer amid interest in Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United have been told by Danny Murphy that the consequences will be “devastating” if their best player leaves this summer amid heavy Saudi threat.",
      "Real Madrid legend Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly told Al-Hilal that they will need to sign Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes if they want him to join.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes holds the key to the Red Devils’ potential efforts to sign Victor Osimhen in the summer, according to reports.",

      "On Sunday, Man Utd announced the signing of Cunha in the most expensive transfer of this summer’s transfer window *so far*.",
      "The Red Devils made the versatile attacker their No.1 target and activated his £62.5m release clause after he contributed 17 goals and six assists for Wolves in all competitions during the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "This is a key signing for Man Utd as they have been toothless in attack under Ruben Amorim and Cunha fits perfectly into the head coach’s 3-4-3 system.",
      "Ferdinand has given a few reasons why he thinks Cunha will be a great signing for Man Utd.",
      "“He needs to reboot this attack. We don’t look like we’re going to score goals in open play unless it’s Bruno [Fernandes] or maybe Amad [Diallo],” Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Six reasons Man Utd should replace Ruben Amorim with Arsene Wenger…",
      "“We’ve taken Wolves’ top goalscorer this season. He’s got 16 goals to his name in all competitions.",
      "“He’s one of the players that I mentioned a few weeks ago: if I had a shopping list, he would be on there.",
      "“He knows the Premier League so he doesn’t need any adaptation time.",
      "“This is a huge factor… if you’re going to buy players from foreign leagues, players that don’t have the experience in the Premier League, there is always a risk.",
      "“But he has the experience here, we’ve seen him here, he grew up a Manchester United fan.”",
      "There is a drawback to this deal, though. This is because Ferdinand believes Cunha’s arrival will force Man Utd to offload Marcus Rashford and one more player this summer.",
      "“I’m hearing he’s taking the No.10 shirt which was Rashford’s shirt. What does that mean for Marcus Rashford, man?” Ferdinand continued.",
      "“There’s a lot of questions that will be asked about that as well and it might answer a few questions. But 17 goals and six assists in 36 games for a Wolves team is impressive.",
      "“The recruitment team, the coaches and the players will have seen what he did to Manchester United at Old Trafford. He was slicing through Manchester United like a hot knife through butter.",
      "“He looked like he had the power and I think he fits a Ruben Amorim player profile perfectly. He’s quick, he’s dynamic, he’s aggressive, he’s capable of dropping deep and transitioning with the ball, he can pass and he can threaten the opponents with a goal by running deep or coming short.",
      "“I think he’s the type of player that Ruben Amorim has been crying out for and with neither [Rasmus] Hojlund or [Joshua] Zirkzee at the moment looking like the answer in advanced positions, I think he has a real opportunity to play across one of those three positions quite easily, as a nine, as one of the guys off the sides.”",
      "He added: “The only thing I would say in this window is that £60m in this window, it will remain to be seen what type of work gets done when you’re spending a big chunk like that.",
      "“As much as I’m happy with it, it means they are going to be some going out of the door and it means there’s going to be somebody like Garnacho or Kobbie Mainoo… and Marcus Rashford.",
      "“They will be the players that will be going I think, so when you look at it it’s a lot of money. But where are you going to get players that can come and affect your first-team for that type of money?”",
      "Rio Ferdinand was “hurt” to see long-term Man Utd target Jeremie Frimpong sign for arch-rivals Liverpool ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "Barcelona could make an offer for an Arsenal star if they fail to land Marcus Rashford from Man Utd this summer, according to reports.",
      "Marcus Rashford may well have played his last games for both Manchester United and Aston Villa. So where next?",
      "Man Utd duo Rasmus Hojlund and Mason Mount need to leave Old Trafford this summer to rescue their careers, according to ex-Red Devils defender Paul Parker.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly been ‘informed’ of the potential to sign a former Chelsea striker, among a number of other Premier League clubs.",
      "United have not had the best time of it with striker signings in the past couple of years. They signed Rasmus Hojlund for £72million two years ago, and Joshua Zirkzee joined in a £36.5million deal last summer.",
      "Both men played more than 30 Premier League games in the season just gone, but neither passed five goals.",
      "As a result, there’s speculation regarding both being sold, with United to sign a better striker. They have some big names on their radar, but might struggle to convince any great players to join given their lack of any European football next term.",
      "They have been offered a solution, though, as TBRFootball reports United are among the clubs who have been ‘approached’ by the representatives of Tammy Abraham, and ‘informed’ on his willingness to return to the Premier League.",
      "Abraham played 89 times in the English top flight, largely with Chelsea, and scored 26 goals and assisted seven more.",
      "He moved to Roma in 2021, and went on loan to AC Milan this season, racking up 47 goals and 20 assists since heading to Italy.",
      "At Milan this season, Abraham was directly involved in 17 goals, but wants to come back to England, and several Premier League sides are informed on his situation.",
      "TBRFootball’s report states West Ham, Everton and Newcastle have all taken an interest in him, while Aston Villa and Leeds are both keeping tabs on the striker’s situation.",
      "Villa know about Abraham’s qualities, having had him on loan when they were in the Championship in 2018-19. That was their last season in the second tier, with the striker helping them back to the top flight with 25 regular season goals and three assists, as well as a goal in the playoffs, which Villa won.",
      "Though that was now seven seasons ago, it has been suggested a few times in recent seasons that Villa might like to bring Abraham back to the club if possible.",
      "It looks unlikely that Marcus Rashford will be signed permanently, given he and Barcelona want to join forces, so Villa might well be keen on signing a new striker."

      "Garnacho has caused controversy at a few times of late. On United‘s tour of Southeast Asia, he’s suggested to have pushed past a fan in the street.",
      "Prior to that, he referred to United’s season as sh*t and questioned why he didn’t play more than a cameo in the Europa League final, which the Red Devils lost to Tottenham.",
      "There’s a lot of speculation over his exit, with Ruben Amorim reported to have told Garnacho: “You better pray that you can find a club to sign you.”",
      "According to The Sun, the winger has chosen Chelsea as his next destination, having reportedly told his agent to make it clear he’d like to land at Stamford Bridge.",

      "“England is the best place to do that and Chelsea have assembled a lot of good young players.”",
      "But the suggestion that Garnacho’s United career is over has been supported, with it also said: “Garnacho seems to think he’s the next Ronaldo and this was his ‘exit interview’ moment, like he wanted to annoy people so much that there was no option but to sell him.",
      "“It’s not gone down well with the rest of the players. “There is a feeling that while he’s a good player, he’s not quite as good as he thinks he is.”",

      "Our friends at TEAMtalk have recently stated that the Blues are not out of the picture, but could find the transfer hard to come by given United would rather not strengthen another Premier League side.",
      "Whether they would let Garnacho go to another side if they were so desperate to sell and knew there were no other options is another question.",

      "Ruben Amorim lost the Europa League final to a historically bad Tottenham side and himself said he was willing to leave “without conversation or compensation” if he was not wanted by Manchester United.",
      "In truth he will surely be given a summer to build a squad closer to something that suits his formation.",
      "So who could take over at Manchester United; we have the big names with the latest odds here…",
      "",
      "9=) Zinedine Zidane\nPeople keep trying to make Zinedine Zidane to United happen. It’s not going to happen.",
      "",
      "9=) Roberto De Zerbi\nThe current Marseille manager will remain high on any list of possible managers for any big Premier League club because he ‘knows the league’, doesn’t he?",
      "",
      "6=) Unai Emery\nMight be the one high-profile Premier League manager for whom the Man United job holds more appeal than Man City. He’s already had one crack at replacing a Big Six legend whose fingerprints are all over the club. At least with United he’s a good few steps removed from all that. But swapping what he’s got going at Villa for United would still be a questionable move.",
      "",
      "6=) Marco Silva\nHas done quietly brilliant things at Fulham, but would Manchester United settle for quietly brilliant things? They probably should.",
      "",
      "",
      "5) Kieran McKenna\nHis agent played a blinder as reported interest from Manchester United and Chelsea led to a four-year contract at Ipswich that made him one of the best-paid managers in the Premier League. But would United fans really countenance the appointment of a relegated manager?",
      "",
      "4) Thomas Frank\nLinked with Tottenham and somehow that feels more likely than the big old leap to Manchester United from the safety and low expectations of Brentford, who really don’t care that he plays direct football. He was the favourite of Dan Ashworth but he is long gone.",
      "",
      "3) Gareth Southgate\nVery strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen. He said as recently as October: “I won’t coach in the next year for sure, I’m certain of that. I need to give myself time to make good decisions. When you come out of a really big role you need to give your body time, you need to give your mind time. I’m enjoying my life, so there’s no rush.”",
      "That hasn’t stopped him being described as a “master of manipulation” and being tipped for the big job, mind.",
      "",
      "2) Mauricio Pochettino\nChelsea chose the path of abject stupidity and it appeared to leave the path clear for United to pounce on a manager they had coveted back in his Tottenham days. They decided to eschew that option in favour of sticking with what’s been working so very well for them.",
      "Any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision making during this season are for now much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job.",
      "",
      "1) Oliver Glasner\nThat FA Cup win with Crystal Palace has led the Austrian to be one of the favourites for the Spurs job and now top of the list here…",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is running the risk of falling out with Red Devils boss Ruben Amorim over Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",
      "Manchester United continue to dominate the narrative and there is a new name touted as a potential manager in Saturday’s Mailbox…",
      "A former Manchester United star has revealed his main ‘fear’ with Ruben Amorim as the ‘jury is out’ on the under-fire Red Devils head coach.",
      "Manchester United winger Amad Diallo has revealed the feeling in the Red Devils squad after reports that Ruben Amorim essentially told Alejandro Garnacho his career there was over.",
      "Man Utd hero Patrice Evra has hit out at the Red Devils fans over their “disgusting” treatment of one player as Amorim claims his side “choke in every game”.",
      "Amorim has made up his mind and ‘the talk’ at Man Utd has now turned to where the midfielder might go and how much they can get for him."

      "Former Premier League midfielder Murphy does not feel Fernandes can be allowed to leave.",
      "Writing in the Daily Mail, he stated it is ‘imperative’ that the midfielder stays at United, as if not, and he kicks off next season in Saudi Arabia, the ‘consequences will be devastating’ for the Old Trafford outfit.",
      "Murphy has praised Fernandes for wanting to ‘stand up and be counted during a terribly difficult period’. He also stated that the recent successes of the club, reaching cup finals, is ‘down to Bruno’.",
      "The pundit suggests that the sale of Fernandes, who is 30 and would surely command a giant fee makes ‘financial sense’ but from a performance perspective he is ‘irreplaceable’.",
      "Indeed, though United want to sign a new striker, and the sale would help to finance that, whoever is signed would be ‘far less effective without having the wonderful passes and crosses Bruno would provide’ per Murphy.",
      "Speculation over Fernandes’ exit has been ramped up given Cristiano Ronaldo is being eyed by Al-Hilal, who wants Fernandes to join him ahead of the Club World Cup.",

      "“I am told that Ronaldo has told Al-Hilal to get Bruno. There is a real belief within the corridors of power in Saudi football that they can get Bruno.",
      "“They are offering him wages only Ronaldo and Benzema have surpassed, they really are pushing the boat out.",
      "“United have told Bruno he isn’t going…but 100 million would be a lot to turn down for a player of his age, no matter how important.”",
      "Man Utd are prepared to sell another starter to Saudi Arabia this summer amid interest in Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",

      "PSG have taken the long road to Champions League glory – with humiliations by Manchester United and Newcastle – but Luis Enrique has ended their ‘obsession’.",
      "",
      "“The Champions League is not at all an obsession – that is over. I said that at the first press conference with Luis Enrique,” said PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi with all the conviction of a man whose sportswashing had shrunk under the pressure of one too many loads.",
      "“We are building a new identity; our own style, our own principles of how to play, an offensive play, and a new culture. That’s what we want, and then the results will follow.",
      "“We are building a team that is really playing as a team. We want our players to enjoy playing, our staff to enjoy coaching, and for our fans to enjoy it when you watch.”",
      "Ten days later, PSG were beaten 4-1 at St James’ Park. The players, staff and fans cannot have particularly enjoyed watching Miguel Almiron, Dan Burn, Sean Longstaff and Fabian Schar score against Europe’s perennial underachievers – although the schadenfreude was irresistible for neutrals.",
      "It has been a long, arduous and often absurd journey to the summit. PSG have avoided the ultimate ignominy of exiting at the group stage ever since this odyssey began, but the trade-off for that has been a preposterous propensity to stumble at all manner of other hurdles: consecutive away-goal eliminations by Barcelona and Chelsea; victims of La Remontada; a humiliation so thorough it forced Manchester United to make Ole Gunnar Solskjaer their manager for more than two years; being entirely and utterly Karim Benzema’d in the Bernabeu.",
      "PSG and the Champions League had been in a toxic, unrequited relationship for years, and the former was kidding itself if they ever believed themselves to be in a position to declare it “over”.",
      "But Luis Enrique has broken the cycle.",
      "The Spaniard’s words at his unveiling became a eulogy at the funeral of Inter’s entire psyche. “The attacking identity is non-negotiable – it’s my philosophy. You have to adapt to your players, my job is to get the best out of my players individually and collectively. I am committed to putting a winning team together and I have no doubt that I will be able to do that and give PSG fans something they will like.”",
      "There were tears in the stands, in the dugout, on the pitch. It was historic but harrowing, a traumatic scene of youthful exuberance obliterating grizzled experience. It was the end of the road for Inter, who would have taken Boyz II Men 0 as early as the 20th minute had they been offered the choice. And after almost a decade and a half it is the belated start of what PSG hope to translate into a period of utter dominance.",
      "Over the course of those 90 minutes it was difficult to envisage any other scenario developing over the next few years. The youngest starting line-up in a Champions League final this century produced two of the five youngest ever European Cup final scorers. The man of the match was 19-year-old Desire Doue. The only player older than 30 of the 16 used was record appearance maker Marquinhos. This is not a group on the verge of disbanding.",
      "That provided an interesting juxtaposition with Inter, for whom this was a second Champions League final in three years, but with the tangible sense it would be their last together. The future of Simone Inzaghi is deeply uncertain, three of their starters were at least 36 and the rest were made to look twice as old. PSG started by hammering the ball out for a throw-in deep in Inter’s half and for the subsequent hour and a half rarely afforded them the opportunity to escape.",
      "This was their last stand and the early mistakes betrayed it, culminating in the double salvo from Federico Dimarco which ended the game as a contest. He was caught in his own offside trap and then later isolated by Doue down the right as PSG took the quickest two-goal lead in final history.",
      "Willian Pacho was winning everything, including a battle with Nico Barella as the Inter midfielder hoped to shepherd the ball out for a corner, only for the PSG centre-half to poke it away and launch the counter which produced the second goal. Achraf Hakimi started popping up at centre-forward and on the left-wing.",
      "Hakan Calhanoglu, the set-piece master, was gifted a presentable free-kick in the vicinity of the PSG area and thumped it straight out for a goal kick early in the second half; it summed the proceedings up neatly.",
      "Then came the landslide. Inzaghi made his changes, four by the hour mark. The sight of Matteo Darmian taking to the pitch somehow did not galvanise Inter but PSG derived motivation from it anyway, hitting a ridiculous triple punch of quality goals: Vitinha to Doue; Ousmane Dembele to Khvicha Kvaratskhelia; Bradley Barcola to fellow substitute Senny Mayulu.",
      "It was almost painful to watch by the end, particularly through the prism of the hapless Francesco Acerbi.",
      "Perhaps only Kylian Mbappe had a more uncomfortable night as the modern-day Michael Owen: the prodigy distracted by the lights of Real Madrid, only for his boyhood club to thrive and immediately capture the sport’s biggest prize in his absence. He might be able to console himself with having scored in that Newcastle defeat.",
      "As it is, the evening belonged not to Al-Khelaifi – despite some weird yet entirely predictable “win for football” nonsense – but Luis Enrique. His personal story is touching enough but even on a professional level it is refreshing to watch such a phenomenally talented and often overlooked coach achieve something so historic.",
      "This PSG success cannot be framed properly without acknowledging the vast spend needed to deliver it. With the highest wage bill in Europe and over £200m invested on transfers this season alone it is, in many ways, simple maths. But Enrique going where incredible managers before him could not at least means something.",
      "And that thing, ultimately, is a Super Cup final against Spurs. It is the showdown of Europe’s true greatest teams we all deserve, and the only real way to celebrate the long-awaited climax of an “obsession”.",
      "There are 10 Champions League final participants who are either Premier League rejects or never made it there at all…",
      "Chelsea rejected Luis Enrique twice, Arsenal turned him down for two reasons, Spurs pulled out at the last hurdle and Manchester United came close too.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain boss Luis Enrique insists he’s “not worried at all” about facing Arsenal after the French side’s unexpected defeat against Nice.",
      "Youri Tielemans and Luis Enrique have been speaking to the press ahead of Aston Villa’s huge Champions League clash with Paris-Saint Germain."

      "The report states:",
      "‘The tension of United’s trip appeared to be evident in a few instances of players flipping the finger to fans. Amad did so as he walked into the W hotel in Kuala Lumpur, following the first game, later apologising on social media in two posts a day apart but saying his mother had been insulted by an “unhealthy individual”. The words used are not clear from video footage of the incident.",

Garnacho also showed the gesture at a signing event for supporters in the Adidas shop at the Exchange TRX mall in Kuala Lumpur, causing bemusement to the person taking the picture and as he walked off the pitch following the game against ASEAN All-Stars, the photographer there complained.’",

      "‘But each one pushed back,’ the report states, with United eventually accepting Lindelof’s wife being heavily pregnant and Eriksen getting married as acceptable excuses for them not to travel with the group.",
      "Manchester United man Alejandro Garnacho has reportedly chosen a Premier League rival as his next club after it was felt he tried to “annoy people so much that there was ...",

      "Sure, United are in a bad place, primarily down to utterly appalling recruitment over the past 8-10-12 years, but the club isn’t dead just yet.",
      "And sure, the club has debt saddled on it by its owners – its not ideal, but again it’s not the death of the club just yet. Debt is designed for companies to use. It would have been nice not to have had the debt, but that’s our Glazers legacy, so we have to deal with it. People and pundits seem to say that United are dead and buried because this summer we can’t afford to stump up 100m for X and 75m for Y, and 80m Z wont come because we’re not in the Champions League.",
      "But that didn’t stop Bournemouth, Forest, Fulham, Villa (to name but a few) all climbing the table in recent seasons.",
      "Forest were many pundits’ picks for relegation last year, and having unearthed (amongst others) two very cheap diamonds in central defense, pushed for the top 4 until the very last game of the season. Bournemouth continue to sit top half of the table, give pretty much anyone a decent game, and have only ever paid over 25m once in their history. Ditto Fulham, who have never paid more than the 34m they paid for Emil Smith Rowe. Ditto Brentford. Villa only came back up to the Prem 6 seasons ago….!",
      "The point being, just because we cant have a summer of getting all the current fad names, doesn’t mean we’re done and dusted. Ok, I agree that the squad needs some decent additions, but at least our transfer business is getting better.",
      "6-8 years ago, we’d go and pay crazy money for names like Pogba and Di Maria, and then get frustrated when they didn’t return value. And fill in the gaps with loans of Falcao etc. Yuk.",
      "2-4 years ago was utterly disastrous – Sancho, Antony, (if Greenwood hadn’t smacked his girlfriend, we’d have saved £150m not having to buy those two), Hojlund (nowhere near value, but think he’s been unlucky, if still below average). I love Casemiro, but hard to say his signing was astute and financially sound.",
      "Last season – far better. Mazraoui, good value. De Ligt – meh, at least we didn’t pay 75, 40 was probably about right if he can stay fit. Yoro – looks a decent player and will only improve. Ugarte – hmmmm not so sure yet, looks a little lightweight for a DMC in the prem, and passing is shocking. Zirkzee – decent footballer, just a shame about his total lack of pace, odd signing.",
      "Amorim’s only signings so far: Dorgu – I’ve seen fans moaning about him cos he’s not playing like peak Roberto Carlos. The kid is 20 years old ….. what is it with people nowadays. He will get better, stronger, brighter. And Heaven, £1.5m for an 18 year old who already looks pretty useful, definitely great value.",

      "Personally I think this is all a bit premature and there’s too much reading into a couple of seasons where, frankly, the promoted teams were just poor and barely even gave themselves a chance at staying up.",
      "One of the arguments seems to be that of the other 17 clubs there are no obvious candidates to go down. But I disagree. We could easily have a very open relegation dogfight with any of West Ham, Wolves, Everton, Fulham, Bournemouth, Palace and Brentford all potentially in the mix with the 3 newbies.",
      "Who knows which of those clubs will lose key players and potentially their manager over the Summer. A lot can change from one season to the next. Sometimes even a small change can make a big difference. Just look at how Wolves were transformed when they replaced their manager. What if they lose Pereira and make a bad decision in appointing his successor?",
      "If you look back to the 22/23 season, the 3 relegated clubs finished 8th, 15th and 17th the previous season. Did anyone really see Leicester getting relegated that season? Not many, I imagine. Southampton went down after 12 consecutive seasons in the Prem and were not widely tipped to be relegated that season.",
      "And fundamentally it comes down to how well the promoted clubs prepare themselves. When my team Brentford came up, we added a few new faces but most of the promotion-winning squad remained intact. It was a long term plan coming together because we were (and are) an extremely well-managed club. Same with Brighton. Same with Bournemouth. Same with Fulham.",
      "So I really don’t agree it’s a closed shop. Is it tough to get promoted and stay in the PL? Absolutely. But why shouldn’t it be? In terms of depth, it’s the strongest league in the world, by a distance. But if clubs come up with no real vision and either just hope for the best or think throwing some money at players with little strategy will keep them up, they shouldn’t be surprised if they end up struggling.

      "“Our big priority is to strengthen what we have at home, renewals of Pedri, Gavi, Araujo, Raphinha, Kounde… I understand that when people talk about signings, they always think about players coming from abroad, but for me, renewals are also signings. Lamine is the best signing in history.",

      "United have been keeping an eye on Cunha's development since his impressive display for Wolves at Old Trafford in the opening match of the 2023/24 season.",

On the other side, sometimes it's [Joshua] Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",

      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",

      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turned 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",
      "While Gomes talks of Cunha's \"shooting and passing\" as well as his \"intelligence with the ball\", speak to Wolves captain Nelson Semedo, who has played with both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and he offers a fascinating assessment of Cunha as a human being.",
      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."

      "Bruno Fernandes is yet to make a decision on his future with Al Hilal willing to pay Man Utd £100m for their captain and nearly treble his wages; the potential sale poses a dilemma with the club in need of a cash injection to fund their rebuild but also so reliant on Fernandes",
      "Sunday 1 June 2025 19:13, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has often been relied upon as Manchester United's saviour - so it is fitting his parting gift could end up being one last rescue act.",
      "United always knew sales would be required this summer to create enough financial flexibility to reshape the squad for Ruben Amorim. Selling Fernandes was not part of that plan, the captain's future a widely presumed certainty until Al Hilal came to the table.",
      "Despite the Saudis' willingness to pay £100m for a player turning 31 in September, United and Amorim want to keep Fernandes. The United boss believes the midfielder wants to stay, though he could not guarantee he would. But can the club afford to turn this down?",
      "Such an offer is unlikely to come again given Fernandes' age. The windfall would be transformative for United ahead of a summer when the budget is pinched, and an overhaul is so dearly required. Fernandes' sale could kick-start a new chapter for the club.",
      "This rationale only holds up under the assumption that the funds would be spent wisely and, for a club with such a poor record in recruitment, it would be a huge gamble. No wonder there is scepticism. Go backwards again and relegation looms.",
      "Old Trafford has become a graveyard for stars over the last decade - Fernandes one of the few shining exceptions - and although INEOS are not to blame for that legacy, it highlights how tricky it would be to replace the club's best signing since Robin van Persie.",
      "We all know Fernandes is a production machine, but he has also become a leader. Imperfect, certainly. United's captain tends to try too hard when things go wrong - to his and the team's detriment. But where would they be without him?",
      "Well, United have not won a Premier League match without Fernandes since March 2022. The sample size is small, yet the record is telling. Six matches, five defeats and one draw. In a squad lacking in character and quality, Fernandes brings both in abundance.",
      "Fernandes' departure would rid United of their one elite player and surely make Old Trafford an even less attractive destination. Liam Delap has already chosen Chelsea over United. Finding adequate replacements is hard enough without Champions League.",
      "Emotionally, in a summer when academy graduates Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho appear set for the chop, on the back of hundreds of redundancies and the worst season for decades, the loss of Fernandes could bring the fanbase to its knees.",
      "In the context of the past year - and the past decade - when the club has been accused of losing touch with its identity, losing Fernandes would make United nearly unrecognisable heading into a summer that could become make or break for INEOS.",
      "If this were another club, it would be easier to predict how they might handle a similar scenario without such a glum outlook. The Philippe Coutinho comparison - although flawed - is an example of how a well-run club can sell a star to improve the collective.",
      "Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker were signed by Liverpool using the £146m fee paid by Barcelona. Their additions proved transformational for Jurgen Klopp, who would win the Champions League and Premier League in the next three years.",
      "Liverpool were further along in their rebuild, but the example offers a blueprint for how United could enjoy a similar transformation if Fernandes leaves. With a goalkeeper, central midfielder and striker dearly needed, £100m could fund a new spine for the team.",
      "Matheus Cunha, undeterred by the lack of European football, is already through the door. If others share his faith in the project remains to be seen, though the signing, sealed on day one of the window, suggests INEOS might be starting to figure things out.",
      "They will hope that is true after spending £200m in their first summer and taking the club from eighth in the table to 15th. Erik ten Hag was still in charge then though and the window had his fingerprints all over it with two more former Ajax players recruited.",
      "Now INEOS have another year under their belt and Amorim in place with a system that he has made clear will not change, the conditions certainly appear more conducive to a better window and the early signs are good.",
      "Cunha, 26, is one of a handful of Premier League-proven players United have signed while in their prime in the post Sir Alex Ferguson era - and if this is a sign of things to come, then INEOS are at least working to right the wrongs of the past.",
      "But funding moves for such players does not come cheap and could be difficult if Fernandes is not sold. Cunha, for instance, was £62.5m. Reports suggest that is more than half of the budget gone without any sales.",
      "If Fernandes stayed, risks would have to be taken on unknown quantities that suit Amorim's system, or he would have to put up with the current crop for longer. For a coach that could quickly come under pressure next season, neither sounds too appealing.",
      "But nor does losing Fernandes, and therein lies the dilemma. United want him to stay, so too does Amorim. The final decision, it seems, lies with Fernandes, who no one could blame for leaving after all he has put up with.",
      "United cannot afford to sell their captain but nor can they afford to turn down Al Hilal's offer."

      "Report as Man Utd beaten by ASEAN All-Stars in first friendly of post-season tour; Harry Maguire, Andre Onana, Patrick Dorgu, Casemiro, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Rasmus Hojlund, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho and Amad Diallo all featured for Ruben Amorim's side",
      "Thursday 29 May 2025 11:07, UK",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim admitted his side may \"need the boos\"  after they suffered a 1-0 defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in the first fixture of their post-season tour.",
      "Harry Maguire captained the side as first-teamers Casemiro, Patrick Dorgu, Andre Onana, Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund all started for United in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Jonny Evans and Amad Diallo were among 11 changes at half-time with the score locked at 0-0, but Maung Maung Lwin netted a 71st-minute winner for the South-East Asia XI to inflict another defeat on Amorim's struggling side.",
      "United were booed in parts for their lacklustre display by those in attendance and, reacting to his side's reception in the Malaysian capital, Amorim said: \"I'm always guilty of the performance of the team, no matter what. Since I've been here from the first day, I am guilty. The boos from the fans is something that we need, maybe. Because every game we lost in the Premier League, they [fans] were always there [supporting].",
      "\"It's like the way of playing, if they see that it's not working, they will change the way they behave. But I felt when we finished and walked away, the supporters were with us. But, again, let's wait for the next season.\"",
      "Amorim described United's season as \"disastrous\" after they finished 15th in the Premier League and lost to Tottenham in the Europa League final - and their poor form continued at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.",
      "Garnacho played the entire second half amid doubts over his future at the club, as did Fernandes, who has attracted interest from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal.",
      "A host of academy youngsters were given minutes which will be seen as the only positive from the defeat in front of a crowd of 72,550, more than 6,000 miles away from Old Trafford.",
      "United will play another friendly in Hong Kong on Friday for their final fixture of the tour which is reportedly set to earn the club £8m.",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada said before the friendly defeat that United will balance \"ambition\" with the need to be \"prudent\" in the transfer market.",
      "United's defeat to Spurs meant they missed out on silverware and Champions League qualification worth an estimated £100m, and the club have wasted little time trying to improve Amorim's side with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha set to sign.",
      "It could start a busy summer in terms of incomings and outgoings at Old Trafford, with chief executive Berrada confident about United's plans.",
      "\"I can't talk about specifics, but I can say that we've been planning for many months now,\" he told MUTV. \"We were ready for all the different scenarios, so now we know what we need to do.",
      "\"We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve, so (technical director) Jason (Wilcox), his team, Ruben have been in talks for many months.",
      "\"Now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent but at the same time with ambition.\"",
      "United's defeat in Malaysia came a week to the day since their Europa League final loss in Spain and just three days on from beating Aston Villa 2-0 in their Premier League finale at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim told fans that \"the good days are coming\" as the head coach apologised for a wretched campaign during an impassioned end-of-season address.",
      "United chief executive Berrada said: \"Ruben spoke really well on Sunday and he's right: the past is the past.",
      "\"It's important to learn. Now we need to stay together, stay united and I can only say again thank you to the fans.",
      "\"The owner has also been very supportive in this transition year and now we just need to work really hard and do everything we can to bring the club back to the top.",
      "\"I'm very excited about what's coming ahead of us. Like Ruben said, now we just need to work really hard as a unit, as a club and I'm sure the good days will be back, as he said.\""

River have an impressive record at home in the derby, losing just one of the last seven iterations.",
      "Mastantuono is no stranger to these big occasions, having already forged a pivotal role in River's first-team since making his debut at the end of January 2024 to become the club's third-youngest player.",
      "The left-footed midfielder has three goals and three assists across 11 appearances in all competitions this season."

      "Chelsea would like Jadon Sancho to stay if they can agree on contract terms that fit their wage structure; the Blues have a £25m obligation to buy the Manchester United loanee but can pay £5m should they opt against making the move permanent",
      "Friday 30 May 2025 11:17, UK",
      "Chelsea are in talks with Jadon Sancho's representatives about new contract terms.",
      "The Blues would like Sancho to stay if they can agree on contract terms which fit in with the wage structure at the club.",
      "Sancho joined Chelsea on loan from Manchester United last August, and Chelsea now have a £25m obligation to buy. They can pay United a £5m penalty to get out of the obligation to buy.",
      "United signed Sancho for £73m from Borussia Dortmund in 2021, and the 25-year-old has a year left on his lucrative United contract, which is believed to be worth up to £300,000 a week, with the option of a further year.",
      "There remains a chance that Sancho goes back to Manchester United even though Chelsea want him to stay, if contract terms can be agreed. Chelsea will not be able to offer him the same terms he is on at United as their policy is to sign players on long, incentivised contracts with lower base wages.",
      "Sancho came off the bench to score as Chelsea beat Real Betis 4-1 in the Conference League final on Wednesday night. His 83rd-minute strike to make it 3-1 at the time was his fifth goal of the season. The winger has also set up 10 goals this campaign across all competitions.",

      "Champions League football is not the main reason Delap is joining Chelsea. Instead, the style of play, a young squad, opportunities to play, the likelihood of being able to challenge for major trophies together for years to come and relationships with people already at Chelsea are understood to have played a part.",
      "Delap watched Chelsea's Conference League final win over Real Betis and was very impressed with the second-half performance.",
