      "Paul Pogba has struggled to make an impact at Monaco since signing for the club back in the summer(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Paul Pogba could soon face more career turmoil amid claims that Monaco are weighing up whether the former Manchester United midfielder still has a future at the club.",
      "Pogba, 32, was a free agent before joining the Ligue 1 outfit back in the summer after serving an 18 month doping ban. He put pen to paper on a two-year deal, however, his time in Monaco has been anything but fruitful, with injuries restricting him to a total of just 30 minutes of game time across three appearances.",
      "Per Italian outlet Gazetta, Pogba's failure to make a significant impact at his new club could see his time in Monaco cut short with their chief executive, Thiago Scuro, reportedly saying he may have to sit down with the player if things do not turn around, indicating Pogba's time at the club could be cut short.",
      "Pogba is currently sidelined with a calf injury that he sustained during a training session last month. Initially described as 'minor', the issue has sidelined him for seven games.",
      "As a result, Pogba will miss the chance to try and get one over on his former club, Juventus, whom he criticised for dumping him after he was handed a doping ban, when they face Monaco in the Champions League on Wednesday night.",
      "Pogba has hardly played for Monaco due to injuries(Image: SOPA Images, SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "Speaking in the wake of Pogba's latest setback, the club's head coach, Sebastien Pocognoli said: \"To have come back from where he was and to play again is already spectacular.",
      "\"But right now, I can’t look towards the future. He is working, and we are there to support him. I understand the concern but I can’t worry about that. I manage the team, and Paul is a part of what I want to put in place, as soon as he is ready to help us.\"",
      "Monaco face Rennes in league action and Strasbourg in the Round of 16 in the French Cup after locking horns with Juventus, however, it remains to be seen when Pogba will be ready to return.",
      "He was a free agent for seven-and-a-half months before agreeing to link up with Monaco.",

      "Despite joining Chelsea from Manchester City for £42.5million two-and-a-half years ago, Palmer is now reportedly considering a move back to the North West. According to The Sun, the England international would 'welcome' approaches from Manchester United if they pursue him this summer.",

      "Aftermath of the horrific Munich air crash in 1958 - which Harry Gregg survived",
      "One of the most iconic shirts in Manchester United’s history is going up for sale - it belonged to the ‘Hero of Munich’ Harry Gregg. Gregg survived the horrific 1958 plane crash and famously showed his courage by going back into the wreckage to save team-mates including Bobby Charlton. Now his goalkeeper’s jersey from that year’s FA Cup final is being sold at auction next month. It’s so famous because Gregg was wearing the shirt when he was notoriously bundled into the net for a controversial goal by Bolton Wanderers legend Nat Lofthouse. Some of his other shirts are also being auctioned - Gregg died in 2020 aged 87.",
      "The historic 1958 FA Cup final shirt that is being auctioned",
      "Football historian Peter Kenny Jones said: “The Harry Gregg Collection arrives at a moment when the sports memorabilia market is more informed, more discerning and more global than ever before.",
      "“Collectors are no longer simply acquiring objects; they are acquiring stories, context and cultural significance. This collection offers all three.",
      "“From the singular green shirt worn at Wembley in 1958, to European Cup exchanges with Real Madrid and Benfica, these items represent the intersections of sport, history and human resilience. They tell a story that transcends club rivalries and national borders.",
      "Harry Gregg and his team-mates in last team photo before Munich air crash(Image: Getty Images)",
      "“Sports memorabilia is not just a passion. It is an investment in the moments that shaped the games we love. In Harry Gregg’s case, it is also an investment in courage, integrity and a life lived with quiet dignity.",
      "“When the hammer falls in February, these shirts will pass into new hands. What they carry with them – the weight of history, the echo of crowds long gone, the legacy of a man who stood firm when it mattered most – will endure.” The shirt is expected to fetch £20,000 but could be sold for much more. The collection also includes match-worn and swapped shirts from domestic and European fixtures, reflecting Gregg’s standing in the game.",
      "Man United legend Harry Gregg in action - historic shirts now to be sold(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "They include a green Real Madrid goalkeeper shirt worn by Rogelio Domínguez in 1959 and acquired by Gregg following a post-match swap. And a black number one Benfica shirt worn by Costa Pereira during the European Cup quarter-final second leg against Manchester United in 1966.",
      "That match, played in Lisbon and won 5-1 by United, is remembered as the occasion on which George Best was famously dubbed “El Beatle”.",
      "A spokesman for the auctioneers Budds said: “Ten red shirts were prepared for the 1958 FA Cup final. Only one was made in green, leaving a single surviving example from one of the most significant matches in the club’s history.",
      "“The final itself remains debated. Bolton’s second goal came after Gregg was bundled over the goal line by Nat Lofthouse, in an era when goalkeepers had far less protection than they do today. The incident became part of a wider debate that later fed into changes in the laws of the game.",
      "In February 1958, Gregg was part of the Manchester United squad returning from a European Cup tie against Red Star Belgrade when their aircraft stopped to refuel in Munich.",
      "England legend Bobby Charlton who survived the Munich crash with Denis Law and George Best(Image: Getty Images)",
      "After two aborted take-off attempts, the plane crashed on the third, killing 23 people, including eight players and three members of the club’s staff.",
      "In the aftermath, Gregg went back to the wreckage to bring survivors out, including team-mates Bobby Charlton, Dennis Viollet and Jackie Blanchflower, as well as a young child. The actions led to the nickname that followed him for life. The ‘Hero of Munich’.",
      "Gregg was a central figure at Manchester United during the Matt Busby era, making 247 appearances for the club. He joined United in December 1957 for a fee of around £23000, which at the time made him the most expensive goalkeeper in the world.",
      "At international level, he was capped 25 times for Northern Ireland between 1954 and 1963, and represented his country at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden - where he was named the tournament’s best goalkeeper.",
      "In 2015, he launched the Harry Gregg Foundation, aimed at encouraging young people’s participation in sport while promoting education, heritage and social inclusion. It was an extension of the values he had carried throughout his life: humility, responsibility and community.",

      "And Carrick has enjoyed a dream start, having won each of his opening two games against Manchester City and Arsenal. One of his main success stories has been the form of summer signing Mbeumo.",

And despite his form having not changed too much since Carrick’s arrival, the Middlesbrough boss is seemingly taking a very different approach with his demands for the forward.",

      "“He’s got this flair in front of the goal. He’s very good in terms of assists as well.” I love his work rate. I love his behaviour on the pitch, technically, mentally as well. But more importantly, I like his movement, the link with his players all the time.",
      "“He brings something different up front. He’s not that physical, but in the meantime, he puts everything he has on the pitch. But I love him because he’s very intelligent.",

      "Representing a prestigious club like Manchester United can leave an indelible mark on a player, making it incredibly challenging to call time on a career in Europe. This was undoubtedly true for Javier Hernandez, who flourished after signing for the club under Sir Alex Ferguson but felt an emotional toll when his career at the top began to near its end.",
      "Hernandez arrived at United in 2010, the same summer he burst onto the global stage with Mexico's World Cup squad in South Africa. He adapted swiftly to English football, netting 20 goals across all competitions as Ferguson's side clinched the Premier League and reached the Champions League final in his debut campaign.",
      "The striker, known to fans as Chicharito, maintained double-figure league tallies in each of the following two seasons but failed to replicate that form under David Moyes. When Louis van Gaal took charge, securing regular first-team football appeared an even greater challenge.",
      "Hernandez received little opportunity from United's incoming Dutch manager. He featured in Van Gaal's opening league fixture but managed only 45 minutes, departing on loan a mere two weeks later and eventually leaving on a permanent basis in summer 2015, when Bayer Leverkusen came calling.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Chicharito might have played for United for the final time but he was still capable of proving his worth in Europe's elite divisions. The Mexican boasted a one-in-two goal average in Germany and netted 16 times in 55 Premier League games for West Ham on his return to England, despite having to adjust to working under three different manager across just over two seasons.",
      "He left West Ham in the summer of 2019, joining Sevilla, only to leave Spain after just a few months to join Major League Soccer outfit LA Galaxy in January 2020. More encouraging times lay ahead for the forward, but he was visibly emotional when acknowledging that beginning a fresh chapter signalled the conclusion of his European journey.",
      "\"I wanted to speak to you guys because the thing is about to get done,\" Hernandez, who is now 37 years of age, said in an emotional video. \"It's almost certain that I'm going to LA. It's okay, everything is perfect, it's only that, well it's like the beginning of my retirement.\"",
      "Chicharito's passion for the game and being at his best was evident as he broke down in tears",
      "Addressing his father, who tried to interject, he continued: \"Dad, try to understand me. Don't worry, look, what I mean is that we're saying goodbye to a career that we put a lot of effort on and we worked, and I know you guys also feel it. We're going to look at the bright side, but whether we like it or not we are retiring from the European dream.\"",
      "Hernandez's fresh start stateside saw him find the net 39 times across 82 Galaxy appearances before heading back to CD Guadalajara, the club where his journey first began prior to that major transatlantic move.",
      "A storybook homecoming was fairly quiet in terms of goals, with just four in 39 outings before his departure was announced last month. At the time of writing he is free agent with no formal retirement announcement having materialised.",

      "Michael Carrick has made a perfect start at Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe was present at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday as Manchester United orchestrated an impressive win against Arsenal. The United co-owner will be delighted with the impact made by interim head coach Michael Carrick, having summoned the former midfielder for a private chat following the latest triumph.",
      "Consecutive victories against Manchester City and Arsenal have lifted United into fourth place in the Premier League standings and strengthened their hopes of securing a Champions League spot. The race remains tight, however, with a group of clubs chasing the same positions and just five points separating United from Sunderland in 11th place.",
      "Erik ten Hag was already in charge at Old Trafford when Ratcliffe purchased a stake in the club in February 2024. United endured a difficult league campaign that year and were weighing up alternative options before the Dutchman guided them to FA Cup success, earning himself a one-year extension.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Shortly before Ten Hag was dismissed in October 2024, Ratcliffe publicly backed the manager, saying: \"I like Erik. I think he's a very good coach but at the end of the day it's not my call. It's the management team that's running Manchester United that have to decide how we best run the team in many different respects.\"",
      "\"I agree the Erik ten Tag and [former sporting director] Dan Ashworth decisions were errors. I think there were some mitigating circumstances, but ultimately they were errors. I accept that and I apologise for that.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe admitted renewing Erik ten Hag's contract in 2024 was a mistake(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "After Ten Hag's departure, United turned to Ruben Amorim following his standout achievements with Sporting CP. While the Portuguese coach guided United to the Europa League final, his league record was less convincing, with just 15 wins from 47 matches. Despite this, Ratcliffe frequently spoke highly of Amorim's efforts during his time at Old Trafford.",
      "In an interview with BBC Sport in March 2025, Ratcliffe said: \"If I actually look at the squad which is available to Ruben, I think he is doing a really good job to be honest. I think Ruben is an outstanding young manager. I really do. He's an excellent manager and I think he will be there for a long time.\"",
      "Pressure mounted on Amorim after United finished 15th in the league and were beaten by Tottenham in the Europa League final. Reflecting on the situation during an appearance on The Business podcast in October, Ratcliffe said: \"He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe parted ways with Ruben Amorim earlier this month(Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)",

Still, the former England midfielder can take encouragement from being chosen ahead of past United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and club legends Ruud van Nistelrooy and Darren Fletcher.",
      "After the Arsenal victory, Carrick postponed his post-match media duties in order to speak directly with Ratcliffe. When approached by journalists, Ratcliffe declined to answer questions, jokingly saying \"just get the smile\".",
      "Asked later about the exchange with the United co-owner, Carrick told Viaplay: \"No, not much as you would expect, I think. There's a lot of happy bodies around the camp today and he's delighted as well. So it was nice to see him.\"",

      "Bruno Fernandes is approaching a key juncture at Manchester United as the club consider handing their captain a new contract(Image: PA)",
      "Bruno Fernandes has established himself as a modern legend at Manchester United, though his long-term future at Old Trafford remains uncertain. The club captain continues to attract speculation about a potential summer departure and has been candid about the situation in recent interviews.",
      "Fernandes has addressed speculation surrounding Saudi Arabian interest last summer when Al-Hilal were allegedly willing to stump up £100million for his services. The 31-year-old disclosed in December how former manager Ruben Amorim was instrumental in persuading him to remain, though he suggested United seemed willing to entertain the bid.",
      "This could prove significant if comparable proposals materialise at the end of this season, with his existing deal set to run until summer 2027. United retain an option to extend that commitment by an additional 12 months but the prospect of securing a nine-figure fee for a player approaching his twilight years might prove irresistible.",
      "Fernandes is understood to be seeking wages that would establish him as the club's highest-paid player by a considerable margin should he pen fresh terms. Nevertheless, United might consider it wise to capitalise on his value as one of several possible avenues in what has emerged as a crucial matter for the club.",
      "There's arguably no player currently at United who possesses greater worth than Fernandes. Not merely in terms of prospective market value but also regarding how significantly the side improves when he's around.",
      "Consequently, it's plausible the club will determine it's in their best interests to invest by offering him fresh terms. Fernandes is reportedly demanding a £400,000-a-week deal should he sign new terms at Old Trafford, given his next contract will likely be the final major deal of his career.",
      "It represents a considerable increase from the £300,000 a week he's currently on. Nevertheless, with Casemiro already confirmed to depart in the summer, removing his £375,000-a-week wages from the books will liberate a substantial amount from the salary structure.",
      "There remains a danger in offering a lengthy new deal to a player who turns 32 in September, though. Liverpool serve as a recent cautionary tale after rewarding Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk with fresh contracts last year, only to witness both veterans struggle to replicate their past levels so far this season.",
      "There's the additional condition that Fernandes allegedly wishes to wait and see who gets appointed as the next permanent boss before making his commitment. But following Michael Carrick's flawless beginning as interim boss, which has seen his chances of landing the role improve, that might not remain a concern for much longer.",
      "Fernandes has been open in admitting he'd accept a move to Saudi Arabia if he was no longer wanted at United",
      "The alternative route worth considering is to capitalise on Fernandes' sale while the opportunity remains favourable. Given his age, there's no certainty United will ever receive bids matching those currently being discussed should they opt to retain their skipper for another season.",
      "The Saudi Pro League has proved a valuable negotiating chip for Premier League sides when moving on particular players in recent times. Middle Eastern clubs are prepared to pay premium fees for marquee signings in a bid to enhance their brand, and speculation linking Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr with Fernandes has continued despite their failure to secure the player last summer.",
      "Speaking to Canal 11 in December, he acknowledged he was receptive to playing in Saudi Arabia and said: \"I can't complain, I'm very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I'll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"My lifestyle will change, my children's lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain. I'll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players.\"",
      "The monetary incentive is also remarkable, with Fernandes allegedly receiving a contract proposal worth approximately £700,000 per week. After six years at United, there's a possibility this summer could mark the decisive moment for both club and player if all concerned agree a departure serves everyone's interests.",
      "Saudi powerhouses are unlikely to be alone in their interest should it emerge that Fernandes is available. However, the situation is complex given fewer European clubs would be capable of matching Saudi financial muscle.",
      "Bayern Munich have recently been touted as another potential destination, one that would fulfil Fernandes' ambition to continue competing at the highest level. The German giants have ramped up their spending in recent years, with Harry Kane aged 30 when Bayern paid around £100m to secure him from Tottenham nearly three years ago.",
      "United's skipper could follow Casemiro's example by leaving Old Trafford as a free agent(Image: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)",
      "In the same Canal 11 interview mentioned earlier, Fernandes also addressed his other preferences after leaving United, saying: \"I want to stay at Manchester United as long as I feel desired. I would like to experience the Spanish league and fight for big titles in Italy. I have many connections to Italy... my daughter was born there.",
      "\"I've already thought about returning to Portugal... the first option would be [former employers] Sporting. To be happy, like it was with Sporting. But I don't want to ruin the image that was left.\"",
      "Money matters but from a practical standpoint, securing a transfer fee for Fernandes isn't necessarily paramount. In fact, allowing his existing contract to run its course and triggering the 12-month extension to retain him at the club until 2028 may prove wisest.",
      "By taking this approach, United would preserve the greatest possible opportunity of maximising the midfielder's remaining peak years. He could then depart in 2028, at which point he'll be 33, and would still be positioned to secure a profitable contract elsewhere given he'd be moving as a free agent.",
      "There's a chance Fernandes could head for the United exit this summer amid talk of big-money bids from Saudi Arabia(Image: Getty)",
      "In this scenario, United wouldn't be required to boost the player's salary and would have greater certainty regarding their timeframe for identifying a replacement. Admittedly, the club would be forgoing the opportunity to secure a substantial fee for their star, but players of Fernandes' calibre are rare, so that could be a worthwhile trade-off to guarantee the rest of his peak years are at Old Trafford.",
      "United paid a combined £67.6m to acquire Fernandes from Sporting in 2020, presuming all performance-related clauses in the agreement have been triggered. Should he depart in 2028, that would amount to approximately £8m per year (excluding salaries) across his eight-and-a-half years in Manchester.",
      "Most would consider that a reasonable investment for a player who has elevated expectations at the club during his time there. Therefore, maintaining the status quo before an amicable exit at the conclusion of his existing deal could prove satisfactory.",

      "Scott McTominay left Manchester United in 2024 and has become a global star since(Image: Francesco Pecoraro/Getty Images)",
      "Gianfranco Zola was stunned at Scott McTominay's Manchester United exit as he continues to impress in Serie A with Napoli. The midfielder spent 22 years with United, working his way through the academy ranks before making his senior debut for the Red Devils in 2017.",
      "McTominay was part of the first-team squad for seven years, winning the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup before making a sudden exit to Italy in 2024. The 29-year-old left United for Napoli for a fee of around £25million, a sale crucial to the club's compliance with financial fair play (FFP) regulations.",
      "Chelsea icon Zola was adamant that FFP rulings had to play a part in McTominay's sale due to the talent United were losing in the midfielder. Speaking to Gazzetta dello Sport, the 59-year-old said: \"Certain choices will never be understood. I want to think that Manchester United sold him for reasons related to financial fair play.",
      "\"Otherwise I really don't get it. He's a complete footballer, he knows how to be on the pitch, he does everything. And he also scores a lot.\"",
      "Zola's comments ring true even more now as he continues to go from strength to strength both for club and for country. However, due to McTominay's homegrown status at United, it seemed like a no-brainer for then-manager Erik ten Hag to sell the Scot and recruit elsewhere in 2024.",

      "Manuel Ugarte signed a five-year deal just days later for a fee rising to £50m with bonuses, departing Paris Saint-Germain for Old Trafford.",
      "However, this deal ended up falling in Napoli's favour as McTominay has gone on to score 22 goals and provide 10 assists in 67 appearances so far.",
      "The Scotland international won Serie A in his debut campaign in Italy and added the Italian Super Cup this season with a 2-0 win over Bologna in the final.",
      "McTominay has been a star reborn for both club and country since his United exit(Image: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)",
      "On the other hand, Ugarte has scored just two goals and assisted six times in 63 appearances for United. McTominay will come up against English opposition this week as Zola's former side Chelsea visit Napoli in Wednesday's Champions League encounter.",
      "Zola's comments ring true about McTominay's 'completeness' as a footballer, with the 29-year-old receiving praise for his performances for club and country.",
      "In November 2025, the midfielder scored a wonder bicycle kick for Scotland in the opening minutes during their crucial World Cup 2026 qualifier against Denmark. The game finished 4-2 to the Scots and McTominay was heavily credited for his international performances in getting the nation to their first World Cup since 1998.",

However, it hasn't stopped the rumour mill sparking a new wave of speculation at the Theatre of Dreams with the likes of Chelsea star Cole Palmer mooted.",

      "The influential fan group have arranged a protest before United play Fulham at Old Trafford on Sunday, having cancelled a planned demonstration before the opening game of the season back in August.",

But Steve Crompton, spokesperson for The 1958, said the positive results on the pitch wouldn't affect this protest.",
      "\"We had to cancel the protest at the start of the season. There had been new signings and there’s always that optimism, I suppose,\" he said. \"It was disappointing; it’s never about what happens on the pitch, it’s what happens upstairs.",

      "\"It's a crazy situation. If Ratcliffe wants to give us a glimmer of hope, then map out what is happening with the football club,\" said Crompton. \"Matchgoing fans don’t care about a shiny tent he wants to build. For me that’s just a vanity project for his own ego.",
      "\"I’m trying to be the most optimistic I can, but I can’t go down any path and think there is a glimmer there; there just isn’t. It just doesn’t work. The Glazers must be laughing in Florida, they are getting zero flak, Ratcliffe is copping for it all, but they still own the club, it’s barmy. But I don’t know what the answer is.\"",

      "Crompton said he understands that football is a business now and will be treated as such, but is concerned that more debt is being put on the club to finance the new stadium, and The 1958 want better treatment for matchgoing fans, after ticket prices were hiked by Ratcliffe.",
      "After two excellent results under Carrick, there is a feel-good factor around the club again, and Crompton accepts people might be wavering about whether to protest or not on Sunday, but he urged anyone unsure of what to do to look at the bigger picture.",
      "\"We’ve been here many times before. History tells us that eventually we end up back at square one,\" he said.",
      "\"This isn't protesting against Carrick and it's not protesting against the lads on the pitch, we'll always support them as we will after the protest.",
      "\"This is about the ownership that's laden with debt doing what's right by matchgoing fans. Die-hard fans are walking away and that’s not the answer, the answer is to stand up and have your voice heard, whether you’re going to the game or not, turn up, get behind the protest and let’s get our voices heard again.\"",

      "Fernandes is viewed as undroppable.(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Kobbie Mainoo covered more ground than any other Manchester United player in the club's last two games. The midfielder left nothing out there, putting himself about like a player with a point to prove.",
      "Mainoo's stock took a hit during Ruben Amorim's tenure, but strong performances against Manchester City and Arsenal were reminders of the wonderfully talented player United have on their hands.",
      "\"I think part of a career is a few ups and downs and sometimes it goes in different trajectories, but I think we've seen last week what Kobbie can bring. It was great,\" said Carrick before Arsenal.",
      "Mainoo is posting United-related photos on his social media again. There had been a nine-month Instagram hiatus, but he's been brought back into the fold by Carrick, who has known him since he was a boy.",
      "The 20-year-old was disenchanted with life under Amorim, and he was set to push to leave on loan in the January window until the Portuguese was axed amid rising tensions with the board.",
      "It was criminal that Amorim could not find a way to fit Mainoo into his system. Amorim overlooked Mainoo in his first game against Ipswich, which set the tone. He experimented with Mainoo as a No.10 and up front. There were jokes within the squad about him playing as a striker.",
      "Amorim eventually settled on his role, deciding he would compete with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot in midfield. \"He is fighting for the position now with Bruno. I changed two midfielders. I like Mason Mount there because we want to score a goal,\" said Amorim in August.",
      "\"And then when I changed it, I felt that the team needed to return to one holding midfielder. So he just needs to fight for the position with Bruno in training. Like it should be at Manchester United.\"",
      "Mainoo was fighting a losing battle from that moment onwards, but he remained committed to winning his place back, doing extra work during the international breaks and changing his chef at home.",
      "Mainoo took another step forward against Arsenal.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Mainoo's frustration began to show by the end of Amorim's tenure, though. He liked a few ill-timed posts on social media about Amorim, and his half-brother paraded a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt at Old Trafford. United insisted that Mainoo knew nothing about the stunt from his sibling.",
      "The frustration was understandable, given he'd gone from starting at Euro 2024 to not getting a sniff of a league start, but Mainoo had little chance when his manager pitted him against Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes has been an ever-present in the starting team since his arrival from Sporting Lisbon. He'd only ever missed two United games due to injury until his recent hamstring issue.",
      "Amorim essentially said Mainoo would never start in the Premier League when he confirmed he was competing with Fernandes. The United captain is undroppable and kept Mainoo out of the team.",
      "Mainoo was the biggest winner from Amorim's sacking, but his departure was bound to be a negative for some others, like Mason Mount, whose relationship with Amorim was strong.",
      "Mount benefited from Amorim's formation, and United were a better team when he was in the starting line-up in the first half of the campaign. Mount delivered consistently strong performances, scoring important goals against Sunderland and Crystal Palace to finally have momentum behind him.",
      "\"He can defend, he can attack. It's the quality that when he touches the ball, it's really good. So it's not a surprise for me, but of course, we need to take care of him,\" said Amorim last month.",
      "Writing on social media when Amorim's sacking was announced, Mount said: \"Thank you, gaffer. All the best to you and your staff for the future.\" Unsurprisingly, there was no farewell message from Mainoo.",
      "Mount and Fernandes embrace at Selhurst Park.(Image: 2025 Manchester United FC)",
      "Carrick has switched to 4-2-3-1 and Mainoo has slotted perfectly back into a three-man midfield, but the tactical switch now means Mount is competing with Fernandes to start as the central attacking midfielder.",
      "Mount was introduced in injury time in the Manchester derby and was an unused substitute against Arsenal. It's too early to say he won't be used as much by Carrick, but he only needs to look at Mainoo's situation from earlier in the season to know what happens when Fernandes is the competition to start.",
      "The silver lining for Mount is that he was in a similar position in the summer when Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed, setting them up as the first-choice players in Amorim's No.10 roles.",
      "Speaking in pre-season, Mount reflected: \"Any opportunity you get, you've got to try and take it. And, yeah, I mean, I'll always back myself. I know what I can do. But we're a team and we're all working together in that.",
      "\"Obviously, with the new signings coming in, they (Cunha and Mbeumo) are going to elevate us to another level, and we all need to be at that level to really perform.\"",
      "Mount backed himself and successfully found a way to force himself into the side. That may be more difficult to do against Fernandes, but he's already shown the required talent and mentality to do so. It will also help that Mount could feature on the flanks in the 4-2-3-1. It would be stupid to write him off.",

      "And according to fresh industry research, United’s proposed 100,000 capacity 'New Trafford' stadium could unlock millions of pounds from a long-term naming rights agreement. The club's stadium naming rights are estimated to be worth £15million a year – the most valuable in English football – ahead of Wembley and Arsenal's Emirates stadium, both valued at £12.5million a year.",
      "The figures emerged in The Sponsor's European Stadium Naming Rights Fair Market Value Report, via the Sun. It said: \"The valuation reflects the scale of the redevelopment, projected capacity, modern infrastructure, Manchester United’s global fanbase and the international reach of the Premier League.\"",

      "United's revenue last year sat at £691m (€793m) but it was their broadcast revenue that plummeted from £224m (€258m) to £179m (€206m) after they failed to qualify for European football.",
      "He said: \"When Sir Alex was there and even in the initial years [after he left], it was a toss-up at the start of each season whether it would be United or Real or Barcelona as to who would be top of that money list.",
      "\"I think it’s reflective of the tough times that the club’s going through and there's a genuine fear that they could fall out of the top 10 next season. Sir Jim Ratcliffe describes them as the world's leading football brand, but if the world's leading football brand is outside of the top 10 of revenue generators, then that's not very promising.\"",

      "Jonny Evans and Jonathan Woodgate.(Image: 2026 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "Last weekend, Leeds fans' stomachs churned when they spotted Jonathan Woodgate celebrating against Arsenal. You could say Woodgate has 'done an Alan Smith' by switching allegiances to Manchester United.",
      "\"Seeing Jonny Woodgate celebrate a scum winner like that is grim,\" posted a Leeds fan on social media. They may have to get used to Michael Carrick's backroom staff celebrating on touchlines, though.",
      "Carrick has overseen brilliant wins against Manchester City and Arsenal. United sources continue to reiterate that nobody is getting carried away, but Carrick has made a perfect start, helping to restore optimism for the remainder of the season after inheriting a team out of all cup competitions.",
      "The backroom staff have been crucial in those wins. Steve Holland joined Carrick to serve as assistant manager, while Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion are first-team coaches.",
      "Holland and Woogate have been hands-on alongside Carrick during training sessions. Woodgate speaks Spanish, which has helped him find common ground with Spanish-speaking players in the squad.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "When Woodgate signed for Real Madrid in the summer of 2004, he attempted to speak Spanish at his initiation, while Michael Owen, who signed in the same window, chose to speak English. Woodgate immersed himself in Spanish culture and watched Spanish television to help pick up conversations more easily. He said it was \"vital\" to learn. Studying Spanish stood him in good stead when he coached Spanish players at Bournemouth, and it has helped him to endear himself at Carrington.",
      "\"Chuffed for Woody. Hope you get a chance to speak to him at some point. He’s good as gold, brilliant fella,\" was the message from a north-east contact after his arrival at United.",
      "A journalist who interviewed Woodgate during his time at Real Madrid was present in the mixed zone at the Emirates. Woodgate strolled over to have a small catch-up with that reporter.",
      "Woodgate and Zidane during Madrid training in 2004.(Image: 2004 AFP)",
      "Woodgate had the talent to be remembered as one of the finest English defenders of all time, but injuries ultimately curtailed his career. Unsurprisingly, the 46-year-old has passed on knowledge to United's defensive unit since his arrival, working individually with the defenders to help them improve.",
      "Woodgate's coaching career has been interesting. He was an assistant coach at Middlesbrough when they were relegated from the Premier League in 2017. He returned to Boro in the summer of 2019 to become their manager, but he was sacked near the end of his first season.",
      "In 2021, Woodgate joined Bournemouth. He oversaw the remainder of the campaign as interim, guiding the Cherries into the Championship play-offs, before being overlooked for the permanent job.",
      "Woodgate returned to Middlesbrough in 2022 to work as a first-team coach following Carrick's appointment as manager. He departed alongside Carrick when he was sacked by Boro. During their time at Middlesbrough, Carrick said: \"Woody has been massive ever since I’ve walked through the door. The impact on me and around the place is massive… his character, knowledge and love of the game. He sees things a little bit differently than me, having obviously played at the back.",
      "\"We feed off each other in a good, dynamic way. He’s constantly looking at different things to what I might see and helping the boys develop. Defence is one of the things we’ve really been conscious of and trying to focus on. Woody does a lot of work with the back four, and credit to him for that.\"",
      "Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick and Jonathan Woodgate the assistant head coach",
      "Evans, who retired from playing at the end of last season, has also been responsible for individual work with the defenders. Evans took up a role as head of loans and pathways last summer, but sources with knowledge of his decision to step away in December said it was not a position that suited him.",
      "The academy graduate is now within the thick of the action again, which is thought to be more suitable for this stage of his career, compared to the slow pace of his previous United role.",
      "Evans is hugely respected at Carrington. He is particularly good with young players, having experience of what it's like to come through the academy and what teenagers must do to consolidate.",
      "Respect for Holland is widespread in the coaching sphere. He worked with Jose Mourinho, Rafa Benitez and Antonio Conte, among others, during his time at Chelsea, and was credited with overseeing the bulk of coaching during his stint as Gareth Southgate's assistant manager for England.",
      "Holland is a boyhood United fan and would watch games from the Stretford End when he was a kid. Carrick had not worked with him before, but agreed with Jason Wilcox that his skillset would be helpful.",
      "Holland and Carrick pictured in discussion.(Image: 2026 Getty Images)",
      "Binnion's official title at the academy was 'head of player development and coaching' before his first-team promotion. Binnion was U21 manager, but stepped up to help Darren Fletcher when he was caretaker.",
      "He was retained to coach within the senior set-up when Carrick was appointed. Binnion has long been a conduit between the first-team and the academy, advising which players are ready to participate in senior training sessions, but his role has evolved over the last few weeks. Although Binnion was on the bench during Fletcher's two games in charge, he has now moved into the stands to sit with the analysts and pass on information to the bench during matches.",
      "Woodgate was spotted wearing an earpiece during the Manchester derby. Binnion's aerial advantage means he can feed back nuggets of information that the coaches in the dug-out may not identify. Binnion has worked tirelessly behind the scenes in the academy over the last few years. Young players, parents and representatives have all benefited from his wise counsel.",
      "Craig Mawson was the only coach on Ruben Amorim's backroom staff to be retained after his exit. Mawson joined United in 2019, having worked his way up at Burnley in different goalkeeper coach positions.",
      "The first-team analyst staff continue to be important. Amorim namedropped Kaita Hasegawa as someone who deserved praise for improving set-pieces and helping to tactically prepare for the opponent. Hasegawa's position has not been described as senior, but he was recruited from Everton after seven years in Merseyside, and he is understood to play an important role in the background.",
      "Carrick has been lavished with praise, however, the mini-transformation over the fortnight has been a collective effort. United are heading in the right direction again thanks to their work at Carrington.",

      "The Reds have been rejuvenated since Carrick succeeded Ruben Amorim until the end of the season. Wins over the Premier League top two, Manchester City and Arsenal, has seen optimism grow at Old Trafford as they chase Champions League qualification - a feat they have not achieved since the 2022/23 campaign under Erik ten Hag.",
      "However, one player who may have been slightly frustrated is Cunha, after being restricted to substitute roles in recent games. The forward has been an excellent signing from Wolves in the summer - scoring five goals and providing two assists so far.",
      "Cunha's best moment in a United jersey so far was, without a doubt, scoring the winner against Arsenal on Sunday. But former Reds midfielder Butt believes Cunha will not have been happy with his role under Carrick so far - although he may now get more starts after Patrick Dorgu's injury.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast, another Reds legend, Paul Scholes, firstly spoke about Dorgu's situation and how Cunha is affected. The ex-midfielder said: \"He [Dorgu] was brought in as a wing-back because that was Amorim’s system, but going back to when we were playing, wide players actually would help your full-back, and United have started doing that.",
      "\"Against Saka, who is their best attacker by a million miles, it was like playing against two left-backs at times because he was working back, but he’s scoring goals as well. I don’t see him there as a left winger full-time.",
      "\"Michael’s obviously seen something in him that he likes because he’s left Cunha out for him, and what a player he is.\"",
      "Butt then interjected. The 51-year-old said: \"Cunha’s giving you an option off the bench and I do feel a bit sorry.\"",
      "Matheus Cunha scored Man United's winner at Arsenal(Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)",
      "Scholes added: \"He won’t be happy with that, no chance, he won’t be happy with that sentence.\"",

      "\"Also with the Cunha situation, I think Mbeumo has been brilliant as a nine. I think he’s done that job really, really well. He’s a handful, he’s powerful, he’s quick, you’re thinking Cunha might see himself on the bench for a good few weeks now.\"",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speaking over the weekend, Dalot told BBC Radio Five Live: \"I am really comfortable with what happened. In my opinion, he took the right decision because there was no big intensity in the challenge.",
      "\"In football, it can go both ways, and it is always about interpretation. I am not afraid of being aggressive or putting every mile onto the pitch.

      "Manchester United supporters are currently waiting anxiously to discover if Patrick Dorgu's injury is serious or not ahead of the clash with Fulham on Sunday. The Dane has been a revelation for Michael Carrick having been moved up field in the 4-2-3-1 formation favoured by the interim head coach.",
      "“Pat’s been a big player for us, obviously he’s scored two goals but in terms of the threat and athleticism and quality, he’s been immense,\" declared Carrick after Dorgu had put Arsenal to the sword on Sunday. In Carrick's first two matches in charge, Dorgu has scored in both including a screamer at the Emirates and the goal that sealed victory over City.",
      "However, before Matheus Cunha's winner, Dorgu was substituted with what appeared to be a hamstring injury. Immediately after the game, Carrick suggested the injury was merely cramp and he would be assessed.",
      "On Tuesday, reports suggested Dorgu would be out for ten weeks with a hamstring concern. It is understood by MEN Sport that Dorgu is still being assessed and no timeline for his injury has yet been confirmed. But should he be out for one game or an extended period, United will need to replace him.",
      "So with this in mind, we have taken a look at three ways United could choose to line up without Dorgu for however long he is out for.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "The first choice for United and probably the most likely option would be to recall Cunha to the starting XI. Carrick has been using the Brazilian as his first choice substitution in recent matches and he has been repaying that faith.",
      "His goal cutting in from the left flank on Sunday was a stroke of genius and will have stood him in good stead to get a start against Fulham at the weekend if Dorgu is injured. Cunha's involvement would weaken the bench but that is a price United will more than likely have to pay.",
      "Manchester United XI with Matheus Cunha replacing Patrick Dorgu",
      "Another option available to Carrick would be to recall Mason Mount to the starting XI. This would be an unorthodox move for the Reds considering Mount is more of an attacking midfielder.",
      "However, the former Chelsea man has experience playing across the attacking midfield three and may need to show greater flexibility if he is to get more minutes in the starting line-up. Now Bruno Fernandes has been moved back to attacking midfield, Mount will find it difficult to unseat him - just as Kobbie Mainoo did.",
      "Therefore, playing him on the left could be an opportunity for him to stake his claim again.",
      "Manchester United XI with Mason Mount replacing Patrick Dorgu",
      "United are not blessed with many left wingers but even so, this seems an unlikely wildcard option. Teenager Shea Lacey is more suited to playing on the right but has featured on the left flank previously in emergencies.",
      "The 18-year-old was sent off for a quick second yellow offence in his last appearance for United but he need not worry about that affecting his chances in the first team. Carrick has made it his mission to show support for the academy players and recently attended their FA Youth Cup fixture vs Derby County.",
      "That being said, thrusting Lacey into a position he is not fully comfortable with while Dorgu is out would be a major curveball.",

      "Michael Carrick could be in the running to become Manchester United's permanent head coach (Image: Getty Images)",
      "The new permanent head coach of Manchester United could potentially oversee his inaugural match in Helsinki, as the club continues to prepare for the upcoming season. Despite the impressive impact of interim boss Michael Carrick so far, the Reds are still searching for a permanent head coach.",
      "Former United midfielder Carrick stepped in to replace Ruben Amorim until the end of the season earlier this month and has made a strong impression with victories over Manchester City and Arsenal. However, the plan – for now – is for Carrick to step down before the 2026/27 season commences.",
      "Even though a successor has not yet been identified, preparations for the next season are already underway. As reported by The Sun, United's executives are planning to schedule pre-season matches in both Helsinki and Gothenburg.",
      "Discussions are ongoing, but plans appear to be nearing completion. United typically embark on a profitable pre-season tour of the USA, but with the World Cup taking place in the country, as well as Mexico and Canada, it seems the itinerary has been altered.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Assuming everything goes according to plan, these matches could provide the first opportunity for the new permanent United head coach to assess their team.",
      "Scandinavia is not unfamiliar territory for the Reds, having started their pre-season schedule there against Leeds United last season, and previously facing Turkish heavyweights Galatasaray in Gothenburg in 2016.",
      "With the pre-season schedule beginning to take form, United will undoubtedly be focused on ending the current season on a high note. The Reds are positioned fourth in the league standings going into this weekend's fixture against Fulham.",
      "Michael Carrick has defeated Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games in charge(Image: Offside via Getty Images)",
      "Carrick has been informed that securing Champions League qualification is the club's objective between now and May. When questioned about his experience in the role thus far, he said: \"I'm enjoying it.",
      "\"It's a fantastic position to be in. What happens next: I'm not going to be answering it every week. I'm enjoying it and I'll continue to do what I can.\"",
      "Meanwhile, centre-back Harry Maguire heaped praise on Carrick and his contributions following the victory over Arsenal.",
      "The centre-back said: \"Michael's come in, he's been brilliant with us, he's brought a fresh energy, the group's really galvanised.\"",
      "Despite Carrick's accomplished tenure to date, several prominent managers have been linked with the position. England manager Thomas Tuchel features on the club's shortlist alongside Mauricio Pochettino and Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United celebrate Matheus Cunha's goal against Arsenal",
      "Manchester United continued their dream start under Michael Carrick as they secured back-to-back wins against the Premier League's top two with a famous victory at the Emirates Stadium.",
      "It felt like United had weathered the early storm from Arsenal when the hosts took the lead. It was a sloppy goal to concede and Lisandro Martinez got the final touch as he battled Jurrien Timber in his six-yard box.",
      "But United's response was excellent and they capitalised on an Arsenal defensive blunder to level. Martin Zubimendi's pass handed the chance to Bryan Mbeumo and he rounded David Raya to score.",
      "Carrick's side then took the lead with a stunning goal early in the second half. Dorgu teed the chance up for himself with some clever control and unleashed a stunning volley that hit the bar and went in. Mikel Merino looked like he had secured a draw for Arsenal only for Matheus Cunha to score almost immediately.",
      "Here's the MEN player ratings.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Senne Lammens: Good saves from Zubimendi and Saka and mostly dealt well with the aerial bombardment. Crowded out for the equaliser. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Dealt well with Trossard and looks a little more comfortable at right-back. The kind of solid and unfussy game he has needed. 7",
      "Harry Maguire: Surely worth a new contract if this form continues. Looked the best centre-back on the pitch, which really is saying something. 9",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Should have been stronger against Timber for Arsenal's opening goal. One good block on Rice but Gyokeres troubled him. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Defended really well against Saka and stayed aware throughout. Arsenal used clever moment down that flank but Shaw was never exposed. 8",
      "Casemiro: Big contribution in his own box from set-pieces and used the ball well. Another reminder that he can still cut it at the highest level. 7",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Felt that United got a foothold in the game when they got the ball to Mainoo more often. Growing in confidence under Carrick and got the late assist. 8",
      "Amad: Took in-swinging corners and got his deliveries spot on. One poor choice on the break in the first half but kept at it. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Curious game. Sloppy with a couple of passes but also had moments where he looked really dangerous and led well when in front. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Weak defensive header in the build-up to the first goal but boy did he make amends. An incredible goal to put United ahead and maintain his own momentum. 8",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Now scored against Liverpool, City and Arsenal. Took his goal really well and was a threat with his movement and clever runs. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Matheus Cunha: Took up some good positions and again looked bright off the bench. Brilliant, brilliant goal. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Little time to make an impact. 7",
      "Noussair Mazraoui: Late sub. 6",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Yoro, Heaven, Malacia, Ugarte, Mount",

      "Matheus Cunha celebrates scoring for Manchester United at Arsenal",
      "Michael Carrick stood motionless on the Emirates touchline. Hands behind his smart black jacket, dressed to kill like a Manchester United manager should be. Inside, his stomach must have been churning.",
      "He raised his left arm to try to wave his team forward, but his right arm never moved. He looked like the calmest man inside a stadium that had long since lost its head.",
      "A couple of minutes earlier, Casemiro had grabbed the back of Matheus Cunha's shirt and slammed him into the turf in sheer delight. That wasn't even to celebrate the forward's stunning goal, but to mark him winning a free-kick from an Arsenal corner. The emotions were everywhere, from a United side finding its mojo again to an Arsenal team that just can't take control of this title race.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Everywhere apart from the away technical area, that is. United's coaches poured out to appeal for a late free-kick as they defended another Arsenal cross. The unflappable Carrick barely flinched.",
      "When the full-time whistle blew, Carrick clenched his left fist and twice subtly punched the air next to him. There was a low-key embrace with his staff and a handshake with Mikel Arteta. For the 44-year-old Carrick, this is just what Manchester United do.",
      "As auditions go, this couldn't have got off to a better start. Carrick has guided United to wins against the Premier League's top two when a month ago they had looked like a team devoid of confidence and lacking enjoyment. This win against Arsenal was the kind of dramatic away-day success the very best United teams produce.",
      "They have had some moments to savour in the FA Cup here in recent years, but they hadn't won a league match at the Emirates since December 2017. That was the day of David de Gea's 14 saves and Jesse Lingard's double in a 3-1 victory under Jose Mourinho.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim had tried and failed to win a league fixture here. Carrick had at least some experience of success. He was among Solskjaer's staff for an FA Cup fourth-round win on a Friday night in January seven years ago.",
      "A lot had changed since then. Arsenal have gradually built to a point where their 22-year title drought could end in the next five months. United have cycled through a succession of failed managers and are back on another short-term appointment in Carrick. Short-term for now, at least.",
      "The feelings of de ja vu are pretty hard to escape right now. Carrick has delivered exactly the kind of uplift Solskjaer brought in December 2018, both in mood and performance. He has to be in the frame to get the job permanently after these victories. Any more of this and it may prove impossible to overlook him.",
      "This was a different kind of win, as well. They started the derby well last weekend and built the confidence that comes from seeing a game plan work on the pitch.",
      "At the Emirates, they began on the back foot. They faced a flurry of early set-pieces and Senne Lammens turned over a header from Martin Zubimendi at point-blank range. Set-pieces had seemed Arsenal's likeliest route to goal, but it felt like United had weathered the storm when they went behind.",
      "Patrick Dorgu failed to deal with Piero Hincapie's cross, Bukayo Saka found a pass to Martin Odegaard and his mis-hit shot was sliced into his own net by Lisandro Martinez. You feared for United at that point, but the response was exceptional before and after half-time.",
      "Bruno Fernandes almost capitalised on a defensive error from William Saliba before Bryan Mbeumo punished Zubimendi. The Spaniard's pass back towards his goal only succeeded in playing in United's false nine and he rounded David Raya before finishing.",
      "Arsenal had been shooting themselves in the foot, but they were powerless to stop the goal that gave United the lead. Dorgu manipulated a bouncing ball into a more promising position and then sent a 20-yard rocket fizzing past Raya, the ball hitting the underside of the bar and bouncing into the roof of the net to give the strike the kind of aesthetic it deserved.",
      "Dorgu's renaissance over the last five weeks has been one of the stories of United's season. He had struggled in the first half here, not only with Arsenal's goal but against Saka, who got far more joy against him than he did the excellent Luke Shaw. But Dorgu's future surely belongs further forward if his recent contributions in the final third are anything to go by.",
      "Arsenal piled the pressure on in search of an equaliser and looked to have rescued a point when Mikel Merino bundled a corner over the line, but United again responded almost immediately. Kobbie Mainoo poked a clever pass to Matheus Cunha, who bent a stunning shot from distance into the corner of the net.",
      "As the majority of the Emirates emptied, United's players gathered in front of a delirious away end at full-time. Casemiro handed his shirt to a fan, and Carrick was serenaded several times. By the time Cunha and the immense Harry Maguire finished their TV interviews, it was still full. There was time for one final flurry of fist pumps after a breathtaking victory.",

      "Michael Carrick has supported the academy.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC/Getty)",
      "Wayne Rooney has praised Michael Carrick and his staff for attending Manchester United academy games. Rooney believes that support for the club's youth system had been \"missing\" before Carrick's return.",
      "Carrick attended an Under-21 game at Leigh Sports Village last Tuesday and showed further support for the Under-18s at Old Trafford in the FA Youth Cup. He was joined by his staff and both occasions.",
      "Ruben Amorim once walked over to observe some of an academy match at Carrington, but he did not make the effort to properly watch a youth game during his one-and-a-half-year tenure.",
      "Rooney sat alongside Carrick in the directors' box at Old Trafford to watch the U18s because his son, Kai, made an appearance from the bench. And United's all-time top goalscorer believes it's important to have first-team representation at academy fixtures to show support to youngsters.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Rooney said: \"It is great to see all the coaches taking a big interest in the academy, which is important for that football club. I have a different focus watching my son.",
      "\"Potentially in the next few years, some of those players might get an opportunity for the first team, so it is important they have that interest. t was great to see them all.",
      "\"He [Kai] has upped the age group to play in the Youth Cup. He helped them get the win. It was a proud moment for me. Even on Saturday, they were all [first-team staff] at the Under-16 game as well before they travelled to London [to face Arsenal]. It has been missing. I have been quite vocal on this.",
      "\"It has been missing in the last few years. It is great to see that coming back into the club. When we had a Sunday game, after training, we used to finish training and go and watch the academy games.",
      "\"That was the norm. That is what I have known at Manchester United. With my two lads in the academy, I haven’t seen that. It was a bit disappointing. The lift it gives to the players, and the players’ parents, seeing the first team manager there. That is how the club should be run.\"",
      "Amorim's lack of support for the academy did not go unnoticed, and fans questioned his faith in young players. Toward the end of Amorim's tenure, he made headlines when he suggested Harry Amass was \"struggling\" on loan in the Championship and pointed to Chido Obi not starting every U21 game.",
      "When asked whether Kobbie Mainoo could change his manager's mind and earn a starting role, Amorim, without any prompting, said: \"[Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in U21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager.\"",
      "Amorim also mentioned Toby Collyer in the press conference, saying: \"He’s from the academy, he played here, went to West Bromwich, he’s not playing. He played for Manchester United.\"",

      "Mikel Arteta’s side took the lead just before the half-hour mark when Lisandro Martinez put the ball through his own net, but Bryan Mbeumo capitalised on a horror backpass by Martin Zubimendi to draw his side level before the break.",
      "Patrick Dorgu then fired United ahead, but Mikel Merino looked to have rescued a valuable point for the Gunners when he bundled the ball home from close-range.",
      "But Matheus Cunha had other ideas, as his stunner three minutes from time secured his side all three points. Following the game, Carrick held talks with Ratcliffe, but when put on the spot about what was discussed, he gave very little away except revealing his boss was a very happy man.",
      "“No, not much as you would expect, I think,” he told Viaplay. “There’s a lot of happy bodies around the camp today and he’s delighted as well. So it was nice to see him.”",
      "Peter Schmeichel then put the United boss on the spot by asking him if he had asked if he could come into his office today, to which a laughing Carrick replied: “No, not yet, Peter. I think it is nice when you can have that feeling with a big win like this, you know, coming away from home.",
      "“Last week was good for different reasons. This one is pretty special. Two good games – it’s about what’s next now and moving forward.”",
      "Reflecting on the win in the capital, Carrick said: \"We understood the start of the game was going to be like that, as much as we tried to turn the momentum in our favour.",

      "Before he continued: \"We were having a decent spell and seemed to be coming into the game when they scored, which was disappointing. Again, we showed the character to come back and there were stages in the game where you have to defend.",
      "“They make you defend the box really and it's challenging at times, but I thought we had enough in the game to keep believing in the confidence and I always fancied us to score.",
      "“The goals were fantastic goals, some of the football was good and we looked dangerous at certain times. There’s other times you have to defend. It was a performance with a bit of everything.”",

      "The definition of an embarrassment of riches: more options or resources than one knows what to do with. Darren Fletcher had that when Manchester United played in the FA Youth Cup on Friday night.",
      "It almost felt unfair for JJ Gabriel and Chido Obi to start together against Derby County. They are both special talents who can hold their own against senior professionals, never mind fellow teenagers.",
      "Kai Rooney was on the bench. Wayne Rooney's son is that prolific in front of goal that he scored 56 goals in one season when he was 11. His father was in the stands, sitting alongside Michael Carrick, to watch.",
      "Carrick attended to show further support for the academy after watching the Under-21s in action on Tuesday. Carrick spoke about the importance of the Youth Cup and said that he was \"excited\" to attend.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Steve Holland and Jonny Evans were also spotted in the directors' box. Stephen Torpey, head of the academy, is understood to have welcomed the presence of the first-team staff at youth games again. Ruben Amorim did not show a similar interest during his one-and-a-half tenure in Manchester.",
      "Rooney tried to avoid attention when he arrived at Old Trafford, but a hood did not succeed in disguising his identity from a few excited supporters outside the ground, who stopped him for photographs.",
      "It was a big story that Rooney's son was on the bench at Old Trafford, nine years after his final game at the ground. Kai has played as a striker since he was a boy, but his father recently explained that his role has changed, saying: \"He's gone to the right wing. Left-footed, coming in off the right side.\"",
      "The warning signs were there for Derby. Gabriel danced down the left side - his balance is impressive - and played a delightful cross into the box. The 16-year-old was soon down that flank again, cutting inside and getting a shot away, only to be denied by Derby goalkeeper Cristiano Dzialuk.",
      "Gabriel looked dangerous from the start.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "Obi didn't want his younger peer to steal the show and attempted a shot of his own from the edge of the box. A few minutes later, he was denied by the outstretched legs of Dzialuk.",
      "The striker made seven Premier League appearances last season and starred during the post-season tour, but he's exclusively played in academy fixtures because coaches felt he still needs to develop.",
      "It's bound to have been difficult for Obi to drop down after getting a taste of playing in front of a full-capacity Old Trafford, however, anyone who has watched him play for the U21s this season will agree with the decision to move him down, as he still has parts of his game to improve.",
      "Obi's final ball, decision-making and work rate out of possession could be better. Nonetheless, he is a lethal striker at youth level, particularly at U18 level. Obi has rarely played U18 football since his arrival, but United want to win the Youth Cup and his inclusion in the team was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "Fletcher has returned to manage the U18s after briefly serving as caretaker. The 41-year-old was offered a role in Carrick's backroom staff, but felt it was the best choice for his career to return to the U18s.",
      "Fletcher was just as enthusiastic as he was in games against Burnley in the Premier League and Brighton in the FA Cup, shouting instructions to Gabriel and reminding Bendito Mantato of his defensive duties. \"Bendi, come on!\" Fletcher screamed when Derby made a promising counter-attack.",
      "Mantato had a great game against Derby.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The word before the game was that Derby needed to be respected and that proved to be the case. Despite the talent on the pitch for United, the away side looked capable of landing a blow.",
      "United goalkeeper Cameron Bryne-Hughes became busier as the match progressed. Fletcher grew increasingly agitated on the touchline. The game wasn't going according to the script, which was perfectly summed up by Gabriel and Obi getting in each other's way around Derby's box.",
      "There was audible anticipation in the stands when Gabriel was sent over the top with 10 minutes remaining, but Derby captain Rio Canoville recovered brilliantly to thwart the danger. Then Mantato, the standout performer in a red shirt, missed a huge chance with seconds of normal time remaining.",
      "Fletcher may have said to continue to 'huff and puff and blow their house down' when he prepared his team for extra-time. James Overy and Kai Rooney were introduced from the bench. Overy had an immediate impact by playing a cross into the box that led to the dreadlock being broken in the 101st minute.",
      "A demoralised Derby conceded again two minutes later, their resolve finally giving way. Obi scored the goal he'd been desperate for, and celebrated with a knee slide in front of the 2,000 fans.",
      "There were chants of 'Rooney, Rooney' when Kai Rooney was brought on from the bench. Derby set up a nervy end to the game by scoring to make it 2-1 late in extra-time, but it was ultimately United's strength in depth, their embarrassment of riches, that proved to be the difference on the night.",

      "Solskjaer and Carrick contended for the interim job this season.(Image: 2021 Alex Livesey - Danehouse)",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed that he has spoken to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since beating him to the Manchester United interim job. Carrick, Solskjaer and Ruud van Nistelrooy were considered to take charge of United for the remainder of the campaign, but Carrick landed the role.",
      "United sources described Carrick as 'impressive' throughout the interview process, and he made a dream start to his interim role by overseeing a stunning victory against Manchester City last weekend.",
      "Solskjaer has been out of work since being sacked by Besiktas in August. The Norwegian was responsible for Besiktas crashing out of Europe and was axed after just seven months in charge.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Carrick got a first taste of coaching as part of Jose Mourinho's backroom staff and he was retained when Solskjaer took over. Carrick has remained in touch with Solskjaer since working with him during that spell.",
      "When asked whether he'd spoken to Solskjaer, Carrick said: \"Yeah, I spoke to him. I'm close, we've been through a lot together, so he's been fully supportive and as you'd expect. He's some man and I respect him an awful lot. He wished us all the best and he was happy that we got the right result.\"",
      "Discussing whether he would pick Solskjaer's brains, he responded: \"I think friendships, you have conversations, I've got a lot of friends in places that I can kind of pick on if I need to be. I'm not one who bothers a lot of people, to be honest. But he's certainly there if ever I need him.\"",
      "Carrick served as United caretaker after Solskjaer was sacked in November 2021. He left the position with an undefeated record, which included a 3-2 victory against Arsenal, but he does not believe that previous encounter against Mikel Arteta is relevant ahead of this weekend's clash against the Gunners.",
      "Carrick after beating Arsenal in November 2021.(Image: 2021 Manchester United FC)",
      "\"I'll be honest with you, I think the confidence I'm taking going into the game is what we've seen since I've been here between me and my staff in terms of the game itself, training, how the boys have gone about it. Games from three or four years ago. It's done. It's in the past,\" he said.",
      "\"So as much as the experience kind of helps you in certain moments, I think it's a totally different game on Sunday and two teams going into it, looking forward to it in good shape.\"",
      "Speaking about United's game plan at the Emirates on Sunday, Carrick said: \"I think it's just playing to what we feel the game needs, really.",
      "\"It's never the same. Even if you come in half time and you've had a good performance for 45 minutes, I'm never one that likes to say same again because it's never, ever the same again. You've got to build on it. So it won't be kind of copy and paste.",
      "\"I think there's new elements that need to come into it. We need to be ready, we need to be at our best. And if we are our best and we're there, we feel we've got a good chance.\"",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Pep Guardiola has made four of the 20 biggest January signings ever in the last few years at Manchester City; his latest might be the best of the lot.",
      "There is a premium to be paid when making a mid-season purchase, but Guardiola has never let that put him off. These are the 20 biggest deals in the history of the January window.",
      "",
      "Considering the Leipzig recruitment model, the idea was likely always to move record signing Simons on eventually at great profit. They likely didn’t expect that to happen within seven months.",
      "Despite the Dutchman’s best efforts, Leipzig failed to qualify for the Champions League in the season they made Simons’ loan permanent. As a result, he informed them of his desire to leave and the poor thing ended up at Spurs of all places.",
      "",
      "Quite comfortably the closest any player has come to replicating what Rodri does for Manchester City, it required a half-season of acclimatisation for Gonzalez to take on board what Pep Guardiola wanted in the middle.",
      "Since then he has become a vital cog in an improving machine. Gonzalez has missed a single game for Manchester City in 2025/26 – and it was one of the few they have lost.",
      "",
      "The transfer which so infuriated Daniel Levy, the supposed master negotiator seething at another club for negotiating. Diaz was a fine addition to further regenerate the Liverpool attack.",
      "They even made a massive profit on the 28-year-old when Bayern Munich started sniffing around. But was the sale of Diaz a catalyst for this rough season?",
      "",
      "It still feels bizarre that Torres played eight more Premier League games for Chelsea than he did Liverpool. The goal haul despite that – 20 at Chelsea and 65 at Liverpool – points to a career trajectory that suffered a sharp fall upon his move to Stamford Bridge.",
      "And yet his four years with the Blues yielded a Champions League and Europa League trophy each, with no Anfield trinkets whatsoever.",
      "",
      "Back before Barcelona used economic levers to sign players with money they absolutely didn’t have, the Blaugrana fed their transfer addiction through old-fashioned means like overdrafts and bank loans. We’ve all been there.",
      "They could have plucked Torres from Valencia for £20m or so about 18 months beforehand but shut up that’s why.",
      "",
      "The most transformative signing at United since Robin van Persie. Just a shame the club are dragging him down with them.",
      "",
      "A miserable end should not obscure a mutually beneficial and temporarily happy union. Only eight players who played in the Premier League era have scored more goals for Arsenal than Aubameyang – and of those players, only Ian Wright and Thierry Henry scored more goals per game. If only he was more punctual and non-negotiable.",
      "",
      "One of football’s greatest mysteries is how Chelsea managed to sell a 29-year-old Diego Costa to Atletico Madrid for £57m despite the striker being very publicly surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge, as painstakingly proven by Antonio Conte’s text message dumping him straight after they won the title together in summer 2017.",
      "Costa had not played professional football for seven months by the time he returned to the Spanish capital; his La Liga record during that second spell was 61 appearances, 12 goals and 17 yellow cards, as well as an eight-game suspension he received for abusing a referee.",
      "",
      "Perhaps swayed by Liverpool breaking the world record for biggest transfer fee ever spent on a defender earlier that same month, Manchester City settled for Laporte.",
      "It wasn’t all a smooth ride but five Premier League titles in six years tells quite the compelling story of a player for whom City recouped £23.6million from Saudi in 2023.",
      "",
      "It did not going to plan for Pulisic, who might well suggest that playing for and being coached by three different managers in nearly four years at a time of immense upheaval has not helped. Frank Lampard, Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter all struggled to harness the American’s talents.",
      "And Maurizio Sarri was managing the Blues when the deal was put together. Still, he’s fairing rather better in Milan now.",
      "",
      "A rare case of a January signing immediately thriving in his first half-season before suffering from some delayed growing pains.",
      "Marmoush had an argument for being Manchester City’s best player in 2024/25, contributing eight goals and three assists to a struggling team finding their feet again.",
      "But with Erling Haaland firing and Guardiola figuring things out, Marmoush has found solace largely on the bench as the anniversary of his arrival looms.",
      "",
      "A decent 2024/25 for Kvaratskhelia, all things considered: 13 goals and 11 assists in 51 appearances for Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as winner’s medals in the Champions League, Ligue Un, Serie A and Coupe de France.",
      "PSG capitalised on Kvaratskhelia laughably low wage in Naples and neither club nor player have looked back since.",
      "",
      "Receiving £57m for an unwanted Costa was a quite ludicrous magic trick from Chelsea, but even they would be hard pushed to outdo the £60m they raked in for Oscar, practically a reserve, in 2017.",
      "Jamie Carragher described it as “embarrassing” for the Brazilian, but he can probably live with the shame. Or wipe his tears away using crisp £50 notes.",

      "After we were told the Ukrainian winger only wanted to join Arsenal, he signed an eight-and-a-half-year contract with Chelsea. Almost three years on, Mudryk has flopped hard and is currently on the sidelines after being charged with a doping offence.",
      "",
      "It is the biggest January signing ever made by Guardiola, who has leaned on the more expensive winter transfer window uncomfortably often in recent years.",
      "The Semenyo situation was a case of opportunity rather than necessity, with his Bournemouth release clause active only in early January 2026 and causing heart palpitations in elite boardrooms across the Premier League.",

      "They equally could hardly avoid cashing in when the Saudi coin arrived. And considering Duran can now be found on loan at Fenerbahce less than a year later, it must be categorised as another decisive Villa win.",

      "The football world scoffed along with Vlahovic at the Sophie’s Choice he was presented in January 2022. After breaking numerous records with Fiorentina, the young striker could have taken his pick of interested clubs.",
      "Arsenal were predictably – and justifiably at the time – rejected in favour of a move to Juventus. What could have been. Arsenal might have been spared their biggest mistake of 2025.",
      "",
      "This was the most expensive January deal ever when it went through on the first day of 2018 and the size of the fee took everyone by surprise. But it turns out that it was basically a bargain for the lynchpin of one of the most formidable teams in Premier League history.",
      "",
      "A deadline-busting deal that was on and off for much of January and only at the very last definitively on. Chelsea ended up going over and above Fernandez’s 120million euro release clause in exchange for a payment structure that suited their needs. Those needs primarily being ‘spread the cost as much as possible across the massive eight-and-a-half-year contracts we give out now’.",

      "Not that either he or the buying club will look back on the deal fondly. Liverpool, though, haven’t stopped laughing about one of the best pieces of transfer business ever.",
      "It’s been just over a month since the last update of the Premier League moods, and much has changed. Not in 20th place, though. They’re even more 20th now.",
      "Thank heavens for the supercomputer, for without its wisdom how would we ever know that winning seven Champions League games out of seven is good?",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And neither Man City nor Liverpool are in top five.",
      "Liverpool and Brentford gave entirely wrong first impressions, while Sunderland, Elliot Anderson and possibly Arsenal were easy to gauge straight away.",
      "According to reports, Chelsea have ‘agreed’ on their side of a Real Madrid ‘swap’ deal, but there are two rather significant problems to overcome.",
      "Chelsea will probably look at Cole Palmer’s personal PPG in an injury-hit season and think it is worth cashing in on interest from Man Utd while they can."

      "Every time we update the mood rankings we are reminded of a near universal truth: the default state of the football fan is misery, with the occasional split-second of happiness that makes it all worthwhile.",
      "Not every fan, not every club, and not all the time. But at any given time, most fans of most clubs? Not that happy with it all tbh.",
      "The Daily Telegraph recently concluded that only four Premier League fanbases are currently happy, and it’s hard to argue. Sunderland, Leeds, Villa and Brentford are the four, and even in those places it’s only a broad consensus rather than unanimous and undiluted joy; if you don’t believe us, approach a Villa fan and say the words ‘Sky Six’ or ‘Red Cartel’.",
      "Point of order: the current giddiness at Manchester United is an erratic and volatile mood swing and not (yet) actual happiness.",
      "Anyway. Here are the latest dooms and glooms and occasional tiny rays of sunlight. December’s positions in brackets, with the full reasonings here.",
      "",
      "In a way, you have to admire it. Having turned their 2024/25 season into an absurd and inexplicably successful high-wire act in which absolutely everything relied on winning the Europa League, they’ve doubled down in 25/26 and tried the same thing but this time with the Champions League, and while playing some of the most eye-bleedingly unwatchable football ever inflicted on supporters.",
      "There’s even the added jeopardy this season that tumbling grimly towards the relegation zone might end up with them tumbling directly into it. Spurs are free-climbing and thus free-falling this year without last season’s safety net of having three of the very worst Premier League teams ever always there below them ready to cushion the fall.",
      "Thomas Frank has become a walking embodiment of beleaguered as the sheer extent to which he is horrifyingly out of his depth gets more and more exposed with each passing game (in which he refuses to attempt any kind of passing game). He continues to imagine positives can be taken from defeats against West Ham or Bournemouth or draws against Burnley as if he were still at Brentford. He really seems unable or unwilling to accept the rules of engagement have changed.",
      "He’s also developed the infuriating accountability-dodging habit of pointing out that Spurs finished 17th last season as if this were the benchmark rather than the specific aberration he was brought in to ensure never, ever happened again, a disastrous domestic campaign so unthinkably and unrepeatably bad that it quite understandably got the previous manager the sack despite ending this club’s desperate yearning for silverware after 17 long and banter-addled years.",
      "There has also been a decisive shift from fans over the last couple of games. Spurs games have, obviously, been riddled with boos and jeers all season. It has been, not unreasonably, pointed out that aiming this stuff at the players is unhelpful. Tensions between some players and match-going fans have been palpable.",
      "That’s slightly shifted in recent weeks, and not in a good way for the manager. The fans are making it far clearer where precisely their anger is aimed. It is now being laser-targeted at a manager who surely cannot possibly survive a February that contains league matches against both Manchester clubs, Newcastle and Arsenal; a month that seems certain to leave them even closer to the bottom three and calamity than they already are.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace have become quite the philosophical poser, which we’re sure will be of huge comfort to their fans as they watch everything that had been built over the last 18 months come crashing down around their feet.",
      "But the inevitable question posed by Palace’s story in recent years is still a good one, and not as easily answered as might initially seem the case.",
      "And the question is this. Should Palace’s astonishing rise and fall over the last two years ends, as now seems alarmingly possible, with relegation is that better or worse than the previous decade spent trudging along finishing 12th every year (or near enough) and getting 47 points (or near enough)?",
      "Instinctively, you feel the drama of the last two years must be better. Look at those shots of fans at Wembley on FA Cup final day. That was the best day in Palace’s history, a day many couldn’t know they would ever live to see. Any price would be worth paying.",
      "But the price has proved spectacularly high. We all know by now that the smaller teams aren’t allowed nice things – certainly not for long anyway.",
      "Yet the sheer speed and scale of what has been taken away from Palace is still enough to make anyone’s head spin. It’s only eight months since Wembley, and Palace have lost or imminently will lose their best player, their best goalscorer, their captain, their manager, their Europa League place, their hopes, their dreams, their future.",
      "Jean-Philippe Mateta might even leave for Nottingham Forest, of all clubs. Adam Wharton will be the next to look at possible exit ramps.",
      "It’s a bit f*cking much, isn’t it? Especially when all you get in return is a used Brennan Johnson and a go at the Conference League.",
      "We are very much now at the time of the season where it’s the teams falling like a stone into relegation trouble that you fear for most, much more than those who’ve been moulded by the darkness all season.",
      "Especially when those teams – your Nottingham Forests, your Leeds Uniteds, and now even the West Hams of this world – are starting to show signs of life.",
      "There are few such signs at Palace, who are now without a win of any kind in any competition against anyone since beating Shelbourne in the Conference League back in December 11.",
      "The 11 games since then have included drawing at home to Finland’s KuPS, who needed that point to scrape into the top 24 of UEFA’s third-tier competition, becoming the first top-flight team ever knocked out of the FA Cup by one from the sixth tier and, most embarrassing and damaging of all, losing to Dr Tottenham in what now turns out to have been a really quite important relegation six-pointer.",
      "For it is Spurs, whose infamous generosity has been accepted by so many others in recent weeks, who join Palace as being the team spinning desperately out of control towards disaster. But even at their current levels of ridiculousness, there still feels like more Spurs can do to pull out of the tailspin. They just, for reasons we haven’t yet quite fathomed, don’t really want to do any of them.",
      "Palace’s growing crisis feels even more existential. This is a club now gripped by paralysis, where even if it acts, then what? Spurs are being severely punished for failure; if they sort themselves out they can still be fine. Palace are being severely punished for success. That’s a far harder puzzle to solve.",
      "It really wasn’t that long ago that we still thought even the loss of Oliver Glasner, which was always inevitable somewhere pretty soon down the line, need not be a catastrophe if handled right. It no longer feels like that’s the case.",
      "Even if Palace get the next appointment spot on, that manager can’t build on what Glasner achieved because everything Glasner has achieved is already being ripped down before he even officially departs.",
      "And that departure also now seems certain to come before its appointed time in the summer, with Glasner now cutting an increasingly frustrated and dejected figure.",
      "Dragging things out surely can’t be doing either him or Palace any good, but right now it just seems hard to imagine what will.",
      "",
      "Funny old effort from Burnley this season, really. They’ve not disgraced themselves but the sheer lack of attention they’re getting for having no league wins since October shows a) how low the bar now is for promoted teams and also b) just how bad, for how long Wolves were.",
      "The thing with Burnley is that they are far more competitive in individual games than they are across the season as a whole. There appears almost no chance they stay up, but they also just never get humiliated. They’ve only lost by more than two goals twice all season and not at all since September.",
      "And while they don’t ever win matches they have in recent weeks taken to drawing quite a lot of them, and against high-profile teams. Their last three games have all been against Big Six opposition, and they haven’t lost a single one.",
      "Now sure, the quality of those Big Six sides ranges from mediocre to actual fellow relegation candidates, but the point stands. Things have never felt so bleak and forlorn that it’s looked like Scott Parker was about to get the chop. There appears an acceptance that he’s doing as well as anyone could and is still the very ideal sort of chap to try and get them back up again next year.",
      "And it’s hard to argue with any of that. Even when they were losing seven games in a row in the run-up to Christmas, it was never nightmarish. Four of those defeats were by a single goal, and of the three two-goal defeats one was against Arsenal, which is fair enough, another against a Chelsea side who only made the points safe in the 88th minute and the third a daft 3-1 at Brentford in a game that had been goalless at 80 minutes.",
      "If they’re going to do anything beyond continuing on the current vaguely dignified yet nevertheless fate-accepting path to relegation, then it does feel like the time is now. Their next three games are against Sunderland, West Ham and Crystal Palace and you’d think they really are going to have to give some thought to actually winning at least one or two of those.",
      "",
      "It will never be great when your situation ‘improves’ to eight points from 23 games. But improve it has, and at the very least that little spurt of six points from four games including an actual, real-life Premier League win means Derby’s all-time 11-point nadir should be negotiated with time to spare.",
      "Rob Edwards has come in and done a decent job in absurdly grim circumstances but the anger and despair at the way an established Premier League club has been brought so very low by boardroom mismanagement on an epic scale remains real and righteous.",
      "It’s a grim mess with the grimmer reality that the real work comes in the summer and next season. The recent efforts on the field offer some hope, but the struggles of last season’s relegated clubs to get straight back up and the fact Wolves’ last relegation from the Premier League saw them tumble straight down to League One before fighting their way back are a reminder that this can all absolutely get worse before it gets better. If, indeed, get better it does.",
      "",
      "Few clearer examples of just how much misery there is around the Premier League at this time than the fact West Ham somehow managed to remain outside our bottom three last time out and do so again now.",
      "Slightly misleading, of course, because for quite a long spell between the two updates they would definitely have been lower than they land in either; a ranking list directly after the 3-0 defeat at Wolves might somehow have seen them defy mathematics altogether and slip below 20th.",
      "But two wins in a row have, as two wins in a row are wont to do, improved things ever so slightly. West Ham will never not enjoy a late win over Tottenham, and it does feel like one of the most significant results anywhere in the league this season.",
      "It offered renewed hope to a club where it appeared to have faded and died, and parlaying that into an even more impressive win against Sunderland the following weekend has at least kept the Hammers in the mix – as well as dragging other clubs back into their grief hole. Tottenham obviously, but also Palace, are more miserable than they were (which was already quite miserable) as a direct consequence of West Ham being ever so slightly less so.",
      "Which again seems to emphasise the point that miserable is the default position of the football fan; one set of fans being a bit less miserable than before has, if anything, increased the league’s overall misery quota.",
      "Or it might all just be because it’s January, and f*ck January to be honest.",
      "",
      "Caveats and mitigation exist, but it’s just a remarkably poor season, really. From title winners in May to transfer-window winners in August to scrapping desperately and by no means yet certainly for a Champions League spot in January.",
      "With history’s most fraudulent unbeaten run over after a late defeat at Bournemouth, Liverpool find themselves once more outside the top five and with absolutely no real cause for complaint.",
      "They are simply nowhere near the levels of last season despite spending vast sums in the summer. Arne Slot already looks like he’s on the way out, and this time the timing for Xabi Alonso to come in looks absolutely perfect.",
      "But that means another fresh start for Liverpool and, while his club-legend status and obvious quality means it will be one that starts with bountiful optimism it’s still a wild state of affairs on the back of a title win and summer spend that was supposed to herald the coming of a new era of dominance.",
      "",
      "Earlier in the season it was Aston Villa annoying us because we couldn’t work out if they were good or sh*t and now it is Newcastle.",
      "Villa, to their enormous credit, have had the decency to provide a definitive answer and that’s all we ask.",
      "Every time we think we’re just about ready to declare for Newcastle one way or the other, they throw us for a loop again.",
      "Going into the November international break on the back of defeats at West Ham and Brentford had us ready to declare crisis. Then they beat Man City and spangled Everton and we thought ‘okay, maybe they’re not bad actually’.",
      "Then they didn’t even managed to beat Spurs and lost at Sunderland and a pre-Carrick Man United when that was still a mortifying thing to happen to anyone. Fine, they are bad, we thought. Good to know.",
      "Then they won their next three games in a row, and winning three games in a row in this league is enough to drag almost anyone into a halfway acceptable league position. ‘Okay,’ we thought, ‘maybe they’re good after all’.",
      "Then they drew at Wolves and lost meekly to Villa who, as we’ve said, have stopped p*ssing us all about in this manner.",
      "They’re now ninth in the league, but that means nothing because in a couple of weeks they could be sixth or 14th given how volatile the mid-table gang are.",
      "We should in theory have some kind of better idea after the next month or so, in which Newcastle face Liverpool and Brentford and Tottenham and Man City. But you know what? Bet we don’t.",
      "So whatever their own fans think of it all, one thing we can say for certain is that Newcastle are p*ssing us off this season. And that’s what really matters.",
      "",
      "Seven points from their last three games have significantly improved their survival chances even if there was some FA Cup unpleasantness along the way.",
      "A curious season for Forest still has a wide array of possible outcomes, from ‘complete disaster’ to ‘European glory’ via – and this one is much the most likely – ‘wasted opportunity’. They might go down but probably won’t. They might win the Europa League but probably won’t.",
      "They probably will end up in the bottom six and thinking they’ve fumbled the chance to do something rather more lasting and substantial with last season’s apparent breakthrough.",
      "We will all have a clearer idea in a few weeks’ time after they’ve played relegation rivals Palace, Leeds and Wolves as well as the Europa League play-offs.",
      "",
      "Pop quiz, no cheating. How many of Brighton’s last 10 Premier League games have they won? Wrong. Wrong again. It’s one. One game. Against Burnley. At home.",
      "We genuinely have no idea how that’s true given whenever we’ve watched them they seem to be broadly and predictably competent. But true it is. At the start of that run they were fifth, which is fine because literally everyone apart from Wolves has had a go at being fifth this season.",
      "But back then they were only two points behind Villa and now they are 12th and – this is the crucial bit – they’ve achieved this without anyone really noticing. And, perhaps even more impressively, without any particularly tangible change in their football.",
      "The fact that right in the middle of this run they also went and beat Man United really quite impressively in the FA Cup is also good.",
      "",
      "They’re at it again, aren’t they? Absolute scamps. After a couple of months of Champions League form, Andoni Iraola’s incorrigibly streaky gang of imps then did a couple of months of relegation form.",
      "They just can’t help themselves. This is what they’ve been like ever since Andoni Iraola rocked up and pinched Gary O’Neil’s birthright and there is no sign of it stopping. They’ve now taken seven points from their last three games against Spurs, Brighton and Liverpool, and will no doubt win five of their next six games before failing to win any of the next eight after that.",
      "It’s a great bit, honestly, but while the absolute commitment to it is exemplary and admirable, we do wonder if it’s just becoming a bit cliché. Just talking about Bournemouth being streaky has certainly become passe, but unavoidably so. Bournemouth being Bournemouthy has become as much a feature of Premier League life as Spurs being Spursy. No point fighting it, we suppose.",
      "We remain intrigued to see how much of this is a Bournemouth thing and how much an Iraola thing, and await their and his next move with interest given the wide array of big Barclays jobs likely to be up for grabs this summer.",
      "",
      "Mid-table here, mid-table there, mid-table everywhere. Have the chance to do the funniest thing possible at Old Trafford this weekend.",
      "",
      "There’s an extremely strong chance it works out wonderfully well in the end and a very strong chance it does even more than that. There’s a small but very real chance this ends up being Arsenal’s greatest ever season, with domestic and European glory and Spurs crying all the way to the Championship. The quadruple is on; quintuple if you include that Spurs relegation bit.",
      "So why don’t Arsenal fans seem to be having any fun? We’re not going to go as far as miserable here, but they are definitely sh*tting pre-emptive bricks about what happens if things don’t all work out in the end.",
      "We know and they know – and they know we know – that if they don’t win the league this year they are going to get absolutely slaughtered. There will be almost no feasible defence this time to the cruel bottle-job taunts that will rain down upon them from all directions. The fear is palpable, entirely understandable, but also in danger of becoming rather self-fulfilling. The nervousness at the Emirates for the visit of Manchester United on Sunday was positively bleeding out of the screen even for those of us watching on TV. No wonder it was felt by the players actually there trying not to think of the B word.",
      "Given the position in which Arsenal and everyone else now find themselves, there really are only two possible ways for this season to end. Either Arsenal fans will be absolutely unbearable towards everyone else, or everyone else will be absolutely unbearable towards Arsenal fans. And in both scenarios righteously so, and for a really quite extended period of time.",
      "Arsenal fans still hope and expect the former, but the fear of the latter is real and growing.",
      "",
      "Funny thing about Man City this season: they an also win the quadruple. Doesn’t feel like it, though, does it? And not just because nobody ever wins the quadruple – not the proper one anyway.",
      "Yet City are currently (if narrowly) the bookies’ favourites ahead of Arsenal in both the Carabao and FA Cup. They are second in the league scenting blood in the water, and the Champions League’s absolute refusal to be interesting means that even another stuttering campaign there cannot eliminate them before the knockouts.",
      "So… it’s all going pretty well. But we repeat: it simply doesn’t feel like it. There is a growing understanding that while the precise timing of Pep Guardiola’s departure remains unconfirmed the day is certainly approaching, and that brings inevitable uncertainty.",
      "Especially as this is simply not the most convincing Man City side, especially with Erling Haaland in one of those weird mid-season funks he gets when he just stops scoring until someone performs the necessary system updates.",
      "It’s now just one goal (a penalty as well, if you’re the sort of person that bothers) in nine for the big man, including a 45-minute blank in a 10-1 FA Cup win over Exeter.",
      "They may still be in touch with Arsenal at the top of the Premier League, but it’s not been via their trademark unstoppable run because that petered out over a month ago now.",
      "Since winning eight straight games in November and December it’s been three wins (one of them the aforementioned sorting out of Exeter) in their last eight games heading into a Champions League game against Galatasaray they must win to avoid the play-offs and then a trip to catastrophe-addicted Tottenham that even at the best of times would carry far less certainty for City than it would any broadly equivalent side.",
      "",
      "Home form has started to go the way one always fears home form might at a new stadium, with no win at the Hill Dickinson since giving Nottingham Forest what for back in early December.",
      "But the away form has stepped up with a couple of fine away wins in the midlands on their two most recent away days keeping them safely in the mid-table pack and well clear of any of the unpleasantness other teams are allowing themselves to be sucked into down below them.",
      "It’s not quite been as fun a season as we’d hoped it might be for Everton, but it’s fine. They aren’t going to have to chew their fingernails down to the quick, and that’s something not to be sniffed at. We’re very much at the time of the season where for a great many clubs having nothing real to play for is actually a lot less stressful than having everything to play for.",
      "",
      "No longer a football club, not really, and it’s a damning indictment on everyone else that they’re still able to do quite well at actual football despite this. Imagine what they might do if they were confident enough in their approach to, say, hire or retain a manager who might answer back occasionally. Or sign a player over 23 years old because he improves the playing squad rather than the balance sheet.",
      "Given how far down the list of priorities the creation of a functional, rounded football squad is at Chelsea and how no manager ever lasts more than 18 months, it’s pretty extraordinary that they’re able to compete at all.",
      "And then you remember just how much money they’ve spent on their player-trading business and then slap yourself around the face and head for saying their ability to compete on the pitch is extraordinary.",
      "But it kind of is, though. Absurd club and still, in so many ways, far more of an all-that’s-wrong-with-the-modern-game outfit than Man City. Say what you like about City and their methods – or even Chelsea in the Abramovich days – but at least they’ve always also tried to build the best possible football team under the best possible manager.",
      "It feels like a ridiculously low bar because it is. Yet it is one BlueCo Chelsea have never cleared, will never clear, and show no real interest in clearing.",
      "",
      "In truly unprecedented scenes, a shambolic and spluttering Manchester United have sacked a fool of a coach who knew neither the club nor Our League, appointed a beloved former player as interim manager, won a couple of games rather impressively, and are thus possessed with the absolute certainty they are once again about to dominate English football for a good couple of decades.",
      "Okay, much of the exaggeration here is ours, and there is simply no denying that both the performances and victories United have achieved under Michael Carrick’s watchful if still for now temporary eye have been enormously impressive.",
      "There need be no caveats applied to anyone who turns up at any misfiring football club and immediately masterminds wins over Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "That some relatively simple and really quite obvious quick fixes (pick Harry Maguire, pick Kobbie Mainoo, choose a formation that suits the players you have available) have been so transformative says a lot more about the previous manager than the current one, but it’s still undeniably and uncomplicatedly impressive.",
      "We can all also, of course, enjoy the sight of some (and it was only some) Arsenal fans lashing out on social media about Man United responding to their win at the Emirates like they’d won the Champions League.",
      "We’re sorry, Arsenal fans, that sounds like celebration policing. You hate that.",
      "So while we’re not about to deny any Man United fan their elation at what’s gone off in the last couple of weeks, we still worry for them. It just feels like they’ve set off down another familiar path that leads them right back where they started.",
      "Carrick is going to be given the permanent job after a few more wins – having sorted out the best two teams in the country the upcoming and infamously light fixture list is inevitably more straightforward – and we all know what will happen after that.",
      "So United, by all means enjoy it, but enjoy it by being f*cking disciplined. Let’s at the very least try and save the street parties and title talk until after yer man has been able to get himself down the barbers.",
      "",
      "Surprised ourselves to find we’d got them as low as 14th last time out, but turns out they’d just taken one point from their last three league games and got knocked out the Carabao in a run that even included the utter indignity of becoming (and still remaining) only the second Premier League team to contrive to lose to Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium under Thomas Frank.",
      "Which was a double blow for Brentford specifically, of course. Immediately after we dropped them down the mood rankings a place or six they went off and won five of their next six games in all competitions and briefly even popped up in the top five, as pretty much everyone other than Wolves appears to have done at some point this season.",
      "The only team they didn’t beat in that run? Thomas Bloody Frank’s Silly Spurs again, which is a mild pisser but no more than that, all told. Brentford under Keith Andrews remain, even after a couple of defeats to drop them back into the mid-table gang, conspicuously better than Tottenham under Thomas Frank, and if you can’t enjoy that then you don’t have blood in your veins.",
      "",
      "Some low-level huffing and puffing after a 1-1 draw away at Everton serve as yet another reminder that almost no glass is ever quite as half-full as it might be, but we’re still putting Leeds firmly among the small group of clubs whose current general mood can be summed up as ‘Broadly Very Happy, Thank You Very Much’.",
      "Fifteen points from their last 10 Premier League games have lifted them clear of the relegation zone and now within touching distance of those tumbling out the back of the mid-table clog. No reason at all to think Leeds won’t be fully paid-up members of that mid-table clog within the next week or three.",
      "We do understand the slight frustration, as well. For all that the 15-point return from those 10 games (after managing only 11 from the first 13) has changed the whole dynamic of Leeds’ season it does also feel like the very, very least their vastly improved performances across those games have deserved.",
      "But even that is, in its own frustrating way, a positive. Leeds are playing very decent and effective football that has got them out of immediate relegation peril, and all without any sense yet that they’ve peaked or are merely on some unsustainable run of good fortune or freakish results.",
      "They have achieved, over what is now a pretty lengthy period of time, very decent, solid mid-table Premier League results because they have played like a very decent, solid mid-table Premier League team.",
      "",
      "In many ways, Villa are the clearest example of all that the default setting of the football fan is pessimism and misery. They are second in the table, level on points with Manchester City and only four points behind an Arsenal side that has spent the entire season looking like it’s about to decisively run away with the league and then not quite doing that.",
      "With Europa League glory still looking an entirely plausible outcome as well, it is by any sane measure an astonishing effort from Unai Emery and the lads. And we’re not saying Villa fans aren’t happy. They are happy. Obviously, they’re happy.",
      "But… gah, we might be wrong here but we just don’t think they’re as happy as they should be. We don’t think they’re enjoying it all as much as they should do. We’re just hearing far too much bleating about Sky Sixes and Red Cartels and not being allowed to just spend even more money they don’t actually have chasing their dreams.",
      "It’s not unfair that clubs with more money are allowed to spend (and in most cases it’s actually ‘waste’ anyway, so don’t worry) more money than clubs who have less money. If anything, that’s fairer than the alternative.",
      "Anyway, hopefully winning the league will cheer them up a bit.",
      "",
      "Things have dropped off a bit since the highs of the derby win over Newcastle that arrived just before the last mood update and inevitably had Sunderland riding at their absolute highest.",
      "But even that dropping-off can be framed however you want to do it; one win in seven games since Newcastle is also only two defeats in seven games since Newcastle.",
      "They’re still comfily flitting about in mid-table without a relegation care in the world, they’re still the best promoted side we’ve seen in quite some time and they are, since Sunday, the proud and last remaining owners of an unbeaten home record in this season’s Premier League.",
      "We’re going to say with some confidence that even the most bullish Sunderland fan wasn’t predicting that back in August.",
      "We reckon there are maybe four Premier League fanbases genuinely happy with life at this time, and we’re really starting to think that Sunderland, as the team with least to stress about over the months ahead, might for now be the most content of the lot.",
      "For most of the fans who are currently happy there remains the fear that this season could still go horribly wrong. That doesn’t really apply to Sunderland, even if they do eventually lose a home game.",
      "Pep Guardiola has made four of the 20 biggest January signings ever in the last few years at Manchester City; his latest might be the best of the lot.",
      "Thank heavens for the supercomputer, for without its wisdom how would we ever know that winning seven Champions League games out of seven is good?",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And neither Man City nor Liverpool are in top five.",
      "Liverpool and Brentford gave entirely wrong first impressions, while Sunderland, Elliot Anderson and possibly Arsenal were easy to gauge straight away.",
      "Chelsea will probably look at Cole Palmer’s personal PPG in an injury-hit season and think it is worth cashing in on interest from Man Utd while they can.",
      "Palace have lost or imminently will lose their best player, their best goalscorer, their captain, their manager, their Europa League place, their hopes, their dreams, their future."

      "And now reports in Spain claim Man Utd and Chelsea have ‘submitted firm offers’ for the Argentina international, who has contributed seven goals and three assists in 21 La Liga appearances this season.",
      "The focus of the report is on Catalan giants Barcelona and adding on the offers from the two Premier League clubs, adds: ‘These are two projects with considerable financial resources, salaries far exceeding what Barca can currently offer, and a guaranteed leading role. The Catalan club is aware of this situation and acknowledges that it starts at a clear disadvantage.’",
      "MEDIAWATCH: Arsenal ‘boost’ but ‘heartbreak’ for Premier League rivals in Champions League ‘forecast’",

      "Dalot was largely a starter under Amorim and Carrick has also started the Portugal international in both of his first two matches as interim boss.",
      "However, Dalot has been one of a number of players who have come in for criticism this season and there have been rumours he could leave depending on the new manager.",

      "The La Liga outfit are ‘looking to strengthen its defensive structure following Nahuel Molina’s recent inconsistent performances’ and Diego Simeone ‘values ​​the addition’ of Dalot, who signed for Man Utd from Porto for around £19m in 2019.",
      "Atletico Madrid ‘needs a reliable player who can finally free up Marcos Llorente for a more central role in midfield’ and Man Utd full-back Dalot ‘would welcome a move to the Spanish capital’.",

      "“I actually think there’s a half-decent full back in there. And I want full backs so closely.",
      "“At times I think he gets too involved but he’s good in the air, he’s athletic, he’s decent on the ball, he can defend his back post.",
      "“I don’t think he’s a world class full back but neither was I. He does a lot of things and he could even simplify his game a little and focus on feeding people.",
      "“He’s started being more aggressive at getting out to players and then getting back in. The defenders in general are really getting that connection in the last two games.",
      "“I think he’s got something about him, Dalot, I think he’s got a 7/10 performance in him every week.",
      "“But we’ve seen him at right and left wing back before and he’s been exposed so many times. If he just played right fullback all the time I wouldn’t be getting rid of him as a hurry.",

      "READ: Odegaard binned by Arsenal as Man Utd duo leave in summer exodus of 10 POTY winners",
      "The Man Utd interim boss said: “I’m not going to lie, it was a bit of a calculated gamble as well of how long he could play and if he could get through it because he’s literally trained for two or three days for probably eight or nine weeks, so it just shows you what it means really to him.

      "Former Man Utd midfielder Nicky Butt has revealed that he “feels sorry” for Matheus Cunha after he came off the bench to score the winner against Arsenal in a 3-2 victory.",
      "The Red Devils came from a goal down to lead 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday before Mikel Merino levelled the scores up with only six minutes left on the clock.",
      "However, just three minutes later, Man Utd substitute Cunha picked up the ball and dribbled to the edge of the box before unleashing an unstoppable winner past David Raya.",
      "Cunha, who joined Man Utd from Wolves in a £62.5m deal in the summer, has contributed five goals and two assists in 20 Premier League appearances this season.",
      "The Brazilian also started as a substitute against Man City the week before and both Butt and Paul Scholes insist that Cunha will not be happy about his role, although Patrick Dorgu’s injury is likely to mean he starts their next match against Fulham.",
      "Speaking about Dorgu’s impact under interim boss Michael Carrick, Scholes said on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast: “He was brought in as a wing-back because that was Amorim’s system, but going back to when we were playing, wide players actually would help your full-back, and United have started doing that.",
      "READ: Odegaard binned by Arsenal as Man Utd duo leave in summer exodus of 10 POTY winners",
      "“Against Saka, who is their best attacker by a million miles, it was like playing against two left-backs at times because he was working back, but he’s scoring goals as well.",
      "“I don’t see him there as a left winger full-time, Michael’s obviously seen something in him that he likes because he’s left Cunha out for him, and what a player he is.”",
      "Butt interrupted: “Cunha’s giving you an option off the bench and I do feel a bit sorry.”",
      "Before Scholes added: “He won’t be happy with that, no chance, he won’t be happy with that sentence.”",
      "And  Butt continued: “If you look when Darren [Fletcher] was in charge and he’s looking at his bench, he’s got no one to come on. You’ve got the young lads which is okay, they’re good players but when it’s going bad you need proper pros in that team who can come on the pitch, stick their chest out and go against people.",
      "“He might find himself in a bad position now, Cunha, thinking, ‘I’m a really good sub to bring on, I carry the ball up the pitch, I get the fouls, kill the clock when we’re winning and I can score goals’, he could end up being a super sub.",
      "“Also with the Cunha situation, I think Mbeumo has been brilliant as a nine. I think he’s done that job really, really well. He’s a handful, he’s powerful, he’s quick, you’re thinking Cunha might see himself on the bench for a good few weeks now.”",
      "Self-proclaimed “above average” Premier League footballer Jamie O’Hara would be a shoo-in for Prick of the Week if we still gave out that award…",
      "Man Utd were once successful because of the likes of Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. If they are to be again, it will be in spite of them…",
      "Every single Manchester United in the Mailbox has picked Lisandro Martinez in his spat with the Class of 92.",
      "We begin with Eberechi Eze’s rarely-seen wife but move on to Lisandro Martinez being given some advice by an old man.",
      "Lisandro Martinez responded to Butt and Scholes’ entirely baseless criticism and *he’s* the one who needs to “f***ing grow up”? Lads, he’s made you look like a couple of…",
      "Nicky Butt has told Lisandro Martinez to “f***ing grow up” after the Manchester United defender hit back at the pundit for mocking him on his podcast."

      "The lack of a natural option on the left has seen Mason Mount play in Ruben Amorim’s front three for much of this campaign, while natural left-wing-back Patrick Dorgu has been deployed as a left winger under interim manager Darren Fletcher and current boss Michael Carrick.",

      "Champions League qualification would provide a significant boost towards landing their top transfer targets, with midfielders Carlos Baleba of Brighton, Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson, and Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton all reportedly of interest.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, United could take advantage of Milan ‘considering a sale’ for star man Rafael Leao, while Chelsea teenager Tyrique George and Everton winger Iliman Ndiaye are also under ‘consideration’.",
      "The report states:",
      "The left winger market is going to be one to pay closer attention to in the coming months with United likely to stick to a back-four system regardless of whether Carrick remains in charge or not.",
      "Sources in Italy have said that AC Milan would consider a sale for Rafael Leao, while Ineos’ Premier League-proven preference brings others such as Tyrique George, 19, and available to leave Chelsea, and Everton’s Iliman Ndiaye, under contract until 2029, into consideration.",
      "Leao has been perpetually linked with a Premier League move for several years, reportedly previously being a top target for Chelsea.",
      "The 26-year-old Portuguese international is under contract until 2028, so Milan could look to cash in while his value is high, though he is not expected to cost the £100million reported two years ago.",
      "Leao has scored seven goals and provided two assists in 16 Serie A games this season and has registered 143 goal involvements in 278 appearances for the Rossoneri.",
      "He is widely regarded as one of the best wingers in Europe but has yet to be tested in the Premier League, which could make the signing of Ndiaye more appealing.",

      "The 25-year-old has four goals and two assists in the Premier League this season, but his impact goes beyond statistics. Excellent in one-on-one situations with opposition full-backs, Ndiaye is among Europe’s best dribblers and has the ability to turn defence into attack in the blink of an eye.",

      "A player with immense ability and potential, the 19-year-old has struggled for minutes this campaign and was close to joining Fulham last summer.

      "The most overrated player at the Stadium of Light, it initially seemed as though £21m had been spent wisely on Simon Adingra (1.07) when the forward assisted a goal on his winning debut and featured in the club’s first three Premier League victories.",
      "But not since the Black Cats ransacked the City Ground and left with three points in September has Adingra played in any win beyond the FA Cup third-round shoot-out against Everton, in which he was substituted before the end.",

      "He will not. Kolo Muani’s only goals in 23 appearances this campaign have come against the club who loaned him to Spurs in the first place, with PSG still hammering them 5-3 at the Parc des Princes despite that Kolo Muani double.",
      "Juventus are lurking with the 27-year-old said to be considering his immediate future already.",

      "There have been reports that West Ham might already be willing to sell Soungoutou Magassa (0.5), having barely platformed the £14.7m midfielder since his arrival.",
      "With that said, his most recent Premier League appearance ended at half time of the 3-0 thrashing by Wolves, since which West Ham have won two of their three games.",
      "Magassa has played in one Premier League win: for 19 minutes against Burnley in November.",
      "",
      "It isn’t difficult to see why Wolves loaned Ki-Jana Hoever (0.00) out as soon as humanly possible. All eight of his appearances for them ended in defeat before Sheffield United took the Dutchman on and promptly lost his first two games, including a shock FA Cup defeat at home to Mansfield.",
      "However, Hoever did finally get the monkey off his back in the victory against Ipswich, the Blades trusting him with just three minutes at the end of a 3-1 win.",
      "Beyond Hoever, Toti Gomes (0.08) is spared inclusion on a technicality. Twelve of his 13 appearances have been in defeats, with the exception coming in the Spurs draw in September, when he came on as a stoppage-time substitute two minutes before Thomas Frank’s side equalised.",
      "Pep Guardiola has made four of the 20 biggest January signings ever in the last few years at Manchester City; his latest might be the best of the lot.",
      "It’s been just over a month since the last update of the Premier League moods, and much has changed. Not in 20th place, though. They’re even more 20th now.",

      "Arne Slot has talked about Liverpool's issues against low blocks and they are not the only Premier League side struggling to break down deep-lying opponents; Between the Lines digs into the data to reveal the teams with the best and worst numbers",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Wednesday 28 January 2026 15:50, UK",
      "Low blocks are a hot topic in the Premier League.",
      "The term refers to a defending team sitting deep in a compact shape to protect their goal and restrict space in central areas, making it difficult for their opponent to create chances.",
      "Which teams come up against low blocks most frequently? And which teams are most and least effective when it comes to playing against them? Between the Lines digs into the numbers.",
      "Arne Slot was told to stop talking about low blocks by Steven Gerrard after Liverpool's Champions League win over Marseille.",
      "The data supports Slot's comments on low blocks.",
      "This season, Liverpool have a higher percentage of build-up phases of play against compact defences than any team in the Premier League, at 26 per cent.",
      "Arsenal are second, at 24 per cent, with Nottingham Forest and Newcastle third and fourth, on 23 and 22 per cent respectively.",
      "At the other end of the scale, Leeds have the lowest percentage of build-up phases against low blocks this season, at 14 per cent, just below Crystal Palace and Burnley at 15 per cent.",
      "Slot has bemoaned facing more low blocks than last season this term as Liverpool's opponents set up to frustrate them.",
      "Again, the data backs him up.",
      "Only Everton have experienced a bigger increase to the percentage of build-up phases against deep opposition this season.",
      "While Liverpool and Everton are facing low blocks more frequently, Manchester City are facing them less frequently.",
      "In fact, Pep Guardiola's side have the biggest negative differential among ever-present Premier League clubs this term, their percentage dropping from the highest in the Premier League last season at 27 per cent, to 21 per cent this term, putting them fifth.",
      "The dip reflects changes to the way they are attacking, as well as how teams are defending against them, with Guardiola having put more emphasis on directness this season.",
      "Aston Villa rank as by far the most effective team against low blocks.",
      "Helped by a succession of strikes from outside the box this season, Unai Emery's side have racked up 19 goals from phases of play against deep defences since the start of last term.",
      "It is three more than any other side has managed in the same timeframe, with Manchester City next on 16. Newcastle have also enjoyed some success, scoring 15 goals against low blocks.",
      "Excluding relegated and promoted sides, Brentford have scored the fewest goals against low blocks, with three.",
      "Aston Villa and Brentford also come out top and bottom respectively when factoring the number of times Premier League teams have come up against opponents in a low block.",
      "For context, Aston Villa's 19 goals since the start of last season have come from 1,717 build-up phases against compact defences, giving them an average considerably higher than any other Premier League side at 1.11 goals per 100 phases.",
      "Manchester City's 16 goals, meanwhile, have come from a far higher number of build-up phases against low blocks, at 2,676, giving them a much lower average of 0.60 per 100 phases.",
      "While Newcastle and Manchester United rank closest to Newcastle for goals per 100 build-up phases against deep defences, Liverpool and Arsenal sit closer to Brentford.",
      "Arsenal's issues become even clearer when looking at shot numbers.",
      "While Liverpool do at least get a decent amount of shots off against low blocks, their average of 9.9 per 100 phases of play putting them fourth among ever-present Premier League sides in the last two seasons, Mikel Arteta's side average the second-fewest, at just 7.8 shots per 100 phases of play.",
      "The data also suggests Chelsea struggle against low blocks, averaging only fractionally more shots than Arsenal at 8.1.",
      "Arsenal's lack of threat against low blocks was most recently apparent during Sunday's 3-2 loss to Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium, when the Gunners struggled to open up their opponent's defensive structure in open play.",
      "In contrast to Arsenal, Manchester United have averaged considerably more shots against low blocks than any other Premier League side since the start of last season, at 12.9 per 100 phases of play, showing they fare better at breaking them down.",
      "Why are so many Premier League strikers struggling this season? Last week's edition looked at the declining number of goals being scored by forwards and the reasons behind the trend.",

      "Cole Palmer is contracted at Chelsea until 2033; recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United; Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet has expressed a preference for joining Chelsea",
      "Wednesday 28 January 2026 07:38, UK",
      "Chelsea consider Cole Palmer \"untouchable\" amid links with Manchester United.",
      "Palmer is contracted until 2033 and is seen as a key player in the club's future.",
      "Recent reports have suggested the England international was feeling unsettled in London and was open to a move to Manchester United in order to return to the north west, but Chelsea believe the player is happy at Stamford Bridge - as does head coach Liam Rosenior.",
      "Asked if Palmer is 'untouchable' and happy at the club, Rosenior replied: \"Yes and yes. It's simple.",
      "\"Cole's an incredible player like [Moises Caicedo] sitting next to me and many players in the group.",
      "\"I'm not surprised at the timing [of the rumours]. A new manager comes in and all of a sudden there's people are [looking to] unsettle. It's not true. Cole's here, he's very happy and I can't wait to see him on the pitch.",
      "\"There's no reason for an assurance [from Chelsea's directors]. It's so unrealistic. It's come from nowhere, there's nothing in it. There's no reason to have the conversation, that's where I'm at.",
      "\"Cole is very happy. We've had numerous conversations with him on how we can make this team better, how he can improve and how I can help him - because he loves being here and he wants to be a Chelsea player.",
      "\"You can't stop speculation, but some speculation is so far from the truth, there's not point having any discussion about it.\"",
      "Palmer's season has been hampered by injuries to his groin, toe and, most recently, thigh which caused him to miss Sunday's victory at Crystal Palace, but he returned to training on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League fixture at Napoli.",
      "The 23-year-old has not provided an assist in the Premier League this season, scoring four goals in 12 league appearances, having netted 15 in 46 last term and providing 11 assists.",
      "Palmer joined Chelsea from Manchester City in a £40m deal in 2023, and has scored 41 goals and made 20 assists across his 81 league appearances for the Blues.",
      "Rennes centre-back Jeremy Jacquet has expressed a preference for joining Chelsea despite interest from multiple teams.",
      "Talks are ongoing between Rennes and Chelsea about a deal for the 20-year-old French centre back.",
      "Ideally, Rennes want to keep him until the summer and it is proving to be a difficult deal to complete, especially in January.",
      "Clubs such as Bayern Munich and Liverpool are reported to be interested in buying the player in the summer.",
      "Rennes want €65m (£56m) but Chelsea have so far been reluctant to match the asking price.",
      "Chelsea have recalled centre back Aaron Anselmino from his loan at Borussia Dortrmund but it is not certain he will stay at Chelsea for the rest of the season.",
      "Chelsea had five centre backs in their squad for their win at Crystal Palace on Sunday and they have AFCON winner Mamadou Sarr on loan at sister club Strasbourg. Two other Chelsea centre backs are out injured at the moment - Levi Colwill and Tosin Adarabioyo.",
      "Other January centre back target options for Chelsea include Bournemouth's Marcos Senesi and Como's Jacobo Ramon.",
      "Senesi, 28, is out of contract this summer but Bournemouth would be extremely reluctant to let him leave this month. He is set to have the option of moving to some of the biggest clubs in Europe in the summer.",
      "Jacquet is highly rated by new Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior and played for Rennes when they beat Rosenior's Strasbourg side 4-1 in Ligue 1 in November.",
      "Axel Disasi is expected to leave Chelsea before the January transfer window closes.",
      "Multiple clubs are interested in England, Germany, France and Italy, with West Ham an option. Fiorentina are considering a move for Disasi, according to Sky in Italy.",
      "Disasi had previously been surplus to requirements under Enzo Maresca, but has been training with the first team since the arrival of Liam Rosenior.",
      "Raheem Sterling and Chelsea are close to finding a solution in the next few days which will end the long-drawn-out stand-off between club and player.",
      "Sterling has not played for Chelsea since May 2024 even though he has remained one of the club's best-paid players, earning a reported £325,000 a week.",
      "He spent last season on loan at Arsenal but he has been training away from the first-team squad since last summer when a move away could not be agreed during the window.",
      "Chelsea are now in talks with Sterling and his representatives and a solution is expected to be found before the window closes on Monday evening.",
      "He has 18 months left on a contract which could cost Chelsea £25 million if he was to stay until it runs out in the summer of 2027.",
      "Sterling does not want another loan deal so either a permanent deal will have to be arranged in the next few days or a compromise agreement reached whereby he would become a free agent.",
      "Either way, it is expected he will no longer be a Chelsea player after Monday - although he would be well within his rights to stay until his contract runs out.",
      "Sterling signed a five-year deal when Chelsea signed him from Manchester City in a £50 million deal in the summer of 2022.",
      "The deal was done just two months after Chelsea had been bought by new American owners and during a window when co-owner Todd Boehly was acting as the club's interim sporting director.",
      "Filip Jorgensen is expected to remain at Chelsea in this window.",
      "Chelsea's second-choice goalkeeper has been the subject of interest this month from clubs in England, Germany and Turkey, who are keen to offer him more regular football, but Chelsea are reluctant to let the Dane leave before next Monday's deadline.",
      "Chelsea signed Jorgensen from Villarreal for £20.7m in July 2024.",
      "Jorgensen played 24 times for Chelsea last season, predominantly in cup competitions, and was key to their Conference League success, but has been limited to just eight appearances this season.",
      "Jorgensen suffered an injury against Pafos last week and was not pictured at Chelsea training on Tuesday morning.",

      "Gary Neville is \"blown away\" by Manchester United's transformation under the management of Michael Carrick.",
      "United backed up a derby win over Manchester City with a 3-2 success at Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday in Carrick's second game in charge.",
      "Those results have transformed the mood following Ruben Amorim's sacking and Neville is confident United - who are up to fourth in the table - will finish in the Champions League qualifying spots.",
      "\"There are a number of things that have changed, the intensity, the compactness, the aggression of the defending, their willingness to get behind the ball together and be difficult to beat and dig in when you're in difficult moments of the game. And there was more of that [at Arsenal] than there was against City.",
      "\"I thought they played better football against City, but they were always going to have to dig in [at the Emirates Stadium] more. In that first 25 minutes when they didn't have a lot of ball, they didn't really lose too many chances.",
      "\"They controlled the game without the ball. And then they just started to play a little bit.",
      "\"But the big thing for me is that they've got a threat up front. They've got a group of players who are talented up front, who are also getting back and helping their defenders, who are digging in.\"",
      "Neville believes United's system shift away from Amorim's back-three preference to a 4-2-3-1 has boosted the team. He says Carrick has restored the \"magic\" to the team - and they are able to realise their potential to achieve a high finish in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's definitely instilled a simplicity to it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, that I like about it,\" said Neville.",
      "\"It's my favourite system. We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. It's been a huge turn.",
      "\"It's still not a point to get carried away but certainly a point to suggest now that Manchester United have got an unbelievable opportunity, from where they were before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point. It's a remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"And Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's being said to them, and we don't know what's being said to them in that training ground, but they are responding like they weren't before.",
      "\"Why? We'll always speculate, Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking, 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused, as we all are in terms of the flip, but the magic has returned in the last week.",
      "\"The magic seems to have returned to the club momentarily, the feeling of how to play with the aggression, with the risk, with the great goals, with the attacking of speed, the counter-attack. It feels right.",
      "\"And I think one thing that this last week has told us, no matter where it leads to, is that is the way Manchester United have to play, because it's just felt right watching them.",
      "\"Now that might not lead to Champions League football this season, it might be that they go and get beat by Fulham next week. Who knows what's going to happen? I don't think they will by the way, I think they'll finish in the Champions League [qualification places] now.",
      "\"But that's why a number of players that commentate on Manchester United have been so angry in this last five or six weeks, because of the likes of Everton, Wolves, West Ham, Bournemouth, Burnley and Leeds, six teams that have been really struggling apart from Leeds maybe, and only five points were picked up in those games again out of the 18.",
      "\"And in a lot of those games where Manchester United had opportunities to go into the top four. We're like, 'go on', and they didn't, and now they've done it because I genuinely believe there is a feeling that they are better than what they've shown.",
      "\"And they've proved it in these last two games, they have really proved that they can get compact, they can stay together, be aggressive in their shape, can spring out of that shape and play good football and counter-attack and hurt teams, and they can score great goals and get bodies in the box.",
      "\"It's been thrilling to watch these last two matches, it really has, and it's a remarkable turnaround.\"",

      "Gordon McQueen died aged 70 in June 2023 after contracting vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Coroner finds heading 'likely' contributed to brain injury behind death of former Scotland, Manchester United and Leeds defender",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 22:08, UK",
      "Heading a football \"likely\" contributed to the brain injury which was a factor in the death of former Scotland defender Gordon McQueen, a coroner has found.",
      "McQueen - who was capped for Scotland 30 times between 1974 and 1981, and played for both Manchester United and Leeds during a 16-year career - died at his home in North Yorkshire in June 2023, aged 70.",
      "The cause of death was pneumonia as he had become frail and bed-bound for months, the inquest in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, heard earlier this month.",
      "That frailty was due to a combination of vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), coroner Jon Heath said.",
      "The coroner gave a narrative conclusion on Monday, finding that McQueen died from pneumonia as a consequence of mixed vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "He said: \"It is likely that repetitive head impacts sustained by heading the ball while playing football contributed to the CTE.\"",
      "McQueen's TV presenter daughter Hayley McQueen was in court to hear the findings.",
      "When giving evidence at his inquest earlier this month, she was asked by her barrister Michael Rawlinson KC if her father had discussed whether anything in his past history was behind his dementia.",
      "She said: \"He said 'heading a football for all those years probably hasn't helped'.\"",
      "McQueen said her dad was relatively injury-free during his career but did suffer some concussions, adding: \"They would just head back out and play.\"",
      "She also recalled how, when she was young, he would come home from training with Manchester United and lie down in a darkened room with a headache.",
      "She described how her father was very healthy and active - both in sport and with his family - during his playing days and after he retired.",
      "But she said the family began to notice changes in his personality after his 60th birthday.",
      "McQueen said her father had always been very sociable and outgoing, but became more withdrawn.",
      "She said that although her father was a central defender, he was well known for scoring goals from set-pieces, usually with his head.",
      "He came to prominence in England following his move to Leeds from St Mirren in 1972, helping the Yorkshire club to league title success in 1973-74 and playing a key role in their run to the European Cup final in 1975.",
      "McQueen then joined Leeds's arch-rivals Manchester United in 1978 and went on to win the FA Cup in 1983.",
      "Injury robbed him of a World Cup appearance in 1978 after he had been included in Scotland's squad having made his senior debut in 1974 against Belgium.",
      "After retiring as a player, McQueen had a brief spell as Airdrie manager and coach at former club St Mirren, and spent five years as coach at Middlesbrough under Bryan Robson until 2001.",
      "The inquest heard how McQueen's family donated his brain, after his death, to Professor Willie Stewart - a consultant neuropathologist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, who has conducted extensive research into brain injury in footballers and rugby players.",
      "Prof Stewart told the inquest he found evidence of CTE - a brain disorder linked to repeated head impacts - and vascular dementia.",
      "Prof Stewart agreed with Mr Rawlinson, for the McQueen family, when he asked whether the CTE \"more than minimally, negligibly or trivially\" contributed to the death and that \"heading the ball\" contributed to the CTE.",
      "The professor said the only evidence available was McQueen's \"high exposure\" to heading a football."

      "Michael Carrick has got off to the dream start as head coach of Manchester United until the end of the season; But are wins against Man City and Premier League leaders Arsenal enough to justify a premature permanent appointment?",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 17:29, UK",
      "Manchester United fans should not get carried away with Michael Carrick. But why not?",
      "So far, Carrick has shown you do not need to \"suffer\" to win football matches; instead, he's proved football is a simple game.",
      "But the dilemma now is whether he merits the permanent role, or, despite an apparent turnaround at Old Trafford, United should still bite the bullet and stick to their original plan to appoint a different permanent Ruben Amorim successor.",
      "Some fans have made up their minds and the players are rejuvenated but Roy Keane and Gary Neville remain cautious.",
      "Keane says United need a manager \"who you feel can get them winning league titles\", while before the derby day win and the victory at league leaders Arsenal, Neville said there \"cannot be any consideration\" that Carrick takes the job.",
      "However, the football United fans have been exposed to against Man City and Arsenal, the two sides at the top of the Premier League, cannot be taken for granted.",
      "As Carrick celebrated Patrick Dorgu's zinger to make it 2-1 at Arsenal, Neville said the stand-in United boss had put his hands up like the \"messiah\". What United have been exposed to in just two games is what they have been waiting for and prophesied about for over a decade.",
      "The football taught by Carrick works because, rather than treating the game like an exact science, he has allowed it to become an art of self-expression.",
      "Players playing to their strengths with the added pinch of nostalgia has been the recipe for Carrick's early success, with the squad no longer demanded to follow an elaborate instruction manual that never really makes clear what the final product would be.",
      "Carrick's United are direct, front-foot and have thus far been the perfect advert of \"United DNA\", averaging more fast breaks than any other team in the league.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo leads the line because he's made the most runs in behind per 90 in the Premier League this season. Bruno Fernandes is back in his favoured No 10 position as he remains one of the league's most potent chance creators. Dorgu has remained as a wide player because of his consistent displays high up the pitch.",
      "With very little time on the training pitch after taking on his team mid-season, there have been very few complaints from Carrick about his current situation. Why would there be? He's been given a free hit at Old Trafford, just as he was given one in 2021, following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. As he did then, reinstalling fundamentals has become a stroke of genius.",
      "In truth, it's all the makings of what United would hope to see in the first two games of any new permanent manager. Perhaps if it wasn't Carrick, perhaps if it was someone new in the dugout, there'd be a unanimous acceptance that he should be the next man in charge. Unfortunately, United have been here before.",
      "In December 2018, a harrowing 3-1 defeat at Liverpool meant that Jose Mourinho's time at United was called to a close.",
      "United was described as toxic as Old Trafford soured under Mourinho, who grew grumpy in the role and was losing favour amongst the playing squad. Solskjaer came in and had an opportunity to stamp his mark and did so in style.",
      "A 5-1 victory at Cardiff set Solskjaer and United on a trail of 12 matches without defeat in the Premier League. With positivity flowing through the place, the change in style to something more akin to the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "As we've seen under Carrick, there's something about a side fearless in transition that United fans love to watch.",
      "After winning 14 of his 19 interim matches, including an incredible comeback win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, Solskjaer was named United's permanent manager in March 2019. Solskjaer's interim efforts propelled United's top-four chances at the time.",
      "However, after United appointed Solskjaer, everyone returned from the honeymoon and to a dose of realism that Solskjaer was an inexperienced manager whose positive energy outweighed his proficiency in the role. United quickly crashed and burned that season, winning just two of their last eight, missing out on the top four.",
      "Throughout Solskjaer's three years in charge, a similar pattern sustained. United would go on to finish third and second under Solskjaer, but notoriously couldn't get over the line to achieve material success.",
      "United fans look back at their time under Solskjaer, perhaps as fondly as any time since Ferguson's retirement in 2013, but there was ultimately nothing tangible gained under the manager who made United simply \"feel good\".",
      "Under Solskjaer, United were a nearly team, reaching multiple semi-finals in all the cup competitions before a Europa League final in 2021 ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Villarreal.",
      "David de Gea's missed penalty is viewed by many as the true sliding doors moment that led to Solskjaer's ultimate demise in the role but the reality was that United were serial losers when push came to shove.",
      "There's an underlying resistance to repeat the same mistake with Carrick. When United opted to appoint Solskjaer permanently, the regime at the time, in the same breath, lost the chance to appoint Zinedine Zidane and Mauricio Pochettino, who at that time were the outstanding rumoured candidates.",
      "Should United appoint Carrick permanently, they will miss out on tapping into the thriving economy of available managers to do what they have tried in the past.",
      "There's no reason to suggest Carrick would be the same or worse than Solskjaer, but after years of experimenting, the next decision on United manager feels like the most significant one yet.",
      "It could be the difference between returning to a side worthy of the name and reputation or remaining in a cycle of failure.",
      "On current evidence, Carrick would be an astute appointment. But if United want to do something new, however well Carrick does, he shouldn't be among the future candidates. Fans will get carried away, as fans are allowed to. INEOS, though, have another era-defining decision to make.",

      "Substitute Cunha curled a stunning finish into the corner from 25 yards out, only three minutes after Mikel Merino had hauled the lacklustre hosts level from a Bukayo Saka corner.",
      "Earlier, Arsenal had squandered a lead when Martin Zubimendi's poor pass allowed Bryan Mbeumo to run through on goal and beat David Raya after Lisandro Martinez had diverted Martin Odegaard's cross-shot into his own net for the opening goal.",

      "At that point, it seemed Arsenal might go on and find a winner, but Cunha silenced the Emirates Stadium when his stunning, long-range effort sparked more wild Manchester United celebrations. There were boos from some home fans at the final whistle.",
