      "Manchester United want a meeting with referees' chief Howard Webb following a number of controversial decisions. The Red Devils believe they have been wronged on several major calls this season, according to Mail Online.",
      "Angry Old Trafford officials are said to have grown 'increasingly frustrated' with the number of errors which have cost their side in the Premier League. Ruben Amorim is reported not to be involved in the move for crunch talks.",
      "The club's bosses are noted to be increasingly frustrated at the persistent issues arising in their matches. And now they want an explanation from former ref Webb.",
      "PGMOL are reported to have acknowledged that a number of incidents have been down to officiating errors. United believe former player Aaron Wan-Bissaka should have been shown a second yellow for a late sliding challenge on Patrick Dorgu, in their draw against West ham.",
      "They were also stunned that Wolves star Emmanuel Agbadou's handball was not reviewed by VAR in their 4-1 win. United are said to feel that enough is enough.",
      "Earlier this season, Webb admitted to Manchester United that they were the victims of an error in their defeat to Brentford. Amorim's side lost 3-1 in west London and they felt Nathan Collins should have been shown red.",
      "Bruno Fernandes saw his penalty saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after Collins' foul on Bryan Mbeumo. The Bees defender was bailed out by his goalkeeper and got lucky twice as he escaped a red card for pulling back the United forward inside the area.",

      "United's plan for talks comes after Premier League bosses met with the PGMOL chief to call for a change to VAR. They want to top-flight matches staffed in a new way, according to League Managers Association CEO Richard Bevan.",
      "The LMA called for referees to be paired up with specific video assistants so that better partnerships can be formed. They body believes more consistent officiating will arise as a result.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has said that his time at Manchester United hasn't run as planned, and that he had opportunities elsewhere when the club struggled the most. The Portuguese midfielder joined the Red Devils in a £47million deal with Sporting CP in January 2020.",
      "And while the 31-year-old will have held aspirations of reliving the trophy-laden glory that the club held under Sir Alex Ferguson's legendary tenure, things haven't quite played out that way under the tutelage of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag and now Ruben Amorim.",
      "In five years, Fernandes has just an FA Cup and a League Cup to show for his efforts in the heart of United's engine room, while the club's Premier League performances have also faded since his arrival. Last season saw United register their poorest-ever Premier League finish since the league's inception of 1992, as Amorim's debut saw the Red Devils finish in a lacklustre 15th.",
      "The club also missed out on winning the Europa League title in May, courtesy of a bitter 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. And now, appearing on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Fernandes has reflected on his time at Old Trafford.",
      "When asked about his love of the club by Ferdinand, the United captain said: \"Obviously, I think the time at the club has not been as I wanted because obviously, I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lift as many as I should and I could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club in a certain way was still very important and not taking nothing away from other players that were here and everything. I think when we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I think everyone at the club, I hope, is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"So I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably winning more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet.",
      "\"So nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies. It changed a lot because if I look at the past, [Francesco] Totti is known as one of the best players in Italy and unfortunately for him he hasn't won many trophies.\"",
      "Fernandes spoke to Ferdinand earlier this month, ahead of a damning recent interview emerging which saw him claim that the United board wanted him away from the club in the summer. Saudi giants Al-Hilal were ready to offer United £100m to sign Fernandes, but the attacking midfielder instead opted to remain at Old Trafford.",
      "The club were also reportedly willing to pay Fernandes £700,000-a-week, which would have seen him rake in around £100m over the course of a three-year contract. And now, the playmaker has suggested that while Amorim wanted him to stay, the United hierarchy were keen to cash in.",
      "He told Canal 11: \"I can’t complain, I’m very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I’ll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"My lifestyle will change, my children’s lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I’ll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players. I could have left like many people do and said, ‘I want to leave, I don’t want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side.’",
      "\"But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same. But there comes a point where, for them, money is more important than anything.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision. I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay.",
      "\"But, from the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about.",
      "\"I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don’t value the club as much and don’t defend the club as much...that makes you sad.\"",
      "Fernandes' comments directly contradict those coming from United, who have insisted that they made it clear to Fernandes this summer that he was central to their plans going forward, and that they would not sell him.",
      "Head to the Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel to watch the full interview.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Roy Keane has urged Kobbie Mainoo to fight for his place in the Manchester United squad rather than seeking a move away. The United legend also tore in the midfielder's brother, labelling him an 'idiot' for wearing a 'free Mainoo' shirt at Old Trafford.",
      "Questions over Mainoo's future at United have persisted since the summer, with speculation only ramping up amid a lack of minutes under boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The England international requested a loan move towards the end of the transfer window, but the club refused to let him go. Mainoo has featured in just 11 Premier League matches under Amorim this season, every single one as a substitute.",
      "His sole start this campaign came in the EFL Cup loss to League Two outfit Grimsby Town back in August. Earlier this week, Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan Mainoo-Hames, caused a stir by sporting a 'free Kobbie Mainoo' T-shirt during the dramatic 4-4 draw with AFC Bournemouth.",
      "Mainoo entered the fray with less than half an hour remaining, marking his third-longest appearance in the league this term, in a pulsating encounter at Old Trafford. Mainoo-Hames shared the photo on his Instagram account, prompting fresh questions about the midfielder's future and mindset.",
      "\"He might think the manager's on his way out in the summer,\" Keane said. \"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if he's not getting a chance, we've all had to do it.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is prove them wrong. Jamie made a point that he never felt like a regular at Liverpool, I never felt like that at United. Every day is your chance to prove yourself to the manager and when the manager is picking his team, [he goes] 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that... we shouldn't even be giving that kind of stuff the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.\"",
      "Keane went on to discuss Mainoo's prospects at United: \"What's football about? The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong. There was chat about Bruno [Fernandes] leaving the summer, he might leave next summer. Bide your time.",
      "\"I have no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team. Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in over Bruno', prove them wrong!\".",
      "Despite all the speculation surrounding Mainoo, Amorim has declined to confirm whether a loan move would be approved. \"I had some conversations with him, especially last year, and with other players, but about that subject, no, I didn't speak with him,\" he said.",
      "\"I will be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about that. I just want my players happy. I understand every individual has their goals and the frustration doesn't help anybody. I'm not going to say what I would say but I would talk to him.",
      "\"I am completely open, that is clear. I have my ideas and that is also clear. I will not change if I don't believe it but I'm open to speak with any player. I love that.\"",

      "The final 2025/26 Premier League standings have been simulated - in what is good news for Arsenal fans. Heading into Christmas it is still all to play for after 16 games, but at this early stage the Gunners have staked their claim for the title.",
      "Following closely behind are challengers Manchester City and Aston Villa, who at worst will be hopeful of securing Champions League qualification via the top-four. Also in the running for European football look to be Chelsea, Manchester United, reigning champions Liverpool - who have been off the pace, and Sunderland.",
      "At the opposite end of the table, Wolves and West Ham have endured tough starts to the new campaign, and could become the first existing Premier League clubs in three seasons to drop down. Also in the scrap are Burnley, Leeds United and Nottingham Forest.",
      "So, how will the final Premier League standings turn out? The answer will not be certain until next May, but Opta's latest results give a hint as to how matters may play out...",
      "A genuine \"nightmare\" season. They are currently winless (0–2–14) and rooted to the bottom. New manager Rob Edwards faces a monumental task to overturn a -26 goal difference.",
      "Like many newly-promoted sides in recent seasons, Scott Parker’s side have found the jump in quality difficult, managing only three wins so far as they struggle to keep clean sheets.",
      "A disastrous season so far. Graham Potter was sacked in September, and Nuno Espirito Santo is currently struggling to pull the Hammers out of the relegation zone.",
      "Another newly-promoted side who is fighting hard, using an imposing physical style to stay just outside the bottom three, or so the prediction says will happen...",
      "A chaotic start saw Nuno Espirito Santo sacked, his successor Ange Postecoglou also got the boot after just weeks in charge, and now Sean Dyche has been brought in to do what he does best: grind out the results needed to stay up.",
      "Under Marco Silva, Fulham have continued to be the \"entertainers\" of the mid-table. They have been involved in some of the season's most chaotic matches, including a 4–5 loss to Manchester City earlier this month.",
      "It has been a season of significant transition for the Bees. After seven years, legendary manager Thomas Frank departed for Tottenham in June and was replaced by former assistant Keith Andrews, but the club has kept on fighting despite pre-season chatter of relegation.",
      "Despite selling key defenders Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi, Andoni Iraola has kept the Cherries competitive with a high-pressing system that recently claimed a major scalp against Spurs.",
      "The surprise package of the season. Returning to the top flight after eight years, the Black Cats have been remarkably resilient, specializing in late drama with a league-high five goals scored in stoppage time.",
      "It’s been a bumpy road for Thomas Frank in his first season at Spurs. After replacing Ange Postecoglou, Frank has struggled to balance Europa League demands with domestic form, leaving Spurs in an uncharacteristic 11th place.",
      "Under the guidance of David Moyes, the Toffees have moved away from relegation scraps and into a comfortable top-half position, though they struggle for consistency against the elite.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler’s side remains tactically brave and entertaining, though they've dropped points in games they dominated.",
      "Limited summer spending has led to a sense of 'staleness'. They remain tough to beat at St. James' Park but have regressed significantly from the form that helped achieve Champions League qualification last season.",
      "Now under Ruben Amorim, United are showing signs of life after a \"historically bad\" 2024/25. While their defense is still leaky (26 conceded), their attack is much more fluid with Bryan Mbeumo and Mason Mount finding rhythm.",
      "Following their FA Cup win last season, Palace have maintained incredible momentum. Despite a tough schedule, Oliver Glasner has them playing high-intensity football that has them sitting above several giants.",
      "Under Enzo Maresca, Chelsea have finally stabilized. They’ve adopted a possession-heavy style and found a spark in Joao Pedro. But, it might be just too little to reach the Champions League next season...",
      "It has been a difficult second season for Arne Slot. After a brilliant title-winning campaign last year, the defending champions have struggled with mega-money signings Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz bedding in, plus injuries. A recent dip that saw them lose five out of six games in late autumn.",
      "Unai Emery has transformed Villa from \"best of the rest\" into genuine title threats. After failing to win in their first five matches, they've turned things around and sit just three points off the top, proving their staying power.",
      "Despite a rocky start that saw Pep Guardiola endure his worst-ever opening month, City have surged back. Erling Haaland remains inevitable with 17 Premier League goals already, though the team has looked more defensively vulnerable than in previous years (e.g., that wild 5–4 win over Fulham).",
      "The current leaders have been the model of consistency. Mikel Arteta’s side boasts the league's best defence (only 10 goals conceded) and an 11-game unbeaten run earlier this term. With new signings Viktor Gyokeres, Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke helping to add the clinical edge they lacked last season, they look like the team to beat."

      "Manchester United are bracing for the absence of three key players in the coming weeks as Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui all head off to participate in the Africa Cup of Nations. The tournament, staged by Morocco, begins on Sunday with the hosts facing Comoros.",
      "The final is scheduled to take place in Rabat on Sunday, January 18 and United supporters will be keen to know when their trio could return. According to a new Afcon Supercomputer prediction, Morocco are favourites to secure their first Afcon title since 1976.",
      "The prediction, made by Afcon betting experts at BookmakersCameroun.com, suggests that the host nation will edge out Senegal with a 1-0 victory in the final. If this comes to pass, United full-back Mazraoui won't be available for manager Ruben Amorim until the away match against Arsenal on January 25.",
      "In contrast, Mbeumo's Cameroon are predicted to make an early exit at the group stages, which could see him return for United's away game at Leeds on January 4. While such an outcome would not go down well with Cameroon and Mbeumo, it certainly would for United, who would have one of their leading players back available before long.",
      "The supercomputer also forecasts that Senegal will eliminate Amad's Ivory Coast in the semi-finals with a convincing 3-0 win. However, he would still miss the Manchester derby on January 17 as it coincides with the third-place playoff - a match the Ivory Coast are predicted to lose to Uganda on penalties.",
      "Therefore, the prediction suggests that Amad is likely to rejoin the squad around the same time as Mazraoui, potentially in time for the late January clash with Arsenal. In what could prove to be the tournament's most shocking result, Egypt and their talisman Mohamed Salah are tipped to suffer a 1-0 defeat to Comoros in the round of 16.",
      "South Africa and Algeria, both having secured their spots at next year's World Cup, are anticipated to progress to the quarter-finals, whilst Tunisia, another World Cup qualifier, are forecast to bow out before the knockout phases. Amorim faces the challenge of finding answers with Mbeumo, Amad and Mazraoui sidelined for the coming period, and former United defender Paul Parker reckons it will prove an enormously tough assignment.",
      "He said: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",

      "Mainoo has fallen out of favour with boss Amorim as rumours swirl of a potential January exit. The England international has been left out of the starting line-up for all of United’s 16 league matches so far this season, with his only start coming in the Red Devils’ embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat at Grimsby.",
      "The future had looked bright for the 20-year-old after a breakthrough 2023/24 season under Erik ten Hag, where he scored the winning goal in the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester City and became a key cog in the England side that reached the Euros final.",
      "But things have turned sour for the Stockport-born academy graduate since Amorim arrived at Old Trafford, with United legend Paul Scholes among those urging Mainoo to leave his boyhood club in search of game time. According to reports, Mainoo was keen to join Napoli in the summer but had a transfer request turned down.",
      "The youngster received a rapturous reception from the Old Trafford crowd on Monday when he replaced Casemiro just past the hour mark during United’s absorbing 4-4 thriller with Bournemouth, but attention post-match quickly turned to an inflammatory statement made by his brother pitchside.",
      "Jordan Mainoo-Hames, 30, was pictured front row wearing a black T-shirt emblazoned with \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\" in a move that risks aggravating a delicate situation already fraught with tension. The stunt has split United’s fanbase, with some supporters accusing Mainoo’s relative of unnecessary provocation, but others viewing the statement as a justified protest.",

      "He will also be a name known to those inside Old Trafford. Speaking at an England training camp, Mainoo revealed that his brother’s stint in the Love Island villa had earned him an unflattering nickname.",
      "He said: “My brother was on it. I am close to him. You know what, going back to another question – my nickname. The kit man at United always called me ‘Love Island’. He’s been doing so since I was like 16.”",

      "The Red Devils enjoyed a productive summer window with several key additions, including the likes of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. However, the work is far from complete, with a number of areas across the pitch still in need of reinforcement.",
      "One way to make room in both the squad and the budget for further arrivals is to offload players. A handful of names have been linked with potential exits in recent times, none more so than midfielder Mainoo.",
      "The England international had been tipped to depart in the summer, with Serie A champions Napoli rumoured to be among the suitors. However, a move never came to fruition and the academy graduate was made to stay put.",
      "Unfortunately for Mainoo, his game time under Ruben Amorim has not improved this season. The 20-year-old has featured 12 times across all competitions this term, but has not started a single Premier League fixture.",
      "Amorim raised some eyebrows over the past week with his comments about United's young, up-and-coming players and his reluctance to use them. Mainoo was not the only name discussed, with 18-year-old Harry Amass, currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, also singled out.",

      "As the January window approaches, both Mainoo and Amass are among the United starlets attracting plenty of attention. There are claims that as many as 12 clubs are in the race for the midfielder's signature.",

      "Joleon Lescott reckons that Kobbie Mainoo will outlast Ruben Amorim at Manchester United. The 20-year-old hasn't started a Premier League match this season.",
      "Mainoo burst onto the scene at Old Trafford, scoring an FA Cup-winning goal and becoming a fixture in England's midfield at Euro 2024. However, since Erik ten Hag's departure, Mainoo has found it difficult to fit into new boss Amorim's team.",
      "With Bruno Fernandes filling the midfield role that Mainoo is perhaps best suited to, he has been relegated to substitute appearances and requested a loan this summer. Rumours continue to swirl about his potential departure from the club.",
      "Lescott, who coached him for the Three Lions, believes that he should be allowed to play elsewhere as he has a future at the club, unlike manager Amorim. \"I've worked with Kobbie. He's a very mature and impressive person,\" said Lescott, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"But if I'm the club, I'm saying, 'We're giving you a new deal and go and play.' Go somewhere else and play because the future is Kobbie Mainoo. It's not Amorim, is it?",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "\"You'd like to think he's going to be at Man United longer than the manager. So the club should step in and dictate how this plays out rather than just let the manager create a scenario where Kobbie is like, 'I'm not signing, I don't want to sign, I don't want to be here.'",
      "\"Because then you've lost the player of that ilk. I do really think that if the club steps in and controls this situation then it can still be manageable.",
      "\"You have the manager that might not be there in a year's time and then you've lost an asset. I'm not saying Amorim has to play him, but he's coming to the end of his contract. So in like 18 months' time or 12 months' time he's free.\"",
      "Mainoo appeared in United's thrilling 4-4 stalemate with Bournemouth and earned plaudits for his display. His sole start this campaign came during the crushing Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "The 20-year-old's sibling was also present at Monday's match, wearing a shirt emblazoned with \"Free Kobbie Mainoo.\" Lescott believes head coach Amorim is mishandling the situation surrounding Mainoo.",
      "He added: \"Amorim is just managing this wrongly. Mainoo doesn't need to play every week but the scenario can be managed better and I think the club have to be involved in this process.\"",

      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanted to sign three of world football's megastars when he was in charge of Manchester United, when they were still available for bargain prices. The Norwegian coach was keen to land Erling Haaland, Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice before they had fully made their names.",
      "Solskjaer urged United's hierarchy to move quickly, according to The Mail. It was not to be for the Red Devils as they instead spent £39million for Donny van de Beek in 2020, and £73m for Jadon Sancho and £13m for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2021.",
      "Initially taking over as interim boss, Solskjaer was in charge of United from 2018 until 2021. At that time, Haaland was racking up goals at Red Bull Salzburg, Bellingham was breaking out at Birmingham City and Rice cemented himself as a key player at West Ham.",
      "Solskjaer saw Haaland and Bellingham both join Borussia Dortmund in 2020 and have since joined Manchester City and Real Madrid, respectively.",
      "United's signings failed to pan out. Van de Beek could not break into the Red Devils' side and spent time on loan before making his exit, while Jadon Sancho is currently on loan at Aston Villa, having been cast aside by Erik ten Hag and Ruben Amorim.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo, meanwhile, saw his contract ended early via mutual consent. The Portuguese icon failed to gel with Ten Hag, and they quickly parted ways.",
      "Solskjaer has previously spoken about how he encouraged United to sign Haaland in the summer of 2018, months before he replaced Jose Mourinho as boss. The former forward repeated the advice when in the dugout as Haaland had a release clause and little competition present for his signature.",
      "Speaking to the Stick To Football podcast, Solskjaer said: \"Erling was with me at Molde for two seasons, more or less. The summer before I came, I rang the club and said: 'You have to sign this boy, he is going to be absolutely top class.' That was in June or July and they said they didn't have enough reports.",
      "\"By the time I came in as caretaker, we [Molde] had sold him to Salzburg. I tell the club straight away: 'Buy him.' He had a release clause. No-one else then would have paid that money. It was 20m euros and it would have been a bargain. It was the club's decision to not go for him then.",
      "\"We didn't go for him until he started scoring for Salzburg but then Dortmund, Juventus, everyone was there.\"",
      "Solskjaer did manage to at least have a conversation with Bellingham, but the England star's demands were more easily met elsewhere. \"We had Jude in the building,\" said Solskjaer.",
      "\"We sold the club to him as best we could but he wanted X amount of minutes. He is the most mature 17-year-old I ever met in my life.\"",

      "Manchester United target Carlos Baleba has responded following a dip in form since being linked with a move to Old Trafford. The Brighton midfielder was touted as a £100million contender to join Ruben Amorim's ranks before a late transfer attempt collapsed in the summer.",
      "Baleba has been called up by Cameroon ahead of this year's Africa Cup of Nations, where he'll team up with United ace Bryan Mbeumo. And the 21-year-old has fronted up ahead of United potentially reviving their interest in his services next year.",
      "United fans thought they were onto a transformative transfer when it emerged late in the summer that the club was looking into Baleba. The Seagulls star was coming off the back of a breakout campaign on the south coast and ticked almost every box in terms of what the club requires in midfield.",
      "However, the Red Devils were priced out of a move after Brighton revealed his £100m price-tag. And some have speculated the distraction of United's interest has had a hand in his reduced output this season.",
      "Baleba, 21, has played a full 90 minutes just once in the Premier League this term after looking all but indispensable under Fabian Hurzeler last season. The youngster pushed back on the notion United's enquiry has had anything to do with his form this season, though he acknowledged things aren't the same as they once were.",
      "\"I don’t think it affected me. But I had a lot of pressure on me,\" he said during an interview ahead of his AFCON involvement. \"When I started the season, I wanted to [have] the same performances as last season.",
      "\"Every day I try to work hard and to get [back] to my level. Did I put too much pressure on myself? Yes, I think so, but I think that’s good.\"",
      "Despite cultivating an iconic reputation at Old Trafford during his first stint, Ronaldo's return in 2021 was met with mixed response. Some loyalists were ecstatic about the reunion that had long been promised, even if he was 36 years old at the time and way past his prime, while others didn't see value in the investment.",
      "As it turned out, the latter camp was correct. Ronaldo scored 24 goals in his first season back at the Theatre of Dreams having left Juventus, but he eventually left for Al-Nassr in December 2022 amid reports he became a disruptive presence in the dressing room.",
      "And the Daily Mail has now revealed Ronaldo's agent, Jorge Mendes, orchestrated the move by stretching certain details. Namely, he led United to believe Ronaldo \"had the pen in his hand\" ready to join rivals Manchester City, and that was enough to urge the Red Devils into action.",
      "A source with knowledge of the deal was quoted, saying: \"It created a panic. The idea of him scoring for City against United was too much for them. They were frightened to death about how the fans would react when the reality was that signing him would go against everything that Ole was trying to do.\"",
      "It's perhaps no coincidence United had four different coaches during Ronaldo's second stint at the club. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge when the deal was completed, while Michael Carrick and Ralf Rangnick held caretaker roles before Erik ten Hag's appointment in 2022.",
      "Despite his prolific return initially back in England, Ronaldo's move back ended up costing United roughly £1.2m per goal he scored. And it was all down to the machinations of a certain super agent behind the scenes.",

      "Greer has had his YouTube channel for a decade after it was set up by his parents, Nathan and Tara, who found football boots expensive to buy for their son. They hoped he could do some reviews and get one or two freebies along the way, but in the decade that's followed, he's charted his rise from grassroots football into Birmingham City's academy and has dreams of becoming a professional.",
      "He's already met the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Jude Bellingham and Mbappe himself, and is hoping to forge his own career in the game.",
      "Greer started for Birmingham's Under-18s side away at Manchester United, but it was the hosts who ran out 6-0 winners in the Under-18 Premier League Cup, to finish Group G with maximum points.",
      "United wonderkid JJ Gabriel was among those to feature, as was Wayne Rooney's son Kai, who scored the sixth goal of the afternoon for Darren Fletcher's side.",
      "It was an afternoon to forget for Greer, who was making his first start of the season in defensive midfield, playing two years above his own age group after signing a scholarship earlier this summer.",
      "Still, that won't deter the youngster who has enjoyed an incredible rise. Greer is an athlete for Under Armour and met PSG defender Achraf Hakimi on his trip to Paris.",
      "Greer looks to be the next young talent to come off the Birmingham City academy conveyor belt, with Jude and Jobe Bellingham two of the big-name stars playing their trade at top European clubs.",
      "He may not have made a first-team appearance for Birmingham City but already has celebrity status in the city because of his social media following and wants to follow in Jude's footsteps.",

      "Greer has already met some huge names from the world of football through his social media platform, but wants to follow in Jude Bellingham's footsteps.",
      "\"Jude is an inspiration as someone from Birmingham and living proof it's possible to make it,\" he said. \"I've met him a few times - at St George's Park, in the city or even at the training ground when he was here.",
      "\"Jude is down to earth, humble and speaks to you like a normal person. It was mad to see him playing for Birmingham at 16, starting games and scoring goals. It was sick.",
      "\"Players like Bellingham, Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen, who hit such a high level in their teens, are almost like one in a billion. You cannot compare yourself to people like that because they don’t come along at that age very often.",
      "\"Jude told me, 'Keep playing your game and stay humble.' So I've got to do that, keep working hard and let my football do the talking. My end goal is to be a pro footballer.\"",
      "The youngster has opened his own academy at the age of 16 and is hoping to do his coaching badges in the future.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has confessed he can envisage himself playing well into his thirties, in stark contrast to former Manchester United colleague Victor Lindelof. Speaking to Portuguese broadcaster Canal 11, the United skipper revealed his ambition to extend his career, even admitting he'd contemplate turning out in lower leagues such as district football.",
      "The 31-year-old, whose deal runs until summer 2027, reinforced his passion for the beautiful game following summer speculation linking him with Saudi Arabia. Al-Hilal were reportedly prepared to table a substantial bid for Fernandes, but the transfer fell through, allowing Ruben Amorim's squad to retain their captain.",
      "During the same interview, Fernandes also suggested he might be open to departing United in the foreseeable future should he sense he's no longer 'wanted' at Old Trafford. When quizzed about whether he'd continue playing until physically unable, he responded: \"I wouldn't say until I can't anymore, I want to prolong my career as much as possible.",
      "\"It's not about the attention I get, but about the love I have for football.",
      "\"I can't imagine doing anything else, and it's hard to think that in five years I might hang up my boots.\"",
      "Fernandes disclosed a previous chat with Lindelof from their shared time at the club, noting: \"Some players see it differently.",
      "\"Victor Lindelof once told me he won't want to play beyond the ages of 33/34. But I told him, I can't accept that.",
      "\"I wouldn't mind playing in lower leagues - I just want to enjoy the game and keep playing football. Maybe even, in a moment of madness, I'd play district football at an advanced age.",
      "\"That's a different way of living the sport - football played purely for love, where you're with your teammates and friends simply because you need to play.\"",
      "At 31, Lindelof bid farewell to United this summer after an eight-year stint, following the expiration of his contract at the end of last season.",
      "He signed a two-year deal with Aston Villa in September.",

United and Tottenham are reportedly willing to pay up to €40million (£35m) for El Mala, with Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and Bayern Munich also credited with an interest in recent weeks.",
      "Whether any concrete interest will emerge in January remains to be seen, with El Mala being tipped to be one of the brightest prospects currently playing in the Bundesliga.",

      "Last week, Koln supervisory board member Lionel Souque claimed that Brighton's owner, Tony Bloom, had contacted him about potentially striking a deal for El Mala during the summer.",
      "\"Through a friend at the carnival, the owner of the club [Bloom] had my mobile number, called me and tried to see if he had a chance through me, after it didn't work out through management,\" Souque said on the OMR podcast.",

      "El Mala can play across the forward line but has been mostly used in the left wing role for Koln this season. The Germany Under-21 international has scored six goals and provided three assists in just 14 appearances so far this term.",

Darren Fletcher named several U18s regulars for the cup tie, though also picked three debutants at this age level. This included goalkeeper Charlie Hardy (top right), who joined the club's academy from Derby County earlier this month. He made an early save to deny Blues attacker Joseph Ralph a gilt-edged opportunity.",

      "The 15-year-old is one of United's - if not the world's - brightest talents. Just last week he scored on his first appearance at Old Trafford in the FA Youth Cup, and has already trained with Ruben Amorim's senior squad.",

      "Minutes after assisting Rafe McCormack and James McEvoy's headed goal for 4-0, James Bailey added a fifth for the U18s.",
      "The playmaker thrashed in a powerful effort having been teed up by McEvoy in return, and celebrated passionately.",
      "Rafe McCormack put in another controlling midfield performance against the Blues, and even got the goal to show for it. He diverted James Bailey's free-kick in off the post, which always adds a shine to any goal, and truly wrapped up the match at 3-0.",
      "Kai Rooney finished the afternoon's scoring, making it 6-0 to United. The teenager plucked the ball out of the air from a corner, took two controlling touches and smashed into the roof of Birmingham's net from a tight angle.",
      "It marked a delightful comeback for the son of United legend Wayne Rooney, who shared an update on a devastating injury sustained back in September. Although the exact nature was not known, the youngster showed off his right foot in a protective boot.",
      "The timing was heartbreaking as he had just been promoted to United's Under-19s squad, thus playing with others four years his senior. However, on Wednesday he was back with a bang and will be hoping to continue his upwards trajectory."

The Sporting Clube de Portugal skipper was strongly linked with a switch to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, when the club were searching for midfield reinforcements.",
      "The Denmark international has been tipped to link up with Ruben Amorim at the Reds following their successful partnership at Sporting in Lisbon. Whilst other names such as Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson have been mentioned, rumours continue to suggest that the Reds could reignite their interest in Hjulmand next year.",
      "In the summer, however, United chose not to prioritise strengthening their midfield during the summer but are believed to not be rushing to bring forward those plans with a January swoop. Any potential move, though, could face competition from Manchester City, with Portuguese publication Record claiming that City might also consider a possible deal.",
      "Nevertheless, Fernandes has already backed the prospect of potentially seeing Hjulmand arrive at M16 in the coming months. Speaking to Portuguese broadcaster Canal 11, the captain was asked to identify three players from Liga Portugal who could thrive in the Premier League.",
      "\"You have a lot of midfielders,\" he said. \"One of them, because of his intelligence and the dynamic he brings to the game, is Fredrik Aursnes.",
      "\"He's a player who would adapt to the Premier League regardless of his physicality. He's slim‐built, but I believe intelligent players always prevail here.",

Ince believes that a Premier League top-four finish will decide which of his ex-clubs emerges victorious in the tussle for the winger's signature.",
      "Semenyo, 25, has been an instrumental figure under Bournemouth Andoni Iraola, bagging 18 goals and providing eight assists in the top-flight since the start of the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "His impressive form has led to intense speculation about the possibility of a move away during the January transfer window, with a reported £65million release clause in place and Liverpool among a host of clubs supposedly monitoring his situation.",
      "But the player has been urged to pause and consider his options carefully before rushing into any mid-season move, reports the Liverpool Echo.",
      "\"I was surprised that Liverpool or Manchester United didn't sign Antoine Semenyo at the start of the season, because he's a top player,\" Ince told Covers.com.",
      "\"He should wait until the summer transfer window to make a move; January isn't a great time to move and clubs often don't like parting with players midway through a season.",
      "\"I don't see him staying put beyond the summer though. Bournemouth are great at sourcing players from all over the world, but ultimately they’ve always been a selling club.",
      "\"He'll have plenty of options on the table. He's got all the attributes to improve even more too; he's great on both feet, strong, quick and can bag you plenty of goals, as we've seen so far this year.\"",

      "Zirkzee has struggled to hold down a place in Ruben Amorim’s side since joining the club from Bologna in the summer of 2024 for £36.5million. He has managed just eight goals and three assists in 59 appearances for United and has been strongly linked with a move away from Old Trafford in 2026.",
      "The arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for over £200m in the summer has seen Zirkzee relegated in the pecking order. He did score in the 2-1 away win over Crystal Palace last month but has not earned the trust of Amorim, prompting the possibility of a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim’s options up front have just been diminished by Mbeumo leaving to play at the Africa Cup of Nations. Nevertheless, United are understood to be open to losing Zirkzee, but only if the terms are right. That is where Roma are struggling to find common ground.",
      "If they are to do business, United want a permanent sale or a loan deal that guarantees a future payment. A fee of around €35-40m (£30-35m) has been floated, given the 24-year-old is under contract until June 2029.",
      "However, Roma want to structure a deal that suits them better: a loan deal worth an initial €5m-6m (£4.3-5.2m) with an obligation to buy which is attached to the team qualifying for the Champions League. Zirkzee is reportedly open to resurrecting his career under manager Gian Piero Gasperini, but negotiations are essentially at a standstill for now.",
      "Amorim outlined the club’s stance towards doing business in January after being asked about Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo last month. “I was a football player,” he said. “I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation.",
      "“I understand the frustration of some players, seeing the World Cup is there. I know what it means. But the first thing is that the club comes first. If I can help the club and the players, I will be happy. If not, I have to think about the team.”",
      "With Mbeumo away playing for Cameroon at AFCON and both Cunha and Sesko having just shaken off injuries, it seems it would take a bid that is simply too juicy to turn down for United to sanction Zirkzee’s exit.",

      "Bruno Fernandes' career trajectory could have been vastly different had he joined the first Premier League side to express interest in signing him. While he has thrived at Manchester United, they weren't the quickest off the mark when it came to pursuing his signature.",
      "It was during the summer of 2019, while Mauricio Pochettino was at the helm of Tottenham, that they first made enquiries about signing the then-Sporting CP playmaker. However, the north London outfit were reluctant to meet the asking price, meaning he stayed in Portugal.",
      "The 31-year-old eventually made the switch to Old Trafford for an initial £47million just under six months later. Today, Fernandes is considered one of the Premier League's top stars and has captained United for nearly three seasons.",
      "But the story could have unfolded very differently had Spurs been prepared to pay the required fee a little more than six years ago. Fernandes addressed the potential transfer diplomatically when speaking about it at the close of the 2019 summer transfer window.",
      "In an interview with GQ, he said: \"As you all know, Tottenham made a lot of proposals for me. Everything was right with me - or practically should be. I never made any big demands, my manager was always dealing with the finances.",
      "\"It was, and is, my goal to play in England. Sporting know that, everyone knows that, and there were conditions for things to be done. But Sporting understood that the value was not enough and I have to respect the decision.\"",
      "Fernandes' future at Old Trafford has become a hot topic once more following fresh speculation about a potential departure next year. He was reportedly targeted by Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal during the summer window, and he's now spoken candidly about the rumours, taking a swipe at United for failing to make him feel sufficiently valued.",
      "\"I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club,\" he told Maisfutebol. \"The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'If you leave, it's not so bad for us'. It hurts me a lot.",
      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, and I always play, good or bad, I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much... that makes you sad.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim clearly had a significant influence in persuading United's skipper to remain at the club for at least another campaign. Yet this may only be a short-term solution, as Fernandes has since given another interview suggesting he could be tempted by moves to Spain, Italy or Portugal.",
      "He revealed to Canal 11 that he \"would like to experience the Spanish league and fight for big titles in Italy,\" where his daughter was born. He also mentioned Sporting as a possible reunion if they were to approach him.",
      "The attacking midfielder has recorded 196 direct goal contributions across 307 appearances for United and remains under contract at Old Trafford until 2027, with an option for an additional year. Tottenham may rue their decision not to stump up the cash for a player who has repeatedly demonstrated his quality in England, with their missed opportunity becoming a major United coup.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has admitted that his spell at Manchester United hasn't unfolded as he'd envisioned, revealing he had chances to move elsewhere during the club's most turbulent period.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker arrived at Old Trafford in a £47million switch from Sporting CP back in January 2020. While the 31-year-old would have harboured dreams of recreating the silverware-rich success the club enjoyed during Sir Alex Ferguson's iconic reign, matters haven't quite materialised in that fashion under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Erik ten Hag, and now, Ruben Amorim.",
      "In five years, Fernandes has collected just an FA Cup and a League Cup for his contributions in United's midfield, while the club's top-flight displays have also deteriorated since his arrival. Last season witnessed United record their worst-ever Premier League campaign since the competition's launch in 1992, with Amorim's introduction seeing the Reds languish in a disappointing 15th place, reports the Mirror.",
      "The club also fell short of claiming the Europa League crown in May, following a heartbreaking 1-0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur. Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Fernandes has now looked back on his Old Trafford journey.",
      "When Ferdinand questioned him about his affection for the club, the United skipper responded: \"Obviously, I think the time at the club has not been as I wanted because obviously, I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lift as many as I should and I could.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club in a certain way was still very important and not taking nothing away from other players that were here and everything. I think when we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I think everyone at the club, I hope, is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"So I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably winning more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet.",
      "\"So nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies. It changed a lot because if I look at the past, [Francesco] Totti is known as one of the best players in Italy and unfortunately for him he hasn't won many trophies.\"",
      "Fernandes had spoken to Ferdinand earlier this month, before a recent interview surfaced in which he alleged that the United board were eager to see him leave during the summer transfer window. Saudi powerhouses Al-Hilal were prepared to offer United £100m for Fernandes' signature, but the attacking midfielder chose to remain at Old Trafford instead.",
      "The club were also reportedly prepared to pay Fernandes £700,000-a-week, which would have netted him approximately £100m across a three-year deal. Now, the playmaker has indicated that whilst Amorim was keen for him to stay, the United executives were eager to cash in.",
      "Speaking to Canal 11, he said: \"I can't complain, I'm very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I'll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"My lifestyle will change, my children's lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I'll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players. I could have left like many people do and said, 'I want to leave, I don't want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side.'",
      "\"But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same. But there comes a point where, for them, money is more important than anything.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision. I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay.",
      "\"But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'if you leave, it's not so bad for us.' It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about.",
      "\"I'm always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much...that makes you sad.\"",
      "Head to the Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel to watch the full interview.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The numbers don't lie for Bruno Fernandes, but the trophy cabinet does. 307 appearances for Manchester United, 103 goals, 91 assists, and four Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year awards have yielded two medals, in the FA Cup and Carabao Cup.",
      "For all Fernandes' mixed messages over his Old Trafford future and how close he has come to leaving in the past, there can be no question mark over his loyalty to a club he has served with distinction and pride. He deserves more than that measly medal haul, to go with two runners-up efforts in the Europa League.",
      "Speaking to the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Fernandes said he had twice had chances to leave United, only for the club to ask him to stay. That contradicts what he told Canal 11 in an interview released earlier this week, in which he claimed the club wanted him out last summer but lacked the courage to inform him.",
      "That interview was conducted a few weeks ago and was arranged by the Portuguese national team. His chat with Ferdinand was conducted on Saturday, before the Canal 11 quotes were released.",
      "But whatever of Fernandes stirring the pot when it comes to his future and transfer tales of the past, as he points out to Ferdinand, he has given his all to the club and although it remains unsaid, it is clear he hasn't got what he deserves in return.",
      "Fernandes talks about his \"loyalty... in the toughest periods\" and how he opted to stay despite the fact that he hasn't won the silverware his career clearly merits. At times, he sounded reflective when he considered the seven years of service he has given.",
      "\"Obviously, I think the time at the club has not been as I wanted because obviously, I wanted to lift trophies and I haven't lifted as many as I should and I could,\" he said.",
      "\"But at the same time, I think everything I've done for the club in a certain way was still very important and not taking nothing away from other players that were here and everything. I think when we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I think everyone at the club, I hope is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "\"So I'm very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably winning more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I've had trophies into my cabinet. So nowadays people talk more like you are a better player or a worse player if you win or you lose trophies.\"",
      "Fernandes made the point that players from previous generations weren't judged on medals, citing Francesco Totti's loyalty to Roma as an example. Totti made 786 appearances for his boyhood club across 25 seasons and won only one Serie A title and two Coppa Italias. Nobody decries that as a waste of time. Instead, Totti is lauded for both his loyalty and his brilliance.",
      "But times have shifted in the age of social media. Look at the ridicule Harry Kane got at Tottenham for not winning trophies. The only person who should be judging whether that loyalty is worth the payoff is the player.",
      "So far, Fernandes has felt it has been worth it and you can see why. Just imagine being the Manchester United captain - not to mention their best player - when they finally win the title again. That one title at Old Trafford would be worth countless others elsewhere.",
      "The reality for Fernandes is that the elusive prize is no closer to being delivered now than it was when he arrived at the club in January 2020. If anything, it is further away.",
      "Fernandes insists he stayed at United because he thinks they can still win trophies. They did reach a European final last season. But within a few weeks of this season starting, there was only one piece of silverware left on the table, in the FA Cup. It is cup competitions which have to be United's aim at the moment.",
      "Nobody could blame Fernandes if he decided this summer that he had had enough of that. If United fail to qualify for the Champions League for the third season in a row, it will only feel like those big prizes are getting further away.",
      "It would be no surprise if Fernandes were to decide enough was enough, and the worry for United is that the longer they go without competing for trophies, the more difficult it can be to attract and keep the best players.",

      "It's not been an easy business being a striker for Manchester United in recent years and Benjamin Sesko has found his start to life at Old Trafford to follow a familiar pattern. Two goals in his first 13 appearances tell the story of a centre-forward still getting to grips with the role.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee has never convinced in the role and Rasmus Hojlund is now scoring goals for Napoli, having struggled to do the same for United. In search for a solution, Ruben Amorim spent nearly £74million on signing Sesko from RB Leipzig in the summer.",
      "Hojlund could attest that leading the line in this system doesn't come with a guarantee of chances. The Dane didn't look up to the job, but his frustration also regularly boiled over when the final pass never came or opportunities didn't find their way to him.",
      "It's been a similar story for Sesko, who has managed 18 shots in 12 Premier League games, six of which came in one game at Brentford. He has an xG of 2.1 in those games, which shows that chances just aren't coming to him. It's hard to be too critical in that regard and when the same happened to Hojlund, it starts to look like a pattern.",
      "It has been a smoother start to life at United for Bryan Mbeumo, who has quickly become the attack leader and the player in the final third always the likeliest to make something happen. He has six goals in 16 games from an xG of 5.5 and has been a more dangerous outlet than Sesko.",
      "But with Mbeumo now away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), United need someone to step forward, and this feels like the moment Sesko can really make his mark on a new club. That was put to Amorim last week and he sought to take the pressure off his new striker, but did hint at a change in approach.",
      "\"I think it's not just Ben, but everyone,\" he said. \"I think we need to adapt a little bit the way we are going to play the games and that is a good opportunity to do that because we cannot think that we are going to play the same way without Amad, Bryan and Nous but especially Amad and Bryan because of the characteristics. that is really hard to get.",
      "\"They have more or less the same characteristics, both of them, and we are losing them for a few games, but it's a good opportunity for us to try to play in a different way.\"",
      "That different way is something that looks more like a 4-3-3 and it might end up being a system that delivers more chances to the No.9. Sesko got only 22 minutes against Bournemouth and had a hand in Matheus Cunha's goal, but if he returns to the starting line-up at Villa Park it will be easier to judge him.",
      "No player wants an injury, but the four matches Sesko has missed with a knee problem might have given him the chance to reset and take stock, to assess his start at United and what, if anything, needs to change.",
      "He certainly needs to deliver more goals, although to do that he will need more chances. The next few weeks might offer an opportunity in that regard and Amorim will be hoping to see the best of Sesko over the festive period.",

      "For all the talk of Bruno Fernandes' goals and assists, of his leadership and his passion, there is one side of his game that gets little recognition. He is almost always available.",
      "Fresh light has been shed on Fernandes' astonishing fitness record in the latest report from the CIES Football Observatory, which looks at the most physically robust outfield players by measuring minutes played. Across the last three years, nobody has played more than Fernandes' 16,880 minutes.",
      "The 31-year-old comes in ahead of Federico Valverde, Nicolas Otamendi and Gustavo Gomez of Palmeiras and it's a reminder that he is not only relied on at Old Trafford to deliver in an attacking sense, but to play every week as well. That tally of minutes has been recorded across 192 games for club and country.",
      "Fernandes hasn't missed a game this season and has played all but eight minutes of United's Premier League campaign. Last season, he was suspended for one Europa League game and one Premier League fixture and was rested at Brentford during the run-in as focus turned to Europe, but there were no injuries.",
      "The last time he missed a game through injury for United was in May 2024, when he was sidelined for two fixtures towards the end of the season. In total, he has missed just three matches through injury or illness since signing for the club in January 2020, which is an incredible record for a player who has now racked up 307 appearances.",
      "This season, Fernandes has played 96.4% of possible minutes for United. Last season, it was 89.7%, and the season before, 90.4%. He has been United's best player throughout that run, but is also always available.",
      "Having reopened the debate over his future this week, this is another aspect of Fernandes' game that United might find difficult to replace. He told Canal 11 in Portugal that he felt the club wanted him to leave last summer and he has already made it clear he will reassess his future after the World Cup.",
      "It's not impossible that he leaves United this summer, but in addition to replacing his influence in the final third, they will need to find a player who can match his robustness, and that will not be easy.",
      "United have had their injury issues in recent years. Erik ten Hag's second season in charge was wrecked by a string of fitness problems, but Fernandes was never affected. New research earlier this week labelled United the Premier League's most injury-hit club, with absences costing them £155million over the past five years.",
      "Throughout it all, Fernandes has remained the constant, and his ability to almost entirely avoid injury is remarkable. That will be even harder to replace than his goals and assists if he does call it a day at the end of the season.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United transfer blog on Thursday, December 18.",
      "The January transfer window is fast approaching, and Ruben Amorim is preparing for another opportunity to strengthen his squad. After spending over £200m back in the summer, United have been on somewhat of an upward trajectory, with Amorim's side currently sitting sixth in the Premier League standings.",
      "They are just two points behind Chelsea in fourth, which makes United genuine contenders for a Champions League spot this term, and plans are seemingly in place to bolster the squad for the second half of the campaign.",
      "However, the main talking point today is Bruno Fernandes. The 31-year-old has admitted in a bombshell interview that he could leave United soon, claiming a move to Spain, Italy and Portugal are all possible destinations for his next move.",
      "There has been plenty of talk around the future of captain Fernandes' amid ongoing interest from Saudi Arabia. Otherwise, Bournemouth stars Antoine Semenyo, Alex Scott and Tyler Adams all linked with moves to Old Trafford.",
      "A new midfielder has long been the priority for Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba a reported target form the summer. Now, it appears Elliot Anderson at the top of that list. although RC Lens' Mamadou Sangare, Adan Wharton, Noah Sadiki and Ayyoub Bouaddi have also been linked.",
      "So, with that said, here's a look at the latest United updates ahead of another busy day of action.",
      "Follow below for all the latest Man United updates, reactions, analysis and opinions throughout the day...",
      "Manchester United academy graduate Alvaro Carreras has become a key player for Real Madrid after United decided to sell the young defender - a decision that 'surprised' Old Trafford icon Phil Jones.",
      "He told Sports Illustrated: “Yeah, Incredible. Incredible player. Incredible player. I didn’t think he’d get to that level. Don’t forget he went out on loan to Preston and wasn’t playing that regularly at Preston. He was brilliant.",
      "“And the reason that people would look at him and go ‘maybe not for us’ is because he probably lacked pace.",
      "“And as a left back, he’s tall. He’s got like sort of a really lanky way of running. But I thought he was brilliant. I thought technically he was brilliant. He kept the ball. He never gave the ball away. He was one that surprised me why United let him go.”",
      "Manchester United starlet Kobbie Mainoo has dropped a significant hint about a potential exit after struggling for regular game time under Ruben Amorim. The 20-year-old midfielder reportedly knew about the \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\" message displayed by his brother at Old Trafford.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs suggests that Mainoo was fully aware of his brother's t-shirt stunt and supported the message as he seeks more minutes. With Amorim seemingly moving in a different tactical direction, multiple clubs are reportedly on high alert regarding the youngster's availability.",
      "Whether via a loan or a permanent switch, the pressure is mounting on the club to resolve the future of one of their brightest academy graduates.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly chosen Manuel Ugarte as the primary \"sacrifice\" to fund new arrivals this January. INEOS is said to be taking drastic measures to reshape the squad, according to Spanish outlet Fichajes.",
      "The Uruguayan midfielder has struggled for game time, starting only two Premier League matches this season. A loan move to OGC Nice is currently seen as the most likely exit path to free up wages and a squad spot.",
      "Offloading Ugarte is viewed as an \"imperative\" step to adding a different dynamic to the United midfield. Amorim is reportedly searching for a profile that better fits his double-pivot system as the club looks to stabilise the squad.",
      "One strategy to create space in the Manchester United squad and budget for new signings is to let go of certain players. A few names have been associated with possible exits recently, most notably midfielder Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The England international was expected to leave during the summer, with Serie A champions Napoli reportedly interested. However, no move materialised and the homegrown player remained at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim's recent remarks about United's emerging talents and his hesitation to utilise them have raised eyebrows. Mainoo wasn't the only one mentioned, with 18 year old Harry Amass, currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, also being highlighted...",
      "There is plenty of interest in Manchester United's Marcus Rashford, should he not remain at Barcelona, according to reports.",
      "The 28-year-old is currently on loan at the La Liga club but it is currently unclear whether he will remain at the Camp Nou beyond the current campaign.",
      "Should he return to United, it has been claimed by CaughtOffside that he is also a target for Barcelona's La Liga rivals Atletico Madrid.",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes' future at the club is back in the headlines this week after an interview with Portuguese media surfaced on Tuesday.",
      "Conducted in his home country, the midfielder stated he was left 'hurting' by what he felt was the club being uninterested on whether he stayed or left.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has asked its United writers for their thoughts on what happens next with Fernandes and whether the captain should stay or leave at the end of the campaign.",
      "Read what they had to say here...",
      "Manchester United have been criticised by pundit Ian Wright for their treatment of club captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The midfielder revealed in a bombshell interview, that was released this week, that the club's hierarchy were willing to offload him during the summer transfer window. However, despite a significant offer on the table from the Saudi Pro League, he admitted they didn't have the courage to completely force him out the door, owing to the fact Ruben Amorim wanted him to stay.",
      "Wright, who represented Arsenal during his playing days, claims United's treatment of Fernandes has been poor, and he would take the Portuguese star at the Emirates Stadium 'tomorow'.",
      "\"It comes back down to the Manchester United indecisiveness,\" Wright said on The Overlap.",
      "\"Someone's come in for Bruno, you shut that down. Because Bruno didn’t want to go. Bruno is saying they said to him, 'well, it’s up to you if you want to leave'.",
      "\"That’s not what you want to hear from someone like him who's literally holding the club up himself.",
      "\"You want the club to say, 'you’re not going nowhere, you’re a massive part of this'. But Man United didn’t do that. They gave him the opportunity to say, 'if you want to stay you can stay, if you want to go, you can go'.",
      "\"What is that saying? I would take him [at Arsenal] tomorrow.\"",
      "It's not been an easy business being a striker for Manchester United in recent years and Benjamin Sesko has found his start to life at Old Trafford to follow a familiar pattern, writes Tyrone Marshall.",
      "Two goals in his first 13 appearances tell the story of a centre-forward still getting to grips with the role.",
      "By contrast, it has been a smoother start to life at United for Bryan Mbeumo, who has quickly become the attack leader and the player in the final third always the likeliest to make something happen.",

      "Read the full comment here.",
      "Roma have already identified a potential alternative target as a move for Manchester United's Joshua Zirkzee stalls, according to reports.",
      "The Italian club have been heavily linked with the Dutchman of late, as speculation surrounding his future at Old Trafford continues to grow.",
      "That said, with little sign of progress in negotiations and a deal so far, it appears Roma may already be shifting their attention elsewhere.",
      "According to Football Italia, Atletico Madrid's Giacomo Raspadori is also a leading target for the club.",
      "Lazio have also been linked with the player, but Roma boss Gian Piero Gasperini is said to appreciate the 25-year-ol.d",
      "United have made contact over a deal to sign Bournemouth attacker Antoine Semenyo, according to the latest from journalist Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The Ghana international is a target for a number of top Premier League clubs ahead of the January window, including United, Liverpool, Manchester City and Spurs, due to the presence of a £65 million release clause active until a certain date in January.",
      "Speaking on his Youtube Channel, Romano explained the latest involving United: \"For Semenyo, the situation is really heating up.",
      "\"This week, Manchester United and Manchester City called to understand the situation of Semenyo. From Monday to Tuesday, some calls took place from Man United and Man City to understand the situation of Semenyo who has a £65m release clause.",
      "\"These clubs all called. Liverpool called in November and are now assessing what they want to do, both in January and with Mo Salah, before deciding on Semenyo.",
      "“More than money, more than financial fair play, it’s the player who is deciding.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes threw his Manchester United future into doubt this week with a bombshell interview, in which he claims the club's hierarchy wanted to sell him in the summer before he opted to stay at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils captain insisted he is willing to remain at the club so long as he is wanted.",
      "Journalist Fabrizio Romano has since issued his verdict on the Portuguese internationa's future and whether a January exit could be on the cards.",
      "He said on his YouTube channel: \"Now, if you ask me, what’s going to happen in 2026, what I can say is that, for January, the situation is more than quiet.",
      "\"So, nothing is imminent. Nothing is happening. For the summer transfer window, I would keep an eye on the interest from Saudi because I think from Saudi, they can return for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"Then it’s going to be up to Bruno, up to Man Utd again. Let’s see what’s going to happen before of after the World Cup.",
      "\"But I can guarantee, as I always tell you here on my channel, Bruno has always been one of the targets for the Saudi deal-makers. They will be back.",
      "“\"he intention is not to part ways in January. Bruno is fully focused on Man Utd. He’s showing his love for Man Utd, but in the summer, Saudi Arabia will try again.\"",
      "There was no shortage of relief among the Manchester United fanbase when Bruno Fernandes confirmed he would be staying at Old Trafford this past summer, writes Jack Flintham.",
      "The offer from the Saudi Pro League will have been tempting for the captain, considering the amount of money which they put on the table for players of Fernandes' quality.",
      "But after consulting his family, and speaking with the United board and manager Ruben Amorim, Fernandes wanted to stay.",
      "That is why a new interview with the midfielder, on Portuguese media outlet Canal 11, has been so surprising to all those involved with the club.",

      "Ruben Amorim seems to have been enjoying keeping everyone guessing about his system in recent days. A head coach who once said Manchester United would need to sack him if they wanted to go with a different idea has spent much of the past 10 days working on just that.",
      "The 3-4-2-1 system so associated with Amorim wasn’t entirely thrown out of the window against Bournemouth, but it felt like a very different interpretation. Amad was playing well in advance of Diogo Dalot, who often lined up at left-back, with Leny Yoro at right-back. Amad was tucked inside as a midfielder before sometimes dropping back to the right wing-back slot.",
      "It was all very flexible, and after the game, Cherries boss Andoni Iraola said he felt it was the same system Amorim always used, but that it’s a system that comes with a lot of flexibility built in. It hasn’t always looked that way at United.",
      "Amorim was certainly giving nothing away after the match, beyond an acknowledgement that he had been working on a different shape at Carrington.",
      "“That is for you to discuss, not for me,” he said. “I will say the same thing, you can play with the same players, it looks like one thing is another thing. I know that you guys know that I trained this week the back four. I don't know how, but that is a good thing for you guys to discuss this week.”",
      "The question now is whether this weekend’s set-up at Aston Villa looks more like a 4-3-3. Amorim said last week United would have to change once Amad and Bryan Mbeumo left for the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "That system would certainly work, except for a question about width, which would need to come from the full-backs. Diogo Dalot could revert to a natural role at right-back and Luke Shaw to left-back. Lisandro Martinez could be the left-sided centre-back and Matthijs de Ligt, if fit, on the right. If De Ligt isn’t fit, then Harry Maguire, currently also injured, is an option, as are Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven, who are available.",
      "Casemiro could play the holding midfield role, although the Brazilian is suspended this weekend, so Manuel Ugarte might have to step in. A 4-3-3 formation would allow Amorim to play Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes together, if he wanted to.",
      "Benjamin Sesko can lead the line, with Matheus Cunha coming in off the left. Cunha has been excellent as a false nine, but if Shaw can get forward in support, he can drift infield from that role.",
      "It might be a similar situation on the right, with Mason Mount likely to play that position. Mount has been excellent recently and although Amorim would probably rather play him centrally, there is a lack of options on the right with Amad and Mbeumo unavailable.",
      "That XI would easily fit into a 4-3-3 formation, although it could revert to a back three with Patrick Dorgu brought in, likely replacing Mainoo.",
      "But there has been a growing anticipation that Amorim is considering a change, and this might just provide it.",

      "There was no shortage of relief among the Manchester United fanbase when Bruno Fernandes confirmed he would be staying at Old Trafford this past summer. The offer from the Saudi Pro League will have been tempting for the captain, considering the amount of money which they put on the table for players of Fernandes' quality.",
      "But after consulting his family, and speaking with the United board and manager Ruben Amorim, Fernandes wanted to stay. The captain has since gone on to score five goals and grab seven assists, so far this campaign. In October, the captain reiterated to MEN Sport the talks which settled his future involved the hierarchy.",
      "That is why a new interview with the midfielder, on Portuguese media outlet Canal 11, has been so surprising to all those involved with the club. Fernandes now appears to have contradicted himself, suggesting he felt 'hurt' by what he believed was the implication from United that they were not concerned about losing him.",
      "United sources have since reiterated the board made it clear to Fernandes he was part of the future at Old Trafford. But wherever the truth lies, the Reds should be treating this whole saga as a warning ahead of the next summer transfer window.",
      "Even if wires have been crossed between Fernandes and United, the captain has made it clear he wants to achieve other things before he hangs his boots. In the most recent interview, he mentioned his desire to play in Spain, Portugal and Italy before retiring, while also keeping the door open to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Fernandes is 31 now, certainly not at retirement age, but no spring chicken either. If he wants to achieve all of these things, or even some of them, before the end of his career, he will need to get a move on.",
      "There is a sense that Fernandes' time at United is coming to an end. He has been a brilliant servant to the club and he is the most deserving of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson crop of being given a proper send off.",
      "But United must start thinking about their own future and preservation. If Fernandes is to leave at the end of this season or in 2027 when his contract expires, the Reds need to make a plan for his replacement.",
      "For a long time, the plan seemed to revolve around Kobbie Mainoo. He was the academy graduate with the world at his feet and had the potential to produce the key moments Fernandes has done for the club.",
      "But a difficult 2025/26 season has put this succession path into major jeopardy. Mainoo's opportunities have dwindled and he handed in a request to leave the club on loan - which was rejected - over the summer.",
      "Since then the midfielder's situation has not altered. He is still yet to start a Premier League match this season and hopes of going to the World Cup have all but gone.",
      "There is a real possibility United could start next season without Fernandes and Mainoo. Surely then, this should be a wake-up call for the Reds.",
      "At the moment, it seems like they are sleep walking towards losing two of their most valuable midfielders. If they want to keep them, they need to start acting quickly.",
      "Both situations may be too far down the line for United to save them but if Fernandes' mind is made up, Amorim has got to start integrating Mainoo more to keep him from straying away. The Englishman needs to know there is a future for him at this club and a lot must change between now and the end of the season to prove it.",
      "Fernandes' bombshell interview is clear evidence United need to be looking into life without their captain and preparing for that eventuality. The trouble is, as things stand, it could be life without Fernandes and Mainoo next season which is enough to give the recruitment team sleepless nights.",

      "Scott McTominay didn't have the necessary belief from coaches at Manchester United, says Joleon Lescott. The Scotland international has shone since his move to Napoli in 2024.",
      "McTominay had been involved with United from the age of five and rose through the academy ranks to make his debut in 2017. Under various managers he developed an eye for goal, but the versatile midfielder was played in a range of positions and was never one of the first names on the teamsheet.",
      "Thanks to his transfer value as a homegrown talent, McTominay was sold in the summer of 2024 for a reported £26million, much to the reluctance of his boss at the time, Erik ten Hag.",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "Since the move, he has won a league title, been named Serie A MVP, and guided Scotland to the 2026 World Cup. A Supercoppa Italiana semi-final against AC Milan now looms, and ex-Manchester City defender Lescott thinks he was never given a chance by coaches at Old Trafford.",
      "\"He was scoring goals. He was scoring goals for United and he was doing that when he played in a more advanced role,\" said Lescott, speaking on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet.",
      "\"It was just that he wasn't allowed to do it every week and I also don't think he was allowed to have a bad game. I think there were times where he would score, do well, stay in the team and then if he didn't do it again, he was coming out.",
      "\"I don't think every player has that set balance or is not given the grace of playing badly. I think that comes when you're a homegrown talent though.",
      "\"Because for Scotland he's always done it. He did it in spells for Man United, but I don't think he was given the kind of belief from the coaches to go and say, 'You don't have to be Man of the Match every week but you can stay in the team.'\"",
      "Former Liverpool captain Graeme Souness also thinks that McTominay might have been sold prematurely, arguing that he would currently be United's best midfielder had he stayed put.",
      "\"They've spent a lot of money on [Manuel] Ugarte and Casemiro. I got much criticised for saying I thought he was an ordinary Joe when they signed him. I still see him as an ordinary Joe, a very steady player,\" Souness told the Daily Mail.",
      "\"They sold the best one: Scott McTominay. He was better than those two and he's just grown in his job since he's been at Napoli. I understand why you would use Bruno as a six, but then you want to use him as a 10 as well. So, he has a license.",
      "\"I still don't like him waving his arms and telling other people what to do all the time. Slightly frustrating. I couldn't have played with him if he was like that.\"",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes' future at the club is back in the headlines this week after an interview with Portuguese media surfaced on Tuesday. Conducted in his home country, the midfielder stated he was left 'hurting' by what he felt was the club being uninterested on whether he stayed or left.",
      "Speaking to Canal 11, Fernandes suggested the club gave off the impression it 'would not be that bad' if the midfielder was to leave for Saudi Arabia. He added he wanted to stay at United for 'as long as he felt desired' but suggested he was also interested in playing in Spain, Italy and Portugal before retiring.",
      "Fernandes turned 31 in September and has 18 months remaining on his current deal at Old Trafford. In January 2027, the midfielder would be able to negotiate with overseas clubs on terms for a free transfer at the start of the 2027/28 campaign.",
      "The captain said back in October he was happy to stay at United and Ruben Amorim had made it clear he did not want Fernandes to leave. Fernandes has gone on to score five goals and bag seven assists since the conversations with the manager.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has asked its United writers for their thoughts on what happens next with Fernandes and whether the captain should stay or leave at the end of the campaign.",
      "The time to sell Fernandes was probably last summer. That was when the big offer was on the table and when United could have pushed ahead with a rebuild under Amorim. If that fee isn’t on offer next summer, then there is no way a deal should be done.",
      "Fernandes continues to prove his importance to this team week after week and they would be worse off without him. His 12 goals contributions in 16 league games this season again makes him the most valuable player in the team.",
      "But what happens next is really all down to Fernandes now. It’s an unusual approach to bring his future back into the open and risk divisions wth club bosses. If United secure Champions League football next season, then there should be no need to consider a parting of the ways.",
      "If they don’t, nobody could blame Fernandes for wanting out. He has given his all to this club and if it still isn’t where it should be next season, then that might be the moment to call it quits. He will be clearly difficult to replace, but it seems inevitable that at some point in the next year or two, that is the position United will find themselves in.",
      "This situation seemed to have been put to bed by Fernandes himself in October when he expressed his desire to stay at Old Trafford for as long as the club wanted him. While United's playmaker has reiterated this stance to Canal 11, he seems to have added caveats which will concern supporters wanting to see the midfielder stay beyond the summer of 2026.",
      "Undoubtedly, the 31-year-old's comments will have come as a shock to United and there will now be internal discussions about what this means moving forward. Fernandes has shown this season he remains influential and would benefit any top team in the big five leagues in Europe.",
      "Having said that, he will have just one year remaining on his contract in the summer and if Fernandes is already weighing up the possibility of playing football elsewhere, there's a chance United miss out on recouping money by keeping him an extra 12 months. It is a harsh reality of football that personal connections have to be put to one side.",
      "But getting £80m+ for Fernandes would help United rebuild not only their midfield, but potentially their defence too. If an offer around that figure was to be submitted for Fernandes, United may perhaps be right to take it.",
      "However, if Kobbie Mainoo has left by then or the offer is simply lower than it was in the summer, United should be rejecting it and forging a new plan.",

The Red's had a fruitful summer window, bringing in key players such as Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo. However, there's still work to be done, with several areas on the pitch requiring bolstering.",
      "One strategy to create space in the squad and budget for new signings is to let go of certain players. A few names have been associated with possible exits recently, most notably midfielder Mainoo. The England international was expected to leave during the summer, with Serie A champions Napoli reportedly interested. However, no move materialised and the homegrown player remained at Old Trafford.",
      "Regrettably for Mainoo, his playing time under Ruben Amorim hasn't increased this season. The 20 year old has made 12 appearances in all competitions so far, but hasn't started a single Premier League match.",
      "Amorim's recent remarks about United's emerging talents and his hesitation to utilise them have raised eyebrows. Mainoo wasn't the only one mentioned, with 18 year old Harry Amass, currently on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, also being highlighted - perhaps in reference to the Championship club's league position.",
      "\"It's the situation, what's happened,\" the United manager remarked ahead of Monday evening's clash with Bournemouth. \"I don't know what is going to be the future [for Mainoo]. Let's see after this match.",
      "\"[Harry] Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido [Obi] is not always a starter in under 21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\".",
      "With the January transfer window looming, both Mainoo and Amass feature amongst the United youngsters generating significant interest. Reports suggest that up to 12 clubs are vying for the midfielder's services.",
      "Whilst Chelsea and Bayern Munich are understood to be frontrunners in the pursuit, their already crowded midfield departments mean Napoli allegedly remains the player's favoured option currently. Similar to Mainoo, Amass has also captured the attention of a dozen clubs keen on acquiring his services next month.",
      "He is currently on loan at Wednesday and has established himself as a regular, making 16 starts. Should a January recall materialise, with Wednesday battling relegation at the foot of the Championship, the Daily Mail reports that approximately 12 teams have enquired about the player's availability.",
      "Promotion-chasing sides Millwall and Stoke City are believed to be amongst the interested parties.",

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

      "It came as a surprise to supporters when watching the game, as the starting line-up appeared to point towards a back five, but the side shuffled into more of a four during the match.",
      "That is despite head coach Ruben Amorim being insistent over the first year or so of his tenure that he would not change, having previously made his stance clear in the media over a move from the five to a four.",
      "He said: \"No one. Not even the Pope will change [his tactics]. This is my job. This is my responsibility. This is my life. So, I will not change that.\"",
      "Those were quotes that Neville reflected on in the latest recording of the Stick To Football podcast, before having his say on the changes that United made in the game.",

      "\"Has he changed it...? The last 20 minutes he was definitely 4-4-2, 4-2-4, but in the first part of the game, there was something definitely different that had been identified earlier in the week.",
      "\"Apparently, United are a bit annoyed, basically it's leaked out that he's gonna change to a 4-4-2 or a 4-3-3. He was emphatic about not changing, and we've all asked for him to change and be agile. Where are we now in respect to, there's no doubt on Monday he changed.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",
      "There were times in the match where United looked back to the team of old, before the habits of recent years snuck back into it, but it's a promising signal for many that the head coach is willing to make those small tactical tweaks.",
      "While many believed there were changes, Bournemouth's boss Andoni Iraola seemed less certain, as he said after the game: \"I think it's the same system they always play, but they adapt depending on who you put to mark them. In the end, it's a very flexible system.",
      "\"Depending on the players, the outside players, depending if you mark them with a full-back, they will go lower, and then with a winger, they go higher.",
      "\"Also, with the positions in the middle, the six and eight, Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes and - even us - we were changing, it's two against two, but it's not two against two.",
      "\"Until we match up well for us, I think we suffer in the first 15 or 20 minutes, something like this and after when we put Alex [Scott] there, we felt much more solid without the ball. And when you feel solid, normally you also attack better.\"",
      "Considering United's upcoming AFCON absentees, it remains to be seen whether the side will continue with those tactical tweaks or if it was a rare change that may not be seen again.",

      "It has taken Ruben Amorim 13 months and 59 games as Manchester United head coach to bend to his principles and give in to pressure from pundits, supporters and even some players, but after a night of high drama and even higher stress, he might be reluctant to do so again.",
      "Amorim had hinted on Friday that the loss of Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo to the Africa Cup of Nations might force him into a tactical rethink, and this was the first sign of that plan. The one change from Wolves looked like-for-like, but when the game began, it was clear this was more back four than back three.",
      "There was plenty of versatility there. At times, it reverted to the familiar shape with Amad at wing-back, but more often than not he was further forward, with Leny Yoro at right-back and Diogo Dalot at left-back. Throughout the first half, it looked like Amorim had been missing a trick all along. By full-time, there were as many questions facing a back four as there were a back three.",
      "When will the real United under Amorim reveal themselves? They were electric in the opening exchanges in the first half and then out of battery at the start of the second. The contrast was baffling, as it was at both ends of the pitch. United were brilliant going forward but hopeless at the back and once again they saw the chance to go fifth get away from them.",
      "Bruno Fernandes couldn't hide his frustration at full-time. He was animated in arguing with Casemiro but looked to be venting his wider complaints at the Brazilian. He knows this chaos can't continue.",
      "It had looked like a different story on at least a couple of occasions. Three times United lead and after starting without intensity against Everton and West Ham, they tore into Bournemouth.",
      "Amad's goal in the 13th minute was United's eighth shot of the evening and the least they deserved for the enterprise they had shown in the opening exchanges. It was noticeable that Amorim's tactical shift was getting more players into the box. Bournemouth had been overworked in blocking shots from Fernandes, Matheus Cunha and Amad, while Djordje Petrovic saved from Mason Mount.",
      "Petrovic could only stick an arm out when trying to smother Diogo Dalot's dangerous cross with Cunha lurking. The Brazilian didn't get a touch, but the ball bounced up for Amad to head into an empty net from a couple of yards out.",
      "The chances kept coming. Cunha stroked a shot just wide and Mbeumo forced Petrovic into another save. Cunha was pulling the strings as a false nine. Another excellent pass from his own half released Amad, whose shot was blocked by Adam Smith, and a perfect Cunha cross was met acrobatically by Mbeumo, but he could only volley over.",
      "United had racked up 12 shots to zero by the half hour but had a warning when Semme Lammens saved Marcus Tavernier's header from six yards, only they didn't heed it. Luke Shaw was bullied off the ball by Justin Kluivert and Ayden Heaven too slow to Antoine Semenyo, before his finish off the post.",
      "Casemiro restored the lead before half-time, with Petrovic making a mess of his header from Fernandes' corner, and it felt like that should have been that. But if United started the first half well, they were sleeping after the break.",
      "Within seconds of the restart, Tavernier's pass found Evanilson on the wrong side of Heaven, and he finished past a flat-footed Lammens. Soon after, Fernandes was caught on the ball in midfield and Casemiro forced into desperate action, conceding a free-kick 20 yards out. It proved pointless, Tavernier's low effort beating Lammens, who should have been protecting that side of the goal.",
      "United were beginning to look out of ideas as Amorim turned to Kobbie Mainoo to try and save his blushes. The roar that greeted Mainoo's emergence for Casemiro made it clear that Old Trafford regulars have no desire to see the academy graduate spend the second half of the season out on loan, but that noise was soon eclipsed.",
      "Fernandes made up for his mistake for Bournemouth's third by curling a magnificent free-kick into the top corner with 13 minutes to go, waving his arms to demand urgency on the pitch and in the stands. He got it immediately. Mbeumo forced his way through a tackle, Benjamin Sekso carried on the move and Cunha capitalised on a defensive error to fire in his second goal for the club.",
      "Fernandes made a beeline for the subs before running in front of the Stretford End to join his delirious teammates. Cunha kissed his shirt in front of the stand and Old Trafford came alive.",
      "But these supporters know by now never to take anything for granted. Junior Kroupi found space on the edge of the area and delivered a stunning finish and Bournemouth looked the more likely to win it. In eight added minutes, Lammens saved twice from David Brooks to ensure a disappointing night didn't become disastrous.",

      "Manchester United drew 4-4 with Bournemouth in the Premier League on Monday. The game had plenty of twists and turns, but the points were shared after a late equaliser from Bournemouth forward Junior Kroupi.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha scored goals in quick succession to give United a 4-3 advantage with 10 minutes remaining, but the Reds gave Bournemouth another bite at the cherry as they secured a point.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed from the game:",
      "Fernandes' efforts in vain",
      "Fernandes has been the best signing of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, and he made it 3-3 with a stunning free-kick at the Stretford End. United rushed back for the restart and Fernandes whipped up the crowd to increase the noise, knowing that United had time to score again to win the game.",
      "It took just two minutes for United to find that goal. Cunha finished to score his second goal for the club and the celebrations were wild. The Brazilian flung himself into the Stretford End, while Fernandes sprinted to where the substitutes were warming up to throw himself into their arms.",
      "United thought they had won the game, but Kroupi went up the other end of the pitch to bring the score to 4-4. United's biggest problem has been conceding goals - and it came back to haunt them.",
      "Fernandes was inconsolable at the full-time whistle, furiously venting on the pitch.",
      "The system change",
      "Amorim has been heavily criticised for stubbornly sticking by his 3-4-3 formation, but he tweaked his system against Bournemouth, playing with a back four when United were out of possession.",
      "When United attempted to build up play, Amad and Diogo Dalot were in the wing-back positions, but Amad pushed ahead of Leny Yoro when Bournemouth had the ball. The change caused some defensive teething issues, which prompted Amorim and his assistant, Carlos Fernandes, to give Yoro an earful.",
      "The change was a positive, though. Amorim has previously said the positions that players take up during a game are more important than the formation itself, and the shape was fluid throughout, which caused problems for Bournemouth, who were not prepared to play against the changed approach.",
      "Amorim said that not even the Pope could persuade him to change his formation, but he made a slight U-turn against Bournemouth. And United still found a way to drop points.",
      "Controversial decision",
      "United coach Adelio Candido man-marked referee Simon Hooper as the teams returned to the dressing room for half-time, seemingly complaining about the decision not to show Antoine Semenyo a red card.",
      "Dalot challenged Semenyo - it was a foul on the Bournemouth forward - but he reacted by placing his hands on the neck of the Portugal international. Casemiro was sent off for a similar incident involving Crystal Palace midfielder Will Hughes two years ago, but Hooper dished out yellows to the two players.",
      "Candido looked furious as he made his case to Hooper. The fans in the Stretford End recognised what the United coach was doing and taunted Hooper by singing: \"You Scouse b******.\"",
      "The lack of consistency in refereeing decisions in the Premier League has been a longstanding issue.",
      "The reception for Mainoo",
      "There was a small cheer from fans in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand when Mainoo was called to prepare himself to come on just before the hour mark. An even bigger cheer from the entire crowd followed when Mainoo replaced Casemiro, with thousands of supporters standing to applaud.",
      "Amorim has produced some bruising quotes about Mainoo during press conferences over the last few weeks, so the reception for the midfielder was a clear message from fans within Old Trafford.",
      "It remains to be seen how the Mainoo situation unfolds in the January transfer window, but one thing is obvious: United fans want the academy graduate to stay at the club for years to come.",
      "Rollercoaster game",
      "Amad scored a gift-wrapped goal ahead of Christmas when Bournemouth goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic's hesitation created an opportunity that couldn't possibly be squandered.",
      "Dalot sent a brilliant cross into the box, Cunha won the flick on, and the ball kissed the crossbar before finding its way to Amad. The 23-year-old headed into an empty net to mark his last game before travelling to the Africa Cup of Nations with his second goal of the Premier League campaign.",
      "The majority of the credit for the goal should go to Dalot, who built upon his recent improvement down the left with another important contribution in the final third.",
      "Dalot's contribution didn't go unnoticed by the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, who enthusiastically applauded the defender as he returned to his position for the restart. However, the same fans were not applauding when the final whistle went, disappointed at the team's failure to see out a victory.",
      "Back-and-forth",
      "The atmosphere at Old Trafford is at its best for evening games and the Stretford End, in particular, was in fine voice. Anti-Glazer chants were aired and a \"full sale only\" banner was spotted before kick-off, demonstrating the continued unrest among fans about the club's ownership.",
      "\"Stand up if you hate Glazers,\" was heard, which was followed by a vitriolic chant about Joel Glazer. United fans then aired the Amorim \"we'll back him from the Stretford End\" chant after Amad's goal.",
      "The Stretford End subsequently roared United back into the dressing room after Casemiro restored the advantage on the stroke of half-time, but it was Bournemouth fans who were gloating when play resumed for the second half, with the Cherries turning the game on its head in a matter of minutes.",
      "\"It's happened again, Man United, it's happened again,\" chanted the away end section, referencing the fact their side has scored three goals at Old Trafford for the third successive season. Amorim has overseen two of those games against Bournemouth, who should not be scoring so many when they visit Old Trafford.",

      "Ruben Amorim won't turn to the transfer market to solve Manchester United's defensive woes despite admitting that his side \"lack quality\" defensively after their chaotic 4-4 draw against Bournemouth in the Premier League. United led three times at Old Trafford and produced a vibrant attacking display but they were undone defensively too often.",
      "Amad and Casemiro scored in the first half, but they fell 3-2 behind, when two goals in three minutes from Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha looked to secure victory, only for Junior Kroupi to equalise.",
      "Only Manchester City have scored more goals in the Premier League than United's 30 this season, but they have shipped 26, a tally only exceeded by the bottom four and Bournemouth, and while Amorim is happy with some elements of United's defending, he is concerned at their efforts around their own penalty area.",
      "\"I think we are pressing better, we are controlling the game better, far from our goal, [but] we are lacking quality when we defend our goal. It's something that we need to address,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it's different when you suffer so many goals and the opponent doesn't have the same amount or not even near that we create to the opponent. It's really frustrating, but we need to work a lot in the way we defend the box.\"",
      "United spent £215million to improve their attack in the summer, focusing resources on signing attackers. The trio of Bryan Mbeumo, Cunha and Benjamin Sesko were all involved in the fourth goal and they have improved United's attacking output.",
      "The concerns now lie at the back but despite Amorim's issues with United's defending, he doesn't intend to resort to the chequebook to solve the issues.",
      "\"No, I think we have talent in the back, we have quality players in the back, we just need to be better as a team defending,\" he said.",
      "\"But that is a good point, that at least shows that we took care of the offence, we are improving, but I think it's not the same situation. We have the characteristics, we just need to work together and improve our players because they have the quality to defend better.\"",

      "But they were woeful at the back. Semenyo's goal was a gift and Evanilson and Marcus Tavernier put the Cherries ahead. Two goals in three minutes from Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha restored United's lead only for Junior Kroupi to snatch a point for the visitors.",
      "Here are your player ratings from Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens: One good first-half save, but flat-footed when beaten by Evanilson and should have saved Tavernier's free-kick. Good save late on. 5",
      "Leny Yoro: Not at the scene of the crime for some dire defensive mishaps but doesn't always spread calm amongst his teammates. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: Slow to spot the danger and close down Semenyo for the first goal and then the wrong side of Evanilson for the second. 5",
      "Luke Shaw: Bullied off the ball by Kluivert for the first goal when he really has to be stronger. Moved back to left-back in a back four midway through the second half. 5",
      "Diogo Dalot: Excellent cross for the first goal and started brightly. Moved from left-back to right-back midway through the second half. 6",
      "Casemiro: In the right place from a corner again, but Djordje Petrovic should have saved it. Not always convincing on the ball and a desperate tackle conceded a free-kick for the third goal. 6",
      "Bruno Fernandes: Caught on the ball for a break that led to the free-kick for Bournemouth's third, but a magnificent free-kick got United level and managed an assist to boot. 7",
      "Amad: Made a mess of an early pass to Bryan Mbeumo but made up for it with his goal and some really incisive attacks. Hardly alone in struggling a bit more after the break. 7",
      "Bryan Mbeumo: Not at his best. Volleyed over a difficult chance and shot too close to Petrovic for another first-half opportunity. 6",
      "Mason Mount: Excellent in the first half when his passing and pressing really shone, and he was the heart of so much good, but in influence waned after the break. 7",
      "Matheus Cunha: An exhibition of quality as a false nine in the first half. Two brilliant passes to free Amad and a lovely cross for Mbeumo. Deserved his goal. 8",
      "Substitutes",
      "Kobbie Mainoo: Got half an hour and showed some quality in a chaotic game. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: One crunching tackle. 6",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Did well for Cunha's goal. 7",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: No time to make an impact. N/A",
      "Patrick Dorgu: No time to make an impact. N/A",

      "Ruben Amorim's brutal assessment of Manchester United's academy players has not gone down well.",
      "The United head coach has faced criticism in recent months for failing to give sufficient opportunities to homegrown talent during his gruelling 13-month spell at Old Trafford, including fan favourite Kobbie Mainoo, aged 20, who is struggling for game time this campaign.",
      "Amorim’s given just three youngsters their United debuts - Tyler Fredricson, Harry Amass and Chido Obi - and has now suggested that two of those three, alongside Toby Collyer, who made his bow under Erik ten Hag, were promoted to the senior squad prematurely.",
      "Amorim said: \"He (Collyer) played (for United). He's from the academy. He played here. He went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever.",
      "\"It's the situation, what's happened. I don't know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let's see after this match. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in under-21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Ethan Ennis spent the second half of the previous season with Doncaster Rovers, who secured promotion. The 21-year-old right-winger is currently on a season-long loan at Fleetwood and has already made 20 appearances. His positive spell in League Two has seen him contribute four goals and two assists.",
      "Midfielder Dan Gore suffered an injury shortly after joining Rotherham last January but left a strong impression in the time he was available, leading to his re-signing for this season. The 21-year-old has been a key figure for Rotherham in midfield, featuring in 26 matches across all competitions for the League One side and emerging as one of their standout players.",
      "Left-sided defender Harry Amass has been a consistent presence since joining Sheffield Wednesday on loan this season. Amorim was likely referencing Wednesday's off-field troubles, with the club having been hit with a 12-point deduction, rather than Amass' own performances during his controversial press conference.",
      "Amass has made 16 appearances in the Championship and netted his first senior goal against Southampton. Sheffield Wednesday are keen to extend the 18-year-old left-back's loan until the end of the season, suggesting they are pleased with his performance thus far.",
      "After missing the first two matches of the League Two season due to a minor injury, Elyh Harrison played in the next four games for Shrewsbury Town before joining England's Under-20s in September. However, since his absence in September, another young goalkeeper has come into the side and earned first-choice status over the 19-year-old Harrison.",
      "Joe Hugill began the season as Barnet's starting striker in League Two but an injury disrupted his campaign and he didn't return to action until earlier this month. The 22-year-old came on as a substitute against Bristol Rovers and played an additional seven minutes in the loss to Chesterfield.",
      "Centre-back Sonny Aljofree started Notts County's first eight matches of the season and even scored a goal but he lost his place in the starting line-up towards the end of September. Since then, the 20-year-old has been largely absent from the matchday squad.",
      "Meanwhile, Toby Collyer is back at United receiving treatment for an injury after making 12 appearances while on loan at West Bromwich Albion. The 21-year-old central midfielder featured in each of West Brom's first nine matches of the season but has since been in and out of the side due to a muscular problem.",
      "Solihull Moors are midtable in the National League. Louis Jackson started in their first two games of the season but he has struggled to make the XI since. The centre-back, 20, has been absent from their last eight matchday squads.",
      "Enzo Kana-Biyik, 18, scored his first senior goal in October when he salvaged a point for Lausanne in a derby and was called up to France's Under-20 squad for the November international break. The centre-forward has made 13 appearances for the Swiss side, primarily coming off the bench.",
      "Radek Vitek has started every league game for Bristol City in the Championship, keeping seven clean sheets. The 22-year-old Czech goalkeeper has impressed in goal, prompting Bristol City manager Gerhard Struber to tell the Bristol Post: \"He's young, and he looks like an outstanding, experienced Championship goalkeeper.\"",
      "Jack Moorhouse has made 18 appearances for League One side Leyton Orient but just five of those have been league starts. Despite this, the 20-year-old midfielder has shown his potential when brought on as a substitute.",
      "Habeeb Ogunneye's role at Newport County has been affected by the recent departure of Dave Hughes, who previously coached Ogunneye in United's academy. After a strong start to the season, during which the 20-year-old right-back played 21 matches and scored once, he has been absent from the last two matchday squads.",
      "Ethan Wheatley, 19, needed to leave on loan after outgrowing academy football. The young striker has made 19 appearances in League One for Northampton and has found the back of the net three times, while also recording three assists in all competitions.",
      "Ethan Williams is making a name for himself in Scotland. The 21-year-old winger has contributed one goal and three assists in 14 Scottish Premiership appearances for Falkirk, who are currently sitting seventh in the league table. He has not been included in the last four matchday squads, however.",

    "body": [
      "Thanks to Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo's brother should get what he wants when Manchester United face Aston Villa on Sunday.",
      "Perhaps the Brazilian had got an early glimpse of his T-shirt and deliberately got himself booked to help out. Maybe he just wanted a couple of days off before Christmas. Or, and let's be honest, the most true reason, the seasoned former Real Madrid midfielder knew he needed to bring down Marcus Tavernier as he lined up a shot from the edge of the box. Unfortunately for Casemiro, he was booked, is banned for the trip to Villa Park, and Tavernier scored anyway.",
      "His ban should do what Mainoo's brother, a former Love Island contestant, is apparently desperate to see: Free Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "But if it doesn't and Ruben Amorim elects to call upon another - perhaps Manuel Ugarte - and the 20-year-old England midfielder is not given his first Premier League start of the season on Sunday, then he really has to push for a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Of course, the club's hierarchy are under no obligation at all to let Mainoo go - whether Amorim has him in his next starting line-up or not. And Mainoo's contract is relatively modest by United's standards, not a drain on finances and still has 18 months left to run.",
      "The player is keen to get more game time as he pushes for a World Cup spot. But, harsh as this may well be, that's irrelevant to Amorim and United.",
      "Make no mistake, the rest of the season is huge to the United boss. It could make or break his Old Trafford tenure. United don't have European commitments after last season's horror and frankly there are no excuses if United fail to secure a Champions League place for next season. None at all.",
      "Thus, if Amorim feels Mainoo - in any way, shape or form - can help him get United there, then he is perfectly entitled to keep him. Some of us now believe a parting of the ways would be best, as Amorim clearly wants something in his midfield that he doesn't believe the England international can do for him.",
      "But even it's that's true, then if Amorim wants to keep him at the club, Mainoo must simply get on with it.",
      "However, what he could really do without is his brother's T-shirt sideshow.",
      "It has nothing to do with the player himself, let’s get that straight. No-one could question Mainoo’s professionalism. Absolutely not. No-one could accuse Mainoo of feeling he is entitled to a regular starting place. Absolutely not.",
      "Some do, however. Mainoo's brother is not alone in that regard. But his actions don't help. Mainoo needs to prove himself to his manager, who is going nowhere.",
      "Last season, Amorim started Mainoo 12 times in the Premier League. United lost eight. They won only two. Of those two wins, United trailed Southampton 1-0 at half-time when Amorim hauled off Mainoo. United won 3-1.",
      "In his last six Premier League starts United have lost five and drawn one. His performance on Monday night was good enough, but he didn't stand out - and while United fought back to lead 4-3, it was Bournemouth who finished stronger and looked more likely winners before the final whistle blew.",
      "There are no obvious signs of Amorim keeping Mainoo on the fringes because he is not convinced about his character - no matter what Paul Scholes and other hypercritical pundits say. Quite simply, Amorim isn't convinced Mainoo is one of his best midfield options and thus doesn't play him.",
      "That might seem odd to those of use who watched his emergence, where his maturity and composure stood out. But right now, Amorim's is the view that matters.",
      "Hopefully, his brother's T-shirt stunt doesn't see Mainoo cop any flak. But he now needs to roll up his sleeves and prove his worth to his manager.",

      "Ruben Amorim said Manchester United's dazzling attacking display against Bournemouth had inspired their fans after the two teams combined to deliver the game of the Premier League season at Old Trafford. United produced one of their best attacking performances under Amorim, with 25 shots and a string of stylish moves as Amorim tinkered with his system and saw more players getting into positions around the opposition penalty area.",
      "The vibrancy came with risks at the back, however, and after Bournemouth made it 4-4 with six minutes to go, they threatened to win the game three times in added time, with Senne Lammens rescuing United. It was a wild and chaotic game and ultimately one United should have won, although Amorim was keen to take the positives from a performance he felt was in keeping with the club's ethos.",
      "\"If you understand a little bit, if you follow the club like I follow Premier League for so long, you have not just the duty to try to win the games, but the way you try to win the games is so important for the fans,\" he said.",
      "\"They are desperate to win, but they are also, I feel that they are desperate to be inspired when they come to Old Trafford. Today was inspiring, I think also because of Bournemouth, but in the end, that's the feeling of frustration not winning the game.\"",
      "Only Manchester City (38) have scored more than United's 30 Premier League goals this season and their attack has been transformed by a £215million summer spending spree on Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "Amorim feels that has made his team more watchable but he knows they can't sacrifice defensive quality at the altar of scoring more goals.",
      "\"I think people enjoy more to see Manchester United this season, but we need to put both things together,\" he said. \"Sometimes closing the games is so important to give different issues to everything that we did really well. \"",
      "United have made a habit of throwing away leads recently and they led three times against the Cherries, but Amorim rejected the idea that it was a mentality issue affecting his team.",
      "\"It's understanding of the moments of the game, understanding that a lot of goals, it's after half-time, we need to start the second half in a different way,\" he said.",
      "\"So it's everything together, it's not a mentality thing, it's the understanding of the game and how to play the game in different moments.\"",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has hogged the spotlight this week, having first revealed in a bombshell interview with Portuguese outlet Canal 11 that Manchester United “wanted me to go” in the summer when Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal came sniffing for a potential £100m transfer.",
      "Now, Man Utd‘s captain has sat down with a self-proclaimed “man of the people” to discuss his Old Trafford career in what has been billed as ‘his most honest interview yet’ on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.",
      "To save you from having to sit through the whole thing, we thought we would pick out the five best bits from the in-depth interview, which includes the “two times” Fernandes could have left Man Utd, the “six players” in Ruben Amorim’s “leadership group” and how he reacts to criticism from Roy Keane and other pundits…",
      "",
      "“For me, it’s like, even like when someone criticises me, I look at it. If I see something that someone said about me, about my game, he’s not very good at this, he’s not doing very well at this.",
      "“I go and look at that because obviously, even more for me, when it’s from ex-players, I think I look at it and say like, OK, they’ve played the game, they’ve seen the game.",
      "“Let’s see if what they’re saying can help me to improve my game. When you guys, probably when you speak well about me, I try not to overlook that because I think as a human being, not as a player, as a human being, you tend to be like relaxed, like, oh my God, look at this.",
      "“And obviously we know, as I said before, we talk about legends of the club, legends of the game, not just normal players.",

      "“And for us, you don’t talk in a bad way to us. But the problem is, for the perspective of the stadium, it’s bad. It looks bad on us because you’re waving your arms, you’re moving your arms.",
      "“Even when we talk like this, like close to the referee, I’m moving my arms, he’s like, Bruno, just put your arms down. We can talk, we can talk, but put your arms down.",
      "“Because they know, the thing of me doing this, this, this, like the people in the stadium, they don’t know what I’m saying to the referee.",
      "“I could say like, yeah, it was a good decision, but there you missed that. And they go like, Bruno, you’re telling a good thing, but people outside are thinking that you’re screaming and going crazy at me.”",

      "“We have a leadership group. That is me, Harry [Maguire], Licha [Lisandro Martinez], Tom [Tom Heaton], Mazraoui [Noussair Mazraoui], and Diogo [Dalot]. We have six players.",
      "“But obviously, we then add players in the situation that are not in the leadership group, like Casemiro, Luke Shaw, because we also want players with big responsibilities to have a say.",
      "“But obviously, we always try these six players to, OK, guys, this is the way we want to have, where we want to be, what we want to do. And from that six, the message has to be clear for everyone else.",
      "“We have to become a little bit of a bigger personality than the other ones, because we need to make the rules clear for everyone. But that’s not just me.",
      "“It’s the leadership group that has to put a stamp in place, like, guys, this is what we’re going to do and mandatory for us.",
      "“This is the way, the path and what we have to have to play at this club.”",
      "",
      "“When I came to the club, apart from loving being here and loving the club, I think my loyalty was like in the toughest periods I had the club and I could have left in two times. I said, the club said, no, we need you. And I said, OK. You gave me something. I will give you something.",
      "“Obviously, I think the time at the club has not been as I wanted because obviously, I wanted to lift trophies and I haven’t lifted as many as I should and I could.",
      "“But at the same time, I think everything I’ve done for the club in a certain way was still very important and not taking anything away from other players that were here and everything. I think when we struggled the most, I stayed present to the club and I think everyone at the club, I hope is aware of that because the chances I had were very good.",
      "“So I’m very aware that I could have done a different path. I could have gone in a different way and probably winning more trophies and people talking about me in a different way because I’ve had trophies into my cabinet.

      "Man Utd have chosen Manuel Ugarte as the player they want to ‘sacrifice’ in January in order to bring in new players, according to reports.",

      "Only four teams scored fewer goals in the Premier League last season and Man Utd invested most of their summer cash into their forward line with Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko arriving.",
      "Many fans and former players were disappointed that Man Utd didn’t manage to bring in a midfielder with the position an obvious area for improvement after last season.",

      "READ: Man Utd kids have ‘reactionary hissy fits’ after Mainoo brother ‘tantrum’",
      "However, there may have to be some outgoings too with Spanish website Fichajes insisting that Man Utd ‘have decided to take drastic measures to shape their squad according to Ruben Amorim’s demands.’",
      "Ugarte has been chosen as a ‘sacrifice’ for January and Man Utd ‘have decided to look for a way out’ for the Uruguay international this winter.",
      "The ‘absolute priority is to give the midfield a different dynamic’ with it ‘imperative to lighten the current squad, and therefore they are looking to offload the Uruguayan midfielder’.",
      "Ugarte has started just two Premier League matches this season with French side Nice keen to do a deal for the 24-year-old ahead of January.",
      "The report adds: ‘OGC Nice, a club with strong institutional ties through INEOS, appears to be the leading candidate to acquire the Uruguayan midfielder on loan. This move would allow Manchester United to free up a strategic roster spot and reduce their wage bill, enabling them to make an immediate impact signing this winter. Amorim is looking for a specific profile that can integrate into his characteristic double pivot and rotate with figures of the calibre of Casemiro. Manuel Ugarte’s situation reflects the urgent need for changes in a midfield that has shown a lack of pace in recent defensive transitions.’",
      "Fichajes continues: ‘Negotiations are expected to intensify after the holiday period, with the aim of bringing in the new signing in the first few days of next year. Manuel Ugarte ‘s departure would financially facilitate a transfer that the Red fans are demanding to stabilize a squad that has suffered too many setbacks.’",
      "Elliot Anderson could be the answer to their midfield issues but the £100m-rated Nottingham Forest player is much more likely to happen in the summer.",
      "Former Premier League striker Marlon Harewood insists that Anderson would “definitely” be worth his huge price tag.",
      "When asked if Forest have a fight on their hands to keep the England international, Harewood told Goal: “Yes, massively. I’m actually really surprised that Newcastle let him go. But with all the fair play and everything that is going on with the rules and regulations, it was good for Forest to get him in the squad.",
      "“He has really excelled. He has become one of the true Premier League midfielders that you can see go on and excel and do well. Yes, Forest will do well to keep him. If they keep him for the rest of the season it would be good, but I can see people coming in for him in January.”",
      "When asked whether the Man Utd target was worth the £100m quoted, Harewood added: “He is definitely one of those players. If someone said that and put that price tag, with the money that’s going on in the game over the last couple of years, he is definitely worth the price tag and I think he will go on and do really well at whatever club he is at.",

That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",

Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but three wins from three before going toe-to-toe against champions elect Arsenal despite playing most of the game down to 10 men appeared to have rubber-stamped Chelsea’s bona fides.",
      "And then they lost to Leeds United. Which was largely Maresca’s fault. And then continued their self-fulfilling 2024-redux tumble out of the title race with a draw against Bournemouth. Sigh.",

He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A pair of subsequent wins cool the immediate temperatures but it does all feel extremely precarious.",

      "So doomed now they might as well stick with Edwards for a bit. He’s only just got here. And they really did play well at Arsenal, despite the late heartbreak.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. We don’t know, but we’d certainly contend he’s unlucky to be second favourite at this time on current form.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options that prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad, and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford at the weekend, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more convincing.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",

      "We’re all another month closer to the grave and that cheery start means it’s time for another update of the Mood Rankings.",
      "Aston Villa are pretty happy and Tottenham are very miserable. No shocks there, but between those two lurk many thousands of words and all human emotions.",
      "Last month’s rankings are in brackets, and the full reasonings can be read/mocked here.",
      "It’s a familiar yet unfamiliar feeling for an increasingly unmoored Spurs. Events of the last six or seven months really have discombobulated everyone.",
      "They won a trophy, which feels weird. They sacked a manager, which doesn’t. But then they sacked the man who sacked the manager, and we’re back to weird.",
      "Watching Thomas Frank struggle desperately to find acceptable answers to the impossible Tottenham question is nothing we haven’t seen before. He may even have had his Nuno Moment with those resignation-letter substitutions in the capitulation at Forest.",
      "What’s different is that while Tottenham fans increasingly know they don’t want Frank, there’s a lot less clarity than usual about what they do want, who they want to do it, and most importantly of all perhaps: who’s to blame for the mess.",
      "That’s the big change. Daniel Levy’s role as lightning rod for fan anger should not be underestimated. With him out of the picture, nobody knows where to direct their ire. Is it too much to suggest the boos that rained down so infamously on Guglielmo Vicario against Fulham would in previous years have perhaps been aimed in more familiar fashion at the directors’ box?",
      "We’ve said before that we no longer even know what success even looks like for Spurs this season, but it’s increasingly obvious that it definitely isn’t this. Frank’s version of Spurs have achieved something that you’d think impossible without real concerted effort: as moribund as Mourinho’s team in attack, as leaky and error-prone as Postecoglou’s in defence.",
      "He might be given a bit longer, but it seems rather pointless. It’s impossibly hard to visualise him turning this around.",
      "But that only raises the further question of who could turn this around, and compelling answers to that lie thin on the ground.",
      "To add to the disorienting lack of familiar things to grab on to in this otherwise all-too familiar Tottenham scenario, there isn’t even Ryan Mason around these days to take the caretaker reins.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "",
      "Every Moods has a decisive ‘A month really is a long time, eh?’ moment, and already so early we have it.",
      "A mid-table Mood Ranking back in November reflected a situation that had them reaching the third international break outside the bottom three, which already seems like a nonsense idea.",
      "There was a note of caution even then, mind, with the observation that Forest and West Ham might have already put their silliest spells of the season behind them.",
      "That appears even more to be the case now, while also applying to Leeds to some extent. Even Fulham.",
      "Burnley, for their part, have picked up not one single Premier League point since the last update. It’s easy to see where one worse team than them might come from, but increasingly difficult to see where either of the other two they require might be found.",
      "READ: Ten Premier League predictions before 2026 features three sackings",
      "",
      "There is seething, righteous anger at what has been allowed to happen to the club over the last few years, but in terms now of this season specifically it actually could be worse.",
      "If you’re going to get relegated – and Wolves are going to get relegated – then you might as well do it without taunting your poor long-suffering fans with futile, nagging hope.",
      "It is the cruellest and most mischievous of all emotions, and say what you like about everything Wolves have or haven’t done this season, you cannot argue they have been so cruel as to allow even the tiniest crumb of hope to fester and gnaw away at the fans.",
      "And are they grateful? No. Just no pleasing them, is there?",
      "Still, for all the obvious nihilistic benefits of allowing hopelessness to wash over you, it might still be an idea to at least get themselves past Derby at some point.",
      "",
      "Our worry for West Ham is that the Liverpool game at the end of November will be the one that looks like a massive moment in their season.",
      "Liverpool were at their lowest ebb coming into that one. West Ham, on the other hand, came into it on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw at Bournemouth.",
      "They were scoring goals, and getting results. For the first time all season, they looked like a viable, functioning Premier League team.",
      "Then Nuno decide thoroughly out-Nuno himself. Instead of making any attempt to strike at a wounded Liverpool, they rolled over meekly and accepted a fate that really need not have looked so inevitable.",
      "They’re not doomed, but they have tossed away hard-won momentum that may not return. The timing of that is compounded by coming alongside significant signs of live at both Leeds and Nottingham Forest, and to an extent Fulham, have left West Ham again looking among the most likely relegated trio at this time.",
      "That they are very much only the third most likely of that trio is cold comfort.",
      "",
      "We understand all the reasons why Eddie Howe isn’t currently under pressure.",
      "He delivered some of the most long-awaited silverware in the land to Newcastle last season, in a competition they may yet successfully defend this season which would be a good bit after such an absurdly long barren spell. And he also delivered Champions League football again. The summer shambles that befell Newcastle was not in any way his fault.",
      "And he is above all an English manager of the Spoke Well, I Thought school who looks like he listens to and carefully transcribes every single episode of the High Performance Podcast so he can really drink in all the valuable life lessons contained within at his leisure later.",
      "Which an awful lot of the press pack in this country think is correct and good behaviour. They like Howe, who has no dubious foreign ways, speaks to them politely if with those eerie dead eyes of his, and there’s also clearly a lucrative ghost-writing deal for his autobiography out there for someone at some point down the line.",
      "So yeah, we get all the reasons why the Newcastle boat remains so entirely unrocked.",
      "But also aren’t they really quite sh*t? Like far, far sh*tter than it’s remotely necessary or acceptable for them to be in their Champions League-and-Saudi era? They are quite literally as bad as Tottenham, and Howe doesn’t even have Thomas Frank’s flimsy ‘I’m new here and this club is batsh*t’ excuse. And Frank is under immense pressure now.",
      "Yet there’s Eddie Howe, just carrying on, his team showing desperately little fight and almost zero bottle in going down to a tame defeat in the first Premier League Tyne-Wear Derby in nearly a decade.",
      "That’s not really acceptable is it, surely?",
      "They really shouldn’t be as bad as this, stumbling along at the back of a deeply mediocre mid-table peloton, seemingly incapable of stitching together the kind of run that would get them out of there.",
      "We’re not asking for Aston Villa-style ridiculousness here, but it does seem reasonable to think they shouldn’t be getting left behind by Brighton or Everton. Or most pointedly Sunderland, who now sit four points clear of their local rivals.",
      "There’s a couple more things that explain the apparent lack of panic at Newcastle. That mid-table is awfully congested. Villa have already sauntered clean through it and out the other side. Everton had a little go at being fifth. Man United have been sixth here and there.",
      "Feels like that’s a dangerous mindset that could easily lead a daft big club into trouble, but it’s also reasonable to be less bent out of shape about being 12th when the top five is four points away rather than 10.",
      "The other thing is that the fact there is absolutely no peril or jeopardy in the Champions League now – we designed it that way – means Newcastle are in no danger of messing that up in the way they ultimately (if slightly unfortunately) did a couple of years ago. They’ve hit the odd wrinkle, but still sit four points above the generous 24th-place cut line with two games to go.",
      "We still can’t quite shake the sense, though, that Newcastle are having really quite a bad season, one that reinforces the growing idea that they can’t put two good seasons together and compete on all fronts, and nobody seems to be losing their sh*t about it.",
      "That’s no good at all. We thought this was Modern Football with all its instant gratification and baying for blood.",
      "What’s going on here?",
      "",
      "You do feel that at some point the wind is going to change and Bournemouth will be stuck permanently in one of their two guises. The key will be whether that’s the Champions League-form or relegation-form versions of Bournemouth. Because they really are never anything else.",
      "Their first nine games of this season brought five wins, three draws and a solitary defeat at Liverpool which was way back in the before times when nobody realised that was actually quite bad.",
      "Their seven subsequent Premier League games have delivered no wins and four defeats.",
      "The possible good news is that draws with Chelsea and Man United that currently sit in the ‘relegation form’ section could yet in fact be the start of another ‘Champions League form’ run.",
      "With Burnley and Brentford up next, we’ll know more by year’s end.",
      "",
      "Riding high in November on the back of a brilliant win over Newcastle, but it’s been a distinctly bump-based return to earth since then.",
      "The Newcastle game was the third in a brilliant triptych of autumn home wins also featuring Man United and Liverpool, and even now it’s still going far better for the Bees than many (let’s be honest here: we) expected and there is still some distance between them and the real strugglers.",
      "But not the distance there once was. They’ve won only once in the last month, and that was against Burnley which is mandatory anyway. Tricky away games at Brighton and Arsenal have gone as you might expect, but there really is no excuse for anyone losing a league game at Spurs this season. Not even Wolves did that.",
      "A home draw with Leeds represents a missed chance to put more distance between themselves and trouble, and they’re now out of the Carabao as well.",
      "We don’t wish to paint too gloomy a picture, but this is a team we ranked fifth last time out.",
      "Still, though: it’s not all bad news: Wolves next. The ultimate Christmas present.",
      "",
      "Have inexplicably and incredibly irritatingly spent a second consecutive December talking themselves out of the title race for absolutely no good reason. Truly maddening stuff, especially on the back of fighting so, so hard to prove exactly why they could compete for the title in that 10-man draw with Arsenal – which was the same week they dismantled Barcelona in the Champions League.",
      "Have stumbled in that competition as well with defeat to Atalanta leaving them likely facing the unwanted hassle of the play-off round.",
      "Chelsea have reached the semi-finals of the Carabao, although presumably Enzo Maresca thinks it’s just plain daft to talk about them maybe winning it when so many other good teams are involved.",
      "",
      "Tentatively encouraging signs, on the field at least. They played well in Champions League victory at Inter before a solid home win over Brighton. Their next two league games are at Tottenham, which generally proves to be a lift for Liverpool spirits and absolutely should do this time, and then at home to Wolves.",
      "Every chance they hit 2026 on a four-game winning run and then an instant chance to kick off the new year by putting right what went wrong at Leeds the other week.",
      "And with absolutely no off-field drama whatsoever to worry themselves with, it’s all looking far rosier than it did even a couple of weeks ago, never mind at the time of the last Moods.",
      "",
      "We didn’t really expect Daniel Farke to still be here for this update. Leeds had lost four of their previous five Premier League games at that point and were heading into an absolutely brutal run of games: Villa, City, Chelsea, Liverpool.",
      "They duly lost the first two, but then took four points from a pair of riotously encouraging and potentially season-turning performances against Chelsea and Liverpool. Then followed that up with a point at Brentford, which is an absolutely acceptable result for pretty much anyone there; it’s more than Man United, Liverpool or Newcastle have managed there already this season.",
      "They remain under serious and obvious threat of relegation, but to be approaching the halfway stage of the season on an apparent upward curve, outside the bottom three and with the same manager they began the season with? It’s not too bad at all.",
      "",
      "Here’s what we said a month ago:",
      "Proving to be the most gloriously mid-table team imaginable, achieving that middle-of-the-road outcome via the most outlandish means possible.",
      "And a month later… here we still are. They have now, sadly, lost the dream of going through the entire season without having the same result in consecutive games – last month’s wins over Brentford and Forest put paid to that.",
      "But that is still the only time it’s happened to Brighton all season. A team that has beaten four of last season’s top seven already this season remain determined to have it count for as little as possible. And we respect that.",
      "In a congested mid-table built on endless shifts and flux, one where all positions between fifth and 14th seem to be handed out at random week by week, Brighton are 10th and it feels like they are always 10th. Seems churlish, considering that, to put them anywhere other than that here.",
      "",
      "Really did look like they were going to do something quite silly and bin Marco Silva for a while there. It would have been a catastrophic misjudgement. Fulham and Silva is one of those combinations that just works. Neither would be as good without the other; both should think long and hard before even considering the temptation to look elsewhere.",
      "The end of the Carabao adventure is a disappointment for a club who have seen peers claim silverware recently but three league wins in the last five – and a stirring if ultimately not quite successful comeback against City – have at least quietened the noise suggesting they might be about to do something stupid.",
      "In our best Mark Lawrenson voice: They’ll be fine.",
      "",
      "A month ago we demanded to be told whether Man United are good now, or what. Still none the wiser, frankly.",
      "The mood at Manchester United has definitely shifted over the last couple of months, but – as with the team itself – we’d stop some way short of calling it a good mood.",
      "Indeed, that is the very crux of the current problem for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United.",
      "They are no longer utterly, humiliatingly mortifying. That deep sense of embarrassment at being just so profoundly sh*t that United felt throughout last season and into the start of this one has now dissipated.",
      "The stain of finishing where they finished last season and bottling a cup final against a Tottenham – Tottenham! – side apparently being player-managed on the fly by Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven will never truly come off. And nor should it.",
      "You don’t have to be This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About for that to be an unacceptable season. There can exist no mitigation that justifies finishing 15th and collecting fewer league wins than a Wolves team now making a historic attempt at knocking Derby County off their f*cking perch.",
      "That shame will always be there. Grimsby will always be there.",
      "But it’s fair to say now that those very darkest days do appear to be behind United. Things still aren’t perfect by any stretch. At almost any other period of United’s Premier League history their current effort would be a poor one, and that itself is part of the problem for anyone trying to turn this ship around.",
      "Even after the historic lows of last season even the significant current improvement doesn’t constitute success.",
      "And herein lies the ongoing niggle. United are now at the very least competent. That doesn’t sound like much, and it isn’t, but it’s a huge step up from last season. Competence is welcome at this stage.",
      "But with it have already come some extremely irritating missed opportunities. Last year’s incompetence may have only slightly dampened expectations, with the club’s own stated aims for this season a nine-place leap into the top six, but it has handed United another advantage.",
      "It’s not the advantage any club of United’s stature wants, but the absence altogether of any European football – with the Grimsby debacle almost eliminating midweek football altogether – offers United benefits that none of their theoretical rivals can enjoy.",
      "And they just keep refusing to fully accept those chances. They have dragged themselves towards the top of the mid-table peloton but they really could have got themselves into something approaching Villa’s current situation.",
      "United have only lost once in seven Premier League games since the start of November, but it’s a run riddled with annoyance and frustration.",
      "The defeat was a ludicrous one, at home against a good-not-great Everton side who handed United an absurd early advantage by friendly-firing themselves down to 10 men.",
      "And the other six games in that run have all been against distinctly beatable opponents. The league positions for the seven teams at the time United played them were 18th, 6th, 13th, 5th, 17th, 20th and 13th.",
      "The sixth-placed team was Tottenham, who we now know to be more rubbish than that, and the fifth-placed one was Palace, who United beat. The only other win was against the team in 20th, who we don’t think we need identify by name.",
      "In the last seven weeks United have drawn four games against opposition of bottom-half standard. And they have been in front in every single one of those games. In three of them they have led going into the final 10 minutes.",
      "Sure, at Spurs they ended up salvaging a point in the last seconds but only after throwing away a winning position with six minutes of regular time remaining.",
      "West Ham equalised on 83 minutes at Old Trafford, and Bournemouth 84 in a game United had already led twice and trailed once before getting their noses in front with 11 minutes to go.",
      "And such is the congested nature of the league table that these spaffed points really, really hurt. They have had so many chances now to get themselves into the (likely) Champions League places and every time they seem to sabotage themselves, very often infuriatingly late on in games.",
      "Ifs and buts are candy and nuts, but when the table is so tight it is impossible to resist thinking about what might have been. There is a compelling case to make that United could have won every single one of their last seven league games, which is good. Instead, they have won only two.",
      "Even turning two of the five failures into the wins United really should have managed would be enough to have them in top four now. You might even, if you wanted to be entirely reckless, talk about them being on the fringes of the title race.",
      "Instead: there they still are in the mid-table bunch, still having to worry every bit as much about what’s behind them as ahead of them, still in danger of slipping right back into mid-table should they stumble again.",
      "So yes; it’s much better than it was. But what it was, was complete turd. At the moment they’re still doing little more than polishing it.",
      "",
      "A couple of vaguely alarming home defeats to the Manchester clubs are mood-dampeners, but the main thing keeping all things from being deliriously cheery for Palace is the long-term future of Oliver Glasner.",
      "It is the way of the world and Palace fans know their place in it. He will not be there for much longer but wonderful things have happened – and in a way entirely sustainable if they get the next appointment anywhere near as correct as this one – and continue to happen.",
      "Never mind what comes next for now. Palace are competing in the top six of the Premier League and on cup fronts European and domestic. They have never known days like these.",
      "",
      "Phew. Dycheball is doing the necessary, and then some. Let us never speak of Angeball and the most predictable Premier League disaster of all time ever again.",
      "",
      "Is it happening again? It does feel like it might be happening again. We’re not even really sure Arsenal have done a lot wrong. But you can entirely understand The Fear after a run of iffy away results and then a truly honking if still somehow just about good/lucky enough performance against Wolves.",
      "It says a lot about that performance that escaping with a last-gasp win when not playing well is usually your classic Hallmark of Champions territory. But Arsenal were so bad, so panicky when 1-0 up at home against what may yet go down as the worst Premier League team in history it actually became what might be the first in an entirely new genre: a match win that makes you less likely to win the title.",
      "That seems silly. Even as we write it, it seems silly. But it felt true at the time, and doubly so after especially Man City but even Aston Villa with another come-from-behind special recorded far more impressive wins from far tougher assignments the following day.",
      "A weekend that ended up ‘as you were’ on paper didn’t really feel that way in the gut.",
      "We’re not saying anything is f*cked for the league leaders who still have the best team and squad in the league, but surely everyone involved will feel a little more comfortable if they can quite swiftly find a convincing league performance.",
      "And their next few games are ticklish. Everton away is a funny one, because some teams – even crap ones – have found it very easy there and others absolutely have not, while after that it’s Brighton. You never know what to expect from Brighton but they can be extremely mischievous when put up against one of the bigger boys.",
      "And then it’s Aston Villa again. Hmm.",
      "",
      "We were very, very harsh on Everton in the last update. What we were cross about was that we wanted Everton be lots of fun this season and they’d only been quite fun. It was childish of us.",
      "But listen, fair play. Everton have taken it on board. Since that update they’ve gone down to 10 men in the opening minutes at Old Trafford after a fight between two of their own players and still gone on to win. In consecutive home games they’ve been beaten 4-1 and then won 3-0.",
      "They are in absolutely no danger of relegation, and at one point for a brief time even jumped up to fifth place in the table to the widespread delight and wide-eyed surprise of all.",
      "This is what we wanted from Everton in their first season at the Hill Dickinson. Plenty of fun, and no real existential drama or stress. They are now firmly on course.",
      "",
      "If the 24/25 season had an overriding theme it was the ending of trophy droughts.",
      "Crystal Palace won the first major silverware in their history. Newcastle won their first trophy that wasn’t in, well, black and white and even Tottenham ended the most discussed trophy drought of all, in the most Tottenham way imaginable and have since sacked or moved on almost everyone involved in such a hideously off-brand endeavour.",
      "But there was another story rumbling along in the background of all this drought-ending catharsis and joy. And it might have been, in its own roundabout way, just as necessary.",
      "For while all those droughts were ending, something almost as unthinkable was happening in Manchester: Guardiola and City won absolutely nothing unless you count the Community Shield which you absolutely should not. That is just not how things are supposed to be these days.",
      "It was City and Guardiola’s first trophyless season since his very first in England back in 20216/17. And it really might have been just what City needed.",
      "It’s not that there was massive complacency. Certainly older City supporters need no reminding that what they’ve experienced over the last decade is not normal, not Typical City.",
      "But for younger fans it was a more unusual experience; even in the years before Pep turned City into English football’s dominant force there was still success on a scale most clubs never experience ever in their history.",
      "Between 2010/11 and 2014/15, City won two league titles and finished second twice as well as an FA Cup and League Cup. And that was the bit before the gold rush.",
      "Since Guardiola’s arrival, City have won six more league titles, a Champions League, four Carabaos, a couple of FA Cups, A UEFA Super Cup and a Club World Cup.",
      "It is a lot of stuff. Even the most well-adjusted fanbase is going to get a bit blasé about it. How could you not? It’s inevitable.",
      "But a year of going without – especially one like 24/25 where City didn’t even really mount any kind of meaningful challenge for the two top honours – can have a reinvigorating effect.",
      "It certainly seems to have done so for Guardiola himself, who last season often appeared to have grown entirely weary of the whole thing. There were long spells where it wouldn’t have surprised us at all to hear he’d decided to leave in the summer a la Klopp. We’re certain he contemplated it.",
      "But now he’s got the scent in his nostrils again. He’s got a new-look team. It’s not quite as precise and efficient a machine as his very best City teams but in its way all the more charming for that.",
      "Above all, he’s once again caught up in the thrill of the chase. Worth remembering that after back-to-back early-season defeats to Spurs and Brighton it felt entirely reasonable to wonder whether City, so dominant so recently, would once again have to settle for the role of mere spectator and occasional agitator in the title race.",
      "They still don’t fully convince us. They still don’t quite have that look of champions about them. But that might be the most exciting thing of all; that for all the doubts, for all their flaws, for all the uncertainty, there they sit, right on the shoulders of Arsenal.",
      "Both these teams have been here before. Both know how that played out.",
      "City and their trophy-hoarding manager can smell blood in the water and are suddenly right up for this.",
      "Sometimes it really can be the ground left fallow for a year that proves the most fertile.",
      "",
      "A team that probably shouldn’t even have got promoted – they finished 24 points behind Leeds and Burnley and even 14 behind Sheffield United having ended the regular season in horror form – now absolutely ripping it up in the Premier League? Wonderful.",
      "First things first, they (although we must acknowledge Wolves’ selfless assist here) have already pretty much guaranteed we won’t be seeing the three promoted teams go straight back down which is a hugely welcome development. And if the three promoted teams do now all go down, then, well, we’re in for a truly astonishing second half of the season anyway so that’s also fine.",
      "More likely, though, is that Sunderland continuing knocking about in the rarefied top-half air they currently breathe. Even if they don’t in fact end up level on points with Liverpool and separated only on goals scored when the music finally stops in May.",
      "There are all sorts of ambitions you could reasonably have for the remainder of Sunderland’s season. They could definitely qualify for Europe, for instance, which would be a spectacular bit of work.",
      "Our goal for them is, inevitably, more mischief-based. We want them to reach 59 points. Why 59? Because it’s the sum total the three promoted teams Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton managed last season.",
      "At present speed and course, Sunderland get 61 points. We are watching, and hoping that AFCON doesn’t blast too big a hole in our dreams and/or Sunderland’s season before the next update.",

      "Fernandes had lots of interest from the Saudi Pro League over the summer transfer window with rumours of offers up to £100m for the Man Utd star.",
      "In the interview, Fernandes said: “Nowadays, the issue of loyalty is no longer seen the way it used to be. I could have left in the last transfer window and would have earned a lot more money. Financially, it would have been much better for me.",
      "“At one point I was going to leave – I won’t say where – but I would have won many trophies that season. I decided to stay not only for family reasons but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the coach also made me stay.",
      "“But from the club’s side, I felt a bit of: ‘If you go, it’s not really that bad for us.’ That hurts me a little. More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.",

      "And Wright has insisted that he would take Fernandes at Arsenal if the Man Utd captain was to leave Old Trafford in the next couple of transfer windows.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap, Wright said: “When you look at Bruno’s quotes, it comes back to Man United being indecisive. So someone comes in for Bruno Fernandes last summer… you shut that down.",
      "“He didn’t want to go. Bruno is basically saying the club went, ‘it’s up to you if you want to leave’. That’s not what you want to hear when you’re the person who has basically held the club up by yourself.",

      "“They gave him the option and said, ‘if you want to go, you can go’. What is that saying to him? I would take him tomorrow.”",
      "There are now rumours that Fernandes could leave in the next couple of transfer windows and talkSPORT insist that the feeling in the Man Utd dressing room is that his interview ‘may be paving the way for his Old Trafford departure’.",

      "The Brazilian was a catastrophic signing and Man Utd will be lucky to get £15m for him if he is put up for sale…is what we wrote before an amazing loan spell at Real Betis. In the end he exited for less than £22m and United felt lucky to get that.",
      "",
      "After signing Benjamin Sesko, United froze Hojlund out against his will. We feel sorry for him, but scoring four goals in 32 matches last season after costing over £60m is unacceptable. He’s doing a little better back in Serie A with Lazio.",
      "",
      "Joining off the back of a man-of-the-match performance in a Champions League final, Di Maria flopped at Old Trafford. The only saving grace from his stint in Manchester is that the club recouped £56.7m when he was sold to PSG less than a year after arriving.",

      "",
      "Fellaini was the first signing post-Ferguson after David Moyes bought him on deadline day for a higher price than the release clause that was active earlier in the window. He made 177 appearances for the Red Devils before leaving for Shandong Taishan in 2019.",
      "",
      "Martial joined as the most expensive teenager in world football, scored a wonderful goal on his debut and was being compared to Thierry Henry. He scored 17 goals in 32 Premier League matches in 19/20 and looked like he was coming of age. After that terrific year, he looked slow and poor in front of goal.",
      "After an underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla, Ten Hag gave Martial another chance with his fitness letting him down. He eventually joined AEK Athens on a free transfer.",
      "",
      "Wan-Bissaka was one of Erik ten Hag’s biggest success stories at Man Utd. The right-back enjoyed a very productive 22/23 campaign but was never able to usurp Diogo Dalot and his transfer fee will always look very silly.",
      "",
      "Varane failed to convince everyone that he is in fact a four-time Champions League winner in his time at Old Trafford. Injuries absolutely did not help but what a disappointment he was.",
      "The Frenchman joined Cesc Fabregas’ Como and swiftly retired after suffering another serious injury.",
      "",
      "As far as back-up goalkeepers go, Romero was pretty good. And he cost bugger all, which is always a bonus.",

      "",
      "It is hilarious how high Evans is here. Genuinely astounding.",

      "Ajax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United. Matthijs de Ligt has an impressive CV. An impressive CV is one thing, performing on the pitch is another. So far, so average.",

      "He is comfortably the best signing made in the summer of 2024. Low bar, mind.",
      "",
      "As far as half-season emergency loans go, this was a success. Ten Hag decided against signing Sabitzer on a permanent basis. Silly man.",
      "",
      "Competent. And that really is enough.",
      "",
      "Not quite delivered numbers-wise in the early part of 2025/26, but he has fire. And in a sea of sometimes looking like they don’t give a sh*t, that counts for something.",
      "",
      "David Moyes’ second major signing after Fellaini, Mata joined from Chelsea with high expectations. The Spaniard played 285 times for the Red Devils, with game time hard to come from the start of 20/21 up until his departure in June 2022.",
      "",
      "A few years ago Fred was in the same bracket as Lukaku, Pogba, and others as the big-money flops. But the Brazilian midfielder massively improved in his last two years at the club. Still, £53m is steeeeeeep.",
      "",
      "Martinez is a fine footballer who adapted to Premier League life very quickly despite being written off before kicking a ball because of his height. After emerging as the club’s most competent defender, he can’t stay fit.",
      "",
      "The fact that Eriksen cost nothing carries lots of weight. We expected more, but still don’t feel massively underwhelmed.",
      "",
      "He might already be United’s best centre-half.",
      "",
      "Seventeen goals in 39 games in his first season was a great return from a player signed on a free transfer. He was rewarded with a new contract before Man Utd bought Cristiano Ronaldo, which screwed the Uruguayan over.",
      "",
      "Dalot is a pretty inconsistent player. He definitely suits a back four more than he does a back five. So, as long as Amorim’s in charge, his stock will only decrease.",
      "",
      "Immediately looks like a Manchester United player. Which is less of a compliment than it was 20 years ago, but still…",
      "",
      "After a rubbish loan spell with Rangers, Diallo was pretty much written off. However, his Sunderland loan was superb with the young Ivorian increasing his transfer value and staking a claim for minutes in the Premier League.",
      "His transfer fee could rise to £37m, which now looks somewhat reasonable, when it looked frankly ridiculous for a long time.",
      "",
      "Herrera was named Manchester United Fans’ Player of the Season in 2017 after he helped them win the League Cup and Europa League. He played 189 times for the Red Devils and was a fan favourite due to his passion, tireless work rate, and man-marking techniques; just ask Eden Hazard.",
      "",
      "There’s not a lot to say that has not already been said; £13.5m for the most marketable footballer on the planet isn’t too bad at the end of the day. Even if it ended up turning into the biggest circus in world football.",
      "",
      "After spending the whole 2022 summer transfer window chasing Frenkie de Jong, Man Utd realised that Casemiro was available and willing to join.",
      "In his debut season, Casemiro was outstanding and the main reason Ten Hag was able to end the club’s trophy drought and finish third in the Premier League, which is why he is so high here.",
      "In his second season, the Brazilian was awful. He looked remarkably off the pace and Man Utd prayed a Saudi Arabian club would bail them out in the summer.",
      "And then in 2024/25 and now 2025/26, he is one of Amorim’s better players. Funny ol’ game, innit?",
      "",
      "Shaw has had spells where he’s looked like the best left-back in the world, and spells where he’s looked completely hopeless, mainly due to his inability to stay fit. Overall, he’s been a good signing, but the fact he ranks fourth here speaks volumes about United’s woeful transfer business over the last 13 years.",
      "",
      "You might doubt his ability to become a world-class winger, but Garnacho has made United some sumptuous profit. And that’s awful rare for United.",
      "",
      "This is arguably the first signing on this list which was/has been a huge, unqualified success at Old Trafford. It only took 70-odd players to get here but at least we did.",
      "Zlatan scored 28 goals and provided 10 assists in his only full season, helped the Red Devils win the Europa League and scored a brace in the final of the League Cup as they beat Southampton 3-2 at Wembley. In 17/18, he struggled for fitness and left for LA Galaxy, for whom he scored 22 goals in 27 games in the same campaign.",
      "",
      "Although his performances are not as good as they were during the behind-closed-doors days, Bruno Fernandes has been a revelation at Old Trafford. In his first season and a half, Fernandes provided 65 goal contributions in 80 games and was the best player in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side by a country mile.",

      "In an interview he revealed: “The president of Al Hilal spoke to me. He called me directly. Neves sent me a message saying he wanted to talk to me. They wanted him to play in the Club World Cup with Al Hilal. It was a love that started back in the Jorge Jesus days, he had already called me in 2023.”",
      "Fernandes added: “I can’t complain, I’m very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I’ll play in Saudi Arabia.",

I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same.",
      "“But there comes a point where, for them, money is more important than anything. The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision.",
      "“I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’",
      "“It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don’t value the club as much and don’t defend the club as much… that makes you sad.”",

      "Liverpool and Chelsea should be going all out to tempt Crystal Palace and Marc Guehi, while Man Utd should leave Antoine Semenyo to City or Spurs…",
      "The January transfer window is nearly upon us, which means the less-well-run Premier League clubs will be just starting to contemplate what they might need.",
      "For the slackers – and the rest – we’ve pointed towards their most urgent requirement next month…",
      "",
      "Arsenal came out of the summer with perhaps the deepest squad – certainly in terms of quality – in the Premier League, which has come in handy as injuries have mounted. Mikel Arteta says the Gunners are ‘open’ and ‘alert’ to strengthening in January which, if done right, could offer a timely boost as they enter the second half of their title chase.",
      "Where could they use an addition? A dynamic left-sided forward would be lovely, but not easy to source. At the back, it ought to be simpler to add some further cover since Arteta’s rearguard has been stretched by injuries, despite the depth at his disposal.",
      "",
      "Similarly, Villa could benefit from a January boost, especially if they remain among the title contenders, and what they do in January could tell us how serious they are about pushing the likes of Arsenal, City and Chelsea. The summer showed the restrictions Unai Emery and his staff are working under, but if Villa can source an attacker who can play off either flank, like Marcus Rashford last January, then the manager will be keen to do it. Unless over Christmas Jadon Sancho suddenly remembers he’s a footballer. Some cover for Ollie Watkins would be nice too.",
      "Like this? Love F365? Make us one of your preferred sources on Google.",
      "",
      "All the noise around Bournemouth’s window will focus on Antoine Semenyo. If they can get beyond the first fortnight, after which the forward’s £65million release clause becomes inactive, the Cherries will be better placed to rediscover their early-season form through the second half of the campaign. Tyler Adams’ injury is a concern because without the USA international, Andoni Iraola is light on natural defensive midfielders.",
      "",
      "“Yes, I’m sure there’s going to be options that we will look at and look to do in January if we feel it’s right,” said Keith Andrews amid a recent shortage of forwards. The bench against Leeds featured only two attackers with not a Premier League minute between them. Not only have the goals dried up in recent weeks, so too have the shots, with their three lowest performances for xG coming in the last three matches during which they have mustered a total of four shots on target. Losing Dango Ouattara to AFCON won’t help.",
      "",
      "Given the Seagulls generally use the January window to get ahead of the game for the summer, they would have been looking to strengthen at right-back with Joel Veltman, 34 next month and their only recognised full-back on that side, set to be on his way at the end of the season. But Brighton are also looking light at centre-forward, especially in light of Stefanos Tzimas’s season-ending injury.",
      "",
      "On paper, Scott Parker’s squad actually looks quite balanced and there are few areas that immediately look in need of reinforcing. But what it lacks is proven Premier League quality across the board. The Clarets have been competitive but their recent poor run has highlighted weaknesses in moments at both ends. Parker is missing a regular centre-back, central midfielder and centre-forward through AFCON, which does little to suggest their woes will end in time for Christmas. Easier said than done, but an experienced centre-back is a must if they have any realistic hope of improving the second-worst defensive record in the league.",
      "",
      "Despite signing all the players, Chelsea still look light in a few areas. Enzo Maresca needs more from his centre-forwards, with the two bought in the summer, Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, struggling to get going, but a dominant centre-back is more of a priority. What would Palace accept to wave off Marc Guehi half a season early? And, perhaps more to the point, what might Guehi accept to pass up the chance to pick his club in the summer?",
      "",
      "Oliver Glasner wants Palace to use the winter window to ‘correct what we missed in the summer’, with a wide forward and a right wing-back towards the top of his list. Ismaila Sarr’s injury and AFCON call-up gives Glasner the perfect opportunity to highlight how light they are on attacking width, especially on the left.",
      "READ: Five players who will benefit from AFCON absences: Chiesa, Mainoo and more",
      "",
      "David Moyes could use another forward, though Everton should probably stop trying to buy strikers until they have sussed how to sign a good one. The Toffees are also light in both full-back positions, with the right more of a priority than the left. Seamus Coleman, at 37, remains Moyes’ preferred option but the Irishman, inevitably, is creaking, meaning Jake O’Brien and James Garner have had to move across and back from central defence and midfield respectively.",
      "Garner has been very impressive, which might tempt the Toffees to wait until the summer, but the ex-Man Utd midfielder also deserves a chance to show what he can do in his preferred position.",

      "Marco Silva never looks happy but the manager’s mug will be even grumpier if Fulham don’t furnish his squad with reinforcements next month. Silva is particularly light on centre-forwards, with Raul Jiminez carrying the load singlehandedly while Rodrigo Muniz is hamstrung. A midfielder would be nice too.",
      "",
      "Although more pace in the forward line would be ideal, the urgency for a centre-forward isn’t perhaps as great as it was following Daniel Farke’s switch of formation, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Lukas Nmecha pairing up to great effect. Can Farke rely on both stay fit? He might have to gamble if he wants more creativity behind. Of course, it might not be one or the other, but with Leeds, it probably is.",
      "",
      "Antoine Semenyo might be hogging much of the attention, especially while doubts remain over Mo Salah’s willingness to be a team player, but Liverpool’s most dire need is at the centre of their defence. They should have moved more decisively for Marc Guehi in the summer instead of waiting until the final day. They – like Chelsea – have an opportunity to pay for the Palace defender now rather than wait in line when he goes free in the summer. This time, they should grasp it.",
      "",
      "If there is any truth in the reports that Savinho and Oscar Bobb are among the three players most likely to be sold to fund some January strengthening, then Pep Guardiola will be wanting a winger, especially with Jeremy Doku facing a spell on the sidelines. There’s a lad at Bournemouth available for a fair price. A midfielder would be useful too if Rodri’s injuries are likely to persist.",
      "",
      "United can flutter their eyelashes at Semenyo as much as they like but they should be banned from signing anyone until they have recruited a mobile midfielder. Which, no doubt, they will tell us is impossible in January.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe is currently down to two fit senior centre-backs and although injury issues may ease, there is a strong case for adding more quality into the backline. Tino Livramento’s injury on Wednesday night is a huge concern as they could be short at right-back too. They could also use some creativity in attack, which is likely to be harder to source in January.",
      "",
      "Forest are flying right now but Sean Dyche is pushing for reinforcements in his first transfer window in charge, especially while they combine domestic and European commitments. A midfielder is said to be highest on Dyche’s wishlist, which makes sense with Ryan Yates sidelined and Douglas Luiz not pulling up trees at Forest. Ibrahim Sangare will be a miss too during AFCON. Dyche would doubtless like a centre-back, not just because he loves centre-backs, but Forest are short on depth in the middle of their back four.",
      "",
      "Firstly, they need all their half-dozen players back sharpish from AFCON. Then, you could understand the temptation to do very little given the success of their summer activity. But Sunderland – even if there are no gaping holes in a squad that, if anything, needs thinning out – have an opportunity here to strengthen from a position of maximum authority, especially if they have eyes on Europe. That will almost certainly be beyond them if Granit Xhaka, 33, or Noah Sadiki break down.",

      "“Of course, we will definitely be in the market. No doubt about that,” Thomas Frank has said, before showing he still doesn’t really know Spurs at all: “We want them as early as possible.” Frank has tried multiple options on the left following Son Heung-min’s departure. None have worked. Semenyo would be a very fine addition but Spurs will almost certainly spend most of the month fruitlessly chasing the Bournemouth winger before hurriedly signing an inferior alternative. A functioning football club would also seek some cover at full-back too.",
      "",
      "It wouldn’t be a window without West Ham being in the market for a striker. In this one, they will probably pack off Niclas Fullkrug, who could fall up to the actual AC Milan in a Serie A title race, leaving Nuno woefully light and banking on the robustness of Callum Wilson. Nuno needs a pacey forward with a goal threat. He’ll probably get Michail Antonio.",
      "",
      "Not to sound glib, but Wolves need quality across the board: up front, in midfield, at the back, and maybe in goal too. So poor was their summer, it makes the winter window almost irrelevant, since convincing players to sign for a club on their way to being the Premier League’s worst ever is a desperately tough sell. But if there’s one thing Jeff Shi and his cronies can do, it’s sell…",

      "READ: Kobbie Mainoo among six losers as new Manchester United arrives under Ruben Amorim",
      "“Is it Ruben Amorim’s fault? Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo are good players, but the rest of them are an average lot, and I don’t see them getting to the top four, which they have to do. Manchester United, biggest club in our football, maybe the second, third biggest club in world football.",
      "“But right now, they’re going through a difficult period. But they need to get back into the Champions League for the obvious reasons – to generate more finance, to buy even better players, and to be attractive to the genuine big players that are out there that are up for grabs.”",
      "Despite this, Souness actually thinks Amorim’s main problem is Man Utd’s lack of consistency.",
      "“What Ruben Amorim’s got with that group of players is he doesn’t know what he’s going to get from them,” Souness added.",
      "“He doesn’t know what Manchester United he’s going to get, and that’s not a good place to be. You’re sitting there with a wing and a prayer – what are we going to get today? I hope everyone’s on it today.",
      "“You can sit in your dressing room as a coach or manager and look at them before the game. You think, ‘They’re all in it today, we’re going to have a good day today’. And they go out and they’re not on it. Or it can be the other way around.",
      "“You’re thinking in the dressing room at 10 to three, ‘Look at them, they’re quiet’ – and they go out and they’re on fire. So that’s the problem that Man United have right now.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘held talks’ over signing Al-Hilal star Ruben Neves, who is also linked with Newcastle United and Spurs.",
      "It is common knowledge that the Red Devils are in the market for a new midfielder or two as they are expected to overhaul this department next year.",
      "In the summer, Ruben Amorim‘s side were focused on overhauling their attack as they signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, while they landed Senne Lammens to be their new No.1 goalkeeper.",
      "Now, Man Utd need to revamp their midfield and will likely start with a No.6 after they were priced out of a move for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba in the summer.",
      "Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton have also been mentioned as alternatives, but transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has confirmed that Baleba remains their favoured option.",
      "READ: Kobbie Mainoo among six losers as new Manchester United arrives under Ruben Amorim",
      "Romano said: “Look, if there’s a player Manchester United put on top, top, top of their list, for sure it’s Carlos Baleba. Baleba is a player they absolutely love.",
      "“Anderson and Wharton are on the list… but Baleba has always been seen as the top target for Ruben Amorim.”",
      "However, each of these possible signings would be very expensive, and Man Utd are far more likely to sign one or more of these in the summer rather than January.",
      "Therefore, Man Utd could turn to a cheaper alternative as a short-term fix in January and Neves is one of their candidates.",
      "Neves was consistently a standout performer in the Premier League with Wolves, but he has spent the last couple of years in the Saudi Pro League with Al-Hilal.",
      "Now, though, Al-Hilal are ‘ready to sell’ to a European club in January, with a report from journalist Graeme Bailey for our pals at TEAMtalk claiming the Red Devils are ‘holding talks’ with his representatives over a transfer.",
      "It is noted that ‘plenty of clubs are showing an early willingness’ to sign Neves, who is also attracting interest from Newcastle and Tottenham.",
      "The report claims: ‘The 28-year-old is now considering his options and has made it clear to his agents that he is open to a move in January.",
      "‘Off the back of that, we can reveal that Manchester United, Tottenham and Newcastle – all long-term admirers of Neves – have been spoken to.’",
      "Some of United’s current players will likely make way for Neves and other midfield signings, with another report from journalist Dean Jones for TEAMtalk claiming Manuel Ugarte’s exit has already been ‘approved’.",
      "Jones added: ‘Ugarte was signed in August 2024 for £50.7m (add-ons included), viewed at the time as the solution to United’s long-standing midfield issues.",
      "‘That vision has not materialised as the Uruguayan has struggled to establish himself in England and failed to displace the ageing Casemiro in the holding midfield role. The end result is Ugarte is now expected to be moved on.’",
      "Man Utd have chosen Manuel Ugarte as the player they want to ‘sacrifice’ in January in order to bring in new players, according to reports.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has reportedly made a January transfer request as Fabrizio Romano reveals the truth about their rumoured interest in Tyler Adams.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United will make a ‘U-turn’ on letting Kobbie Mainoo leave the club during the winter transfer window on one condition.",
      "Man Utd could now land a midfielder they regret being the alternative rather than the top target in the summer of 2024.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has admitted that one of his players is “struggling”, while he has opened the door to two transfers.",
      "A former Premier League star who was on the radar of Manchester United has put off top cubs given his wages, with two options now available to him."

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things might be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. Dubravka has made more saves than any other keeper having faced 17 more shots on his goal than anyone else. And he might have save of the season wrapped up after this late stop to preserve a win at Wolves.",
      "",
      "Henderson falls from the top of this ranking after conceding three to Manchester City from a PSxG of 1.7. The number is damning but the Palace keeper passed the eye test, especially around Erling Haaland’s brace, and to expect more in the face of Phil Foden’s 20-yarder feels harsh.",
      "",
      "Only Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder. Most recently, he made seven saves v Arsenal with narrative out the wazoo. Sat out the win at West Ham.",
      "",
      "A big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season. On Saturday, like Pickford, he conceded two from a PSxG of 1.2 at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses. Saved a penalty against Leeds only to see the rebound dispatched. Conceded four goals v Fulham and looked a little lost. Made one excellent save v Sunderland and stopped all fur shots on his goal taken by Palace.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton. The clean sheet at Wolves was very, very welcome. The battering by Everton and a groin twang less so.",
      "",
      "Making just five saves in five Premier League appearances hardly screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1’. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider.",
      "",
      "Came back into the Villa team for the Brighton game after Martinez suffered an injury in the warm-up and returned once more at West Ham. Conceding five goals from 2.8 PSxG was sub-optimal.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regain shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa. But he was absolutely culpable v Forest and not great against former club Manchester United. Then, at Arsenal, he was just plain unlucky.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season but when Arsenal have needed him, has he done enough? Reports suggest the Gunners might be looking to upgrade.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in.",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he has been keeping the wrong company down here for most of his first season with the Bees.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good. Conceded eight goals in his last four Premier League games but nobody gives a f*** at Leeds.",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning.",
      "",
      "He’s no Kepa, is he? It has been a rotten few weeks for the Cherries keeper, who falls to the bottom of this ranking after conceding four at Old Trafford. United’s 3.3 PSxG was not as damning on Petrovic as Casemiro’s header that seemed to terrify the Serbian.",
      "Thomas Frank has many problems to try and solve at Spurs, but one that may be heading his way is as simple and stark as the optics of vast blocks ...",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And Chelsea have been unseated at last…",
      "Manchester United’s youngsters are having ‘tantrums’ by posting images of themselves with trophies on Instagram. Disgusting.",
      "Premier League Mood Rankings time again. The short version? Villa are pretty happy, Spurs are definitely not. Read on for the (much) longer version.",
      "Manchester United have spent nearly £2billion on 75 players since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. We’ve ranked them all.",
      "Manchester United dominate the narrative after Monday’s 4-4 draw, with the next few weeks key in sorting out that bizarre table."

      "Crystal Palace are resigned to losing Oliver Glasner at the end of the season and reportedly have a La Liga manager lined up as his replacement.",
      "According to Spanish website Cadena Ser, Glasner will not renew his contract beyond next summer, and the Eagles are considering replacing him with Getafe’s Jose Bordalas.",
      "Glasner has done an outstanding job at Selhurst Park, guiding Crystal Palace to their first major trophy by winning the FA Cup last season.",
      "His effective counter-attacking 3-4-3 has earned widespread praise since he arrived in the Premier League in 2024, with players like Ebere Eze, Marc Guehi, and Adam Wharton all thriving under his system.",
      "Glasner’s success has sparked speculation about his future, with Manchester United constantly linked to searches for alternatives to current head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Austrian head coach employs a similar, albeit more effective, system to Amorim, but has shown greater tactical flexibility during his career. He has successfully used both a back three and a back four during his time at Eintracht Frankfurt, where he won the Europa League in 2022.",
      "Glasner has plenty of admirers, and Palace appear to be preparing for life without their highly-rated head coach.",
      "PREMIER LEAGUE FEATURES ON F365\n* Ten daft reasons why this Premier League season is already great and could be the best ever\n* Five players who will benefit from AFCON absences: Chiesa, Mainoo and more\n* PL clubs ranked on AFCON impact: Sunderland, Man Utd hit hard; Arsenal, Leeds profit?",
      "The Cadena Ser report from Jose David Palacio and Bruno Alemany states that Bordalas is expected to leave Getafe at the end of 2025/26 and ‘his next destination could be Palace’.",
      "Bordalas has reportedly been ‘identified’ as Glasner’s replacement, as the Austrian ‘has no intention of renewing his contract’ due to his ambition of taking charge of a ‘Premier League giant’ in 2026/27.",
      "Palace owner Steve Parish has been forced to start searching for a new manager but is ‘very impressed’ with Bordalas, though no contact has been made yet.",
      "It appears the move would suit Bordalas as well, as Palace ‘offer him a project that aligns with his wishes’.",
      "Still, this is bad news for Palace fans. Glasner has already established himself as a club legend, and his departure will feel like the end of an era at Selhurst Park.",
      "Meanwhile, an insider on X with a ‘team of five elite reporters’ and over 690k followers claims Glasner has rejected two offers to extend his contract because he wants to ‘manage a top club’.",
      "Manchester United is the club most frequently linked to him, though Liverpool could be an option if they part ways with Arne Slot.",
      "Elsewhere in the Premier League, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United are likely to be connected with the 51-year-old as Thomas Frank and Eddie Howe both fight to save their jobs.",
      "The report adds: ‘Oliver Glasner has turned down two contract offers in the last six months, signaling his ambition to stay in the Premier League and manage a top club. He’s not just looking for any job; he wants to make an impact at a bigger team.",
      "‘What sets him apart is his flexibility. He’s ready to adapt his tactics to fit the strengths of his players, knowing that clubs expect versatility in today’s game.",
      "‘With eyes across Europe on his next move, Glasner could very well be the next big name in football management. His strategic mindset and willingness to evolve make him a hot prospect for clubs looking to elevate their game.’",
      "Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘to leave’ Manchester United and will ‘not’ be in charge next season, with INEOS ‘ready to make a dramatic decision’.",
      "Sunderland v Newcastle is back on the Premier League fixture list after almost a decade away, and have Aston Villa set themselves up for a fall?",
      "Liverpool have been told to sign a teammate of Marc Guehi at Crystal Palace, but this transfer only makes sense if Oliver Glasner replaces Arne Slot…",
      "Theoretically, if ‘preferred candidate’ Oliver Glasner replaced Liverpool head coach Arne Slot this season, this is the XI he would select…",
      "Liverpool have their eye on Man Utd manager target Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace if they decide to sack Arne Slot, according to reports.",
      "Oliver Glasner will obviously leave Crystal Palace at some point. It has to happen. But *how* it happens matters more than *when* – and here’s why."

      "According to reports, Manchester United’s players ‘feel’ captain Bruno Fernandes is in his final season with the Premier League giants.",
      "Fernandes has been heavily linked with a move elsewhere in recent months, and he looked likely to leave in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "The Portugal international has been Man Utd‘s best player over the past few years, but he attracted interest from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal ahead of the Club World Cup in the summer.",
      "This transfer looked likely in the summer, but Fernandes eventually decided to remain at Man Utd for at least one more year.",
      "Fernandes has made a strong start to this season as he has five goals and six assists in his 15 Premier League appearances, but he has remarkably claimed that club chiefs wanted him to leave in the summer.",
      "In a new interview, Fernandes said: “From the club I felt it was, ‘If you go it’s not so bad for us’. It hurts me a bit.”",
      "READ: Kobbie Mainoo among six losers as new Manchester United arrives under Ruben Amorim",
      "He added: “More than hurting me, it makes me sad,” Fernandes said. “I’m a player that no-one can criticise, I’m always available, I always give my best.",
      "“I could have left in this transfer window, I would have earned much more money.",
      "“I would have won many trophies this season, but I decided not to go, not only for family reasons but because I genuinely love the club.”",

      "‘The German club is preparing a financial offensive of around €50 million to convince the British club’s management to sign Bruno Fernandes in this transfer window.  Fernandes is seen as a top-tier signing capable of providing immediate experience and world-class ball distribution.",
      "‘His contract situation is a determining factor, as the end of this season will mark a critical stage for his professional future. Bayern Munich’s interest is no coincidence, as the Bavarian club has long admired the Portuguese midfielder’s playing style.’",
      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has sat down with Rio Ferdinand for an in-depth chat, and here are the five best takeaways from this interview…",
      "There has reportedly been a ‘total break’ between Leon Goretzka and Bayern Munich, as Tottenham are said to be one of the teams best placed to land the midfielder.",
      "Arsenal legend Ian Wright insists that he would take Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes at the Emirates Stadium if he left Old Trafford.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano says “keep an eye on Saudi interest” in Man Utd midfielder Bruno Fernandes ahead of the summer transfer window.",

      "Manchester United will only consider selling Kobbie Mainoo in January if they receive an exceptional offer.",
      "The club do not want to sell, and are equally reluctant to see him leave on loan.",
      "A string of Premier League clubs are interested in him, but only a handful could afford a permanent deal.",
      "What is impossible to predict, however, is how the player himself might react - and how that might impact the club's decision-making, if Mainoo remains on the fringes of the first team.",
      "The academy graduate is yet to start a Premier League game this season, and his brother posed for photographs at Old Trafford on Monday night wearing a t-shirt which read \"Free Kobbie Mainoo\", which has since gone viral on social media.",
      "There were loud cheers from the home support when the young midfielder came on against Bournemouth with half an hour to go.",
      "Mainoo is clearly still very popular with United fans, and he is clearly frustrated by the lack of game time, struggling to adjust to a fall from grace since he was a regular under Erik ten Hag and a starter at the heart of the England midfield for last summer's European Championship final in Berlin.",
      "Mainoo won the last of his 10 England caps in September 2024 and, ahead of next summer's World Cup, is yet to feature under new England head coach Thomas Tuchel.",
      "Apart from playing the whole of the second half against Burnley back in August, he hasn't featured for more than half an hour in any Premier League for United game since. His only 90-minute outing came in the ill-fated defeat at Grimsby Town, which saw United dumped out of the Carabao Cup in the second round.",
      "But Amorim has been very clear that he doesn't doubt Mainoo's talent - rather, the head coach says it is a straight choice right now between him and the United captain.",
      "\"We play with two midfielders,\" Amorim said. \"We could change in the future but Kobbie Mainoo is playing in the same position as Bruno Fernandes and sometimes it's really hard to take Bruno Fernandes out of the team and that is the only reason.\"",
      "When asked if he rates Mainoo highly, Amorim added: \"Of course. Like everyone else.\"",
      "It makes no financial sense for United's hierarchy to send Mainoo out on loan.",
      "Because of his route through the United age-groups he is on a relatively modest wage compared to other players in the first team, and so there is little incentive to have his salary covered by another team.",
      "Furthermore, if he were to go on loan next month, United would have to replace him to provide extra cover in their midfield for the remainder of the season. That is likely to mean a bigger bill to bring in a new player who would be less familiar than Mainoo with the United environment.",
      "Meanwhile, Roy Keane has urged Mainoo to fight for his place at Manchester United.",
      "Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, former United captain Keane said: \"Are you telling me he can't sit there for another six months?",
      "\"He might think the manager might be gone in the summer, one or two of the senior players might be gone.",
      "\"He's 20 years of age, what's wrong with sitting and learning your trade? And even if you're not getting a chance, we've all had to do it at different levels.",
      "\"Sometimes a manager is on your case and what you have to do is look at a manager and go 'I'll prove you wrong'.",
      "\"Every day is your challenge to prove to the manager and when that manager is picking the team I'm going to train like a beast and when you're writing that team [as a manager] you're going to go, 'he has to play'. He's got to get that in his mindset.",
      "\"And when he's got his idiot of a brother doing all that… we shouldn't even be giving his brother the time of day. Sometimes you're just surrounded by idiots, especially the families.",
      "\"The life of a footballer is about trying to prove people wrong,\" Keane added when talking about Mainoo being in competition with Fernandes for a place in Amorim's starting XI.",
      "\"Bruno might get injured. There was a chat about Bruno leaving in the summer. Bruno might leave next summer, so you bide your time as a young player.",
      "\"I've no problem players going out on loan, it can work for everybody, but sometimes as a player, your biggest challenge is here at Man United and getting into that first-team.",
      "\"Even if the manager is saying 'you're not going to get in ahead of Bruno' [your mindset should be], 'I'm going to prove you wrong'.\""

      "Wednesday 17 December 2025 08:53, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim got Manchester United fans back onside with tactical flexibility against Bournemouth, but AFCON absences raise new problems, writes Dan Khan...",
      "As I go for walks around Manchester I constantly bump into United fans and we always end up chatting about how they feel their club is doing.",
      "After drab, lacklustre performances against Everton and West Ham, one gentleman in my barbers last week - a season ticket holder in the Stretford End - told me he just wants to see United 'go for it' and put on a performance. That's all.",
      "Despite the draw against Bournemouth extending their run of form to just two wins from seven, the overall performance saw most fans leave Old Trafford satisfied with the display they had witnessed.",
      "You can look at the metrics like xG and shot count to explain why United could have had a hatful in the first half, but it was not just that which left their supporters content.",
      "It was Leny Yoro at right-back, looking revitalised on his return to the side, showing aggression and pressing high.",
      "Ayden Heaven and Luke Shaw, a centre-back duo I did not think I would ever write, also echoed that aggression with Mason Mount looking even more like the player United signed from Chelsea in July 2023.",
      "This was the difference: the intent from Amorim's team. This is what the home fans responded to and what Amorim had been asking from his players. To show that aggression, win their duels and give the fans at Old Trafford a show and they duly obliged despite the disappointment at sharing the points in the end.",
      "It is impossible to gloss over the ease which some of Bournemouth's goals were scored but perhaps context is required as well to explain United's defensive woes in recent weeks.",
      "Amorim told us after the game he does not believe significant investment is required in defence, and that he has the characteristics among his players to improve and defend better as a team.",
      "It is easy to forget United were without their best defender this season, Matthijs de Ligt, and two other potential starters in Harry Maguire and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Lisandro Martinez made another cameo off the bench but looked understandably rusty after returning from a knee injury that kept him out since February.",
      "With the defensive issues highlighted, it is also important to focus on an area which was of utmost urgency to improve from last season: scoring goals.",
      "Last season, United were among the division's lowest scorers and, of course, spent hundreds of millions of pounds to address that through signing Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But even with that added fire power the new front three have started just three Premier League games together due to untimely injuries to Cunha and Sesko.",
      "All things considered, if had you said at this point United would find themselves sixth, two points off a top four spot and the second-highest scorers in the division, you would have thought not is all bad for a team still working itself out.",
      "Despite positives about what could be going forward, I also cannot help but have a feeling of frustration for Amorim.",
      "Not that he needs empathy after the Bournemouth performance or result, not because he showed he can be flexible in his tactical system when often accused of the opposite, and certainly not because United were the better team but once again failed to see out a lead.",
      "I feel frustration for Amorim because just as we have finally seen his side put on their best attacking and entertaining home performance of his reign, other than maybe against Brighton this season, he now waves off two of his star attacking players, Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, as they depart for AFCON.",
      "Neither we nor Amorim will see a United team with that pace or threat of attack again for at least a month, until both players return.",
      "Amorim will welcome Sesko's return to the matchday squad and he could easily slot into Mbeumo's position alongside Cunha, but he has a huge dilemma on how to balance the right-hand side, which looked so effective against Bournemouth with the pace and combination play of Mbeumo and Amad.",
      "How does he fill that hole? There is no straightforward answer.",
      "The immediate thought is that if Yoro continues at right back, Diogo Dalot may be the most natural to slot in ahead of him as a makeshift winger with Patrick Dorgu on the left of defence - but United have often looked blunt in attack when both have started this season.",
      "Potential solutions may present themselves, perhaps. Kobbie Mainoo could get more game time if Bruno Fernandes is shifted upfield, or he could perhaps even find himself on the right of a narrow diamond in midfield.",
      "Mainoo has yet to start a league game this season but did enjoy a 30-minute cameo against Bournemouth and could be in line to replace the suspended Casemiro against Aston Villa.",
      "The Brazilian's absence adds another headache, robbing Amorim of his midfield enforcer against such an in-form Villa side. There will also be a focus from fans about Amorim utilising Academy products.",
      "The likes of Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher will more than likely find themselves on the bench in the coming weeks but is Amorim comfortable enough to turn to them? So far, the answer has been no.",

      "Between the Lines returns with a data-led look at the Premier League's game-changing players; Mohamed Salah's numbers are unmatched since 2010/11 but Bruno Fernandes has made the biggest contribution to his team this season",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Wednesday 17 December 2025 15:56, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes showed his importance to Manchester United yet again as he produced a goal and assist during a man-of-the-match performance in their 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.",
      "In an interview published after the game, he then accused the club's hierarchy of trying to cash in on him during the summer, saying the episode had left him \"hurt\" and \"sad\".",
      "But just how vital is he to Man Utd? And where does he rank among the Premier League's biggest game-changers?",
      "Between the Lines reveals which players' goals and assists have won their clubs the most points, both this season and historically - and Fernandes and Mohamed Salah, another player under the microscope lately, feature prominently.",
      "Fernandes comes out top for this season as he continues to show his value even in another tough campaign for Manchester United.",
      "His four goals and six assists have won Ruben Amorim's side a whopping 14 points.",
      "The Bournemouth game was the latest example, with his goal involvements proving the difference between a loss and a draw. He won Manchester United two and three points respectively in their recent wins over Wolves and Crystal Palace too.",
      "As shown in the graphic below, Fernandes has made result-altering goal involvements in eight Premier League games this season.",
      "Morgan Rogers sits second in the list with goal involvements worth 12 points to third-placed Aston Villa, a total which includes the three points won by his double against West Ham on Sunday.",
      "The England international has only contributed a combined eight goals and assists for Unai Emery's side in the Premier League but, with the exception of his assist in the 3-1 win over Fulham in September, all of them have been game-altering.",
      "His total puts him two points ahead of Erling Haaland. The Manchester City striker has nearly twice as many goal involvements as any other Premier League player this season, with 17 goals and three assists, but only seven have directly changed results.",
      "Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo is tied with Haaland on 10 points won after his goal helped Bournemouth grab a point at Old Trafford on Monday, with Everton's Jack Grealish and Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike next on nine.",
      "Another way to measure player influence is to look at whose goal involvements have earned the highest proportion of their team's points. Again, it's Fernandes who sits top of the pile this season.",
      "The 31-year-old's goals and assists have won more than half of Manchester United's 26 points after 16 games.",
      "Semenyo is second, while Brentford striker Igor Thiago ranks third, his 11 goals having won 40 per cent of the side's 20 points.",
      "Grealish is just behind him on 38 per cent, with all of his six goal involvements this season having directly impacted Everton's results.",
      "Rogers, Ekitike, Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes, Sunderland's Granit Xhaka, West Ham's Callum Wilson and Brighton striker Danny Welbeck make up the rest of the top 10.",
      "So, Fernandes leads the way this season, but when factoring previous seasons, going back as far as 2010/11, it's Salah who comes out on top as the Premier League's biggest game-changer, despite his much-discussed recent dip in form.",
      "Salah's 280 Premier League goal involvements have been worth 177 points, putting him just ahead of Harry Kane on 173 points and highlighting the size of his contribution to Liverpool following his short spell at Chelsea earlier in his career.",
      "Former Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has the third-highest total for points won by goal involvements, with 127, while Kane's former Spurs team-mate Heung-Min Son is fourth on 106 and Manchester City legend Sergio Aguero is fifth on 104.",
      "Salah, in addition to having the highest total, boasts the highest percentage of a team's points won by goal involvements in a single season since 2010/11, with his 45.2 per cent last term just ahead of Robin van Persie's 42.7 per cent for Manchester United in 2012/13.",
      "Salah's output has of course dipped this season. He only has four goals and three assists in 14 Premier League appearances so far.",
      "But it is worth noting, as shown below, that those goal involvements have still won 23 per cent of Liverpool's points total, a higher proportion than in three of his previous campaigns at the club.",
      "So was he right to suggest he has been unfairly singled out during a difficult campaign for everyone at the club? The numbers suggest he has still made a useful contribution.",
      "But nobody can match that of Fernandes this season.",
      "Ninety-three injuries in 18 months? We dissected Arsenal's continued injury issues in last week's edition and the knock-on effects of losing players in the same positions.",

      "City are keeping close tabs on developments with the 25-year-old, with Tottenham also keen - and some insiders believe Pep Guardiola's side are now the strongest contenders for his signature.",
      "United are considered serious rivals for both City and Spurs, however, with Liverpool believed to still be in the background. Ruben Amorim described Semenyo as a \"special player\" ahead of the game against Bournemouth.",
      "United have not been actively looking to sign another forward in January but believe the opportunity to sign Semenyo - which will come next month and for a set price - is something they must genuinely consider.",
      "The biggest obstacle for United is financial, though. While they are not currently at risk of breaching the PSR regulations, a £65m fee could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, where a defensive-midfielder is the absolute priority.",

      "\"What I feel is that [Bournemouth have] a top manager, top team - I really like the team - and a top play, I think he is a special player.\"",
      "United held strong interest in Semenyo over the summer but ended up signing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for the forward positions.",

      "Tuesday 16 December 2025 08:51, UK",
      "Manchester United and Bournemouth traded blows in a thrilling 4-4 draw that saw Ruben Amorim make the first changes to his formation since taking over at Old Trafford.",
      "In a riveting, rollercoaster contest, that Jamie Carragher subsequently hailed as \"the best game of the Premier League season so far\":",
      "Amorim has staunchly defended his 3-4-3 system, but looked to be playing a tweaked or even entirely altered formation from kick-off. And the middle of the second half, he had thrown caution to the wind and gone for a 4-2-4.",
      "The changes certainly worked with Manchester United dominant in the first half and making a deserved breakthrough in the 13th minute when Amad Diallo nodded home on his final appearance before the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "But their good play going forward was undone when Luke Shaw was too easily barged out of the way, allowing Antoine Semenyo to power forward. He then swept home, with the goal coming against the run of play.",
      "Deservedly though, Casemiro nodded Manchester United back in front on the stroke of half-time from a corner - the hosts' seventh from the set piece this season, with only Arsenal (9) scoring more.",
      "But just seven minutes after the break, the Red Devils somehow found themselves 3-2 behind. Bournemouth equalised with a brilliant finish from Evanilson 38 seconds into the second half, before Marcus Tavernier curled a wonderful free-kick into the bottom left corner.",
      "Then it was Manchester United's turn to score two quick goals to restore their lead as the pendulum swung back the other way. Bruno Fernandes scored a wonderful free-kick to level, before Cunha turned home inside a packed box as the ball fell kindly his way.",
      "But the drama wasn't over yet.",
      "Bournemouth hit back again to round off an incredible eight-goal thriller. Eli Junior Kroupi - just on as a substitute - added to the raft of high-quality goals as he squeezed through the central defenders before arrowing home his effort.",
      "The result moves Manchester United into sixth place on 26 points - level with Crystal Palace, Liverpool and Sunderland. Bournemouth are nudged up into 13th spot.",
      "\"We have just seen the best game of the Premier League season so far. That's what makes the Premier League the greatest league, the greatest product or whatever you want to call it, in the world.\"",
      "\"I think it's the best I've seen Manchester United play, certainly in the first half, under Amorim, maybe going back to the first game of the season with Arsenal.",
      "\"Manchester United were fantastic in those first 25 to 30 minutes. It was almost a throwback to Sir Alex Ferguson - fast, attacking football, people being energetic, making runs forward, being positive, being on the front foot, winning the ball back early. There was lots of that.",
      "\"Bournemouth were not at the races in the first half but they were fantastic in the second half.\"",
      "\"A fun game. We started really well, did a very good first half. The result should be completely different.",
      "\"We lost the concentration and they scored two goals. But we managed to get back to the game, we scored two goals again and then we have to finish the game.",
      "\"We need to think about not to go again, but to take calm and to close the game. A lot of good things, but a lot of things to work.",
      "\"We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five. It's the details that we need to work, understand the momentum of the game. You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.",
      "\"We need to focus on the performance today, different from the last two at home. That is also a point that we pay attention to. The result is the same and at one point, it's frustrating, but the performance is different.\"",
      "\"It had everything. Moments where you think it's a loss, moments where you think we have this one, we are comfortable.",
      "\"Even at the end, at the last minute, two clear chances, and I was thinking, 'maybe win this one'. It's just a point, it's not a lot in the standings, but I think we can take good and bad things from today.",
      "\"We are two teams that play quite aggressively, quite open and probably today we attacked much better than we defended. The second goal is a cheap goal, a cheap one for us to concede. The corner is not even a great header.",
      "\"We finished really well the first half. When we scored the 1-1 we were feeling comfortable and were finishing the half much better. That's why the goal we conceded just from the corner has hurt me because we were in a good moment.",
      "\"You didn't even know if we were happy finishing the game, or give us one minute more.\"",

      "Gary Neville hailed Manchester United's 4-4 draw with Bournemouth as \"a stunning watch\" while Jamie Carragher labelled their performance as the best under Ruben Amorim.",
      "United and Bournemouth produced the game of the Premier League season so far, with Neville relieved by United's attacking intent despite their failure to secure three points.",
      "Speaking on his podcast, Neville said: \"It was a stunning watch. I was really critical after the Everton and West Ham games because of just the nature of the performance. I thought it was really bland.",
      "\"This was the complete and utter opposite. I can live with that all day long in terms of a performance and a standard because they played with real intent, played the ball forward, always played at full pace.",
      "\"When United went 3-2 down, Ruben Amorim then went to 4-4-2 and did the right thing. Forget the system, he did the right thing. He got the right players on the pitch and were a massive threat.",
      "\"The second half was absolute mayhem. There were big boos after the West Ham and Everton games but there weren't the big boos here after this game. There was disappointment but there were a lot of fans we've just seen who stayed in the stadium to clap the team because they can live with that.",
      "\"If you're a kid coming to United - my two girls have come tonight, and they'll be thrilled walking back. They won't be happy that United haven't won, but they'll have seen a great game of football and that's what you come to Old Trafford for.",
      "\"You come for entertainment. Of course you come to see your team win, and I get it, you've got to go and win games, win trophies, win titles and we could say it's not good enough in respect of what's happened, but I think getting the entertainment bit right, the performance and style right, is absolutely critical at this football club.",
      "\"I enjoyed what I've seen tonight from those red shirts.\"",
      "\"It's the best I've seen Manchester United play, certainly in the first half, under Amorim, maybe going back to the first game of the season with Arsenal.",
      "\"Manchester United were fantastic in those first 25 to 30 minutes. It was almost a throwback to Sir Alex Ferguson - fast, attacking football, people being energetic, making runs forward, being positive being on the front foot, winning the ball back early. There as lots of that.",
      "\"But clean sheets are a big problem for them. They had problems at both ends of the pitch last season.",
      "\"We highlighted pre-match that they're improving in attack and we saw that again tonight. I thought the attacking players for Manchester United were fantastic.",
      "\"They had a lot of young defenders out there tonight that didn't help. I've been there, more often than not when you make a mistake as a young defender, it ends up in the back of your goal and that was the mistake tonight.",
      "\"Even though it ended up at 4-4 and Bournemouth should have won it at the end, Manchester United were by far the better team.",
      "\"That was the first time in a long time, and certainly under Amorim, that I felt like I was watching how Manchester United should be.",
      "\"Just wave after wave of attacks, counter-attacks, and almost the opposition feel like they're getting sucked back into that box in front of the Stretford End. You can't get out.\"",
