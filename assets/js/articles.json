      "Rasmus Hojlund has hit back at Ruben Amorim by detailing three reasons behind his exit from Manchester United. The 22-year-old striker moved to Napoli on a season-long loan deal during the summer transfer window.",
      "He had slipped down the pecking order at Old Trafford and was told he could leave by United head coach Ruben Amorim. Antonio Conte's side hold a £38million obligation to make the Denmark international's switch permanent next summer, meaning Hojlund may have already played his last game for United.",
      "Hojlund's choice to depart United this summer wasn't a simple one, however, as he had originally been resolute about remaining to battle for his position. Even when the likes of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko arrived, the frontman felt he could win back his place if given the opportunity.",
      "When he was in the USA for United's pre-season tour, Hojlund said: \"I think my plan is very clear and that is for me to stay and fight for my spot, whatever happens. I'm still very young. I think people forget that sometimes.",
      "\"I'm only 22. Obviously, not every striker is scoring 100 goals at the age of 22 [like Kevin De Bruyne]. But I've learned a lot, I think you can see in my game. I'm starting to develop and become even better in the basics.",
      "\"Now it's just about for me to sharpen myself and I've done very well in the pre-season, so far. I'm just focusing on continuing that. Competition is fine with me.",
      "\"It sharpens me, as I'm more than ready. I'm feeling sharp, so I'm welcoming everything that comes. I think it's good with competition and it only sharpens the team.\"",
      "Despite his initial position, Hojlund ultimately accepted a deadline day switch to Italian champions Napoli. So far this campaign, Hojlund has netted four times in six appearances in all competitions - matching his entire Premier League tally for United during the 2024/2025 season.",
      "Speaking about what finally swayed his decision and persuaded him to embrace the next phase of his career in Italy, Hojlund waxed lyrical about Conte while speaking to Radio Kiss. The ex-Atalanta player said: \"Conte is a top coach.",
      "\"I came here because I knew this was an important step for me. Napoli is a great club and a wonderful place to live. It's exactly what I need right now in my career.\"",
      "Following six matches, reigning champions Napoli currently lead the Serie A standings, and remain on course to retain the title they secured last season, boasting five victories and just one defeat from their campaign. Hojlund isn't the sole former Manchester-based star flourishing with the Italian outfit at present, either.",
      "Scott McTominay has enjoyed a brilliant spell with Napoli since completing his switch from United last summer, registering 12 goals and six assists in the league during the previous term. Meanwhile, Manchester City icon Kevin De Bruyne is also excelling, contributing with three goals and two assists from his eight appearances in Serie A and the Champions League so far.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United icon Wayne Rooney has urged the current squad to keep faith in Ruben Amorim's tactics, despite the head coach claiming that punditry comments are influencing his players. Rooney had previously criticised Amorim's approach before their win over Sunderland, suggesting he'd 'lost faith' in the Portuguese coach's system.",
      "The ex-England forward wasn't alone in his views, with fellow former players Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt also expressing similar sentiments. In his pre-match press conference on Friday, Amorim voiced his concerns that the club legends' comments were beginning to seep into his team.",
      "\"I understand when people think 'what would this team be like in a different system?'\" He stated. \"Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles, even if we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2. That is my point with the players.",
      "\"I don't want to change your mind, but my players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me.",
      "\"So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys [pundits and journalists] when you say the problem of our team is the system.\" After Saturday afternoon's 2-0 triumph, Rooney was quizzed about his reaction to Amorim's press conference remarks.",
      "\"I'm sure they are,\" the striker responded on The Wayne Rooney Show when asked whether the squad were aware of his comments regarding Amorim's tactics. \"I said when I made the comments, it's not something that I really wanted to do but I feel you have to tell the truth on it.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim himself has been critical about the players. It wasn't long ago he was telling us it was the worst Manchester United team in the history of the club.",
      "\"That's him being honest. If that's his thoughts, that's his thoughts.",
      "\"For the players, they have to keep focused on what they're doing. He's the manager, listen to what he's saying and tactically what he wants to try and win games.",
      "\"That's the only way it changes, unfortunately. I've been there as a player and been criticised as a player. You have to just try and focus on your job and win games. You're at Manchester United.",
      "\"It's still one of the biggest clubs in the world so you have to expect to be criticised when you don't win games or play well. On the flip side of that, the benefits of playing well and winning games are huge.\"",
      "United now enter the international break with numerous current squad members travelling across the globe to feature for their nations. Upon their return, United face a daunting trip to Anfield to take on Liverpool in one of the season's biggest clashes.",
      "Arne Slot's side are feeling the heat after suffering three consecutive defeats across all competitions prior to the international break.",

      "Manchester United were linked with a mega-money move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba in the summer - but the midfielder has endured a season to forget ever since being told he would remain at the Amex.",
      "It was well documented that the Red Devils wanted to bolster their midfield, but ultimately failed to land any new face in that area. It remains a problem position and the expectation was that they would return to see if they could lure Baleba away from the Seagulls next year.",
      "In light of his performances, though, a rethink could be on the cards at Old Trafford. After all, United have been stung numerous times in the transfer market, spending huge sums on players, only to see them underwhelm in a red shirt.",
      "Unfortunately for Baleba, his struggles continued at the weekend as he was hooked - for a third time - at the interval. The Cameroon star has started six of their seven Premier League matches, but Baleba is yet to complete a full 90 minutes, despite excelling in his debut season at the Amex. On Saturday, he was replaced by Georginio Rutter with Brighton trailing 1-0 at Wolves - but they did go on to score in the second half to grab a draw.",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler previously replaced his midfielder at half-time in their loss to Everton in August as well as last month's home draw against Tottenham. On this occasion he was hauled off as a precaution with Baleba on a yellow card.",
      "The German said: “No, it was because of the yellow card. Therefore, that's what I mean, it impacts the whole match plan, it impacts everything. So that's why it's very frustrating if you get for the first foul, always a yellow card. In my opinion there were no yellow cards, and therefore I think the balance has to be better.”",
      "Hurzeler was honest about the impact United's interest had on Baleba during the transfer window. Brighton had previously seen midfielder excel under them, only to move on for huge profits. Moises Caicedo being the most high profile example.",
      "The Brighton boss conceded \"it's normal that there will be some waves in their development\" when addressing the dip in Baleba's form. He told talkSPORT: \"I'm confident that we will get the best out of him, I think he needs time, he's a young boy, his development in the last year was incredible.",
      "\"Maybe it went a little bit too fast, there was a lot of rumours about him, he played an incredible season, but I always try to be humble with the players.\"",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's consistent brilliance in front of goal has propelled Napoli to the top of the Serie A table, following their 2-1 triumph over Genoa at the weekend. The Manchester United loanee netted in the 75th minute, restoring the Italian champions' lead and placing them marginally ahead of Roma due to their superior goal difference.",
      "This marked his third consecutive goal at Stadio Diego Armando Maradona and his fourth in six matches since his deadline-day transfer. With Romelu Lukaku sidelined due to a severe thigh injury, Hojlund has stepped up to spearhead the champions' attack, earning him widespread acclaim in the Italian press.",
      "Corriere della Sport's match report heaped praise on Hojlund's clinical finishing and his consistent ability to find the back of the net - a trait that was noticeably absent during his two-year stint in Manchester.",
      "Their report stated: \"Hojlund's finishing ability also made the difference, with three consecutive goals at the Maradona and already four in six games.\" Despite a challenging first half where Napoli \"failed to build an attacking play\", the report lauded Kevin De Bruyne's impact upon his introduction in the second half.",
      "The former Manchester City midfielder was praised for \"bringing order and quality, revitalising the team, and inspiring his teammates. With him, Napoli seemed like a different team, both in terms of conviction and awareness.\"",
      "The Italian publication's match report wasted no time in crowning the Dane as the Serie A champions' main attacking threat, declaring: \"Napoli has found its true centre-forward. And they're enjoying it.\"",
      "It represents quite the accolade considering Lukaku spearheaded their title triumph last season, bagging 14 goals in all competitions. Yet with the Belgian hitman unavailable, Hojlund has seized his opportunity to command the Italian giants' forward line and has undoubtedly hit the ground running in Naples.",
      "With the 22-year-old now away on international duty with Denmark, Conte will be desperate for his talisman to maintain his scoring streak ahead of their journey to Torino on October 18.",
      "Hojlund's impressive return to Serie A has restored the striker's standing following a difficult spell at Old Trafford. la Repubblica chose a headline that captured how rapidly he has become indispensable, stating \"Hojlund has already taken Napoli: his goals for the top spot in the standings.\"",
      "His goal secured a crucial win for his team, catapulting them past Roma to top the league table on goal difference. Since his 2022 transfer to Atalanta, Hojlund hasn't had the chance to compete for major titles, but he's adapted brilliantly to Napoli's pursuit of consecutive league championships for the first time in their near-century long history.",

      "Manchester United are planning to welcome Lisandro Martinez back from injury before the end of the calendar year. Martinez, 27, has been sidelined since February after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament in a clash with Crystal Palace.",
      "The defender started taking part in outdoor training towards the end of United's pre-season tour in late July, having been added to the Red Devils' new six-man leadership group by boss Ruben Amorim. Although Martinez is still training individually as he continues his rehabilitation, United are hopeful that he could return following the November international break.",
      "The Sun report that medical staff are planning to ease Martinez back into Amorim's squad, having been in and around his team-mates at Carrington. Last month, the Argentine travelled to the Etihad Stadium to provide support as United faced Manchester City.",
      "In another show of his commitment to the Red Devils, Martinez has been staying behind to watch training sessions and attend team meetings. It's not the first time that the former Ajax star has been forced to watch from the sidelines since joining United in a deal worth up to £56.7million in 2022.",
      "Martinez fractured his metatarsal in April 2023, requiring corrective surgery five months later, ruling him out until January 2024. The Argentina international then missed 26 games with a separate foot issue during the 2023-24 season, and a further 10 shortly after due to a knee injury.",
      "A calf strain also saw him miss a chunk of the run-in that year before helping United win the FA Cup. Having had a clean bill of health last season, Martinez suffered his ACL injury during February's 2-0 loss at home to Palace and hasn't played for club or country since.",
      "Amorim has singled out the 27-year-old as one of the reasons for their struggles this season, saying: \"We miss a lot Licha, especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does, we miss him.\"",
      "Luke Shaw has started all seven of United's Premier League matches in Martinez's role as the left centre-back. Amorim prefers a left-footer in the position and Shaw, despite being a full-back by trade, has got the nod over Ayden Heaven, who started August's humiliating Carabao Cup defeat away to Grimsby Town.",

      "Manchester United and Ruben Amorim could be set for a telling January transfer window should the Portuguese boss still be in charge at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have mustered just 10 points from their opening seven Premier League matches this season.",
      "Having already suffered three losses, not including a bitterly disappointing defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, Amorim is well and truly in the United hotseat. A 2-0 home win against Sunderland on Saturday eased these concerns but a daunting trip to Anfield is next and a bad result there could undo any positives.",
      "Should Amorim remain in charge until January then some personnel changes will inevitably have to be made. Bruno Fernandes continues to be linked with a move to Saudi Arabia and the new year could be an ideal time to sell up.",
      "The Red Devils have long been crying out for a consistent and confident pair of hands between the sticks. Andre Onana was a failed buy from Inter Milan and cost nearly £50million. Altay Bayindir has also failed to impress.",
      "After a string of critical errors from both of these shot-stoppers, the former having now been shipped off on loan to Trabzonspor, young Belgian ace Senne Lammens was signed on deadline day for an initial £18.2m. He had impressed in the Belgian Pro League, and fans were thankful to see him handed his debut against Sunderland.",
      "The bar was set so low that simple catches during this match were cheered. But Lammens was assured on his first start for the club, so much so that chants of \"Are you [Peter] Schmeichel in disguise?\" bellowed down.",
      "A stunning save just before half-time to deny Granti Xhaka compounded a calm 90 minutes on the ball. Perhaps most importantly, he seemed dominant when balls came into the box from crosses and corners.",
      "It is too early to tell whether Lammens will be the solution, but if in a few months' time it turns out he is not, then a hefty fee might have to be tabled for a well-thought-of goalkeeper. Porto's Diogo Costa has been Portugal's No. 1 for some time and is just 26 years of age.",
      "His contract expires in 2027, and he has yet to agree on a new one. This deal reportedly includes a release clause of £65,m and Sky Switzerland reported that Amorim's side had shown interest this summer before snapping up Lammens.",
      "And although Fernandes has been United's saviour on numerous occasions and is still debatably their best player, perhaps now isn't the worst time to cash in. Fernandes' contract expires in 2027, when he will be on the verge of turning 33.",
      "Primarily, though, it is Amorim's reluctance to alter his system that means Fernandes' leaving isn't so far-fetched. The Portuguese ace has been forced to play in a deeper midfield role as opposed to his ideal No. 10 and often looks out of depth defensively.",
      "Amorim has said not even the Pope will get him to change how he sets up, and so as long as the 40-year-old is in charge, Fernandes will be compromising. The Daily Mail even reports Fernandes is unhappy with where he is being played.",
      "A fee of £100m, if that is indeed how much a 31-year-old Fernandes may fetch, would go a long way to securing the club's midfield. Brighton's Carlos Baleba could be brought in as a holding option, with Bayern Munich's Aleksandar Pavlovic an alternative, according to German outlet BILD.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, who broke out as a technical box-to-box player alongside the more defensive Declan Rice for England at Euro 2024, could also be ushered back into first-team contention. Losing a player as impactful as Fernandes may seem ridiculous, but should that offer come it would be too hard to turn down.",
      "One thing that has become clear at United, with the new season underway, is that a left-sided centre-half is desperately needed. Luke Shaw simply isn't cutting it, and he was savaged by Roy Keane for his Manchester derby performance.",
      "It remains to be seen what funds are available to United in January but if the club want to back Amorim then an ideal signing would be Sporting CP's Goncalo Inacio. The 24-year-old won two league titles under Amorim, is suited to his system and would slot in perfectly to the left of Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "A Bola reported over the summer that both United and Liverpool were keen on Inacio and a £52m release clause is present in his current contract which expires in 2027. Inacio is a regular for his country and helped them to the UEFA Nations League this year.",
      "It seems written in the stars that Inacio touches down in Manchester to help shore up the club's backline and with his deal up so soon Amorim's former employers could have their arms twisted.",

      "Football loving writer who spends much of his life on motorways getting to games all over the country. Passionate about football, my job and the Mirror. The Premier League is the best in the world and always believe England has a chance. Author of Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story of Arsenal Under Wenger.",
      "So, here’s a quiz question… which was the last team to win the Premier League title while in transition?",
      "It is probably up for debate but Manchester United in 1996 - you can’t win anything with kids - might be the only answer. After shipping out Andrei Kanchelskis, Paul Ince and Mark Hughes, they brought in academy graduates David Beckham, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and the like to be first team regulars.",
      "It was one hell of a shift - and gamble - by Sir Alex Ferguson to go from older, experienced and proven players to, er, kids who then won and carried on winning.",
      "Liverpool are slightly different in that they are already champions - and they are trying to transition towards a new team while being at the top. However, it is still no less of a gamble on Arne Slot’s part to shift away from the team which won the title last season to a completely different look.",
      "Two new full backs, new forwards and even a new playmaker. They have also spent £400m in building that new team. Some was enforced because Luis Diaz wanted to leave and Trent Alexander-Arnold joined Real Madrid and, for all those that said Liverpool would cope without him, it is clear they are missing the England right back.",
      "Let’s be clear here… it was also a traumatic summer when players suffered a collective tragedy in losing Diogo Jota who was so loved by all. Any dressing room would feel that sort of blow. The club handled it as well as they possibly could but it was another challenge for Slot and the whole dressing room.",
      "What is remarkable is the way that Liverpool stormed into this season. Jeremie Frimpong came in, Milos Kerkez and Florian Wirtz all started the season. Hugo Ekitike was also new in attack while Alexander Isak joined later. That is one hell of a shift in dynamic and playing style.",
      "Suddenly, last season’s midfield of Ryan Gravenberch with Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai was ripped up to accommodate Wirtz who is a beautiful, creative and artistic player. But so very different to what had gone before and ideally Liverpool would have to set up differently to accommodate him as a No10.",
      "To start as well as they did - five straight wins in the Premier League and also a good win over Atletico Madrid in the Champions League - is a tribute to Slot’s man-management and also their incredible team spirit which saw them snatch late goals.",
      "Now we are perhaps seeing a more realistic outlook. A team needs time to gel. They were my choice to be champions - and I still think they are favourites.",
      "But the way they lost at Crystal Palace and now Chelsea shows that the team needs work. It needs to gel. Ibrahima Konate is struggling. The right back slot looks an issue. Where does Wirtz play? Isak looks undercooked.",
      "The ideal for any team is to strengthen when you are on top. But Liverpool did not actually have that luxury. They had to buy two new full backs, midfield needed strengthening anyway and the forward line needed reinforcing. They had lost players. So, rather than trying to strengthen, Liverpool had to rebuild and that was a major gamble for Slot but one actually he did not really have a choice on.",
      "It was obvious that Jurgen Klopp’s old team needed major surgery. Slot put it off for a year - and is now having to do it. Only time will tell whether they can come through the ultimate test. Slot was incredible in his first year - but now is a much bigger test and will really show his calibre as a manager.",

      "Alexis Sanchez scored for Sevilla in their rout of Barcelona and, despite claiming he wouldn't celebrate against his former club, the Chilean admits that emotions can sometimes boil over as the Spanish champions were humbled.",
      "The Manchester United flop scored one of four goals as the Catalans were well beaten, losing for the first time as they relinquished top spot in La Liga. Red Devils loanee Marcus Rashford scored, but it was nothing more than a consolation.",
      "Sanchez has played for numerous teams since his departure from Manchester. He's now found himself in southern Spain and celebrated as he scored from the spot after 13 minutes. As a show of respect the 36-year-old didn't plan to celebrate, but u-turned in the moment.",
      "He said after the game: \"I had said I wouldn’t celebrate, but sometimes the excitement overcomes me, and the desire drives me to do so. In truth, I hold a great deal of love for Barcelona.\"",
      "Sevilla were leading 2-0 when Rashford pulled a goal back for Barcelona. The hosts then scored twice in stoppage time to add some serious gloss to the scoreline with Jose Angel Carmona and Akor Adams both getting in on the act.",
      "Barcelona boss Hansi Flick said after the heavy defeat: “We have to accept this defeat and look at the positive side. In the first half we made a lot of mistakes, but in the second half we were able to react. The international break this October will do us good.",
      "Sanchez famously chose a move to Old Trafford, despite huge interest from Manchester City, when he decided to leave Arsenal in 2018. His move to the Red Devils made him the highest paid player in the Premier League but he rarely delivered on that huge investment. He spent only 18 months at the club before being allowed to leave.",
      "He's since struggled to find a home. He's had two spells in Italy with Inter Milan - sandwiched in between that was a season at Marseille. More recently he headed to Udinese, the club he made his name out before signing for Barcelona.",
      "In the summer he returned to Spain to join the Seville-based outfit and has helped them enjoy a promising start to the season. He's scored twice in his five games for the La Liga side.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "He has made his mark in Spain thus far, netting three goals and providing five assists across all competitions. Barcelona had maintained their unbeaten run in La Liga prior to Sunday's clash, but a thrashing at Sevilla's hands saw them surrender a two-point advantage to bitter rivals Real Madrid at the summit.",
      "Sevilla broke the deadlock through an Alexis Sanchez spot-kick after 13 minutes before doubling their cushion via Isaac Romero in the 37th minute.",
      "AS targeted Rashford, particularly his dreadful record at Sevilla's fortress, the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium. They highlighted that across the three matches he has played the club away from home, the England international has tasted defeat in every single one.",
      "Rashford's experiences were branded as \"truly disastrous\" and it was emphasised that Sevilla's ground and facing the club away has proved difficult despite him claiming Barcelona's lone goal in the 4-1 reverse. Rashford first set foot on the pitch in 2018, coming on as a substitute in a goalless draw.",
      "Just two years back, Rashford had a challenging visit to Spain when his team was knocked out of the Europa League following a 3-0 away loss, further tarnishing his record at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium.",
      "The Spanish outlet lavished praise on Rashford and his contributions, hailing his goal as \"beautifully crafted\" and asserting that he remains \"one of the most incisive players in attack.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo also penned: \"Beyond the numbers, the Englishman is increasingly displaying confidence and commitment. His ability to adapt to Hansi Flick's system has been one of the most positive aspects of recent weeks.",
      "\"This is despite the fact that the team, which has suffered two consecutive defeats, is not in his favour. On an individual level, Rashford continues to rise.\"",
      "They adopted a more optimistic perspective on the defeat, which leaves Barcelona second in La Liga with 19 points, and also highlighted that this loss marks two consecutive defeats after their Champions League fall to PSG.",
      "El Des Marque were among those who saw the silver lining in Rashford's performance against Sevilla. They lauded his goal in the first-half stoppage time, describing it as \"brilliant.\"",
      "The outlet gave Rashford's performance a 5/10 rating and commented: \"A great signing for Barcelona. A differential player who never fails when he has the opportunity. He scored his team's goal and was one of the most incisive players in the match.\"",
      "But they weren't nearly as kind about Rashford's attacking partner, Robert Lewandowski, who fluffed his lines from the penalty spot in the defeat.",
      "They remarked: \"He started and had one of his worst matches. He even missed a penalty from the penalty spot, which went wide. A day to forget for the Pole.\"",

Following the match, De Gea took to Instagram to share a picture of the team huddle, accompanied by a heartfelt message to supporters.",

      "Liverpool relinquished top spot as their losing streak continued at Chelsea and we now have a new leader in Arsenal - who only weeks ago were being criticised for their approach to big games.",
      "The Gunners secured a routine win on Saturday and will now go into the international break as the Premier League leaders. Liverpool boss Arne Slot is having to digest another poor showing with the millions he spent unable to take the Reds to the next level.",
      "They are struggling to find a winning formula and, as a result, criticism continues to come their way.",
      "Manchester United managed to find a much-needed win for Ruben Amorim and then 24 hours later neighbours Manchester City did what the Red Devils couldn't - win at Brentford. That kept them in touching distance of top spot with Erling Haaland again their match winner.",
      "We'll keep you across all the fallout from the weekend's matches.",
      "That's all for today, folks.",
      "But join us again tomorrow for all the latest news from the Premier League.",
      "It looks as if Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City will be the trio battling it out for the Premier League title.",
      "Currently Tottenham have enjoyed a fast start under Thomas Frank whilst Bournemouth continued to perform borderline miracles under Andoni Iraola.",
      "But who really has enjoyed the best of the opening seven games? We can't agree, but you can read the various cases here!",
      "So, here’s a quiz question… which was the last team to win the Premier League title while in transition?",
      "It is probably up for debate but Manchester United in 1996 - you can’t win anything with kids - might be the only answer. After shipping out Andrei Kanchelskis, Paul Ince and Mark Hughes, they brought in academy graduates David Beckham, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and the like to be first team regulars.",
      "It was one hell of a shift - and gamble - by Sir Alex Ferguson to go from older, experienced and proven players to, er, kids who then won and carried on winning.",
      "Liverpool are slightly different in that they are already champions - and they are trying to transition towards a new team while being at the top. However, it is still no less of a gamble on Arne Slot’s part to shift away from the team which won the title last season to a completely different look.",
      "Read John Cross' full thoughts here..",
      "Continuing on the Mo Salah theme...",
      "Wayne Rooney has accused the Liverpool superstar of not working hard enough for his team - and he reckons Salah is letting his ego get in the way of helping Arne Slot's men get back to winning ways.",
      "Man United legend Rooney believes Salah has been found wanting, when his side need him the most. Speaking on 'The Wayne Rooney Show', he said: \"I think top players have a bit of an ego, and Mo Salah has been one of the best players in the league for a long time.",
      "\"I think the last week has shown something. When it's going well and you’re scoring goals and winning games, it's great and the team will put up with that.",
      "\"But over the last week, I would question his work ethic. We know he doesn’t always get back and defend as much, but in the Chelsea game his full-back was getting torn apart and he was watching.”",
      "\"He's not getting back and helping and players like (Virgil) Van Dijk, and the leaders in the dressing room should be telling him, 'you need to help out.' That was a worry - and I think he has looked a bit lost over the last week.\"",
      "He was electric last season, but Liverpool's Egyptian king is not firing on all cylinders so far.",
      "The Reds boss said: \"I think today he had many opportunities to do what he's done so often. But yeah, he's a human being.",
      "\"It's not like every chance he gets is always a goal. We feel sometimes it is because of what he has done last season and so many times.",
      "\"But, yeah, he can also have a game where he has so many, so many...where he has chances and a lot of times in promising positions, but doesn't have a goal or an assist.\"",
      "Arsenal have been given a 44.23% chance of winning the Premier League - ahead of Liverpool who have been given a 30.61% chance of defending their title.",
      "Man City currently sit in fifth but they are the only other side in double figures, with a 14.32% chance of winning another title under Pep Guardiola.",
      "Damningly, Man Utd have a 0.14% chance of landing the title, according to Opta.",
      "A tough start to Florian Wirtz's Anfield career has left Real Madrid on red alert, according to reports in Spain. Madrid boss Xabi Alonso was the German playmaker's manager at Bayer Leverkusen, and there has been talk of a reunion if Liverpool decide to cash in on their £116m man.",
      "There is no suggestion at this stage that Liverpool plan to give up on the German international. He was left out of the starting line-up for Saturday's defeat at Chelsea, but showed promising signs after replacing Conor Bradley at the start of the second half.",
      "These aren't the games which will decide whether West Ham stay up or go down, and they won't be the results on which Nuno's long-term future lives or dies after they were beaten at Arsenal.",
      "Even so, there were positives compared to Graham Potter and Julen Lopetegui - or, to put it more accurately, fewer negatives. Under the previous two managers, fans might have been braced for conceding one or two more after falling behind, but that porousness wasn't on display under Nuno, while there were even a couple of promising moments going forward, with Niclas Fullkrug and Callum Marshall finding space before squandering chances, and we can probably file this in the 'things to build on' pile.",
      "Reece James has dropped out of the England squad due to injury and been replaced by the uncapped Nico O'Reilly. The Chelsea captain suffered an injury during their 2-1 win against Liverpool on Saturday.",
      "James, 25, will now miss England's friendly against Wales at Wembley on Thursday before Thomas Tuchel's side face Latvia away from home in a World Cup qualifier next Tuesday. The fixtures could see 20-year-old O'Reilly make his senior England debut.",
      "The Manchester City starlet was initially named in the under-21 squad, having played for England at ever age group from under-15 level.",
      "Ange Postecoglou admits he expects to hold talks with Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis about his seven-game winless start during the international break.",
      "The former Tottenham boss said: \"I expect to have a discussion with the owner and everyone else at the football club about what we've embarked on here, where we're at and what we need to do for sure.\"",
      "Bukayo Saka claims he's \"hungry for more\" after reaching 100 Premier League goal involvements. The Arsenal winger, who netted a second-half penalty in the 2-0 win over West Ham, now has 55 goals and 45 assists to his name after also racking up his 200th top-flight appearance.",
      "However, Saka insists the best is yet to come, stating: \"It feels very good. But yes, knowing myself, I'm always hungry for more but in these moments, I need to not take it for granted especially after being out with a few injuries over the last few months.",
      "\"I don't take these things for granted anymore, so I'm really happy with that milestone and I want to push on for more.\"",
      "Oliver Glasner admits Crystal Palace's lack of a clinical edge looks to be the \"missing link\" that is preventing them from becoming a top team.",
      "Their 19-match unbeaten run was ended at Everton with the Eagles boss making his frustration clear.",
      "He said: “We’re massively disappointed, it hurts, I saw 60 or 70 minutes of fantastic performance, but we didn’t take our chances when we were on top. That’s happened a few times now, and we’re 12 games into the season with only one defeat, but I think that [not being clinical] is the missing link for us to be a top team in the Premier League.”",
      "Gary Neville has slammed Ruben Amorim for fostering an “excuse mentality” at Man United after the manager suggested negative comments from pundits was affecting his team.",
      "Amorim said his players were susceptible to taking media criticism to heart before the 2-0 win over Sunderland on Saturday. Neville and other high-profile ex-United players like Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes have been open in their concerns about Amorim’s lack of tactical flexibility.",
      "Neville has now responded to Amorim’s comments with a scathing rant about the culture at the club. “I’ve not got a lot of time for that. For a start, if pundits are getting in your head, you shouldn’t be playing for Manchester United. Simple as that,” he said on the Gary Neville podcast.",
      "“Do people not remember Alan Hansen criticising us, saying we’d win nothing with kids? That was the greatest and most successful centre-back of all time at that moment. Do they not think we got criticised during our careers? I’m sorry, you’re playing for Manchester United, it comes with the territory. You’ve got to step up.\"",
      "Eddie Howe admits that the international break comes at a bad time for Newcastle United, but admitted some relief after seeing off Nottingham Forest on the back of a tough week.",
      "The 2-0 victory over the City Ground side heaped pressure on Ange Postecoglou. But for Howe, it was all about his team holding their nerve during a tense affair on Tyneside, with two goals in the final half hour earning only Newcastle's second win of the season.",
      "Howe said: \"The break has probably come at a bad time for us with the momentum. We will take it and dust the players down and regroup. We started the season really well defensively. We have been solid and resilient. A good mix for us because you are only a goal away from winning a game.\"",
      "Erling Haaland has been declared a the \"greatest goalscorer to ever play in English football\", by Jamie Carragher.",
      "The Man City star scored for a ninth game in a row as he helped his side to victory at Brentford on Sunday. It was his 18th goal of the season for club and country.",
      "In light of another match-winning contribution Carragher said: \"I think we're watching the greatest goalscorer to ever play in English football. I honestly can't remember Jimmy Greaves, Dixie Dean and all those players from years ago. But I think of Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Harry Kane and Ian Rush for my club Liverpool.",
      "\"There's a difference for me between a great centre-forward or striker and a goalscorer. I think what we're witnessing now is something we've never seen before in our game.\"",
      "Pep Guardiola wrote another piece of Premier League history on Sunday.",
      "The Man City boss reached 250 Premier League wins in 349 which is faster than any other manager as it took Arsene Wenger 423. Sir Alex Ferguson took 404 games before the Premier League era.",
      "It also pushed City up to fifth in the table and Guardiola suggested that they will be back among the title contenders again after finishing last season empty-handed.",
      "He said: “We won a lot! Otherwise you cannot take this accolade without winning a lot of games. It’s an honour for me to be alongside Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger so I will invite them to a good dinner.",
      "“Maybe not in Manchester, maybe somewhere with more sun. No, we’ll do it in Manchester. It’s an honour, a pleasure to be part of that in the Premier League history.",
      "“I want to say thank you to the club, the organisation, the players and the staff that I had because we did it quicker, faster, better and really, really pleased. Now, let’s go for 250 more.”",
      "Pep Guardiola hailed match-winner Erling Haaland as “the best” striker in the business and also believes his side will be serious contenders for the title again.",
      "\"It’s just seven games for the Premier League,” he said. “I would say three weeks ago Liverpool apparently won the Premier League and now they have not.",
      "“It’s important to see the team better and better. Liverpool is an incredible team, like Arsenakl, the question is to improve and improve, the way we play, the way we defend, will help us to be close to fight.",
      "“I’m really pleased for this month since the Man United game. We are there and I have the feeling we are getting better and better.”",
      "Jack Grealish was Everton's match winner on Sunday and the Toffees have made their feelings clear as their loanee continues to be overlooked by England.",
      "He has been hugely impressive since joining Everton for the year, but is not back in the international picture.",
      "Man City fans will have held their breath when they saw Rodri limp off on Sunday.",
      "He missed almost all of last season and that was a huge reasons for their drop off.",
      "Pep Guardiola expects Rodri - who was forced off with a hamstring injury - to be out for two to three weeks.",
      "Jamie Carragher has doubled down on his criticism of Arne Slot's Liverpool side - whom he likened to a basketball team' this season - following their third defeat in a week.",
      "The former Red raised the issue after the first game of the season and has continued to stick with that theme.",
      "He said on Super Sunday Extra Time: \"My criticism of Liverpool being almost like a basketball team, again it has come back to haunt them.",
      "\"This thing about it being end to end in a game of football, Liverpool should be dominating a game like this with the changes of personnel Chelsea have got.\"",
      "It was all changed at the top of the Premier League.",
      "Stay tuned for all the reaction after wins for Arsenal and Man City - but another loss for Liverpool."

      "But Amorim’s side responded well against the promoted Black Cats, with first-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko sealing a much-needed victory before the international break.",
      "New goalkeeper Senne Lammens impressed on his debut as the hosts made five changes, with Mount – another of those brought in – giving them the lead inside eight minutes. Sunderland stopper Robin Roefs produced a string of fine saves but was beaten again in the 31st minute when Diogo Dalot’s long throw was flicked into the path of Sesko to score.",

      "Here’s a round-up of United news heading into the international break…",
      "Amorim said he wanted actions rather than words after Mount’s pre-match show of support. The midfielder said the squad are “100 per cent behind the gaffer,” before the Sunderland game, with the performance suggesting that was more than lip service to an under-pressure manager.",
      "When the United boss was told about Mount’s comments, he said: “I saw [that] today and I know they want to do their best, and I know they don’t want to change the coach all the time.",
      "“But, like I said during this week, to be with the manager is, ‘I will kill myself to go in every transition’. We need to show with actions.",
      "“And sometimes, when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end, they know that sometimes we can do better. So, I feel that during the week but we need to show that on the pitch, not just at home but also away.”",
      "The win over Sunderland may have eased some pressure but Gary Neville insists Amorim is “not off the hook”. The former United defender said winning the odd game is nowhere near enough for Amorim, who is yet to secure back-to-back league wins after almost a year in charge.",
      "“Manchester United win the odd game but that’s nowhere near enough. I don't think anybody would be kidded on by the fact that Manchester United beat Sunderland at home. The fact that it was even in doubt before the game is probably the problem in itself.”",
      "Sesko channelled his inner Roy Keane as he basked in his first Old Trafford goal. After opening his account in the loss at Brentford, the Slovenian was elated to score in a winning effort against the Black Cats after Mount’s well-taken opener.",
      "With a line that will resonate with the straight-talking club legend, Sesko told MUTV: “It’s my job to try to score as many goals as possible, try to win the game, try to help the team in every single situation and hopefully I get more moments like this.”",
      "On his dream-come-true moment against Sunderland, Sesko said: “To play for a club like this, even train every day, is an obvious pleasure and I’m looking forward to being back [after the international break].",
      "“It feels amazing [to score]. It feels even better because I helped the team to win the game because in the end, it's important to win the match. I try to help the team as much as possible.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford maintained his brilliant form at Barcelona as he struck a sensational volley against Sevilla, though his side were still heavily beaten. The England ace marked his latest Thomas Tuchel call-up by finding the net once again for the Catalan club.",
      "Pedri provided the ideal cross after Barca had pressed their rivals high up the field, with Rashford timing his run from the left flank perfectly before smashing it beyond Odysseas Vlachodimos - on loan from Newcastle United - with his left foot.",
      "The strike represented the seventh straight fixture in which Rashford has registered a goal contribution, taking his tally to three goals and five assists in 10 outings since his loan switch from Manchester United. Rashford boasts more contributions than United trio Bryan Mbeumo, Bruno Fernandes and Benjamin Sesko put together.",
      "The 27-year-old's heroics on Sunday proved futile, though, as Barcelona slumped to a 4-1 hammering. Ex-United forward Alexis Sanchez broke the deadlock from the penalty spot before Isaac Romero extended the hosts' advantage.",
      "Rashford's superb effort then arrived in first-half stoppage time. However, late strikes from Jose Angel Carmona and Akor Adams secured a major shock as Sevilla snatched all three points.",
      "For the first time this season, it was United and Amorim that enjoyed a positive weekend while Rashford did not. Goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko saw United pick up all three points against Sunderland at Old Trafford.",
      "Despite a disappointing start, with pressure on Ruben Amorim, United head into the break in tenth after winning for the third consecutive time on home soil. Barcelona meanwhile, had not lost this season prior to their 2-1 loss to Paris Saint-Germain earlier this week with Sevilla compounding their misery on Sunday.",
      "On their latest defeat, Hansi Flick said: \"The first half was not good for us, they played one against one and very aggressive.",
      "\"We had no solutions, that's not a good thing. But in the second half I really appreciate the team's reaction.",
      "\"I don't want to talk about the two goals, we don't want excuses. We have to focus on the first half, but the most important thing is the reaction. This defeat is important and after the break we will fight for all the titles. That's what we want, we are a good team.\"",

      "Gary Neville has slammed Ruben Amorim for fostering an “excuse mentality” at Manchester United after the manager suggested negative comments from pundits was affecting his team.",
      "Amorim said his players were susceptible to taking media criticism to heart before the 2-0 win over Sunderland on Saturday. Neville and other high-profile ex-United players like Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes have been open in their concerns about Amorim’s lack of tactical flexibility.",
      "The United manager has stubbornly stuck to his 3-4-2-1 formation and is convinced it will work out. But the 3-1 defeat by Brentford last weekend saw many openly questioning his job, which has been eased with the Sunderland victory.",
      "Neville has now responded to Amorim’s comments with a scathing rant about the culture at the club. “I’ve not got a lot of time for that. For a start, if pundits are getting in your head, you shouldn’t be playing for Manchester United. Simple as that,” he said on the Gary Neville podcast.",
      "“Do people not remember Alan Hansen criticising us, saying we’d win nothing with kids? That was the greatest and most successful centre-back of all time at that moment. Do they not think we got criticised during our careers? I’m sorry, you’re playing for Manchester United, it comes with the territory. You’ve got to step up.",
      "“Look, they’ve been hopeless in the system. Absolutely hopeless. Alright, it’s not the system, it’s you, the players, we can just start battering the players. I’ve mentioned the system because I’ve not liked certain things that I’ve seen, for instance Mason Mount playing left wingback. That can’t happen. Changing the back three all the time. Having two in midfield means that Bruno has to play in midfield. I don’t like that aspect of it.",
      "“So there are parts of the system that are a problem in the sense that they haven’t got the right players, or it’s meaning that Bruno’s not in his best position. The system does create problems, but he’s right in what he says, it’s not the entirety of the problem.",
      "\"The players are a problem. The manager is a problem. The whole thing is a problem if you’re losing football matches to the level that Manchester United have been doing then… I don’t know, I never blamed anybody else when we lost football matches.",
      "“I played in a dressing room that when you lost there was accountability. Why would you blame other people when you’re losing matches? That’s a pretty big problem itself. I’ve not got any time for it, excuse mentality, short cuts, blaming other people, it’s the worst thing you can do in life. I think they need to concentrate on doing their jobs, doing it well and winning matches, it’s the only thing that’s going to shut people up.”",
      "Goals from Mount and Benjamin Sesko gave them their third win from seven Premier League games on Saturday and moved United up to ninth place going into the international break.",

      "Referees’ chief Howard Webb has reportedly admitted to Manchester United that they were the victims of a big mistake in their defeat by Brentford last weekend. United lost 3-1 in west London in a result which piled pressure onto Ruben Amorim, but the club felt hard done by.",
      "Bruno Fernandes saw his penalty saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after Nathan Collins' foul on Bryan Mbeumo offered them a route back into the game. Collins was bailed out by his goalkeeper and got lucky twice as he escaped a red card for pulling back the United forward inside the box.",
      "Referee Craig Pawson opted against the dismissal and his decision was upheld by VAR, with a statement released to explain the reasoning. “The referee’s call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with Collins deemed to have pulled Mbeumo back,” it read. “VAR also checked the referee’s call of yellow card to Collins – and deemed that Mbeumo wasn’t in control of the ball.”",
      "That decision was questioned by many and had an obvious impact on the game, with Brentford keeping 11 players on the pitch and going on to score again. United felt aggrieved and The Daily Mail says that they wrote to the Professional Game Match Officials for an explanation.",
      "United chief executive Omar Berrada and technical director Jason Wilcox got a response from PGMO chief Webb, who accepted that Pawson and the VAR had made a mistake and Collins should have seen red. It is not the first time that Webb has conceded a high-profile error this season and ex-Premier League referee Mark Halsey was stunned at this one.",
      "Halsey told the Sun: “The statement from the Match Centre said that Mbeumo did not have control of the ball. It doesn’t say in law about having the ball under control.",
      "\"It’s about the likelihood of keeping control of the ball. “In my opinion, the Match Centre statement was absolute nonsense and it was a clear, clear denial of a goalscoring opportunity.”",
      "Webb also came out this week to defend the decision to overturn Arsenal’s penalty against Newcastle when Viktor Gyokeres clashed with Nick Pope. “The VAR checks the penalty,” Webb explained on Premier League's Match Officials Mic'd Up show.",
      "\"When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going in. That hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee.”",

      "Senne Lammens made a bright start to his Manchester United career this weekend, but as history shows, a strong debut doesn't always guarantee a permanent spot in the first team. This is a lesson that former United goalkeeper Dean Henderson learned the hard way.",
      "After a sparkling debut for the club in a League Cup match against Luton back in 2020, Henderson was tipped for big things. Many, including then-boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, saw him not only as United's future No. 1, but also England's. However, neither of these predictions came true.",
      "With David de Gea firmly cemented as first-choice keeper, Henderson found chances hard to come by. He later hinted that promises had been broken and admitted that his patience at Old Trafford \"wasted\" a significant part of his career.",
      "After joining United's academy in 2011, Henderson took his first steps into senior football on loan at Stockport County. His breakthrough, however, came at Sheffield United, where his standout performances in the club's 2019/20 Premier League campaign solidified his reputation as one of England's most promising talents.",
      "Interest in Henderson was high at the end of the season, but he chose to stay at United after reportedly being told he'd be the first choice in a year's time.",
      "Things initially started brightly. After making what Henderson described as a \"dream\" debut for the club, he went on to make 26 appearances in all competitions in 2020/21.",
      "\"I dreamt about this my whole life!\" Henderson wrote on social media after his first appearance in a United shirt. \"Unbelievable feeling to make my debut for the club I love! Clean sheet and a win to top it off!!!\"",
      "Yet when the 2021/22 campaign got underway, it became obvious that De Gea wasn't going anywhere and would retain his status as first choice - leaving Henderson understandably disappointed.",
      "\"To sit there and waste 12 months is criminal really, at my age. I was fuming,\" he told talkSPORT in 2022. \"I turned so many good loans down last summer for that reason [being promised No.1 spot], and they wouldn't let me go. It was frustrating.\"",
      "Henderson decided to take control of his own destiny, hastily arranging a temporary switch to Nottingham Forest ahead of new boss Erik ten Hag's summer 2022 arrival. \"I didn't really want the manager to come in and be able to see me in training because I knew he'd probably want to keep me,\" Henderson explained.",
      "\"So I tried to do it all before I left for the season, I told all the hierarchy I need to go and play football. I don't want to be here playing second fiddle. And it panned out so I was almost gone before the manager came in the door and I haven't spoken to him since.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "At the City Ground, Henderson finally secured the regular minutes he'd been desperate for. However, an untimely thigh problem sidelined him for the second half of the campaign, disrupting the progress he'd at last begun to make.",
      "After a permanent switch to Crystal Palace in 2023, he initially shared goalkeeping duties with Sam Johnstone. However, by the 2024/25 campaign, Henderson had truly made his mark - securing his spot as Palace's top-choice goalkeeper.",
      "He ended the season on the highest of notes, saving a penalty in Palace's stunning 1-0 triumph over Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Now, he stands as a pivotal figure in the squad as the club embarks on its maiden European journey in the Conference League this season.",
      "United must be ruing their decision to let Henderson leave, at least to some degree. The man who was blocking his path, David de Gea, left the same summer he did, and De Gea's successor, Andre Onana, endured a torrid two-year spell between the sticks before being loaned out to Trabzonspor last month.",
      "In the weeks since, Altay Bayindir has been given the task of filling the void, with varying degrees of success. However, there is a glimmer of hope. Summer recruit Lammens made a promising impression during Saturday's 2-0 victory over Sunderland, pulling off a couple of key saves to secure United's first clean sheet of the season.",
      "The Belgian also stood out for his composure, both on the ball and when facing shots, and seems well on his way to establishing himself as United's No. 1. But as Henderson's cautionary tale has shown us, a positive start doesn't guarantee anything.",

      "And yet, instead of dwelling on the issue, Bayindir showed his maturity and celebrated with his teammate after he made a solid first appearance for United. This is exactly what the Reds need now more than ever.",
      "Yes, there has been a lack of quality at times under Amorim but team spirit has been clear for all to see. Fortunately, what we saw from Bayindir is a player who will not sulk and mope around the club because he has missed out on a start.",

      "Naturally, you wouldn't want to lose that competitive drive and the will to fight for your place in the team. From Amorim's point of view, he'll be hopeful he sees this squad take inspiration from Bayindir and Lammens, striking the right balance between competitiveness and team unity.",

      "Fedorenko joined United from the Blades to become the academy lead scout for players aged 9-11. He was promoted to head of local recruitment in 2021 and named head of academy recruitment two years later.",
      "United's academy recruitment has been narrowed to the British shores in the post-Brexit era, and Fedorenko played a crucial role alongside Cox in signing Chido Obi from Arsenal.",
      "Torpey is a former City academy employee. He joined City in 2014 and gradually worked his way up in their academy to become the head of coaching between Under-15s and Under-23s.",

      "Ruben Amorim has said not even the Pope could make him change his Manchester United formation.",
      "Many argued Amorim's stubbornness would cost him his job following defeat to Brentford, but he made a significant change to secure a much-needed win against Sunderland.",
      "Senne Lammens punted the ball from almost every goal-kick. Diogo Dalot launched long throw-ins into the penalty area. There was a simplicity to United's approach that was reminiscent of a bygone era.",
      "United were direct and reverted to basics. It was a greatly effective change from Amorim, who secured a comfortable 2-0 victory to survive during the October international break.",
      "Amorim even ditched the beige chinos in favour of wearing a full tracksuit on the touchline, which felt appropriate given United played like a Stoke City team put together by Tony Pulis.",
      "There is no doubting that Amorim is a stubborn manager, but a leopard can change its spots.",
      "The 40-year-old did what was necessary against Sunderland - he tweaked to secure a victory. And it would be unfair to suggest United only secured the win due to their newfound directness, as every player delivered strong performances and there were some quality individual contributions on the ball.",
      "Amorim was asked if he was frustrated at the timing of the international break, given the team could build momentum, and responded: “There is no momentum with our team.",
      "\"So with a break, without a break… we know what happened when we win one game. And then for me, the frustration is not to see the same team at home and away.",
      "\"And you saw today, we didn't play well in the second half, but we were focused. We fight second balls. Ben [Sesko] was there to touch the ball all the time. So, these small things are going to help us win games. And sometimes you have your moments. First half, we had a lot of moments.",
      "\"But then in the second half, if we cannot play well, they will not play well, and that is the way a big team play during the season. So, that is the big frustration.”",
      "United sources were forced to clarify that Amorim retained the backing of the board after the Brentford defeat, communicating for the second time this season that he was safe.",
      "However, it's rare for a manager to recover once those enquiries begin and a win against newly promoted opposition at Old Trafford won't save Amorim if the situation sours when domestic football resumes.",
      "He was right to bemoan the team's lack of consistency when he spoke during his post-Sunderland press conference, because that is the problem undermining any progress.",
      "The failure to win back-to-back Premier League games is not good enough, although the events of the last week have made the upcoming Liverpool fixture an entirely different proposition.",
      "United will take on Liverpool at Anfield after the October international break. That game looked ominous for Amorim in the fixture list, but Liverpool are suddenly in crisis after losing against Galatasaray and Chelsea.",
      "There was a sense that Liverpool had been fortunate in securing late wins against Bournemouth, Newcastle and Burnley. They hadn't performed well and were bailed out by a few late goals.",
      "Liverpool will lick their wounds and the bookmakers will make them heavy favourites to beat United at Anfield, but the door is clearly ajar for Amorim to secure a tenure-making result.",
      "Slot has form for complaining when Liverpool's opponents don't play into their hands. He dislikes when a team plays direct, like United did against Sunderland - but there is no right way to play football.",
      "\"I'm not too sure if I saw a football match. It was set-piece after set-piece, long throws,\" said Slot after facing Newcastle. The Liverpool manager admitted he doesn't like being dragged into a battle.",
      "United have not won away at Anfield since January 2016 when Wayne Rooney scored a late goal to settle a scrappy encounter, and Amorim would snap your hand off for a similarly dogged win in Merseyside.",
      "The Sunderland performance provided a blueprint to beat the Premier League champions.",

      "“It’s rotation, everybody has to be ready to play. We need to win this game, every opponent is different so we try to find the best characteristics to win this game.”",
      "Ruben Amorim gave a very diplomatic answer when asked why Senne Lammens had been chosen ahead of Altay Bayindir before Manchester United's clash with Sunderland.",
      "The United boss would have been well within his rights to point to the plethora of errors made by Bayindir when explaining his team selection, but of course he was never likely to do so. Bayindir's confidence is clearly shot and so announcing to the world that he had been dropped would have been a foolish move.",
      "However, if rotation really was the reason he had been left out of the team, there's every chance he will return to the starting XI in the not-too-distant future. If Lammens' showing on Saturday is anything to go by, that simply cannot happen.",
      "United had played seven games in all competitions prior to Saturday's win over Sunderland and they had failed to keep a clean sheet in any of them. Bayindir started the six league outings while Andre Onana started the chastening League Cup exit at the hands of Grimsby.",
      "While Sunderland offered little in the way of an attacking threat on Saturday, the confidence and calmness that Lammens brought to the backline didn't go unnoticed. When goalkeepers make mistakes it has a knock-on effect on the rest of the team and United looked far more assured on Saturday with Lammens between the posts.",
      "Of course, it is still very early days with Lammens and to judge him on one performance against a Sunderland side who offered very little would be foolish.",
      "But the Belgian goalkeeper didn't put a foot wrong against the Black Cats and should be the automatic first choice for the upcoming games.",
      "A lack of consistency has plagued United in recent years, but Amorim is doing himself no favours by failing to settle on a regular first-choice goalkeeper.",
      "If the United boss wants consistent displays then choosing a first choice goalkeeper would be a good start.",

      "Mason Mount fist-pumped and exhaled to the Stretford End after firing Manchester United into the lead against Sunderland.",
      "Mount finished brilliantly to open the scoring against the Black Cats on Saturday afternoon.",
      "Ruben Amorim desperately needed a victory at Old Trafford and made five changes to his starting team, which included the decision to bench Matheus Cunha in favour of starting Mount.",
      "It took just eight minutes for Mount to vindicate his selection and the standing ovation for the midfielder when he was substituted spoke volumes. It was probably his best performance for United.",
      "\"It was obviously a big moment for us today,\" said Mount. \"I mean every game [is big], but today was a lot of pressure on the performance, on the win.",
      "\"Being at home, coming off obviously a difficult result, I think it was so important for us to start sharp. That was something that we obviously spoke about in the dressing room.",
      "\"Bruno spoke about before the game, before kick-off in the huddle. So I felt that, I felt the energy at the beginning of the game and obviously to get the goal, I think really settled us.",
      "\"And then to go on and get another goal, going into half-time 2-0 up, you're in a good place. I don't think we stepped off at all in the second half, it was kept a bit cagey, but it was massive to get a clean sheet as well. So yeah, a very important win for us.\"",
      "Mount continued: \"I think it was massive to really start sharp today. Big character to step up after a difficult game and we did that. Now we've got to push on, we obviously have a bit of a break now before the next game, but we need to take positives from this game and take them into the next one.\"",
      "Amorim has admitted he \"loves\" Mount. \"I see myself as bringing a lot of energy into the team and setting off the press at times, being a bit of a catalyst going forward,\" he reflected.",
      "\"So, yeah, that's always something that I focus on, helping the people around me and really bringing the energy. And to get the goal was obviously massive for me, getting the first goal of the season at home in the Premier League. Important. So, yeah, I really enjoyed that.\"",
      "Mount rounded off an 18-pass sequence - the most passes United have made before a league goal for two years - in the style akin to previous holders of the number seven shirt.",
      "There were green shoots after United's setback against Brentford last weekend. Amorim spoke about negative press potentially affecting the dressing room before Sunderland, but Mount insisted the players are focused on delivering what the manager wants to see on the pitch.",
      "When asked if external noise permeates the dressing room, Mount said: \"No. For us, it's just focusing on what the manager wants and that's in training. And then when it comes to the games, doing exactly what he asked for. And I think, as you see today, we stuck to the job in hand.",
      "\"Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.\"",
      "Mount praised the contributions of Senne Lammens and Benjamin Sesko, while reiterating that the squad is fighting together and behind the manager to 'continue moving forward'.",
      "He said: \"The defenders were amazing. So that was really important for everyone. I mean, for Ben [Sesko], scoring his goal was so important. I'm absolutely over the moon for him.",
      "\"And obviously, Senne [Lammens] coming in as well. It was a solid performance. Any danger of them pressing, he puts it into Ben and we work off that. I think he kind of released the pressure a lot today.",
      "\"And everyone was around him. Altay [Bayindir] was around him. Tom [Heaton] was around him before the game. And that shows the togetherness we have.",
      "\"Obviously, even in this season, we've gone through ups and downs, but we're together. And we'll continue to be together with the manager, with the staff, to continue moving forward.\"",
      "Speaking about his relationship with Amorim, Mount added: \"I have a good relationship with the manager. I don't think it's any better than all the other lads. I think I have the experience of playing a similar formation to what he likes. As I have played it before in the past.",
      "\"So, knowing the roles and what he wants out of the team resonates with me because I've done it before. So, I think that's something that I obviously understand.",
      "\"I think all the players understand it now. But I think at the beginning, especially, it was something that maybe he could lean on me because I know the positions.\"",
      "Mount admitted United's players were hurt after losing against Brentford. \"It's difficult sometimes when you only have one game a week because there's a lot of time to think,\" he said.",
      "\"After a game like Brentford, we're hurt. As a team, as a staff, because we know we can do better. It really hurts us, obviously, as a club as well. It feels like a long time until the next game.",
      "\"But when that game does come around, you're prepared. You're ready to really start sharp, as I said before. That was our goal from the beginning. Because we know if we start sharp and we're on the front foot, especially at home, then it can definitely go our way.\"",

      "Manchester United returned to winning ways with a much-needed 2-0 win at home to Sunderland on Saturday afternoon.",
      "First-half goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko eased the pressure on Reds boss Ruben Amorim after a week of intense scrutiny of his position at Old Trafford. Amorim's side were lacklustre in defeat at Brentford last weekend but enjoyed a positive day at M16 against the Black Cats.",
      "United will now have the international break to reflect on a difficult start to the season. Last term, the club finished 15th in the top flight—its lowest-ever Premier League finish.",
      "But Amorim has almost certainly earned himself some breathing room ahead of United's next fixture - a clash at bitter rivals Liverpool on October 19.",
      "The Reds' win over Sunderland has moved them up to tenth in the table for now, and supporters will have been pleased to see a positive debut from new goalkeeper Senne Lammens. Benjamin Sesko also impressed in a good afternoon for United.",

      "However, he did play a key role in Chelsea's opening goal during their impressive 2-1 win at home to Liverpool on Saturday evening. One moment of contention at Stamford Bridge saw Garnacho clash with Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai in the penalty area - an incident which saw referee Antony Taylor wave away appeals for a spot-kick to the home side.",

      "It is claimed that United did not want to make a 'public fuss' about the situation and appreciated Webb's rational explanation for why the mistake was made. Of course, had Collins been sent off the context of the game could have been a lot different with United having roughly 20 minutes against ten men to seek an equaliser.",

Do people not remember Alan Hansen criticising us, saying we’d win nothing with kids? That was the greatest and most successful centre-back of all time at that moment. Do they not think we got criticised during our careers? I’m sorry, you’re playing for Manchester United, it comes with the territory. You’ve got to step up. The players are a problem. The manager is a problem. The whole thing is a problem if you’re losing football matches to the level that Manchester United have been doing then… I don’t know, I never blamed anybody else when we lost football matches.",

      "Brown told MUTV:",
      "Listen, I think you’re going to see him in that position quite a lot this season and he knows he needs to do better there. You see him get on that left foot, with that much space, and he normally just curls that one in the bottom or top corner. But he was slightly off balance and it wasn’t quite meant to be. I still don’t think he’s at his best and he caused a lot of problems today without maybe the end product, but still the assist was still there. The end product is a little bit off but, again, he’s a brilliant signing for us and exactly what we needed.",

      "Manchester United won 2-0 against Sunderland in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon.",
      "United made the perfect start to the game when taking an early lead through Mason Mount, and Benjamin Sesko extended the advantage as United led by two heading into the interval.",
      "Ruben Amorim needed a positive result after losing against Brentford last weekend, and there were huge cheers at the final whistle as United moved into the top half of the Premier League.",
      "Here are the talking points and moments you might have missed at Old Trafford:",
      "Lammens sparkles on his debut",
      "Lammens finally made his debut after his deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp. Fans had wondered when Lammens would be given his first start, and it felt sensible to play him against Sunderland.",
      "The bar is low for Lammens to impress at United, given that supporters have watched error-prone goalkeepers Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir underperform over the last few seasons.",
      "That was highlighted when Lammens made a good save to deny a powerful shot from Granit Xhaka near the end of the first half. It was a decent save from Lammens - but a stop any goalkeeper worth their salt should make - and it was met by huge applause from each corner of the ground.",
      "Then Lammens came to claim a cross into the box with authority just minutes later - and the reaction from the crowd was so loud you would have thought they were celebrating a goal.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt sprinted to Lammens to congratulate him after the final whistle. Lammens also received a hug from Harry Maguire and a high five from Luke Shaw.",
      "Mount's first pump to the crowd",
      "Amorim made five changes to his starting XI to face Sunderland and Mount was selected to start over Matheus Cunha, a decision which was vindicated just eight minutes into the contest.",
      "Mbeumo picked out Mount in the box, but he still had plenty to do. Mount brought the ball down with his left foot and the touch was slightly heavy, although that didn't stop him from finishing intelligently.",
      "Amorim reacted on the touchline by calmly giving a simple thumbs up to his coaching staff, however, Mount's celebration in front of the Stretford End was a tad more enthusiastic.",
      "Mount roared to the terraces and passionately fist-pumped as his teammates prepared for the restart. You can tell the 26-year-old genuinely cares when he plays, and that goes a long way in the modern game.",
      "The towel worked a treat",
      "Amorim wore a full tracksuit against Sunderland and United scored a goal that Tony Pulis, who famously wore a full tracksuit during his managerial days in the Premier League, would have been proud of.",
      "Dalot launched a long throw into the box for Sesko's goal to make it 2-0. The Slovenia international reacted well to the flick-on to score his second goal for United in a week.",
      "Before taking the throw-in, Dalot dried the ball with a towel to improve his grip, which worked a treat. Arsenal have enjoyed success with Mikel Arteta in charge by making the most of the 'dark arts' and the introduction of towels around the side of the pitch was a no-brainer for United.",
      "Following Sesko's goal, Dalot created another opportunity with a long throw-in and he benefited from the towel again. United must do everything they can to give themselves the best chance of winning.",
      "Amorim learned from Chelsea",
      "It was disappointing to see Casemiro receive a second yellow card against Chelsea, as United were cruising into half-time before he foolishly made a cynical foul, which meant both sides had 10 men for the second half.",
      "However, Amorim learned from that episode by substituting Casemiro off against Sunderland just minutes after he had received a yellow card for bringing Brian Brobbey to the ground.",
      "Amorim could not take any risks with five minutes remaining and introduced Manuel Ugarte.",
      "No banner, no problem",
      "Amorim emerged from the tunnel for kick-off shortly after his players had walked out from the dressing room. And there wasn't much applause for Amorim from the Stretford End.",
      "It was also interesting that \"the good days are coming\" banner could not be spotted among the banners and flags that were unfurled. That banner was seen in the Stretford End before the Burnley game last month, but it appeared to be left at home after a bad result against Brentford last weekend.",
      "Amorim did receive some applause from fans in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, though.",
      "Matchgoing fans have continued to back Amorim, despite him failing to give them a reason to, but the muted reception for his emergence from the tunnel suggested a few have started to change their minds.",
      "Amorim desperately needed a win and will be relieved to have secured three points. His name was chanted loudly in the final seconds of the game - Amorim just needs to continue to win games.",

      "Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has advised the current squad to continue listening to Ruben Amorim after the head coach accused punditry comments of seeping into his players.",
      "Before the victory over Sunderland, Rooney was critical of Amorim's tactics suggesting that he had 'lost faith' in the ideas that the Portuguese coach was trying to implement. The former England striker was not alone in these views with other ex-players including Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt also sharing those opinions.",
      "On Friday, in his pre-match press conference, Amorim explained how he felt that comments made by legends of the club were starting to filter into his squad. \"I understand when people think 'what would this team be like in a different system?'\" He said.",
      "\"Maybe this team would win more games. But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles, even if we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"That is my point with the players. I don't want to change your mind, but my players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"They have to believe in me. So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys [pundits and journalists] when you say the problem of our team is the system.\"",
      "Following the victory on Saturday afternoon, Rooney was asked for his response to Amorim's press conference comments. \"I’m sure they are,\" the forward said on The Wayne Rooney Show when questioned on whether the players know what he has said about Amorim's system.",
      "\"I said when I made the comments, it’s not something that I really wanted to do but I feel you have to tell the truth on it. Ruben Amorim himself has been critical about the players.",
      "\"It wasn’t long ago he was telling us it was the worst Manchester United team in the history of the club. That’s him being honest.",
      "\"If that’s his thoughts, that’s his thoughts. For the players, they have to keep focused on what they’re doing.",
      "\"He’s the manager, listen to what he’s saying and tactically what he wants to try and win games. That’s the only way it changes, unfortunately.",
      "\"I’ve been there as a player and been criticised as a player. You have to just try and focus on your job and win games.",
      "\"You’re at Manchester United. It’s still one of the biggest clubs in the world so you have to expect to be criticised when you don’t win games or play well.",
      "\"On the flip side of that, the benefits of playing well and winning games are huge.\" United now head into the international break with plenty of the current squad jetting off to different corners of the world to represent their countries.",
      "Upon their return, United will be welcomed back with one of their biggest games of the season when they visit Liverpool. Arne Slot's side are under increasing pressure after losing three straight matches in all competitions before the international break.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim has, arguably, bought himself more time than some other managers would have been afforded at Manchester United due to his handling of the difficult questions posed to him by the media.",
      "United supporters have by and large warmed to the Portuguese head coach as he has often spoken with honesty and integrity which are admirable qualities. Amorim could never once be described as sugar-coating or skirting the main issues that have hindered the club since he arrived almost a year ago.",
      "While results have been largely terrible, there's a feeling that something is building at United which never seemed to be the case under Erik ten Hag. While the Dutchman wilted to his players and altered his philosophies - which was ultimately his undoing - Amorim has stuck to his guns and when the performances have been good, they have been much better than other the previous regime.",
      "However, this campaign has started with mediocre performances and results - at best. This has led to obvious questions about the Portuguese's tactical approach, not only within the press pack, but also among legendary figures at the club.",
      "Wayne Rooney went as far as to say that he'd \"lost faith\" in Amorim's tactics, which was a damning indictment of the head coach's ideology. In response, Amorim insisted that he did not want to change anyone's opinions, but he warned critics that comments were seeping into his dressing room and altering the mindset of his team.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "For once, Amorim appears to have made a minor misstep in his off-field communication. While he's right to feel concerned by the impact of pundits and journalists' comments influencing his players, the answer is not to warn critics against making those comments.",
      "Instead, the Portuguese head coach should be taking a more inward approach, and addressing the mentality of those players in the dressing room who are being affected by such comments from the outside world. Rightly or wrongly, criticism of this team comes with the territory of being part of United.",
      "They are one of the world's most widely supported clubs and every fan, media outlet and former player has an opinion on them. The criticism has become even more intense after the period of mediocrity that has followed Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.",
      "Until United win the Premier League again, that will continue to pile up. So the answer is either sign players who have the mentality needed to represent such a club, or teach those that are already here to have tougher skins.",
      "The idea that comments from the outside are leading players to question the manager is, frankly, unbelievable. Players should be above that and live in their own bubble.",
      "Yes, it is harder than ever before due to social media providing no escape but, at the end of the day, the players at Carrington are paid handsomely to rise above that. Amorim's rebuild of this team is not complete and, hopefully from his perspective, the Portuguese can remove those from the squad who he feels are struggling to handle the pressure because if he doesn't it will, ultimately, be his job in the line instead.",

He primarily focuses on sports content, with specific expertise in and a passion for football, darts, horse racing, snooker, cricket, Formula One, as well as American football.",
      "Manchester United and manager Ruben Amorim could be gearing up for a significant January transfer window, provided the Portuguese boss remains at the helm at Old Trafford.",
      "The club have only managed to secure 10 points from their first seven Premier League matches this season. With three losses already under their belt, not to mention a deeply disappointing defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup, Amorim is feeling the heat.",
      "A 2-0 home victory against Sunderland on Saturday alleviated some of these worries, but a challenging trip to Anfield looms and a poor result there could negate any progress made. If Amorim stays in charge until January, it's inevitable that some squad changes will need to occur.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Red Devils have been crying out for a reliable and confident goalkeeper for some time. Andre Onana was a costly purchase from Inter Milan that didn't pan out, setting the club back nearly £50million. Altay Bayindir has also failed to make his mark, reports the Mirror.",
      "Following a series of costly mistakes from both goalkeepers, with the former now loaned out to Trabzonspor, promising Belgian talent Senne Lammens was brought in on deadline day for an initial £18.2m. He had caught the eye in the Belgian Pro League and supporters were delighted to see him given his debut against Sunderland.",
      "Expectations had fallen so dramatically that routine saves during this fixture were met with applause. However, Lammens appeared composed on his maiden outing for the club, so much so that supporters could be heard chanting: \"Are you [Peter] Schmeichel in disguise?\"",
      "A brilliant stop moments before the interval to thwart Granit Xhaka capped off a composed 90 minutes between the sticks. Most crucially, he looked commanding when dealing with deliveries into the penalty area from set-pieces and wide positions.",
      "It remains premature to determine whether Lammens will prove to be the answer, but should he fail to convince in the coming months, a substantial sum may need to be invested in a highly-regarded goalkeeper.",
      "Porto's Diogo Costa has been Portugal's first choice for considerable time and is only 26 years old. His deal runs until 2027, and he is yet to commit to fresh terms. This contract allegedly contains a release clause worth £65m and Sky Switzerland claimed that Amorim's team had expressed interest during the summer before securing Lammens.",
      "While one Portuguese star could be making his way to Old Trafford, another might be on his way out. MEN Sport reports that Saudi Pro League clubs who offered a £100m package for club captain Fernandes this summer may return with a similar offer in January.",
      "Despite Fernandes being United's go-to man on numerous occasions and arguably their best player, it might not be the worst time to cash in. His contract is set to expire in 2027, by which time he will be nearing 33 years of age.",
      "The main factor, however, is Amorim's unwillingness to change his system, making the idea of Fernandes' departure less far-fetched. The Portuguese maestro has been pushed into a deeper midfield role rather than his preferred No. 10 position and often appears uncomfortable in defensive situations.",
      "Amorim has stated that not even the Pope could persuade him to alter his setup, meaning as long as he remains at the helm, Fernandes may have to adapt. The Daily Mail has even reported that Fernandes is dissatisfied with his current playing position.",
      "A fee of £100m, if that is indeed the potential price tag for a 31-year-old Fernandes, could significantly bolster the club's midfield if reinvested. Brighton's Carlos Baleba could be considered as a defensive midfield option, with Bayern Munich's Aleksandar Pavlovic also a possible alternative, according to German publication BILD.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo, who emerged as a dynamic box-to-box player alongside the more defensive Declan Rice for England at Euro 2024, could be brought back into the first-team fold. Losing a player of Fernandes' calibre may seem absurd, but if such an offer were to come in, it would be difficult to refuse.",
      "One thing that has become apparent at United, with the new season in full swing, is the urgent need for a left-sided centre-back. Luke Shaw simply isn't up to scratch, and his performance in the Manchester derby drew harsh criticism from Roy Keane.",
      "It's unclear what funds will be available to United in January, but if the club wants to support Amorim, an ideal signing would be Sporting CP's Goncalo Inacio. The 24-year-old, who won two league titles under Amorim, fits his system well and would slot in perfectly to the left of Matthijs de Ligt.",
      "A Bola reported over the summer that both United and Liverpool were interested in Inacio and a £52m release clause is included in his current contract, which runs until 2027. Inacio is a regular for his country and helped them win the UEFA Nations League this year.",
      "It seems written in the stars that Inacio will land in Manchester to bolster the club's defence and with his contract expiring soon, Amorim's former employers might be persuaded to let him go.",
      "Inacio, Baleba and a new goalkeeper would considerably strengthen United's spine and mean the club's ownership group Ineos will have given Amorim everything he needs to be a success at Old Trafford.",

      "Former referee Keith Hackett has slammed ex-Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho for his on-pitch behaviour. The Argentina international joined Chelsea this summer in a £40million deal - which includes a 10 per cent sell-on fee.",
      "The 21-year-old became United's fourth-highest sale in history - following Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria. Garnacho has made five appearances for Enzo Maresca's side so far, but is yet to score or provide an assist for the Blues.",
      "However, he did play a key role in Chelsea's opening goal during their impressive 2-1 win at home to Liverpool on Saturday evening. One moment of contention at Stamford Bridge saw Garnacho clash with Liverpool's Dominik Szoboszlai in the penalty area - an incident which saw referee Antony Taylor wave away appeals for a spot-kick to the home side.",
      "And Hackett, who refereed in the Premier League for two seasons during the early 1990s, has now had his say on Garnacho, sharing his belief that the winger's behaviour is influencing referees' decisions against him.",
      "\"There's no doubt that there’s exaggeration,\" he told Football Insider. \"In these situations, players think; 'I'll work to [try and] make sure I get a penalty kick by tumbling and rumbling'.",
      "\"Sometimes, that's exactly what the referee sees. He sees an incident, and then the theatrics, and it works against what the player wants out of it. Referees are not daft, so they prepare. And we all know that he exaggerates.",
      "\"The sadness is that on the occasions when we don't feel the pain he does, and he has been fouled, he doesn't get it because referees are conditioned against him.",
      "\"The manager should bring in Howard Webb, involve Garnacho, and watch some clips with him. That's not helping the club, that would be keeping the yellow cards down... He needs to know how his antics are possibly influencing referees against him.\"",

      "Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko promised he will continue to improve after scoring against Sunderland.",
      "Sesko scored his second goal for the club in a 2-0 win against the Black Cats at Old Trafford.",
      "The Slovenia international reacted quickly to poke home at the Stretford End in the 31st minute, which extended United's advantage following an opening goal from Mason Mount.",
      "Sesko celebrated by leaping into the air and he was clearly delighted during his post-match interview with MUTV. \"It feels amazing,\" he said. \"It feels even better because I helped the team win the game. Because in the end, it's important to win the match. I try to help the team as much as possible.",
      "\"The atmosphere afterwards [following the second goal] was unbelievable. It's something I've been dreaming about - jumping high in the stadium like that. My dream came true.",
      "\"It's my job to try to score as many goals as possible, try to win the game, try to help the team in every single situation and hopefully I get more moments like this.\"",
      "Sesko was asked whether fans have seen the best of him and responded: \"No, not yet. There's loads to come. I'm still getting used to it more and more to read the players, to be connected with them even more. I believe I can be even better and I will try to show that.\"",
      "Speaking about the difference between the Premier League and Bundesliga, Sesko said: \"I would say it's way quicker and you have less time in general. This is one of the biggest changes, I would say. Everyone is really physical and athletic, but I'm getting used to it. I'll come to this level soon.",
      "\"To play for a club like this, even train every day, is an obvious pleasure and I'm looking forward to being back [after the international break].\"",
      "United signed Sesko for €76.5million (£66.4m) plus €8.5m (£7.3m) in add-ons from RB Leipzig.",
      "Sesko scored 39 goals in 87 appearances during his two-year stint with Leipzig.",

      "Manchester United supporters sang the praises of new goalkeeper Senne Lammens following his victorious debut for the Reds. Lammens, 23, made his eagerly anticipated first appearance for United in Saturday's 2-0 win over Sunderland at home.",
      "Lammens justified his manager's confidence with a composed display, producing a spectacular diving stop to thwart Granit Xhaka's long-range effort in the opening period before blocking Chemsdine Talbi's attempt with his legs in the closing stages.",
      "Following the 23-year-old's intervention, the Stretford End sang: \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\", paying tribute to their iconic former goalkeeper, Peter.",
      "Amorim will be thrilled with Lammens' showing and the outcome, which relieves the burden on his role ahead of the upcoming international break.",
      "The fixture was portrayed as a crucial fixture for the Reds manager, amid reports that United were considering alternatives to replace him after a dismal 11 months at the helm and a dreadful beginning to the current campaign. Prior to Sunderland's arrival, his team had suffered defeat in four of their initial seven matches.",
      "Opening-half strikes from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko provided the ideal remedy, alongside a Sunderland spot-kick that was reversed after a VAR examination. \"That is the kind of game where when we're not playing well we're defending well,\" Amorim told BBC Sport after giving the perfect reply to his doubters.",
      "\"We had our moments, we were focussed and competitive. Not the perfect performance. Senne did really well. We were a competitive and adult team today.",
      "\"We need to win these games with a clean sheet. Good for us.",
      "Mount also spoke about Lammens' debut. He said: \"It's crucial in the Premier League keeping clean sheets, you have opportunities to score and then to maintain the clean sheet in the second half was so vital. He was solid, when we were under pressure, the option was Ben [Sesko] and we worked off that.",
      "\"Buzzing for him, everyone was around him today, it can be tough making your first start we want to be together and I felt that today so we keep moving forward.\"",

      "Ex-Premier League referee Mike Dean has offered his thoughts on a controversial few minutes during Manchester United's clash against Sunderland at Old Trafford. Goals from Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko put Ruben Amorim's side in control, but the visitors looked set to have a chance at pulling one back just before half-time.",
      "The incident involved United's second goal-scorer Sesko with VAR recommending a pitchside review after a penalty was awarded when he appeared to kick Trai Hume in the head when trying to clear a long throw-in. However, no contact was made which saw referee Stuart Atwell changing his decision.",
      "The Premier League Match Centre on X stated: \"#MUNSUN – 45+3’ VAR OVERTURN After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of penalty to Sunderland.\"",
      "\"Referee announcement: “After review, there is no foul by the Manchester United player. He does not make contact with the head of the attacker. As the ball is out of play when the decision was made, the final decision is corner kick.”\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"The issue I have, we have referees as VARs and assistant referees as assistant VARs,\" he said. \"For some reason today, we've got an assistant referee as VAR and an assistant VAR. So they don't really know what's happened.",
      "\"For me, there's no contact whatsoever. He shouldn't have been sent to the screen, it should have been cleared on the field.\"",
      "Dean later corrected himself by saying: \"The pictures [VAR] Neil [Davies] was seeing, it looked like it was not given on-field. The referee actually gave it on field and I had a bit of go [at the VAR], but actually it was the right call to get involved.\"",
      "Even though a good process was followed, the former official's words about assistant referees running VAR are still quite interesting.",
      "United were involved in some VAR controversy last weekend when Nathan Collins was only shown a yellow card for dragging back Bryan Mbeumo in the penalty area. That would have been deemed the correct decision had the Brentford defender attempted to play the ball, but he did not and thus he should have been dismissed.",
      "On this occasion however, the correct decision was made with United remaining two goals in front and therefore pressure on Amorim is likely to decrease.",

      "The 25-year-old was cast aside at Old Trafford by Ruben Amorim and secured a permanent transfer to Real Betis after a fruitful loan spell last season. And while the Brazilian is flourishing in Spain, he endured a torrid period throughout his stint in the north west after being recruited by his former Ajax boss, Erik ten Hag, in a staggering £86m transfer back in 2022.",
      "Across 96 appearances for the club, Antony managed a meagre tally of just 12 goals and five assists for United. In comparison, he has already accumulated 10 goals and six assists from just 30 matches for Real Betis.",
      "Antony has explained he had previously come close to sealing terms with Liverpool prior to his switch to United. However, while his stint with the Red Devils may not have proceeded according to plan, he maintains he harbours no regrets regarding how his tenure transpired.",
      "When asked by ESPN Brazil if he wished he could change anything about his time with United, he said: \"Look, I don't think so, because everything has a 'why.' If I went there, it was because God wanted me to be there, to learn and to go through the things I went through.",
      "\"Today, I feel a much better man as well as a father. Before I signed for United, yes, I was close to signing for Liverpool. Everything has a 'why' and I don't just look at the negative times I had there, because I also won titles and had great experiences.",
      "\"So, I don't regret it. I am a man who accepts my responsibilities. I think off-field matters affected me a lot, in my performance. I know my potential, I know my qualities, I didn't play in a World Cup for nothing, I didn't return to the national team for nothing.",
      "\"I also take responsibility for it not working out, for not performing as I wanted. But I always try to see the bright side of things, going through this entire process, this time at United, was necessary to see myself.\"",

      "Manchester United take on Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon.",
      "United suffered a 3-1 defeat to Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium last weekend, which forced United sources to clarify Ruben Amorim still retains the backing of the board.",
      "Amorim is under increasing pressure and needs a positive result against Sunderland before the October international break. United have made an awful start to the season and Amorim's future has dominated headlines.",
      "Sunderland have made a superb start to the Premier League campaign following promotion from the Championship and will sense an opportunity to cause an upset at Old Trafford.",
      "Here are five things to look for:",
      "The Mainoo debate",
      "There has been widespread discussion about Amorim's handling of Kobbie Mainoo this season. Mainoo is yet to start a Premier League game and many fans believe the youngster has been underused.",
      "Mainoo came on from the bench against Brentford last weekend. He caught the eye immediately after replacing Manuel Ugarte, and it's surely time to start him against Sunderland.",
      "The midfield has continued to be a problem and Mainoo has the quality to provide control in the centre of the pitch. The youngster has knuckled down in an attempt to regain a starting role, even changing his private chef, and eyebrows will be raised if Amorim snubs him again.",
      "Amorim is not helping himself with selection decisions and his handling of Mainoo has been questionable.",
      "Sunderland love Amad",
      "Amad blossomed during his season-long loan with Sunderland in 2022/2023. The winger delivered consistently strong performances in the Championship and thoroughly enjoyed his time at the Stadium of Light.",
      "Sunderland boss Regis Le Bris was asked about Amad and said: \"His spell here was really important. The coaching staff likes him - as a person and as a player - so both. Now he will be an opponent. So it will be great to say hello but during the game he won't be a friend.\"",
      "Amad was unavailable against Brentford due to a family bereavement, but he is set to return to the squad this weekend. Amad has made a quiet start to the campaign and perhaps an appearance against Sunderland will spark him into life, as he has yet to find the back of the net this term.",
      "United's record against Sunderland",
      "United have lost just two of their last 30 league games against Sunderland, winning 22 of those matches and drawing six, which is a good omen for Saturday afternoon.",
      "Sunderland last won at Old Trafford in May 2014 when Ryan Giggs was in charge as interim manager. Sebastian Larsson's first-half goal secured Sunderland's first win at Old Trafford since 1968.",
      "The Black Cats are fifth in the table after making an impressive start to the campaign, so they will be hopeful of causing an upset, but United are unbeaten in their last 24 league games against newly promoted sides.",
      "Amorim's body langauge",
      "If you're attending the game at Old Trafford this afternoon, it's worth watching Amorim on the touchline because he has looked like a manager under pressure in the last few weeks.",
      "It can often be fascinating to watch Amorim's behaviour on the touchline. He is rarely happy with what he sees on the pitch and almost looks desperate to get involved.",
      "Sunderland is a must-win for Amorim after suffering another setback against Brentford. International breaks are synonymous with managerial changes, and Amorim might need to win to survive.",
      "United have insisted Amorim retains the backing of the board - but that might change if United lose today.",
      "Malacia back in the squad?",
      "Tyrell Malacia has been reintegrated into the first team after a spell of training with the Under-21s. Malacia wanted to leave United in the summer, but a proposed move to Elche collapsed on deadline day.",
      "Club sources have stressed it was always the plan to reintegrate Malacia once he failed to find a new club.",
      "Malacia's reintroduction raises the possibility of him making a return to a matchday squad, although it seems unlikely he will be named on the bench against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim shipped Malacia out on loan to PSV in the January transfer window after deciding he was not good enough. It was the right decision to welcome Malacia back to first-team training, but that doesn't necessarily mean he will play a part in Amorim's plans in the next few months.",

      "Sesko had raised his foot near the Sunderland defender's head while attempting to clear the ball. Hume went down to prompt a swarm of appeals from the away team, with their nearby supporters also demanding a penalty.",
      "It was unclear what decision had been given on-field, but referee Stuart Attwell - after consulting one of his linesmen - was sent over to the pitch-side monitor to review the incident. After watching multiple replays, Attwell deemed that Sesko hadn't committed a foul and play continued from a corner kick.",
      "A post on the Premier League's Match Centre account on X read: \"After VAR review, the referee overturned the original decision of penalty to Sunderland. Referee announcement: 'After review, there is no foul by the Manchester United player. He does not make contact with the head of the attacker. As the ball is out of play when the decision was made, the final decision is corner kick'.\"",

      "It was a repreive for Sesko, who'd scored his first goal at Old Trafford to double United's lead in the 31st minute. The striker produced a neat first-time finish after Diogo Dalot's long throw-in was flicked on into his path.",
      "Sesko, 22, had opened his account for United in last Saturday's 3-1 defeat away to Brentford. This time out, Mason Mount - another player who hadn't scored a Premier League goal for United at Old Trafford - opened the scoring.",
      "The midfielder controlled a ball from Bryan Mbeumo and his side-foot effort beat Sunderland goalkeeper Robin Roefs before nestling in the bottom right-hand corner with just eight minutes on the clock. Ruben Amorim's side dominated the first half and were good value for their 2-0 lead; firing off nine shots, including a Bruno Fernandes strike that Roefs superbly tipped onto the crossbar.",
      "Sunderland, who've enjoyed a strong start on their return to the top flight, grew into the game as the first half wore on. Granit Xhaka's long-range shot needed to be saved by Senne Lammens, who looked assured during his first 45 minutes as a United player.",
      "Lammens, who was signed from Royal Antwerp for an initial £18.2million plus add-ons last month, made his debut for United in place of Altay Bayindir. The Belgian was trusted by Amorim for what many considered a must-win game.",

This has left Ruben Amorim’s side level on points with Man City, who travel to Brentford on Sunday before the season pauses for the latest round of World Cup qualifiers.",

      "It drew criticism from fans on social media, with one person harshly arguing that the designer ‘should be sacked’. Another said: “Not a bad shout to say this is the worst kit of all time.”",
      "It found some fans though, as this Blue said: “Wow, this is super cool.” Elsewhere, Man United fans were more positive to their club’s retro third strip inspired by the black away kit worn between 1993 and 1995.",
      "One Red said: “This looks amazing, Man United nailed the retro vibe.” Another said: “This is absolutely fire.”",
      "However, this fan had a more tongue-in-cheek response, saying: “Will look nice in the away end when they’re playing Stockport next season.”",

      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "Man Utd midfielder Mason Mount insists that the Red Devils team are “together with the manager” despite rumours about Ruben Amorim’s future.",
      "The Red Devils beat Sunderland 2-0 over the weekend to give Amorim a huge boost after a week of speculation about his future at the club.",
      "There were rumours that Amorim’s job could come under threat if Man Utd lost heavily to Sunderland on Saturday but luckily for the Portuguese head coach his side put in a decent display.",
      "When asked if rumours of Amorim potentially being sacked have impacted the Man Utd dressing room, Mount said: “No. For us, it’s just focusing on what the manager wants and that’s in training. And then when it comes to the games, doing exactly what he asked for. And I think, as you see today, we stuck to the job in hand.",
      "“Everyone did their roles and responsibilities and it was a good performance. I think in the second half it got a bit cagey and there were times where we had to defend. We had to put the body on the line.”",
      "Mount added: “Obviously, even in this season, we’ve gone through ups and downs, but we’re together. And we’ll continue to be together with the manager, with the staff, to continue moving forward.”",
      "The Man Utd midfielder continued: “I have a good relationship with the manager. I don’t think it’s any better than all the other lads. I think I have the experience of playing a similar formation to what he likes as I have played it before in the past [at Chelsea].",
      "“So, knowing the roles and what he wants out of the team resonates with me because I’ve done it before. So, I think that’s something that I obviously understand.",
      "“I think all the players understand it now. But I think at the beginning, especially, it was something that maybe he could lean on me because I know the positions.”",
      "Former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood liked what he saw from Man Utd against Sunderland with Senne Lammens and Benjamin Sesko impressing him.",
      "“It’s largely going direct to a centre forward who wants the ball, and getting players around him to help him.”",
      "Sherwood added: “Man United are playing direct to Sesko. I’ve never seen him have so many touches, which is pleasing to see. They’re not asking Lemmens to play out – he’s kicking it long – and it’s paying off.”",

      "Napoli will almost certainly complete the signing of Man Utd striker Rasmus Hojlund on a permanent deal next summer, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano.",
      "The Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League last season with only four clubs scoring fewer goals than Ruben Amorim’s side.",
      "That led Man Utd to invest almost £200m in three new forwards with Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo all joining the Premier League club in the summer.",
      "Hojlund found himself pushed down the pecking order at Old Trafford with the Denmark international leaving on loan to Napoli in the summer.",

      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “Napoli want to keep the player. Napoli trust Rasmus Hojlund, they see him as part of their long-term project.",
      "“It’s a loan with buy option that might become an obligation, but it’s seen by all parties involved in this deal as a future permanent transfer almost guaranteed.",
      "“Hojlund is doing very well, scored a brace in the Champions League, scored on his debut against Fiorentina and again against Genoa this weekend.",
      "“So Napoli are very happy with Hojlund and Hojlund is very happy with Napoli… and the idea is to continue together, to sign the player on a permanent transfer.",
      "“So Man Utd can already consider €6m for the loan fee and €44m for the future signing of Rasmus Hojlund. It’s really important news for Man Utd.”",

      "Jones told our friends at TEAMtalk: “Lammens is not the guaranteed first-choice goalkeeper for the long-run – but he has given himself a chance of being No.1 for the next game. And that’s all he can hope for and focus on right now.",
      "“United seem adamant they are not going to commit to a first-choice stopper, because they want a genuine battle for the shirt on a week to week basis.",
      "“It felt like the decision to give Lammens his chance was overdue and he did well this weekend, so I personally think he has given himself the edge when it comes to starting against Liverpool after the international break.",
      "“But there is no way I would say he’s now going to establish himself as the first choice because I do believe Bayindir will still get games and I also think United are still on the lookout for another goalkeeper.”",
      "Jones added: “I’m pretty sure a new goalkeeper will arrive by the summer – and may even arrive in January if they can find a good option. Again, this is about competition and strength in depth.",

It’s no longer acceptable in the nuance-free culture war age even to just call second place first loser; second place is first bottler. When it’s happened three years in a row already and your last title is over 20 years ago, the reticence to accept the favourites mantle is understandable.",
      "But there is simply no avoiding it. Arsenal are the best team in the country, and their second XI is probably about the fourth or fifth best team in the country.",
      "They negotiated a horribly tough opening set of fixtures without suffering terminal damage – which was a valid concern given how little margin for error Premier League title challenges now permit – and they have now taken top spot as we hit the second interlull and look perfectly placed to really stretch their legs and open up a gap.",

      "A powerful example of how the Europa League group stage, so often seen as a burden and chore, can really help kick a season into life.

We can’t really think of many comparable examples of fans turning so quickly and viscerally on a manager after their appointment. They don’t expect this to get better, and in fairness to them they have a body of evidence from Postecoglou’s previous Premier League employment that is hard to argue with.",

      "Crystal Palace and Chelsea both played well against Liverpool and were worthy winners. But they didn’t really do anything very differently to those other teams who came close to getting something only to be denied at the last.",
      "Liverpool have not been smashed or grabbed by these late goals they’ve conceded. They’ve felt like the natural conclusion to drab and uninspired performances.",
      "And they need to find solutions fast. This is not yet a crisis, but it really does feel like it could be a crisis’ origin story. Their post-interlull fixtures are unhelpful, with league games against Manchester United, Aston Villa and Man City alongside Champions League clashes with Eintracht Frankfurt and Real Madrid plus a Carabao encounter with their newly-minted nemesis Crystal Palace all offering further obvious potential for widening of cracks and deepening of concerns.",

      "Carlos Baleba’s failed summer move to Manchester United has left no winners, with the Brighton star one of this season’s biggest disappointments…",
      "One of this summer transfer window’s most surprising developments came as Man Utd, despite apparently being at risk of going bust by Christmas, made an audacious move for Brighton sensation Baleba.",
      "This provided evidence of the Red Devils, for a change, being notably astute in the transfer market as a No.6 with such a high ceiling as Baleba had the potential to turn Ruben Amorim’s side into a competent team.",
      "One of Man Utd’s many glaring weaknesses is their lack of a mobile No.6 to glue the team together. Baleba would have fixed this problem, but this ‘dream’ scenario proved too good to be true.",
      "With United almost exclusively focusing on overhauling their attack, they did not have £115m left over to sign Baleba. Therefore, they shelved their interest until a later date and also opted against signing an alternative.",
      "The immense lure of Man Utd remains undiminished by their prolonged on-field woes, with Baleba reportedly joining a host of other players in favouring a move to Old Trafford despite being able to do better.",
      "But with Brighton refusing to play ball, Baleba is stuck at the south coast until January at the earliest, and it’s clear that this summer’s events have negatively impacted his performances.",
      "On Sunday, Baleba picked up a yellow card in the 20th minute and, for the third time this season, was hooked off by Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler at half-time, while he is yet to complete 90 minutes amid a string of sub-par performances this term.",
      "This time, Hurzeler claimed post-match that Baleba was subbed “because of the yellow card”, but the Brighton boss has previously accepted that the “incredible” star’s form has dipped following his failed move to Man Utd.",
      "“I’m confident that we will get the best out of him, I think he needs time, he’s a young boy, his development in the last year was incredible.” Hurzeler said.",
      "“Maybe it went a little bit too fast, there was a lot of rumours about him, he played an incredible season, but I always try to be humble with the players.",
      "“Because with young players, it’s normal that there will be some waves in their development, and at the moment, we have a wave, so therefore the only way to get out of it, is to try to keep working hard and try to use every training session you can have and try to get as many minutes on the pitch.”",
      "So, at the moment, the Baleba saga has no winner…",
      "The player is clearly hurting from missing out on a huge pay bump and a desired move to an elite club, which is proven by his uncharacteristic decline at the start of this season.",
      "Man Utd are still lacking a quality No.6, and without such a player, their severe defensive issues will continue to limit their progress under Amorim/his potential replacement.",
      "And Brighton have a seemingly unhappy player performing far from his peak and should Baleba’s issues continue, they would have little choice but to accept his sale for a fee significantly lower than £115m.",
      "Crystal Palace and Nottingham are definitely at risk as we rank the top ten non-Big Six stars most likely to secure an upwards transfer to a giant in 2026.",
      "In Ruben Amorim’s beloved 3-4-2-1, here’s a team of Premier League players that Man Utd are destined to overpay for next summer.",
      "Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba should be off the market in January, but a summer exit for Man Utd remains a real possibility, according to Ben Jacobs.",
      "Man Utd ‘leading the race for a No.6’? Not a chance with Liverpool and Man City around. Will the Red Devils have to settle for Carlos Baleba?",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between. We’re definitely leaning towards the former, though.",

      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank and the excellent start they’ve made despite everything is only strengthening his standing.",
      "",
      "Things would have to go unbelievably wrong unbelievably fast, but this is Everton so, you know. Maybe. And there are few things that straddle the blessing-curse divide in football quite like a new stadium.",
      "The benefits Everton should accrue come in the long term. In the short term there’s the loss of familiarity and – something that feels specifically important in this particular case – atmosphere while everyone gets used to the new surroundings.",
      "Defeat at Leeds on the opening weekend was distinctly squibbish, but Everton have bounced back in some style since to suggest they could not just survive but thrive. With Jack Grealish in impish early-season form, they might even be fun. Ending Crystal Palace’s unbeaten run in such dramatic circumstances was certainly that.",

He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, and a world in which Frank doesn’t make the November international break entirely possible, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation.",
      "Crucially, there has been no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",

      "Now, though, after a traumatic summer and the Alexander Isak Saga and a sometimes iffy start to the season, our Spidey Sense is tingling once more. We’re going to be right back in the saddle come November after a run of two draws and a defeat leaves the Magpies seven points outside the top six.",

      "There were encouraging signs before late heartbreak against eternally stupid Manchester United and against champions-elect Liverpool. A point against Forest was certainly a step in the right direction, but they are firmly in the bottom three as we reach the October international break where club decision-makers do start to get antsy.",

      "Pereira should theoretically be fine after the work he did in steering Wolves so comfortably clear of any relegation trouble last season contributed heavily to him being give a new three-year contract in September. But making terrible starts that leave them in apparent relegation trouble before surviving comfortably in the end after a managerial change appears to now be ingrained in the club culture, an issue that transcends players and managers.",

Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been rather more of the latter than the former.",
      "He definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",

      "Missing out on the Champions League in the manner they did at the end of last season was definitely a p*sser, and while Villa were perfectly good last season, it was one that felt a bit flat in the end. It was good, but it could have been great. They could have finished in the top five. They could have won the FA Cup. They could even have knocked out PSG in the Champions League after thar barnstorming Villa Park comeback.",
      "These annoyances are real and meaningful, and have leaked into this season. They are already out of the Carabao and took until the fifth game of the season just to score a Premier League goal that still wasn’t enough to secure a first victory of the season at 10-man Sunderland.",
      "But the win over Fulham was much, much better and beating Feyenoord and then Burnley for four wins in a row feels restorative.",
      "",
      "It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, but there remains a decent case that Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – could or even should have thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Leeds’ lack of firepower against teams wallowing in slightly less despair than Wolves remains a concern, but two wins from the opening seven games to go with creditable draws against Newcastle and Bournemouth ought to be plenty enough to keep Farke gainfully employed, for now.",
      "Definitely worth noting the oddsmakers currently consider this very much a two-horse race at current prices.",
      "",
      "Feels like one could still, if one were so inclined, make the case for him being both top and bottom of this list.",
      "Top because United were staggeringly and at times unwatchably bad last season, as well as bottling the Europa League final in truly dismal fashion against planet earth’s most notorious pot-dodgers, and haven’t delivered anything conspicuously better in the early weeks of this season. Bottom because United have so clearly and determinedly nailed their colours to the Amorim mast that they might just stick with him out of pure stubbornness.",
      "But can he survive defeat to Grimsby Town? Should he? Victory over Burnley helps, but it could scarcely have been less convincing. And my word, they looked broken against Manchester City. We said at the time that the wild 10-man win over 10-man Chelsea was not a turning point; Brentford proved it.",
      "At this point, Sir Jim and his nowhere-to-be-seen pals are probably sitting tight, waiting for a year to pass just to save a few quid on his pay-off. In which case, Amorim and United have a month before both can be put out of their misery.",

      "He is currently trying – and failing – to deploy it with a Forest squad far less suited than Tottenham, especially in terms of defensive pace, mobility and technical ability. Throw in the fact that when it did work at Spurs, it worked early on due to its shock-and-awe newness before everyone figured it all out. There has been no early benefit reaped at Forest. Actually the opposite is true.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans are raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to nod in agreement. At Palace, the Dutch stopper kept a clean sheet despite Palace’s 1.59 xG and Forest failed to beat him despite an xG of 1.65. Manchester United were expected to score 2.1 goals, which was roughly what transpired.",
      "",
      "The Italian has the second-highest saves percentage (82.8 per cent) in the league and only two keepers have made more saves. He was bloomin’ busy last season too.",
      "",

      "According to Fabrizio Romano, something “crazy” needed to happen for Manchester United to sack head coach Ruben Amorim after the Sunderland game.",
      "Amorim was under immense pressure heading into Saturday’s home match against Sunderland, with it even suggested that this was a ‘must-win’ game for the head coach.",
      "Man Utd headed into this game after losing three of their opening six Premier League matches, while also suffering an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Grimsby Town.",
      "Therefore, the Sunderland match was huge as Amorim and Co. looked to boost morale, and they earned a valuable and deserved three points as Mason Mount and Benjamin Sesko scored in their 2-0 victory.",
      "This result moves the Red Devils up to tenth in the table, though Amorim remains one of the favourites to be the next Premier League manager sacked this season.",
      "Despite this, Romano has revealed Man Utd’s “plan” following the Sunderland game, with Amorim only to lose his job if something “completely crazy happened”.",
      "“What is happening is also that Man Utd won the game against Sunderland and closed all the speculation, at least for the next few weeks, for Ruben Amorim, so they head into the international break way more relaxed,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "READ: Amorim saves job in ‘must-win’ game to beg Manchester United question: was all the ‘suffering’ necessary?",
      "“The new goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, finally started and got a clean sheet – and so a very good start for Lammens and a very good result for Amorim. As I told you guys, Man Utd were not going to sack Amorim even if Man Utd were going to lose the game against Sunderland. Even in that case, he was not going to be fired.",
      "“That was the plan of Man Utd unless completely crazy things happened, like losing, I don’t know, 3 or 4 or 5-0. But, for example, losing the game, I don’t know, 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, something like that – Amorim was not going to be fired.”",
      "On reports linking Man Utd with Gareth Southgate, Romano added: “Man Utd’s message was quite clear and they never contacted other managers.",
      "“I spent basically the last 10 days telling you that Gareth Southgate was in the media, but there was never a concrete negotiation between Man Utd and Southgate or his representatives.",
      "“There is a very good relationship between Southgate and INEOS, but never a negotiation. And Man United wanted to show their support to Amorim.”",
      "Rasmus Hojlund, like Marcus Rashford, has enjoyed a renaissance since leaving Man Utd on loan, scoring four goals in six games for Serie A side Napoli.",
      "Now, Romano has explained why a permanent move in 2026 is already “almost guaranteed”.",
      "“For Hojlund, I keep telling you guys, the Napoli intention is very clear,” Romano continued.",
      "“Apart from the obligation to buy included in the deal – for €44 million – Napoli want to keep the player. Napoli trust Hojlund and they see him as part of their long-term project.",

      "“I’m pretty sure the club have made it aware this summer that I can’t leave the club on any terms with other clubs enquiring about my things and my position with my contract.",

      "A Barca source told the Daily Mirror: “At the top of his game, Marcus Rashford is one of the best players in Europe. Barca have got themselves a genuine bargain. Marcus should be worth more than £60m in the current market.”",
      "Speaking last week, former Barcelona striker Gary Lineker praised Rashford’s start at the Camp Nou after a tricky first few matches.",

      "“Obviously you’re always going to get little knocks and injuries to certain players, and he seems to be rotating quite a lot, but Marcus has started a lot of games in the Champions League. Of the three goals that Barcelona have scored, he scored two of them and assisted the other one– really good pass.",
      "“Good start, I think it’s encouraging. You can see they really like him.",
      "“Even at the weekend– I mean his assist at the weekend was in the league, it was a corner, but all the players ran to him. It’s a really good sign. You need that. I’m pleased.”",
      "Touching on Rasmus Hojlund also doing well, Lineker added: “I know De Bruyne was brilliant in the game as well yesterday, but Rasmus Hojlund scored two goals. Everybody who is leaving Manchester United seems to be doing really well. But it just shows you, doesn’t it?”",
      "It has been claimed that Marcus Rashford has given Manchester United a “big issue”, with the Premier League giants “boxed in”.",
      "Paul Scholes was ‘bitter’ and ‘nasty’ in an assessment of Marcus Rashford which captured a ‘spitefulness’ still holding Manchester United back.",
      "According to reports, FC Barcelona face missing out on Marcus Rashford as Manchester United are set to receive a ‘bigger than expected offer’.",
      "Paul Scholes has received criticism for admitting he ‘struggles to feel happy’ for Marcus Rashford in Barcelona. But why should he?",
      "Marcus Rashford is a player who did not even ‘fake defend’ for Manchester United so he deserves no sympathy.",
      "Paul Scholes knows the unique pressures of Manchester United – and the possible ‘mistakes’ – better than anyone. So what’s his Marcus Rashford problem?"

      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Liverpool) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Bournemouth) – £45m",

      "19th (West Ham) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the November selections with four more games each:",
      "=1st) Chelsea and Liverpool (11 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £9.13m in 2024/25",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (10 games) – worth around £8.3m",
      "8th) Newcastle (9 games) – worth around £7.47m",

      "=13th) Brighton, Fulham and Wolves (6 games) – worth around £4.98m",
      "=17th) Bournemouth and Crystal Palace (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=20th) Burnley and Sunderland (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "No surprise to see who heads up the winners section, even if they now have no choice but to accept the mantle of Premier League favourites.",
      "There are some silly Liverpool messages and agreements but the big problem is the MailOnline’s atrocious reporting of that Gary Neville ‘outburst’.",

      "Senne Lammens reminded Manchester United fans what a competent goalkeeper looks like, but his opposite number on matchday seven is out-performing every stopper in the league…",
      "Liverpool were ‘simply unacceptable’ in defeat to Chelsea and not one single player ’emerged with any credit’. But Arsenal should face more criticism.",

Two, that number will not be sufficient to win the Golden Boot, or probably even get that close. Good bit that he’s already scored two headers when all the evidence from Germany was that, despite looking precisely like someone who would score a lot of headers, he doesn’t actually score many headers.",

      "",
      "Made a flying start to his Liverpool career but might he just prove a bit too ‘scorer of great goals, not great goalscorer’ across an entire campaign? Also very hard to know exactly what everyone’s favourite palindromic striker’s season might look like now Alexander Isak has been signed.",

      "He’s already one of the early favourites for the PFA Player of the Year award but there are reasons to be worried about his early-season form. The fact he’s still third in the running here says a lot about how little anyone else has managed to do to put pressure on Haaland.",

      "When Ruben Amorim prophesised after his first match in charge of Manchester United that “we are going to suffer for a long period,” he perhaps didn’t realise he was issuing the most egregious understatement in human history.",
      "Before Saturday, that 1-1 draw against Ipswich 314 days ago was the last time Manchester United scored in the opening ten minutes of a Premier League game. And an inability to start strong ranks absurdly low on the list of causes for these unnecessarily agonising year-long growing pains.",
      "But Manchester United failing to build on those leads or even just capitalise on brief moments of ascendancy has been an infuriating trait. So too their incompetence in simply trying to keep a clean sheet.",
      "No-one will be foolish enough to read too far into a 2-0 win over Sunderland secured through goals in the eighth and 31st minutes, buttressed by a stable and secure defensive platform. Not when the infernal search for consecutive Premier League wins will take in a visit to Anfield after the international break.",
      "Yet this was the club’s best performance of the season in a ‘must-win’ game for the manager.",
      "It is, of course, heartening that this Manchester United hierarchy might still be making decisions based on the circumstances of one fixture. If one stunning FA Cup final can keep Erik ten Hag in employment well beyond the glaringly obvious end of his road, setting this eternal restoration project back at least another year or so, then why shouldn’t a home win over promoted opposition secure Amorim’s future for the remainder of the season?",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the INEOS brains trust would ideally never learn any lessons ever, perennially extending this exasperating process by ignoring every issue and clinging to all potential positives.",
      "Sure, Old Trafford is surrounded by myriad dumpster fires but at least they’re generating enough light and warmth to save on the energy bill and avert any further redundancies.",
      "It should be said that this was a rare break from the “suffering”. Manchester United were competent against Sunderland. Good, even. Great at times. Mason Mount continues to prove himself to be any manager’s favourite player, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo have formed a tantalising link on the right, and Benjamin Sesko needed only one gilt-edged chance rather than three in succession to score.",
      "And on his Premier League debut, Senne Lammens kept the club’s first clean sheet of the season. He was hardly needed to produce the sort of volume of saves which attracted Manchester United to his ability in the first place, but one confident claim from a high Noah Sadiki cross was greeted with rapturous applause and very possibly a few disbelieving supporters fainting in the stands.",
      "Robin Roefs was once again more outwardly impressive at the other end, tipping a wonderful Bruno Fernandes effort onto the bar in his most eye-catching stop. But Manchester United twice found a way through one of the better defensive teams in this myriad Premier League season and wholly deserved their win.",
      "It is vanishingly rare that everything Amorim touches turns to gold. But the Lammens call, bringing Leny Yoro in for Harry Maguire, even dropping Matheus Cunha for Mount were all vindicated.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo got his 13-minute cameo, Casemiro was substituted before he was given the opportunity to get stupidly sent off, and Amorim managed to both have and eat his cake with a trademark centre-half swap with five minutes remaining as Sunderland laboured to find anything resembling a foothold.",
      "Regis Le Bris even felt compelled to alter his system in the first half to match the hosts with the introduction of large Dan Ballard. Amorim, for once, had no reason to follow suit.",
      "He knows “results dictate everything”. Amorim had ventured into the ever so slightly desperate before the game with his controversial rework of a John Lennon classic, saying: “Imagine if we had won the first game against Arsenal, hadn’t missed the penalty, and had won against Fulham even without playing well.”",
      "His basic point was that winning breeds confidence and fine margins have often been the difference. But it is gloriously quaint to hear the manager of Manchester United essentially say: “Imagine if we had just won these games.”",
      "This weekend and over the international break, they need no such creative thinking. An entirely routine, straightforward victory with no suffering in sight might be the most significant result of Amorim’s reign yet.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Mason Mount insists that the Red Devils team are “together with the manager” despite rumours about Ruben Amorim’s future.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "No surprise to see who heads up the winners section, even if they now have no choice but to accept the mantle of Premier League favourites.",
      "Man Utd are ‘quietly considering’ Unai Emery as their next head coach as Ruben Amorim comes under pressure, according to reports.",
      "There are some silly Liverpool messages and agreements but the big problem is the MailOnline’s atrocious reporting of that Gary Neville ‘outburst’.",
      "As the dad joke goes, you would not have left your dog with Spurs last season. Under Thomas Frank, though, Tottenham are suddenly good at holding leads…"

      "Bayindir is not good enough to be anything more than a No.2 for Man Utd, and he’s been a weak link at the start of this season, but he has retained a starting berth as Amorim has opted to ease Lammens into the fold.",
      "However, this has changed on Saturday as Amorim has ‘thrown Lammens into the fray’ against Sunderland, with the £18m goalkeeper making his first Premier League start.",
      "On this decision, BBC journalist Simon Stone explained: ‘With his back against the wall and huge pressure over his job, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has handed £18.1m goalkeeper Senne Lammens his debut.",
      "‘The deadline day signing from Royal Antwerp has sat out the last three games but Amorim has decided today is the day to throw the 23-year-old into the fray.",

      "‘There is no easing in period. Lammens needs to perform today.’",
      "Ahead of Saturday’s game, Amorim has explained why he is not scared to lose his job.",

Why? Well because they’re playing to keep their job so.",

      "While many would have sent Ruben Amorim packing from Manchester United already and almost all others would see an inevitable defeat to high-flying Sunderland on Saturday as the final straw, amid reports claiming that Sir Jim Ratcliffe will give the Portuguese boss a full season as he fails to come to terms with yet another Old Trafford mistake, Amorim is indeed set to survive the upcoming international break.",
      "But in clarifying the full-season “yardstick” Ratcliffe and Ineos will use to decide his future, journalist Ben Jacobs has confirmed his sacking in the next international break.",
      "“Ruben Amorim, I think, doesn’t have that many games to turn things around,” Jacobs said. “I’m not so sure, despite the fact that I respect other reports, that it’s as clear-cut as he’ll get a full season. Speaking to people in and around the club, he’ll get 38 games split across two seasons and they’ll use that somewhat as a yardstick.”",
      "Having now infamously won just 34 points from his first 33, Amorim has five games to save his job, or five to see out before his escape, depending how he’s looking at things.",
      "",
      "It will have been seen as an absolute banker by Manchester United fans trawling the fixture list at the start of the season. An Old Trafford clash against newly-promoted Sunderland, who have beaten United just twice in the Premier League in 30 meetings, losing 22 of them, since Michael Gray and John Mullin goals earned them all three points in March 1997, give it a tick and move on.",
      "But six games into the season we’re wondering if there is a worse fixture for Amorim and United to be playing. Sunderland are sixth having conceded just four goals in those six games, and while no-one expects them to hold that position, there also won’t be many still considering them as relegation candidates. They’ve got good players, a good manager and crucially – in stark contrast to United – are a team.",
      "And yet, they are still Sunderland. They’ve still only just come up, they’ve still got plenty of players in their first Premier League season, just like their manager. It would therefore still be written up as a disaster of biblical proportions if United were to lose to them.",
      "Can’t have that though – Amorim’s got to make it through another four games. A 1-1 draw. Harry Maguire equaliser in stoppage time.",
      "",
      "The 2-2 draw at Anfield last season ushered in Amorim’s best/only half-decent spell as United boss. It was a timely result on the back of defeats to Tottenham, Bournemouth and Wolves, and preceded five wins in six games, including the 6-4 victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup a week later.",
      "Amorim said afterwards that he was “upset” United didn’t claim all three points, but while we’re all doing our level best to insist Premier League leaders Liverpool are currently in the midst of a mini-crisis and defeat to Chelsea on Saturday would ensure a full-blown one for us all to ruminate over for the international break, it’s hard to imagine the level of catastrophe required for Arne Slot’s side not to beat United at Anfield.",
      "“Who doesn’t cause Konate problems right now?” Jamie Carragher asked after Victor Osimhen ran rings around him in another calamitous showing from one of the top ten slumping Premier League players against Galatasaray. Enter Dr. Sesko.",
      "No goals for United then and there’s nothing like a game against United to break Mohamed Salah out of a funk. Hat-trick for him. 0-4.",
      "",
      "This fixture last season was very nearly the end of Amorim, who had reportedly become so ‘disenchanted’ with life at United after a run of one Premier League win in six culminated in the 3-1 defeat to the Seagulls at Old Trafford that he was ‘prepared to resign’ and had to be talked off the ledge by the United bosses.",
      "Despite there being ‘no formal move to quit’ after the game in January, the Portuguese head coach ‘had to be reassured by senior figures at the club, including CEO Omar Berrada, that he would be backed to turn the team’s fortunes around.’",
      "We don’t know how Amorim could see a summer in which United failed to sign a new No.6 or No.1 as one in which he received sufficient backing, but it feels as though he’s been on the brink of resignation as well as the sack pretty much ever since.",
      "Fabian Hurzeler has already led Brighton to victories over Manchester City and Chelsea this season. 1-2.",
      "",
      "Ange Postecoglou being sacked twice before Ruben Amorim after beating him in the Europa League final is both brilliant and famously unjust in equal measure, if it wasn’t definitely actually slightly more brilliant than unjust.",
      "That currently looks very likely to be the case after he was jeered off by Nottingham Forest fans on Thursday following his fourth defeat as manager in six winless games. He wasn’t “sacked in the morning” but surely will be next week if they fail to turn Newcastle over on Sunday.",
      "Amorim is f***ed either way. Ange got the better of him three times last season – 1-0 wins in the UEL final and the Premier League and a 4-3 in the League Cup quarter-final. United also lost both games to Forest and if Ange has gone then they may still be in the midst of a new manager bounce, which they’re due having experienced more of a splat post Nuno-Espirito Santo.",
      "Please, for the love of all that is great and holy, let it be Erik ten Hag guiding his new team to a 1-0 victory.",
      "",
      "United haven’t beaten Tottenham in their last seven meetings, losing five of them, and if current Brentford boss Keith Andrews can “out-school” Amorim after a full eight games as a professional football manager we can only assume that former Brentford manager Thomas Frank – widely regarded as one of the very finest tacticians around – will teach him a sack-ensuring lesson in north London.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo to score a consolation as the last United goal in the Amorim era from the bench. 4-1.",
      "Man Utd midfielder Mason Mount insists that the Red Devils team are “together with the manager” despite rumours about Ruben Amorim’s future.",

      "\"There's too many defeats, the record's too poor so I don't think anybody will be celebrating too much tonight at Manchester United but I think they'll be relieved that there is a victory which allows a little bit of peace going into the international break.",
      "\"Manchester United win the odd game but that's nowhere near enough. I don't think anybody would be kidded on by the fact that Manchester United beat Sunderland at home. The fact that it was even in doubt before the game is probably the problem in itself.\"",
      "Amorim said ahead of the game that he is convinced criticism from within the media is affecting his players and their confidence in his much-maligned 3-4-3 system. He said: \"My players, I guarantee you, they are listening to all the opinions and they are putting that inside because we are not winning games. They have to believe in me. So my biggest problem is that my players believe in you guys when you say the problem of our team is the system.\"",

      "Manchester United made it three wins in a row at Old Trafford as they eased the pressure on Ruben Amorim with a 2-0 win over Sunderland.",
      "Mason Mount, selected ahead of Matheus Cunha, scored a fine opening goal before Benjamin Sesko netted at Old Trafford for the first time in front of his home supporters. Sunderland struggled to cope and even switched to 3-4-3 in a bid to alter the flow.",
      "There were flashes from Regis Le Bris' side that hinted at their confident start to the campaign, Bertrand Traore almost opening the scoring and Granit Xhaka firing off a shot. They also thought they had a penalty against Sesko but VAR rightly overruled it.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (7), Shaw (6), De Ligt (7), Yoro (6), Dalot (7), Amad (7), Casemiro (6), Fernandes (7), Mount (8), Mbeumo (7), Sesko (8).\n\n\nSubs: Dorgu (6), Cunha (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Maguire (n/a).\n\n\nSunderland: Roefs (7), Hume (5), Mukiele (6), Alderete (5), Masuaku (6), Xhaka (7), Sadiki (6), Le Fee (6), Traore (5), Adingra (6), Isidor (6).\n\n\nSubs: Ballard (6), Mayenda (5), Talbi (6), Brobbey (6), Geertruida (7).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Mason Mount.",
      "But United were the better side and could have punished the visitors even more but for Robin Roefs pulling off some good saves, including a fingertip effort to deny Bruno Fernandes. Senne Lammens, making his United debut, was less busy at the other end.",
      "Mason Mount's opener for Manchester United against Sunderland rounded off an 18-pass move, the joint-most for a goal in the Premier League this season.",
      "Lammens' best save came late in the game when he kept out a Chemsdine Talbi effort with his legs but the Belgian goalkeeper was hardly overworked. There were bigger cheers when he claimed a cross in stoppage time, his second good claim of the game.",
      "Manchester United kept their first clean sheet of the season in what was also Senne Lammens' debut for the club.",
      "How United need that sort of commanding presence in goal with supporters unconvinced by the performances of Altay Bayindir. Lammens, signed from Antwerp late in the window, also looked composed when kicking with his right and left foot.",
      "There was one hairy moment when he chased out of his goal on the angle only to see Traore get there first amid some uncertainty with Fernandes. But as debuts go, this was a fine effort from a 23-year-old goalkeeper with a huge task ahead of him.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim in the press conference:",
      "\"I think he looked confident in the first game. But the important thing is that the teammates helped Senne to have a good game. Because everyone was focused, not a lot of mistakes against a team that was really comfortable playing football.\"",
      "Asked why he delayed starting him, Amorim added: \"He arrives and you can feel it that he needs to adapt. New country, new training, the pressure that you guys put on the goalkeepers are massive. So it was like a little preparation for the guy to be ready to start his first game.",
      "\"But now it's just one game and he needs to work. Because he needs to be prepared that in our club things are really hard. But he did well in the game. He was comfortable during the game and that is a very good sign.\"",
      "Asked whether the international break denies United the opportunity to build momentum, Amorim joked that \"there is no momentum with our team\" - a reference to the fact that they are still looking for back-to-back Premier League wins under him.",
      "But Amorim was encouraged by the performance. When asked about Mount's comments that the players were 100 per cent behind their coach, the Portuguese suggested that the performance was proof of that.",
      "\"I saw it today. And I know they want to do the best and I know they don't want to change the coach all the time.",
      "\"We need to show with actions. Sometimes when we look at our team, I know for sure that when we see the games in the end I know sometimes we can do better. I feel it during the week but we need to show it on the pitch.\"",
      "It is easy to talk about heart, about shape, about defending with your lives - something which has provided the platform for some impressive results for Sunderland against Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest. But resolve only gets you so far.",
      "At some point, you have to hurt teams and possess quality in the final third. And at Old Trafford, Sunderland looked woefully short in that department, creating just 0.71 worth of expected goals and rarely testing Lammens, who would have been feeling it ahead of his United debut.",
      "And while it's fair to say United were efficient rather than exceptional once racing into their 2-0, the gap in quality was undeniable. This was a bit of a reality check. A performance that strips back the optimism and lays bare the challenge ahead of survival.",

      "Ruben Amorim said he has no plans to walk away from the Manchester United job and insisted his system is not to blame for their struggles in an impassioned press conference.",
      "HIs side face Sunderland on Saturday having suffered a third Premier League loss of the season against Brentford which left them 14th in the table and increased the pressure on the head coach.",
      "Ahead of Saturday's game at Old Trafford, read the full transcript as Amorim outlines his determination to turn Manchester United's form around, denies reports he is unhappy in Manchester, and argues that he used 4-4-2, rather than a back three, against Brentford.",
      "AMORIM: \"Because the worst thing in this job is to not win games. That is the same feeling I had in Casa Pia when I lost in the third division.",
      "\"And then it's a job. Of course, it's a dream to be here. And I want to continue here. And I want to fight for this. But the problem is now, what makes me suffer is to lose games, not to lose my job.",
      "\"You fear to lose your job when you have to pay the bills and I don't have that feeling. I just want to continue this. But when we don't win games, that is the suffering that I have. It is not the fear of losing the job. I don't care.",
      "\"I'm telling you when we finish the game and you can see me, I don't care about my job. That hurt of not winning games or failing. That is the thing that hurts me the most.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"That is a decision of the board. I cannot do that. Sometimes I have that feeling and losing is hard. It's so frustrating when you create the momentum, go to the next game, and something happens.",
      "\"That feeling sometimes hurts me a lot. Also the players and especially the staff here.",
      "\"But that is not my decision. And I think it would be really hard to leave if I don't do everything to follow my career here.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's really important because there is no one in the world that can read everything and listen to everything about people that understand football and not be influenced by that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to listen and to see all the games because I know that I see the game more times than all those guys together because they have to see all the games in the Premier League and give an opinion.",
      "\"My opinion is completely different because I see the games, I see the training, I understand my players, I understand what I'm doing and I follow my job this way because it's impossible to survive in this club, listening to all the things.",
      "\"I see a lot of things that my wife is talking with the media. That is such nonsense.",
      "\"Nobody in my family talks about that. We love living in England. You have no idea what is abuse here because you are so polite compared to my country where we are losing. So you have no idea. My family is really happy.",
      "\"It's just me and my family that is struggling because I hate losing and I hate failing.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"I'm not concerned about that and nobody here is naive. We understand that we need results to continue the project.",
      "\"We will reach a point that is impossible for everyone because this is a very big club with a lot of sponsors, with two owners. So it's hard. That balance is really hard. So I'm not concerned about that.",
      "\"What I want is to see my team winning or losing playing the same way and we are not doing that, in the simple things of playing football that anyone can do.",
      "\"So my biggest problem is [if] my players believe in you guys when they say the problem of our team is the system.",
      "\"I get crazy about that because I can see the team, I see this team playing in a different system.",
      "\"We need to play the same way with the same power with the same intensity with the same focus. If you do that, the system doesn't matter.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It doesn't matter. I just need one more game because football is like that. We need one more game, we win, we get some hope and then in the next game we'll see.",
      "\"That is always the same thing, so I don't need a lot of time. It doesn't matter for me, it's just the next game that matters and the next game is [Saturday]. We just have to perform and we need to win.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"It's the results. Imagine that we won the first game against Arsenal and then you don't miss the penalty and you win against Fulham, even without playing really well. Imagine that this happened.",
      "\"The trust in everything about our club, the system, the way we play, would be completely different.",
      "\"So, if you win, everything is okay. If you lose, you are doubting everything about yourself, about your team-mates, about the coach, everything. And that is normal.",
      "\"There is no back three against Brentford. Lately we play with Luke Shaw, two centre-backs and the right back. They play in different positions in the beginning.",
      "\"So it's not three centre-backs, it's the same thing with a little bit different positions. Against Brentford, second half, it was like a 4-4-2. The problem is that we were not good with the ball, we were soft without the ball and we lose.",
      "\"But imagine that we score the penalty. In the final goal we are trying to win the game, everyone is out of position. That can happen in the 4-3-3 or the 3-4-3. So I think the details matter more than the system.\"",
      "AMORIM: \"No. Guys, I'm the manager of the club, the big club. Is the media going to dictate what I'm going to do? It cannot be. It's not possible to sustain that.",
      "\"I talk with the players every day and I explain point by point what is happening with our team. So again, it's not a 3-4-3 all the time.",
      "\"I think we are thinking about the system but I think we need to look at all of the parts of the game. This team play in the different systems for many years, and you were talking about the lack of identity, no idea, whatever.",
      "\"So it's not the system. It's the small details, the way we play the game. And I understand what people think. 'What would this team be in a different system?' I don't know. Maybe this team would win more games.",
      "\"But if we don't change certain things, we are not going to win titles whether we change to 4-3-3 or 4-4-2.",
      "\"And that is my point with the players - not with you, I don't want to change your mind - but my players. I guarantee you they are listening to you. All those opinions, they are putting that inside because we are not winning games.",
      "\"And they have to believe in me because I watch more [Man Utd] games than you guys combined.\"",

      "Saturday 4 October 2025 15:17, UK",
      "Gary Neville has delivered his most damning verdict on Ruben Amorim's Manchester United yet as the under-pressure Portuguese coach readies for a crunch clash against Sunderland this weekend.",
      "Amorim fell to another sobering defeat as a rampant Brentford beat United 3-1 at the Gtech last weekend.",
      "It denied Amorim the chance to end a dismal record of failing to secure back-to-back league games in the same season since May 2024. United now sit in 14th, having lost three games this season, losing two and drawing one of their six fixtures, which has prompted huge concerns for Neville.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" Neville told NBC, Sky's US partner, following the 3-1 defeat at Brentford. \"There's no point in me sitting here and saying that I'm not.",
      "\"The levels of performance, the results, the substitutions...[at Brentford], I saw something [which happened] at the end of the Grimsby game that they lost in the Carabao Cup a couple of weeks ago, which was Mason Mount ending up at left wing back.",
      "\"Now, look, we admire managers who are resilient, who are stubborn around the system. We want them to stick to the plan.",
      "\"But when you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid. And that's happened twice now. It can't happen. The first time I thought was unforgivable and it's happened again.",
      "\"He changes his back three and his back five every single game. And the performances and the results are just unacceptable. So I'm really, really worried.",
      "\"I would never go on television - I know how difficult a manager's job can be - and say that a manager should be sacked. But I suspect that the hierarchy at Manchester United are going to want to see a turnaround very quickly.\"",
      "Neville: \"When you've got Mason Mount playing at left wing-back, you're going to look pretty stupid.\"",
      "What the stats say: A manager's substitutions are meant to help a team, but Ruben Amorim's in-game changes at Manchester United have so far proven to be more of a hindrance. His Premier League substitutes have made more errors leading to goals than they have scored goals.",
      "That is as damning as stats come for a coach. The tally stands at 3-2 since he took charge nearly 11 months ago. In six games this season, two of Amorim's substitutes have made errors leading to a goal and none have scored off the bench.",
      "Neville: \"The results are just unacceptable.\"",
      "What the stats say: Results have been bad ever since Amorim arrived, so it is difficult to tell what it would take for the situation to become intolerable for the decision-makers at Old Trafford.",
      "Graham Potter was sacked by West Ham last weekend with a win percentage of 26.1 in the Premier League. Amorim's stands at 27.27 per cent after 33 games.",
      "For context, that is identical to Chris Wilder's record at Sheffield United in the top-flight after 66 games.",
      "Steve Bruce had a marginally better win rate when he was sacked by Newcastle, and so did Gary O'Neil at Wolves. This is the ballpark Amorim is in.",
      "Compared to coaches at 'Big Six' clubs since that moniker came into being in the early 2010s, Amorim has the worst Premier League record of those with at least 30 games. Juande Ramos was not much better at Spurs (28.6 per cent), but the 'Big Six' didn't exist then.",
      "Neville: \"He changes his back three and his back five every single game.\"",
      "What the stats say: Amorim has used 21 different back threes in his 33 Premier League games at United, which is by far and away the most of any other side in the competition during that timeframe. Southampton (13) and Wolves (10) are the closest behind.",
      "A change to the back three worked against Amorim last time out, with Harry Maguire starting in the back three for the first time in the league last season and playing a part in the first goal United conceded.",
      "Tinkering with his back line appears to be a consistent theme under Amorim. Leny Yoro, who started each of United's first four league games of the season, hasn't started since but has been introduced in the last two. Matthijs de Ligt and Luke Shaw have both started all of United's league games so far. However, Shaw has only completed 90 minutes in three of those games.",
      "The lack of consistency at the back of United has proved to be a reflection of their lack of consistency in both results and performances."

      "Manchester United forward Bryan Mbeumo admits the players \"need to take responsibility\" for their poor start to the season, which has put head coach Ruben Amorim under serious pressure.",
      "\"Obviously disappointed with the result, I had a warm welcome back from the fans and I will never forget that,\" he said.",
      "\"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility. When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do - as a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "Mbeumo has a unique perspective of the situation, having seen the noise outside of United and now witnessing it on the inside.",
      "The scrutiny has recently come from all directions. From former captains Wayne Rooney and Gary Neville to their away fans demanding them to 'attack, attack, attack' against Brentford in a lacklustre performance.",
      "Mbeumo said: \"Obviously it's different, it's not the same, but the only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",
      "\"It's not that hard [to block the noise out], obviously, the main thing we see is on social media, so it's just not going on there much, and you just have to stay focused on your own things.\"",
      "For all of the negativity that seems to surround Man Utd at this present time, there was a moment at the weekend that Amorim and United fans had been waiting for.",
      "That was the sight of summer signings Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo starting a Premier League game together for the first time.",
      "United spent over £200m on their new attacking trio, and now the focus will be on seeing how quickly they can click to catapult the team up the table.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" Mbeumo said.",
      "\"Of course it will improve, we haven't played a lot together, so there are certain things that we're going to improve, and there are different types of players, but it's good to be with them.\"",
      "One of Mbeumo's other team-mates is Bruno Fernandes, who has had a rollercoaster of a season himself.",
      "He scored the crucial winning penalty against Burnley but then missed spot-kicks against Fulham and Brentford - and although the United captain has often had to front up to criticism of his side, Mbeumo agreed to the idea that his team-mates may need to support their skipper in these difficult moments as well.",
      "The 26-year-old said: \"It's important to support him because this is what he's doing every time.",
      "\"I think it's normal for us to carry him as well sometimes because he gives us a lot, and it's good for him to have us as well.\"",
