      "Manchester United Under-18s wrapped up the U18 Premier League Cup in style, thrashing Birmingham City 6-0 at Carrington to secure maximum points from the group stage.",
      "Darren Fletcher's lads took a comfortable lead before half-time against a resilient Birmingham side. After initial attempts were foiled by visiting goalkeeper Szymon Terenowicz, United full-back Jacob Watson finally broke the deadlock with a goal direct from a corner kick.",
      "JJ Gabriel doubled the lead before half-time, tucking away a rebound from close range, and could have added more to his tally if not for the heroics of Terenowicz.",
      "Man Utd contact FIFA after player blocked from appearing in Premier League match",
      "Bruno Fernandes has blurred the lines but Saudi transfer appears inevitable",
      "Kai Rooney, son of club legend Wayne Rooney, was brought on after the interval, marking his return from injury. The 16-year-old had a goal disallowed for offside but later found the back of the net as part of United's four late goals.",
      "Rafe McCormack, Jay McEvoy and James Bailey each found the net once, before Rooney completed the scoring with a tidy finish from a tight angle inside the penalty area.",
      "With three wins from three group stage matches, the Under-18s progress to the quarter-finals, eagerly awaiting the reveal of their next adversary.",
      "Man United U18s pose for their team photograph ahead of kick-off against Birmingham City at Carrington on Wednesday afternoon. Darren Fletcher named several U18s regulars for the cup tie, though also picked three debutants at this age level. This included goalkeeper Charlie Hardy (top right), who joined the club's academy from Derby County earlier this month. He made an early save to deny Blues attacker Joseph Ralph a gilt-edged opportunity.",
      "JJ Gabriel was denied numerous times during the first half, until he was in the right place at the right time to stab in a rebound and double United's lead. He spread his arms in celebration.",
      "The 15-year-old is one of United's - if not the world's - brightest talents. Just last week he scored on his first appearance at Old Trafford in the FA Youth Cup, and has already trained with Ruben Amorim's senior squad.",
      "The first-team manager and Gabriel have met behind the scenes, undertaking a long meeting about where his career could go at United. Although the club are keen to manage expectations, the teenager is doing all he can to impress for his first major breakthrough.",
      "After early attempts were saved by Birmingham goalkeeper Szymon Terenowicz, it looked like it was going to take something special to break the deadlock.",
      "Up stepped Jacob Watson, who found the net directly from a corner kick after 17 minutes, and received many deserved pats on the back from his United teammates.",
      "Minutes after assisting Rafe McCormack and James McEvoy's headed goal for 4-0, James Bailey added a fifth for the U18s.",
      "The playmaker thrashed in a powerful effort having been teed up by McEvoy in return, and celebrated passionately.",
      "Rafe McCormack put in another controlling midfield performance against the Blues, and even got the goal to show for it. He diverted James Bailey's free-kick in off the post, which always adds a shine to any goal, and truly wrapped up the match at 3-0.",
      "Kai Rooney finished the afternoon's scoring, making it 6-0 to United. The teenager plucked the ball out of the air from a corner, took two controlling touches and smashed into the roof of Birmingham's net from a tight angle.",
      "It marked a delightful comeback for the son of United legend Wayne Rooney, who shared an update on a devastating injury sustained back in September. Although the exact nature was not known, the youngster showed off his right foot in a protective boot.",
      "The timing was heartbreaking as he had just been promoted to United's Under-19s squad, thus playing with others four years his senior. However, on Wednesday he was back with a bang and will be hoping to continue his upwards trajectory."

      "At the start of the month, it was announced that clubs only needed to release players from December 15, instead of 14 days before the tournament begins on December 21. That was little help to United, who were scheduled to face the Cherries on Monday through no fault of their own.",
      "Negotiations with Ivory Coast and Cameroon saw Amad and Bryan Mbeumo allowed to play in the dramatic 4-4 draw against Bournemouth. The Red Devils had also hoped to call on Mazraoui before their initial request was rejected by Morocco.",
      "United escalated the issue to FIFA but the governing body ultimately supported Morocco’s stance. The nation's decision aligned with their pre-tournament guidance, and the AFCON hosts play in the tournament's opening match.",
      "Mazraoui trained with Ruben Amorim's first team squad as usual in the build-up to his exit. The ex-Ajax ace is said to have remained ‘professional’ and 'respectful’ during the dispute.",
      "United’s hierarchy are said to feel they were ‘unfairly punished’ after their Premier League fixture was moved. They sought guidance from FIFA but found no solution, with Italian giants Roma and La Liga side Real Betis experiencing similar frustrations in their own dealings with Morocco.",
      "FIFA urged international federations and clubs to 'hold bilateral discussions in good faith to find appropriate individual solutions'.",
      "It said: \"In cases where there continues to be a dispute over the release of players subsequent to such bilateral discussions, Fifa will, in mediating between both parties, apply guidelines that take into account the circumstances of each case, including factors related to the timing of matches of affected competitions, the stage of these competitions, the historical and planned involvement of the players in the matches in question, as well as any other pertinent factors.\"",
      "Amorim will now be without Mazraoui, Amad and Mbeumo for the festive period. Former United defender Paul Parker reckons the latter's abilities will be most keenly felt.",
      "\"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him,\" Parker told MyBettingSites.co.uk.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has hinted that Manchester United target Morten Hjulmand would be a perfect addition to the squad, whilst highlighting the midfielder's standout attributes. The Sporting Clube de Portugal skipper was strongly linked with a switch to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, when the club were searching for midfield reinforcements.",
      "The Denmark international has been tipped to link up with Ruben Amorim at the Reds following their successful partnership at Sporting in Lisbon. Whilst other names such as Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson have been mentioned, rumours continue to suggest that the Reds could reignite their interest in Hjulmand next year.",
      "In the summer, however, United chose not to prioritise strengthening their midfield during the summer but are believed to not be rushing to bring forward those plans with a January swoop. Any potential move, though, could face competition from Manchester City, with Portuguese publication Record claiming that City might also consider a possible deal.",
      "Nevertheless, Fernandes has already backed the prospect of potentially seeing Hjulmand arrive at M16 in the coming months. Speaking to Portuguese broadcaster Canal 11, the captain was asked to identify three players from Liga Portugal who could thrive in the Premier League.",
      "\"You have a lot of midfielders,\" he said. \"One of them, because of his intelligence and the dynamic he brings to the game, is Fredrik Aursnes.",
      "\"He's a player who would adapt to the Premier League regardless of his physicality. He's slim‐built, but I believe intelligent players always prevail here.",
      "\"Obviously, Morten Hjulmand is a complete player at the moment.\"",
      "When questioned about whether he'd welcome Hjulmand at United, Fernandes stated: \"He's a player who adds to the team.",
      "\"He's intelligent, aggressive, and in the Premier League you need that. But only once you're here do you realise if you're really made for the Premier League, because it's very different compared to other leagues.",
      "\"In my view, Hjulmand would adapt well here, but I also see him fitting in the Italian league.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Fernandes' remarks about his own future have fuelled further speculation. He suggested the club didn't have the bottle to tell him to move on last summer, and revealed he intends to reassess his situation following the 2026 World Cup.",
      "It's understood that United have no intention of letting Fernandes go before the summer transfer window closes, during which investment will be made to bolster the midfield.",

      "Former Liverpool and Manchester United striker Paul Ince has urged Antoine Semenyo to wait until the summer transfer window rather than making a January switch away from Bournemouth. Ince believes that a Premier League top-four finish will decide which of his ex-clubs emerges victorious in the tussle for the winger's signature.",
      "Semenyo, 25, has been an instrumental figure under Bournemouth Andoni Iraola, bagging 18 goals and providing eight assists in the top-flight since the start of the 2024/25 campaign.",
      "His impressive form has led to intense speculation about the possibility of a move away during the January transfer window, with a reported £65million release clause in place and Liverpool among a host of clubs supposedly monitoring his situation.",
      "But the player has been urged to pause and consider his options carefully before rushing into any mid-season move, reports the Liverpool Echo.",
      "\"I was surprised that Liverpool or Manchester United didn't sign Antoine Semenyo at the start of the season, because he's a top player,\" Ince told Covers.com.",
      "\"He should wait until the summer transfer window to make a move; January isn't a great time to move and clubs often don't like parting with players midway through a season.",
      "\"I don't see him staying put beyond the summer though. Bournemouth are great at sourcing players from all over the world, but ultimately they’ve always been a selling club.",
      "\"He'll have plenty of options on the table. He's got all the attributes to improve even more too; he's great on both feet, strong, quick and can bag you plenty of goals, as we've seen so far this year.\"",
      "Liverpool currently occupy seventh spot in the Premier League standings. Speculation linking them with Semenyo emerges whilst Mohamed Salah's future at Anfield beyond January remains uncertain, with Cody Gakpo's recent injury adding to the Reds' woes in the wide forward department.",
      "Arne Slot's side share the same points tally as sixth-placed arch-rivals Manchester United, who began the campaign hoping to secure European football under manager Ruben Amorim's first full term at the helm.",
      "The Old Trafford outfit have also been linked with a move for Semenyo. Ince believes whichever club can guarantee the Ghana international Champions League action next term will triumph in the transfer race.",
      "\"In terms of whether he’ll move to Liverpool or Man Utd, it depends on which one will finish in the top four and have Champions League football to look forward to next season,\" Ince added.",
      "\"If I were in his position, I’d stay put for now at Bournemouth until the end of the season, and see which one of those teams finishes in the top four.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Iraola has provided insight into how Semenyo has handled the transfer talk surrounding his future.",
      "\"Obviously, when you hear your name every day in the news, you have to deal with these situations,\" Iraola said. \"But I think he's committed and I haven't seen a lot of changes in him.\"",

      "Roma have reportedly entered talks with Manchester United over the signing of Joshua Zirkzee in the January transfer window. The Italian side are interested in securing Zirkzee’s services mid-season, but the financial details of the deal are yet to be ironed out, with United holding firm.",
      "Zirkzee has struggled to hold down a place in Ruben Amorim’s side since joining the club from Bologna in the summer of 2024 for £36.5million. He has managed just eight goals and three assists in 59 appearances for United and has been strongly linked with a move away from Old Trafford in 2026.",
      "The arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for over £200m in the summer has seen Zirkzee relegated in the pecking order. He did score in the 2-1 away win over Crystal Palace last month but has not earned the trust of Amorim, prompting the possibility of a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim’s options up front have just been diminished by Mbeumo leaving to play at the Africa Cup of Nations. Nevertheless, United are understood to be open to losing Zirkzee, but only if the terms are right. That is where Roma are struggling to find common ground.",
      "If they are to do business, United want a permanent sale or a loan deal that guarantees a future payment. A fee of around €35-40m (£30-35m) has been floated, given the 24-year-old is under contract until June 2029.",
      "However, Roma want to structure a deal that suits them better: a loan deal worth an initial €5m-6m (£4.3-5.2m) with an obligation to buy which is attached to the team qualifying for the Champions League. Zirkzee is reportedly open to resurrecting his career under manager Gian Piero Gasperini, but negotiations are essentially at a standstill for now.",
      "Amorim outlined the club’s stance towards doing business in January after being asked about Zirkzee and Kobbie Mainoo last month. “I was a football player,” he said. “I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation.",
      "“I understand the frustration of some players, seeing the World Cup is there. I know what it means. But the first thing is that the club comes first. If I can help the club and the players, I will be happy. If not, I have to think about the team.”",
      "With Mbeumo away playing for Cameroon at AFCON and both Cunha and Sesko having just shaken off injuries, it seems it would take a bid that is simply too juicy to turn down for United to sanction Zirkzee’s exit.",

      "Bruno Fernandes' career trajectory could have been vastly different had he joined the first Premier League side to express interest in signing him. While he has thrived at Manchester United, they weren't the quickest off the mark when it came to pursuing his signature.",
      "It was during the summer of 2019, while Mauricio Pochettino was at the helm of Tottenham, that they first made enquiries about signing the then-Sporting CP playmaker. However, the north London outfit were reluctant to meet the asking price, meaning he stayed in Portugal.",
      "The 31-year-old eventually made the switch to Old Trafford for an initial £47million just under six months later. Today, Fernandes is considered one of the Premier League's top stars and has captained United for nearly three seasons.",
      "But the story could have unfolded very differently had Spurs been prepared to pay the required fee a little more than six years ago. Fernandes addressed the potential transfer diplomatically when speaking about it at the close of the 2019 summer transfer window.",
      "In an interview with GQ, he said: \"As you all know, Tottenham made a lot of proposals for me. Everything was right with me - or practically should be. I never made any big demands, my manager was always dealing with the finances.",
      "\"It was, and is, my goal to play in England. Sporting know that, everyone knows that, and there were conditions for things to be done. But Sporting understood that the value was not enough and I have to respect the decision.\"",
      "Fernandes' future at Old Trafford has become a hot topic once more following fresh speculation about a potential departure next year. He was reportedly targeted by Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal during the summer window, and he's now spoken candidly about the rumours, taking a swipe at United for failing to make him feel sufficiently valued.",
      "\"I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club,\" he told Maisfutebol. \"The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'If you leave, it's not so bad for us'. It hurts me a lot.",
      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, and I always play, good or bad, I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much... that makes you sad.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim clearly had a significant influence in persuading United's skipper to remain at the club for at least another campaign. Yet this may only be a short-term solution, as Fernandes has since given another interview suggesting he could be tempted by moves to Spain, Italy or Portugal.",
      "He revealed to Canal 11 that he \"would like to experience the Spanish league and fight for big titles in Italy,\" where his daughter was born. He also mentioned Sporting as a possible reunion if they were to approach him.",
      "The attacking midfielder has recorded 196 direct goal contributions across 307 appearances for United and remains under contract at Old Trafford until 2027, with an option for an additional year. Tottenham may rue their decision not to stump up the cash for a player who has repeatedly demonstrated his quality in England, with their missed opportunity becoming a major United coup.",

      "Spanish media have delivered their verdict after Marcus Rashford's strike helped Barcelona dodge a cup catastrophe against third-tier Guadalajara. Rashford's team toiled to break down their opponents but finally found the breakthrough in the 76th minute.",
      "Barcelona were anticipated to comfortably sweep aside the Castilian outfit, who languish approximately 60 positions beneath them in the Spanish football pyramid. However, with Rashford deployed from kick-off as a frontman, they failed to find the net for considerable periods.",
      "As the final whistle loomed, an almost inconceivable outcome beckoned before Andreas Christensen's deflected header handed the Catalan giants a 1-0 advantage. Rashford sealed the victory in the 90th minute with the opposition defence stretched thin.",
      "The on-loan Manchester United ace's team sidestepped humiliation and progressed safely to the Copa del Rey last 16. Whilst certain media publications were swift to praise Rashford, others felt the Englishman endured a below-par evening.",
      "Marca characterised Rashford's deployment as a striker in Hansi Flick's XI on Tuesday night as a \"gamble\" and their match commentary proved somewhat harsh regarding Rashford's display.",
      "The 28-year-old enjoyed numerous chances against the lower-league outfit but either saw his efforts drift wide or get thwarted by an inspired Daniel Vicente. In the 68th minute, Marca observed: \"Rashford's pass to himself is too long and he shoots it straight out. The Englishman isn't accurate.\"",
      "Vicente repeatedly thwarted Rashford's attempts to find the net, with Marca's post-match report claiming he caused Barcelona and the striker \"significant trouble.\"",
      "Shortly before Rashford found his breakthrough, he fouled Guadalajara's Javier Ablanque whilst attempting to beat him, prompting the publication to note: \"Rashford couldn't get past Ablanque and ended up committing a foul. It's not the Englishman's night.\"",
      "However, not everyone was harsh in their assessment of Rashford's display. AS lavished praise on goalkeeper Vicente for his saves against Rashford, rather than criticising the Englishman for his misses. They even labelled Rashford's eventual finish as showing \"class.\"",
      "AS reported: \"There was curiosity to see if the German would come up with something at half-time. Joan Laporta [Barcelona president] wasn't entirely convinced either. It was time for Flick.",
      "\"The German made some changes. Above all, he changed all the attacking pieces. Lamine [Yamal] moved to the right, [Roony] Bardghji to the middle, Fermín [Lopez] to center forward and Rashford to the left. The Englishman had the first two chances of the second half. Vicente was lightning-fast on both. Excellent, one might say, on the second.",
      "\"Guadalajara fought back. Salifo unleashed a spectacular shot that tested Marc-Andre ter Stegen's return. It was his last gasp. With space to operate, Rashford sealed the victory with class.\"",
      "Sport concentrated on Rashford's strike, praising him for breaking a drought that had stretched back to November 2. They reported: \"The match began with Ter Stegen's unexpected inclusion in the starting line up and ended with a crucial save from him to prevent Guadalajara from equalizing before Rashford sealed the victory.",
      "\"The Englishman, who had been a standout provider in recent weeks, hadn't scored since November 2nd against Elche. Rashy now has seven goals and 11 assists this season, having found the net in all three competitions.",
      "\"Against Guadalajara, he started as a center forward but showed his best form when he moved to the left wing. He scored one goal, but it could have been three.\"",
      "Sport awarded the now-established Rashford seven out of ten for his display on Tuesday, using just one word to capture how the English sensation performed: \"Insistent.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo employed a comparable term to characterise Rashford in their post-match assessment, describing him in their player ratings as: \"Persistent.\"",
      "They added: \"He didn't despair even though he missed two very clear chances with the score at 0-0 and ended up sealing the passage to the round of 16 by scoring with quality.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo also indicated that Rashford's endeavours on the evening merited a goal, noting: \"A brilliant assist from Lamine allowed Rashford (who deserved it) to score the second goal in the 90th minute.\"",

      "Manchester United look set to play in Finland for the first time in 60 years in a money-spinning friendly with Wrexham. Red Devils chiefs are currently putting together plans for the club’s pre-season schedule ahead of the 2026/27 campaign.",
      "And within that, United are set to take on Championship side Wrexham, who are backed by Hollywood duo Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac. The game will represent a money-spinning opportunity for both clubs, while it is also set to make history for the Premier League side.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, the match is expected to be held in Finland. United have not played a game in the Scandinavian nation since the 1965/66 season when they took on HJK Helsinki in the European Cup.",
      "Then managed by Sir Matt Busby, United secured a 3-2 victory. Away from the Wrexham game, another pre-season friendly is expected to be staged in Gothenburg, Sweden.",
      "The clash with the Welsh side will represent the second showdown between the two clubs in three years, having previously met in 2023. The game ended in a 3-1 win for Wrexham, albeit boss Phil Parkinson was left furious after a challenge from United’s Nathan Bishop left Paul Mullin with a punctured lung.",
      "He said: “I’m fuming about it, I’ve got to be honest with you. It was a clumsy, reckless challenge in a pre-season game and I’m not happy with it at all. I haven’t seen the goalie and he’s probably best steering clear of us for the time being because we’re not very happy.",
      "“It’s a clumsy challenge from the goalkeeper, I’m disappointed with that. It should have been a straight red. If it’s not denying a goalscoring opportunity it’s still a dangerous challenge so if you add the two scenarios together he should have been off the pitch.”",
      "“It’s a dangerous challenge and obviously Paul Mullin is our talisman,” Parkinson added. “The way the lads responded after that I thought was outstanding. That’s what we’re all about as a group – resilience, sticking together. And that’s what we showed.”",
      "Wrexham have enjoyed a meteoric rise up through the English football pyramid since their last clash with United. Fresh off the back of promotion from the National League in 2023, the Welsh side now find themselves in the Championship.",
      "They have enjoyed a positive start to life back in the second tier, with 28 points from their opening 21 league games leaving them in 15th ahead of this weekend’s clash with Welsh rivals Swansea City.",

      "Manchester United defender Harry Amass is attracting plenty of attention ahead of the January transfer window, despite Ruben Amorim claiming that he is \"struggling\" this season. Amass is currently on loan with Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship, but could switch teams in January.",
      "The left-back joined Wednesday on a four-month loan deal on transfer deadline day. He has settled well, making 15 appearances for the club so far, contributing one goal and one assist.",
      "The United boss raised eyebrows ahead of the Bournemouth game when he said \"Amass is now struggling in the Championship\" while discussing the situation with the club's academy graduates. The club later clarified that Amorim was referring to the Owls' league position, not Amass' own fortunes, but Wednesday may struggle to hold onto him in the New Year.",
      "Despite Amass earning the Yorkshire club's player of the month award for November, they are rooted to the bottom of the Championship on -9 points following two points deductions and a solitary win in 20 games. Manager Henrik Pedersen has made it clear that his side want to extend Amass' loan deal, but that decision could be taken out of their hands.",
      "The Daily Mail reports that Stoke and Millwall are both keen on signing Amass in January and United could be tempted to move their young player to the top end of the Championship. Both Stoke and Millwall are currently in the play-off places and could offer a more challenging environment for Amass, who is behind Patrick Dorgu, Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot at his parent club.",
      "In total, it is believed around 12 clubs have expressed an interest in signing Amass in January. But the player himself is very happy at Wednesday and United may decide not to disrupt his momentum mid-campaign, even though relegation to League One looking is all but certain for his loan side.",
      "Amorim has not been forthcoming with opportunities for youngsters since arriving over a year ago at Old Trafford. Amass, Tyler Fredricson and Chido Obi are the only three United academy graduates to have made their first-team debuts for the club under the Portuguese manager, who hinted that he hasn't been impressed by the standard of the players progressing through the system.",
      "Asked about the situation given the ongoing struggles for Kobbie Mainoo to get minutes, Amorim said: \"He (Toby Collyer) played (for United). He's from the academy. He played here. He went to West Bromwich. He's not playing. He played for Manchester United. So sometimes it's not because he's from the academy or whatever.",
      "“It's the situation, what's happened. I don't know what is going to be the future (for Mainoo). Let's see after this match. Amass is now struggling in the Championship. Chido is not always a starter in under-21s. All these guys played when a lot of people were saying sack the manager!”",

      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing up Antoine Semenyo for a wing-back role if they manage to secure his signature in the January transfer window, it is claimed. The 25-year-old put in a stellar performance for Bournemouth during Monday's 4-4 draw against United, netting his seventh Premier League goal of the season.",
      "The Ghana international showcased his skills by driving from the right channel into the box and delivering a flawless shot into the bottom corner, leaving goalkeeper Senne Lammens with no chance. A number of clubs are said to be interested in him ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "As per the Independent, United are keen to make a move for Semenyo next month. The player has a £65million release clause in his contract that comes into effect from New Year's Day and the Reds are ready to outmanoeuvre their Premier League rivals - including Tottenham and Manchester City - to bag his services.",
      "United are reportedly confident about their chances of landing Semenyo and are gearing up to make a move in January. The club's board and Amorim are said to be fans of Semenyo's tactical versatility, which they see as a valuable asset.",
      "While Semenyo has been playing as a wide forward for Bournemouth this season to great success, United envisage him in an attacking wing-back role, with Amad Diallo on the opposite flank. Semenyo is believed to be open to such a proposition as he contemplates his future.",
      "Should Semenyo join United and take up the left wing-back position with Amad on the right, it wouldn't affect Bryan Mbeumo, who would continue in his usual right forward role under Amorim. The same applies to Mason Mount, who enjoys Amorim's backing and has featured in three of the past four fixtures on the left flank of the attacking trio.",
      "Matheus Cunha, meanwhile, was deployed through the centre. Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot would feel the effects, though, as both have shared duties in the left wing-back role this campaign.",
      "With Amorim rotating between the pair, it seems he hasn't identified a clear preference. Discussing Semenyo ahead of his pre-Bournemouth press briefing, Amorim remarked: \"They have a special player. They have many good players, but they have a special player in Semenyo. [He] can play both sides with both feet.\"",
      "Beyond Semenyo, United are keen to bring in two midfielders, with Brighton's Carlos Baleba and Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson among their primary objectives for the January and summer transfer windows. However, a big-money move could be forced to wait until the end of the season.",
      "United spent over £200m in the summer to bolster their attack in signing Matheus Cunha and Mbeumo. One of the priority positions throughout the first half of the season was a new midfielder amid uncertainty over Casemiro's future.",
      "Now, Bruno Fernandes' bombshell interview, where he admitted he would be open to three moves away from Old Trafford, has placed further emphasis on Amorim signing a new midfielder. \"I want to stay at Manchester United as long as I feel desired,\" he said in an open interview with Canal 11.",
      "\"I would like to experience the Spanish league and fight for big titles in Italy. I have many connections to Italy. My daughter was born there.",
      "\"I've already thought about returning to Portugal. The first option would be Sporting. To be happy, like it was with Sporting but I don’t want to ruin the image that was left. I don’t want to drag myself there, I want to add to it.",
      "\"And even try district football, at an advanced age. You play in the district for love, you feel different. I have friends in the district.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has green-lit an exit from Manchester United by revealing that he would be open to moves to Spain, Italy and Portugal. The Red Devils captain has put his future into major doubt over recent days.",
      "An interview that he recorded with Portuguese media during the recent international break was released over the past few days, featuring some particularly outspoken comments. Within it, Fernandes admitted that he felt as though he was being pushed out of the club during the summer, albeit he eventually ended up staying.",
      "In a further release, the 31-year-old has confirmed where he would go should he leave Old Trafford. Speaking to Canal 11, the Portuguese playmaker said: “I want to stay at Manchester United as long as I feel desired.",
      "“I would like to experience the Spanish league and fight for big titles in Italy. I have many connections to Italy… my daughter was born there.",
      "“I’ve already thought about returning to Portugal… the first option would be Sporting. To be happy, like it was with Sporting. But I don’t want to ruin the image that was left.",

      "Fernandes started his career in Italy as he represented Novara, Udinese and Sampdoria before a move to Sporting Lisbon. He enjoyed a hugely successful spell with the Portuguese side before making the switch to Manchester United in January 2020.",
      "Fernandes has never played in Spain but has regularly been linked with Real Madrid. And while it appears that his preference is to remain in Europe, he has also claimed that he would not close the door on a switch to the Middle East in the future.",
      "He said: “If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I'll play in Saudi Arabia. My lifestyle will change, my children's lives will be sunny, after six years in Manchester with cold and rain, I'll be playing in a growing league, with renowned players.",
      "“I could have left like many people do and said: ‘I want to leave, I don't want to train, I just want to leave for 20 or 30 million, so they pay me more on the other side.’ But I never did that.",
      "“I never felt in a position to do it, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same. But it gets to a point where, for them, money is more important than anything. The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head.",
      "“I told the directors that, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision, because the manager wanted me. If I had said I wanted to leave, they would have let me go.”",

      "There is a lot about the latest instalment of the Bruno Fernandes-Saudi Arabia saga that does not make complete sense. But one thing is for sure.",
      "The first time the wider public was aware such a move was on the cards was when Fernandes told those of us who were in the media area of San Mames stadium in Bilbao late on May 21. Pretty much out of the blue - in the immediate disappointment of a loss in the Europa League final - it was Fernandes who officially set the transfer ball rolling into the public domain.",
      "Less than an hour after Spurs had completed victory in a dismal contest, this is what Fernandes said. It was completely unprompted.",
      "“If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it is what it is. And football sometimes is like this.",
      "“I have always been honest. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go.”",
      "We were all a little but stunned by Fernandes’ words but it was clear the idea of him leaving United had been the subject of discussion. While he told reporters in October that the club had wanted him to stay, he has now told Portuguese television that the club wanted him to go and that hurt him.",
      "The lines are blurred. But we do know that Fernandes’ representatives were in advanced talks with Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal over the summer, only for the player to finally turn down an offer that would have been worth a basic £700,000 a week.",
      "The club will point to Fernandes’ comments about United wanting him to stay when privately discussing his latest claim that they wanted him out. All somewhat confusing. But the truth is surely somewhere in the middle.",
      "Saudi interest in relatively ageing but established stars can be a game-changer. If a club can get £100million for a player about to turn 31, the chief executive - or whoever - would not be doing his job if he didn’t strongly consider it, even if the player was one of the best.",
      "And here’s the thing. There is little doubt that Fernandes has been United’s best player over the last half-decade, the best at United since he arrived in January, 2020.",
      "Fernandes has 103 goals and 93 assists in 307 games for the club and has been captain since July, 2023. But he has also been part of the comparative mediocrity that has engulfed Old Trafford in recent seasons.",
      "It is harsh to put it like that but it is the inescapable truth. He has been a constant throughout the Premier League struggles. Without him, United might have struggled even more but he was still the skipper who led his team to 15th in the Premier League last season.",
      "Fernandes has spoken with Cristiano Ronaldo about Saudi and has spoken warmly about the prospect of playing out there. And from a financial point of view, it would clearly hold considerable attraction for him. All the signs point to him ending up there.",
      "But when? It will not be in January. United need every bit of inspiration they can muster for a second half of a season when not finishing in a top-four position will be inexcusable.",
      "But if Al-Hilal comes up with another very lumpy offer in the summer - and Fernandes will be 32 next September - don’t be surprised if the club is more amenable to taking the money this time around.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The pick of United's goal was a perfectly placed free-kick from captain Bruno Fernandes. But the Portuguese midfielder has now hit out at his club after the clash, accusing United of trying to force him out over the summer to Saudi Arabia.",

      "\"I can't complain. I'm very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I'll play in Saudi Arabia,\" Fernandes said, speaking to Canal 11.",

      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available. I always play, whether it's good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much. That makes you sad.\"",
      "Two midfielders who featured against United in Monday's draw are reportedly being eyed up by Amorim's side. Tyler Adams started the game at the base of the Cherries' midfield and according to The Daily Mail, he is of interest to United.",
      "Adams came off injured in the stalemate and so this could scupper a potential January transfer. Still, reports suggest United have an eye on the American, who is valued at around £40million.",
      "The 26-year-old is supposedly not the only Bournemouth midfielder who United have shown interest in, either. Young England star Alex Scott is also thought to be on their radar, according to The Sun.",
      "Scott came off the bench on Monday and his current value is estimated at around £25-30m. Whether the club would move for both of these stars or just one remains to be seen, but reports suggest these Bournemouth aces are on United's agenda.",

      "The 31-year-old said in comments that emerged this week that he was hurt by the club after claiming they 'wanted' to sell him back in the summer. The comments from the Portuguese star, who had attracted serious interest from Saudi Arabia, have sparked fresh speculation around his future at the club.",
      "And Fernandes' telling remarks that surfaced on Tuesday evening will no doubt stoke the flames even more, admitting that he would be open to moves to Spain, Italy and Portugal.",
      "However, he made it clear that his priority is to remain at United, but only on the condition that they show him love. In an open interview with Portuguese broadcaster Canal 11, Fernandes said of his future: \"I want to stay at Manchester United as long as I feel desired.\"",

      "The 30-year-old has been heavily linked with a move to Saudi Arabia. In the summer, Fernandes was courted by Al-Hilal but decided to reject the deal and stay at Old Trafford.",
      "Al-Hilal were said to have offered Fernandes a staggering £700,000 per week, a deal that would have netted him close to £200 million over three years. He has also remained in close touch with Ronaldo and been linked with his team, Al-Nassr.",
      "Despite the riches on offer in the Middle East, the United star clearly finds the appeal of top-flight European football more appealing.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker has once again been United's standout player this season and scored a remarkable free-kick in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday night. Despite Fernandes playing a key role in the team's progression under Amorim, he hit out at the club he has called home for the past five years.",
      "“Nowadays, the issue of loyalty is no longer seen the way it used to be,” he said. “I could have left in the last transfer window and would have earned a lot more money. Financially, it would have been much better for me.",
      "“At one point I was going to leave – I won’t say where – but I would have won many trophies that season. I decided to stay not only for family reasons but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the coach also made me stay.",

More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly launched an inquiry into how Ruben Amorim’s plans to tweak his system leaked out on the day of the Bournemouth game. United's head coach has favoured a three-man defence since his move from Sporting to Old Trafford in November 2024.",
      "However, he made a slight adjustment during Monday night's 4-4 draw at home to the Cherries, with Diogo Dalot moving from his usual wing-back position on the left to a traditional full-back role in a four-man defence.",
      "Nevertheless, word of this change was leaked on Monday afternoon, reportedly causing concern at United that Bournemouth may have been given advance notice of their strategy on the day of the match.",
      "The Mail now claim that United are committed to identifying the source of the leak to prevent such incidents from recurring in the future. A club spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "A concerned Amorim was asked about the change post-match on Monday and chose to turn the question back onto the media.",
      "He said: \"That is for you to discuss, not for me. I know that you guys know that I trained this week with a back four. I don't know how, but that is a good thing for you guys to discuss this week.\"",
      "Kitbag has slashed up to 65% off football kits and merch. Fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "Monday's incident is not the first involving leaks at the club under Amorim, with United said to have been ‘furious’ in September over reports that Red Devils captain Bruno Fernandes is ‘unhappy’. United's team selection was also leaked well ahead of the Manchester derby in December 2024.",
      "Several other stories were leaked last season, including those over squad issues and team news, with United's hierarchy taking steps to identify the mole in the camp. Other managerial tenures at M16, under Erik ten Hag, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and Jose Mourinho, were also plagued by leaks.",
      "United started well against Andoni Iraola's team on Monday, with Amad deservedly putting Amorim's men a goal ahead in the first half before they were pegged back by Antoine Semenyo's equaliser.",
      "Casemiro nodded United back in front on the stroke of half-time from a corner, before a quick-fire double at the start of the second half gave Bournemouth the lead. Fernandes then equalised with a stunning free-kick before Matheus Cunha put the Red Devils ahead again.",
      "But again, United could not hang on to their lead with Eli Junior Kroupi pulling the Cherries level once more. The hosts have now moved up to sixth in the top-flight table, with Bournemouth nudging themselves up to 13th.",
      "\"If you understand a little bit,\" Amorim said post-match. \"If you follow the club like I follow the Premier League for so long, you [know you] have not just the duty to try to win the games. The way you try to win the games is so important for the fans.",
      "\"Of course they are desperate to win, but also, I feel that they are desperate to be inspired when they come to Old Trafford. Today was inspiring, I think, also because of Bournemouth. But in the end that's the feeling of frustration of not winning the game.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim was spotted looking visibly irritated in the technical area during Manchester United's epic 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday evening. The 40-year-old manager vented his frustrations to his backroom team, specifically targeting Leny Yoro.",
      "In footage posted by a supporter on social media, Amorim could be seen gesturing wildly as he sat back down, before shouting in his native Portuguese: \"The ball has gone for half an hour, what is Leny doing?\". The exact moment during the match when this happened remains unclear.",
      "Earlier this month, Amorim suggested Yoro 'thinks too much' after the 20 year old appeared dejected on the substitutes' bench following his withdrawal in the 54th minute during United's 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace. \"I also spoke with him because he thinks too much,\" he said.",
      "\"He makes a mistake in the game and then he struggles because he's too young and he wants to do everything so well. He's growing with games and with setbacks, it's not easy for him as a young guy. He cannot give that [reaction] to the people, the way he came to the bench. He understands that but he was really frustrated.\"",
      "\"It shows he cares. He knows it wasn't his best game but he did some things well and I showed him that. He's fit and ready for the next challenge.\"",
      "Despite taking the lead three times at Old Trafford, United failed to secure a win. Bruno Fernandes and Matheus Cunha netted goals in rapid succession, making it 4-3 with just 10 minutes left on the clock.",
      "Amad and Casemiro also scored, showcasing an improved offensive performance. However, the draw meant that United missed out on the opportunity to ascend to fifth place in the Premier League as their defensive weaknesses were laid bare.",
      "\"It's really disappointing, we are really disappointed,\" Amorim said post-match. \"Crazy game.",
      "\"It might look like we lost the two points in the second half but I think we lost them in the first half. We dominated and created so many chances. We had to go to half-time with a different result.",
      "\"In the end we deserved more. It was a fun game for everyone at home. I think we started really well. We did a very good first half. The result should be completely different.",
      "\"And then, again, I think six minutes into the second half, similar to Nottingham [Forest], we lost the concentration and they scored two goals, but we managed to get back into the game.",
      "\"We score two goals again and then we have to finish the game. A throw-in in our possession, we need to think about, not to go again but to take calm and to close the game. In the end, it was a fun game.\"",

      "Manchester United face an \"impossible\" challenge to replace Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo whilst the pair are away at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). That's according to former United defender Paul Parker, who reckons United have been handed a \"nightmare\" scenario with both Mbeumo and Amad - their only two senior right wing options - jetting off to the tournament this week.",
      "Mbeumo, 26, has made a strong impression at Old Trafford since his £65million plus add-ons transfer from Brentford in July, finding the net seven times in 17 outings for the Reds. Meanwhile, Amad, who has shifted back to right-wing back this season to make room for Mbeumo, has been crucial to Ruben Amorim's system since his arrival and netted the opening goal in Monday's 4-4 stalemate against Bournemouth.",
      "However, United will now be deprived of both Mbeumo and Amad for a minimum of the next two-and-a-half weeks. AFCON kicks off this Sunday, with Mbeumo's Cameroon taking to the pitch first on Wednesday, 24 December against Gabon, whilst Amad's Ivory Coast begins their campaign against Mozambique on the same day.",
      "However, if Cameroon and/or the Ivory Coast progress to the knockout stages, they wouldn't be available for United's clash with Leeds and could potentially miss additional fixtures, including the FA Cup third-round tie against Brighton.",
      "The AFCON final is scheduled for Sunday, January 18, which means Mbeumo and Amad could miss up to eight United games should their respective countries reach the final.",
      "United manager Amorim will need to find a solution to cope without Mbeumo and Amad for the foreseeable future - a task that pundit Parker believes will be extremely challenging.",
      "Parker told MyBettingSites.co.uk: \"It is impossible for Man United to cope with the loss of Mbeumo when he leaves for the AFCON. They simply can't. They have no one close to his level, so they will struggle without him.",
      "\"He is going to be a massive miss, and I can't see how they can do anything without him. We have to remember that he is one of the best players in the league, and he is definitely the best player from Manchester United.",
      "\"He is seriously scary on that right hand side, but who should replace him? Amad Diallo is gone as well. Will they play Mason Mount or Zirkzee there? Gosh, I can't imagine how that is going to look.",
      "\"Of course, Amad will be a massive miss as well,\" Parker added. \"Man United might have to change their whole approach, because nothing will come from that right hand side without them. Amad is a big threat and we can see that in every game. No one is able to take on their opponent like him, so no one can replace him.",
      "\"Combined with both of them being out, that is going to be a nightmare. It will be a true nightmare, and I don't really have faith that other players can step up to their level, which is normally expected at a big club like Manchester United.\"",
      "Mbeumo and Amad aren't the only United players missing due to AFCON. Noussair Mazraoui is another, with the full-back set to represent Morocco at the tournament.",

      "Manchester United are ready to launch a move to sign Antoine Semenyo in January - and they already have plans for where he'd play. Bournemouth star Semenyo was among eight different goalscorers during Monday's rip-roaring 4-4 draw at Old Trafford.",
      "The 25-year-old forward ended a barren run of seven Bournemouth games without a goal, having enjoyed a prolific start to the season. Semenyo scored six times and provided three assists in the Cherries' opening eight matches to follow on from an impressive 2024-25 campaign.",
      "His exploits for Andoni Iraola's side have piqued the interest of multiple Premier League clubs, with Liverpool, Manchester City and Tottenham also linked. And it's enquiries from those rivals that could spring United into action.",
      "The Independent report that United are prepared to sign Semenyo during the winter transfer window, if their competitors make a move. The Red Devils, who are making plans for another big-spending summer, are reportedly confident that they can win the race for the London-born Ghana international, despite their lack of European football this season.",
      "Semenyo has a £65million release clause in his Bournemouth contract, but there's a catch. It must be triggered by January 15 in order for the Cherries to have sufficient time to sign a replacement before the window closes on February 3.",
      "Ruben Amorim is said to be a fan of the ex-Bristol City star's tactical versatility and United can imagine him playing at left wing-back with Amad on the right. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday, Amorim described Semenyo as a 'special player'.",
      "Semenyo, it's added, is open to moving to Old Trafford next month. Until then, he's focussed on helping Bournemouth recover their form after extending their winless run to seven games.",
      "\"I'm enjoying my football here. If I'm not scoring goals, all of that goes away. I try to stay present, do the best I can for the team, score goals and whatever happens in the future happens.\"",
      "Semenyo could the next cab off the rank at Bournemouth, with the Cherries having sold Dean Huijsen, Milos Kerkez and Illia Zabarnyi for a combined £150million last summer. \"When they all left, there was a lot of interest and back and forth with the club,\" he said.",
      "\"But I knew in my head that the manager's got something up his sleeve this year. How we finished off the season last year was so good and we could continue, especially with the players we've bought in as well.",
      "\"I wasn't too sure at the start but we've kicked on like a house on fire. I'm glad I committed to staying here because I'm enjoying every moment.\"",

      "Manchester United have no intention of parting ways with Bruno Fernandes, despite renewed speculation about his future at Old Trafford. Last summer, Fernandes turned down an offer from Saudi Arabia, but his future has once again become a hot topic following the release of an interview with the Portuguese midfielder.",
      "In a chat with Canal 11, Fernandes hinted that United were open to him moving to Al-Hilal during the summer transfer window. The United skipper also suggested that the club's board lacked the \"courage\" to make the decision on his behalf.",
      "Fernandes went on to say: \"From the club's side, I felt a bit like, 'If you leave, it's not so bad for us'. It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player who they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, and I always play - good or bad - I give my all.\"",
      "However, club insiders have reiterated that the management was clear throughout the summer that Fernandes was integral to their future plans. They pointed to his own statement from an October sit-down with Manchester-based reporters, where he claimed that the club shared Ruben Amorim's wish for him to stay.",
      "Last summer, United contemplated signing Carlos Baleba. Brighton slapped a hefty price tag of over £100million on the midfielder, and United prioritised bolstering other areas of their squad.",
      "They have also kept tabs on Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton. Casemiro's contract is set to run out at the end of this season. While there is an option for a 12-month extension, activating it would mean the 33-year-old remains the top earner in the dressing room.",
      "Despite expectations that Casemiro will depart once his contract ends, he has become a key figure for Amorim this season, sparking rumours that he might stay on at United.",
      "United are looking to beef up their midfield when the season concludes. The Reds were satisfied with not bringing in a midfielder last summer as the club chiefs were confident that the existing options were robust enough to secure European football.",
      "Fernandes' contract is due to expire in 2027, with an option to extend it by another year. He has 103 goals and 93 assists in 307 games for the club and has been captain since July 2023, when Erik ten Hag decided to replace Harry Maguire as skipper.",

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes' future at the club is back in the headlines this week after an interview with Portuguese media surfaced on Tuesday. Conducted in his home country, the midfielder stated he was left 'hurting' by what he felt was the club being uninterested on whether he stayed or left.",
      "Speaking to Canal 11, Fernandes suggested the club gave off the impression it 'would not be that bad' if the midfielder was to leave for Saudi Arabia. He added he wanted to stay at United for 'as long as he felt desired' but suggested he was also interested in playing in Spain, Italy and Portugal before retiring.",
      "Fernandes turned 31 in September and has 18 months remaining on his current deal at Old Trafford. In January 2027, the midfielder would be able to negotiate with overseas clubs on terms for a free transfer at the start of the 2027/28 campaign.",
      "The captain said back in October he was happy to stay at United and Ruben Amorim had made it clear he did not want Fernandes to leave. Fernandes has gone on to score five goals and bag seven assists since the conversations with the manager.",
      "With this in mind, MEN Sport has asked its United writers for their thoughts on what happens next with Fernandes and whether the captain should stay or leave at the end of the campaign.",
      "The time to sell Fernandes was probably last summer. That was when the big offer was on the table and when United could have pushed ahead with a rebuild under Amorim. If that fee isn’t on offer next summer, then there is no way a deal should be done.",
      "Fernandes continues to prove his importance to this team week after week and they would be worse off without him. His 12 goals contributions in 16 league games this season again makes him the most valuable player in the team.",
      "But what happens next is really all down to Fernandes now. It’s an unusual approach to bring his future back into the open and risk divisions wth club bosses. If United secure Champions League football next season, then there should be no need to consider a parting of the ways.",
      "If they don’t, nobody could blame Fernandes for wanting out. He has given his all to this club and if it still isn’t where it should be next season, then that might be the moment to call it quits. He will be clearly difficult to replace, but it seems inevitable that at some point in the next year or two, that is the position United will find themselves in.",
      "This situation seemed to have been put to bed by Fernandes himself in October when he expressed his desire to stay at Old Trafford for as long as the club wanted him. While United's playmaker has reiterated this stance to Canal 11, he seems to have added caveats which will concern supporters wanting to see the midfielder stay beyond the summer of 2026.",
      "Undoubtedly, the 31-year-old's comments will have come as a shock to United and there will now be internal discussions about what this means moving forward. Fernandes has shown this season he remains influential and would benefit any top team in the big five leagues in Europe.",
      "Having said that, he will have just one year remaining on his contract in the summer and if Fernandes is already weighing up the possibility of playing football elsewhere, there's a chance United miss out on recouping money by keeping him an extra 12 months. It is a harsh reality of football that personal connections have to be put to one side.",
      "But getting £80m+ for Fernandes would help United rebuild not only their midfield, but potentially their defence too. If an offer around that figure was to be submitted for Fernandes, United may perhaps be right to take it.",
      "However, if Kobbie Mainoo has left by then or the offer is simply lower than it was in the summer, United should be rejecting it and forging a new plan.",

      "Manchester United's starting line-up vs Aston Villa on Sunday will be a lot different to the side which drew 4-4 with Bournemouth on Monday night. Noussair Mazraoui was already missing from that team as he linked up with his Morocco teammates ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",
      "However, he will be joined on the absentee list by Amad and Bryan Mbeumo. They were given special allowance by their national teams to play against the Cherries but will not be available for selection when the team travel to Villa on Sunday. But if that was not enough for Ruben Amorim, there is another matter to contend with.",
      "United shall also be without the services of Casemiro in the West Midlands this weekend. The Brazilian picked up his fifth booking of the campaign, not including the two he received against Chelsea, on Monday night and will therefore be suspended for one game.",
      "His absence leaves a hole in the midfield which will need to be plugged by the Reds. With this in mind, MEN Sport has taken a look at three ways United could choose to line-up in the absence of Casemiro.",
      "United could simply decide to make a straight swap with Casemiro dropping out for Manuel Ugarte. Many predicted the Uruguayan would have a bigger role at Old Trafford once Amorim arrived considering their history together at Sporting.",
      "Instead, Ugarte has failed to push on and has dropped behind Casemiro in the pecking order. This would have been inconceivable at one stage considering the Brazilian was so far off the pace in the Premier League last season.",
      "But in 2025/26, Casemiro remains the best option in defensive midfielder and there is little chance his suspension will damage his chances of returning to the Boxing Day squad vs Newcastle.",
      "There is a lot of talk about whether United are ready to play with four at the back considering the number of absentees - especially against Villa. One option available to Amorim is to return to a 4-3-3 formation which the Reds, and this group of players, have used previously.",
      "Amorim has stated Kobbie Mainoo could feature more in such a system. Should this be the case, Amorim could kill two birds with one stone and ease the tension surrounding the academy graduate's playing time this season while also finding a way around the Casemiro headache.",
      "Without Casemiro, there would still be a place for Ugarte in this formation and both he and Mainoo would benefit from three players in that midfield.",
      "The wildcard option for United would depend entirely on whether or not Amorim is ready to change his mind entirely. Lisandro Martinez has played as a defensive midfielder before - for Ajax when Erik ten Hag was struggling for numbers in that position.",
      "Amorim stated recently he did not see Martinez as a midfielder as he is not taking on that workload currently. Since his long-term injury, the Argentine has been focusing on being a defender but if Ugarte is not seen as a viable option, Martinez could be utilised there.",
      "He could play as the anchor just ahead of the centre-backs which would once again allow Mainoo an opportunity to impress. However, it seems obvious this is a long shot considering Amorim's recent comments on Martinez.",

That could throw United’s plans into chaos, with the captain currently contracted until the end of the 2026/2027 season.",
      "It would at least boost United’s budget, as would the departure of Casemiro on a free transfer. A contract extension hasn’t been ruled out, but the 33-year-old is one of the club’s highest earners, and his exit would be a significant saving on the wage bill.",
      "The futures of Kobbie Mainoo and Manuel Ugarte are also in doubt. Mainoo is wanted on loan by a number of clubs in January, with Napoli at the head of the queue, although United won’t sanction a permanent exit. If Amorim is still in charge this summer and Mainoo’s prospects of playing time haven’t improved, it could create a pinch point.",
      "Ugarte has slipped further below Mainoo in the pecking order and has failed to get off the bench in three of the club’s last eight games, managing only 40 minutes across that period. Amorim looks to have lost faith in a player he worked with at Sporting and Ugarte has rarely done enough to suggest he has a long-term future at Old Trafford. United could cut their losses on a player signed from Paris St-Germain for £xxm in the summer of 2024.",
      "All of that will present a headache to United’s football executive, particularly director of football Jason Wilcox and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, who were already planning an overhaul of the midfield next year.",
      "Nottingham Forest’s Elliott Anderson, Carlos Baleba of Brighton and Crystal Palace man Adam Wharton are all under consideration as elite-level additions, but United will need more than one new signing. They have also been linked with the Bournemouth duo of Tyler Adams and Alex Scott in recent days.",
      "A potential departure for Mainoo in January might force United to consider their options, but as it stands, they aren’t expecting to be busy next month. Club sources stress they would only commit to a deal if it was a player they have a long-standing interest in, rather than rushing into a panic move.",
      "Their desire to rebuild in midfield is well known and United will be offered plenty of players, such as Ruben Neves, whose camp are looking at a potential exit from Al-Hilal next month, although any deal is considered very unlikely.",
      "For now, United’s focus remains on the summer of 2026 and what could be a defining few months for their midfield.",

In a statement posted on X this afternoon, National League North club Macclesfield confirmed the forward had died in a car crash on the M1.",
      "They wrote: \"With the heaviest of hearts and an overwhelming sense of surrealism that Macclesfield FC can confirm the passing of 21-year-old forward Ethan McLeod. Travelling back from Bedford Town last night, Ethan was involved in a car accident on the M1 which tragically took his life.",
      "\"Ethan was an incredibly talented and well-respected member of our First Team Squad, who had his whole life ahead of him. But more than that, Ethan’s infectious personality endeared him to everyone that he came into contact with.",
      "\"In giving his all in everything he did, Ethan effortlessly pushed us all to be the best we can be - both on and off the pitch. Ethan’s professionalism and unwavering work ethic inspired everyone, and his lust for life put smiles on all our faces - even on the darkest of days.",
      "\"News of Ethan’s passing has devastated our entire club and no words can convey the immense sense of sadness and loss that we feel now. The deep mental scars elicited from Ethan’s passing will undeniably never heal - but one thing is for sure, and that is Ethan’s vibrant legacy will never fade, no matter how much time passes in the future.",
      "\"Ethan will live in our hearts and minds forevermore and no matter what the future holds, his unique smile that mesmerised us all will never be forgotten. Our deepest sympathy goes out to Ethan’s family and friends at this deeply traumatic time, together with an assurance that we will provide as much support as we can to those who need it.",
      "\"May you rest in peace Ethan - you will forever be a Silkman.\" Well wishes have since been flooding in from across the football community since the news of his death was announced.",
      "Among them was a comment of a red love heart and pray emoji from O'Reilly, replying to a post from the Instagram account 'Rising Ballers' who described McLeod as a 'truly incredible person on and off the pitch'.",
      "Shoretire responded to the same post with a love heart and white dove emoji.",
      "McLeod was a product of the Wolverhampton Wanderers academy. He spent time on loan at Alvechurch before leaving Molineux in 2024 and joining Rushall Olympic. He also spent time at Stourbridge before arriving at Macclesfield this summer.",

      "Hello and welcome to our live Manchester United transfer blog on Wednesday, December 17.",
      "The January transfer window opens in two weeks, and Ruben Amorim is preparing for another huge window at Old Trafford. After spending over £200m in the summer, things have been on the up at United, with Amorim's side currently sitting sixth in the Premier League.",
      "With them just two points behind Chelsea in fourth, United are genuine contenders for a Champions League spot, and plans are expected to be in place to bolster Amorim's squad for the second half of the season.",
      "However, the main talking point today is Bruno Fernandes. The 31-year-old has admitted in a bombshell interview that he could leave United soon, claiming a move to Spain, Italy and Portugal are all possible destinations for his next move.",
      "Speculation surrounding Fernandes' future is rife, with interest from Saudi Arabia expected in January. Elsewhere, United's plans to bring players in this winter are also accelerating, with Bournemouth stars Antoine Semenyo, Alex Scott and Tyler Adams all linked with moves to Old Trafford.",
      "A new midfielder is the priority for Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox, with Elliot Anderson at the top of that list. RC Lens' Mamadou Sangare has also been linked alongside Adan Wharton, Noah Sadiki and Ayyoub Bouaddi.",
      "So, with that said, here's a look at the latest United updates ahead of another busy day of action.",
      "Follow below for all the latest Man United updates, reactions, analysis and opinions throughout the day...",
      "According to talkSPORT, Manchester United players have a feeling that Bruno Fernandes' post-match interview after Bournemouth may be slowly paving the way to his exit from the club.",
      "The club captain claimed the club board were willing to sell him to Al-Hilal this summer, admitting feeling 'hurt' by this.",
      "The feeling within the dressing room is said to be that this could be Fernandes' last at Old Trafford.",
      "The Premier League have confirmed the full schedule of dates and times for fixtures taking place across February, including United's. They are as follows...",
      "United's Under-18s have beaten their Birmingham City counterparts 6-0 this Wednesday afternoon in the Premier League Cup. JJ Gabriel and Kai Rooney were both on target.",
      "It means they're into the quarter-finals!",
      "High-scoring Reds! Our U18s beat Birmingham City emphatically in the #U18PL Cup! On to the next, boys pic.twitter.com/xt7KAzZ6ZA",
      "Al-Hilal are thought to be open to selling Portuguese midfielder Ruben Neves in January and United could seek to capitalise, or so reports TEAM talk.",
      "The Saudi Arabian club have been unable to tie Neves down to a new contract and do not want to lose him for free, having bought him from Wolves for £47m in summer 2023.",
      "United are claimed to have been in contact through intermediaries at this early stage.",
      "BBC Sport's Simon Stone reports United winger Sam Mather is 'likely to leave the club during the January transfer window with significant interest already.",
      "The 21-year-old has trained with Ruben Amorim's squad this season due to age. He played a full 90 minutes as the club's Under-21s lost 3-0 to Tamworth in the National League Cup on Tuesday night.",
      "Existing interest comes from Germany, Turkey, Portugal and Poland.",
      "According to CaughtOffside, United have been keeping an eye on Elche's Austrian central defender David Affengruber this season.",
      "The Spanish club are said to have set a €30m (£26.3m) price tag in order to put rivals off a transfer this coming January window.",
      "That would be fine for United, the report says, as they are prioritising a new midfielder before anything else.",
      "Wednesday's Corriere dello Sport has claimed that a deal to take Joshua Zirkzee to AS Roma on loan in January is now 'progressing'.",
      "Earlier this week, reports in Italy claimed that Roma were looking to sign the forward on loan with an obligation to buy him permanently. Now, Roma's sporting director Ricky Massara had meetings with United in London last week, alongside Zirkzee's entourage.",
      "Reports in Germany have reported that Manchester United and Tottenham have made inquiries for FC Koln wonderkid Said El Mala.",
      "BILD have claimed that the teenager will stay at the Bundesliga side for the rest of the season, with a summer transfer preferred. Both United and Spurs are reportedly open to paying €30m-€40m.",
      "Following his interview, clubs are lining-up for Bruno Fernandes and according to talkSPORT, Bayern Munich are one of the teams keen on signing him.",
      "The report adds that he has a £57million release clause in his contract that only foreign teams can trigger. Bayern are thought to be big admirers of him.",
      "Manchester United are planning to use Antoine Semenyo as an attacking wing-back if they manage to sign him during the January transfer window, it has been claimed.",
      "According to the Independent, United are willing to move for Semenyo next month. He has a £65million release clause in his contract that is active from New Year's Day and the Reds are prepared to jump ahead of their Premier League rivals - including Tottenham and Manchester City - to secure his signature.",
      "It's added that United feel they have a strong chance at his signature, and are preparing to make a move in January",
      "Manchester United have no desire to sell Bruno Fernandes amid fresh speculation over his future.",
      "Club sources have reiterated the leadership was clear throughout the summer that Fernandes was a key part of the future plans, pointing to his own quote from a sit-down with Manchester-based reporters in October, in which he claimed that the club echoed Ruben Amorim's desire for him to stay.",
      "Casemiro's contract expires at the end of the season. There is the option of a 12-month extension, but triggering another year would ensure the 33-year-old remains the dressing room's highest earner.",
      "Although Casemiro is expected to leave after his contract expires, he has become an important player for Amorim again this season, leading to suggestions that he could continue at United.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has claimed that Man United wanted him to leave in the summer amid links to a switch to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Speaking to Maisfutebol, he said on life at United, and those exit whispers: \"I can't complain, I'm very well paid, but obviously the difference is huge. That was never what guided me. If one day I have to play in Saudi Arabia, I'll play in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"My lifestyle will change, my children's lives will be sunny - after six years in Manchester with cold and rain - I'll be playing in a growing league, with recognised players.",
      "\"I could have left like many people do and said; 'I want to leave, I don't want to train, I just want to leave for €20m or €30m, so they pay me more on the other side'. But I never did that. I never felt in a position to do that, because I felt that the empathy and affection I had for the club were the same.",
      "\"But there comes a point where, for them, money is more important than anything. The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn't have the courage to make that decision.",
      "\"I decided to stay, also because of family reasons, but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the manager also made me stay. But, from the club's side, I felt a bit like; 'If you leave, it's not so bad for us'. It hurts me a lot.",
      "\"More than hurting, it makes me sad because I'm a player they have nothing to criticise about. I'm always available, and I always play - good or bad - I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don't value the club as much and don't defend the club as much... that makes you sad.\"",
      "Manchester United outlined to Bruno Fernandes in the summer that he was a key part of the club's future plans, after Al-Hilal offered a huge financial package in an attempt to lure Fernandes away from Manchester.",
      "United sources have reiterated that the leadership was clear throughout the summer that Fernandes was a key part of the future plans, pointing to his own quote from the sit-down with Manchester-based reporters in October, in which he claimed the club echoed Ruben Amorim's desire for him to stay.",
      "During that interview, Fernandes said: \"The manager spoke with me. He said I was still part of the project. He wanted me to stay. The club said the same. And I always said that if the club was like ‘Bruno, we want to cash in, you are 30 years old. We want to make some money. We don't think you can be part of the future project’, or whatever, I would be like, OK, I have to find a solution for myself, whatever is best for me and my family. And I will leave.",
      "\"But obviously that wasn't the case. I felt that I was still part of the plan, that I could still help the club to achieve whatever was our aims. And that's what made me stay. Obviously, I have a big connection with the fans, with the club, also the country. My family feels very well here.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes has hinted that he could leave Manchester United soon. In another interview with Portuguese channel Canal 11, he hinted he would be open to leaving United in the not-so-distant future if they don't show him enough love.",
      "Speaking in a recent interview, Fernandes told Canal 11: \"I want to stay at Manchester United as long as I feel desired. I would like to experience the Spanish league and fight for big titles in Italy. I have many connections to Italy… my daughter was born there.",
      "\"I've already thought about returning to Portugal… the first option would be Sporting. To be happy, like it was with Sporting. But I don’t want to ruin the image that was left.",
      "\"But I don't want to drag myself there, I want to add to it. And even try district football, at an advanced age. You play in the district for love, you feel different. I have friends in the district.\"",
      "He added: “I could have left in the last transfer window and would have earned a lot more money. Financially, it would have been much better for me,\" he claimed.",
      "“At one point I was going to leave – I won’t say where – but I would have won many trophies that season. I decided to stay not only for family reasons but because I genuinely like the club. The conversation with the coach also made me stay.",
      "“But from the club’s side, I felt a bit of: ‘If you go, it’s not really that bad for us.’ That hurts me a little. More than hurting, it makes me sad, because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise me for. I’m always available for every match, I always play, whether well or badly. I give my maximum.",
      "“Then you look around you and see players who don’t value the club as much as you do and who don’t defend the club as much. That makes you sad.”",
      "Barcelona have set two conditions that will have to met for Marcus Rashford to join the club on a permanent basis.",
      "Spanish outlet E-Noticies has claimed that the first condition is for Rashford to do more defensive work to help Hansi Flick's tactical demands. The second one is Rashford will have to take a pay cut.",
      "Ruben Amorim has reportedly demanded that United sign a new left-back in January, with four players on the shortlist.",
      "TEAMtalk have claimed that scouts were sent to watch Sporting's Maxi Araujo, 25. Benfica's Samuel Dahl, Lorient's Arsene Kouassi and Club Brugge's Joaquin Seys are also on their radar.",

      "The 31-year-old, who is under contract until the summer of 2027, reaffirmed his love for football after summer interest from Saudi Arabia. Al-Hilal were said to have tabled a major offer for Fernandes, but the move collapsed, leaving Ruben Amorim's side to keep hold of their captain.",

The Blues' games with their Merseyside rivals have often been seen as pivotal in the race for the Premier League title. However, a recent slump in form means Arne Slot's side are unlikely to be in the conversation for the league title this term.",

      "As for Manchester United, they have been handed another unpopular fixture time with their first trip to the Hill Dickinson Stadium to take on Everton has been moved to Monday, February 23. The Reds' midweek commitments were expected to be few and far between this season after failing to qualify for Europe and being eliminated early from the Carabao Cup.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has lit a fuse under Old Trafford. And it could end up being nearly as explosive as Mo Salah’s transfer saga at Liverpool.",
      "Fernandes’ interview - saying he was “sad and hurt” - accusing the Manchester United board were ready to sell him to Saudi club Al-Hilal last summer was incredibly powerful.",
      "It will have embarrassed the United hierarchy and left a potentially even bigger disconnect between the fanbase, Glazers and Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Just when you think things could not get any worse, Fernandes has taken aim.",
      "United fans already worship Fernandes and him also expressing his love and commitment to the club and desire to win trophies will have only strengthened the bond. But it is hard to believe that there is not some strong politics going on here.",
      "Just to be sure, Fernandes says that Ruben Amorim wanted him to stay and that is the reason the board did not get their wish. However, Fernandes knows what he is doing. If you set up a battle between Fernandes and the hierarchy (making it clear whose side Amorim is on) then there is only one winner.",
      "Fernandes has been fabulous for United. His figures - goals and assists - in an ailing team have been remarkable. I don’t think he can be one of the Premier League all time greats because he has not won enough. But he deserves to be.",
      "Maybe that is the difference with Salah. He made it all about himself, it was a misstep and, despite winning so much at Liverpool, he was actually ready to throw everyone else under the bus - apart from himself.",
      "And this must be at the heart of Fernandes’ frustration because the club have let him down and failed to build a team around his strengths. He has been careful to say he has given himself for the club.",
      "You could make a stronger case for selling Fernandes last summer around Amorim’s tactics than a financial discussion. He is priceless to United.",
      "But United do still look unbalanced. That is why the back three discussion goes on. Can you really make Fernandes work in that system? Fernandes seems to make it work himself.",
      "However, in my mind, Adam Wharton would not fit in at United. Why? Have you seen him run? He is the passer in any team. He needs legs and energy with him. To make Amorim’s system work you need two midfield runners.",
      "But actually United have always been based around a player of Fernandes’ class. That is the club’s whole identity. And why people like me think they are special.",
      "It’s the style they stand for. The gripping eight goal thriller against Bournemouth was a taste of that. And Fernandes was at the very heart of it.",
      "Selling him would be like parting with the family silver. And now Fernandes has set us all up for a very messy divorce when it inevitably comes.",

      "Is this the moment Kobbie Mainoo has been waiting for? With Casemiro suspended, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo unavailable, and Ruben Amorim experimenting with a three-man midfield, we may get a better indication this weekend of whether Mainoo still has a future at Manchester United under the current head coach.",
      "Amorim has been peppered with questions on Mainoo in recent press conferences and his answers wouldn't have filled the 20-year-old academy graduate with an awful lot of confidence. No doubt Amorim will be asked about the antics of Mainoo's half-brother, Jordan, and his 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt on Monday night.",
      "That stunt came on a night that ironically went pretty well for Mainoo. The 29 minutes he got on the pitch was the third-longest of his 11 Premier League substitute appearances this season and with Casemiro picking up a fifth yellow card of the season, there is room in the United midfield.",
      "Mainoo played well in his cameo in a chaotic game and it was interesting that he was the first substitute called for by Amorim, coming on to replace Casemiro as United chased the match, trailing 3-2 at the time of the change. It was the same story when Mainoo replaced Casemiro three minutes earlier against Everton in November, and it doesn't mean the academy graduate will take the Brazilian's role at Villa Park.",
      "That spot is likely to go to Manuel Ugarte. Amorim seems to have lost faith in the Uruguayan, despite their shared history at Sporting, and he played just 40 minutes in the last eight Premier League games, but is the only other natural holding midfielder in the squad.",
      "The real boost for Mainoo might be Amorim's system change. He spent last week drilling his players in a 4-3-3 and used a hybrid of that approach and his 3-4-2-1 against Bournemouth on Monday night.",
      "With Amad and Mbeumo now joining Noussair Mazraoui in leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations, that plan might need to change and it could be that Amorim goes with a more traditional 4-3-3 against in-form Aston Villa. That should, in theory, be good news for Mainoo, just as Amorim suggested last week.",
      "\"The problem is that we are playing with two [in midfield] and you guys see Kobbie in a different way than I'm seeing,\" Amorim said ahead of facing Bournemouth. \"Maybe if you play with three midfielders, not with just two, but with three, Kobbie will have more minutes.\"",
      "Now might be the chance for Amorim to deliver on that suggestion. He certainly has some tinkering to do this weekend, with a lack of obvious width in the team now after the departures of Amad and Mbeumo. Mason Mount could be used out wide along with Matheus Cunha, with Benjamin Sesko leading the line.",
      "If Amorim opts for two in midfield, it would be a surprise if it's not Ugarte and Bruno Fernandes; however, if he goes for a third, then Mainoo surely comes into the equation. That is what the academy graduate will be banking on.",
      "Last week, Amorim told Mainoo to knock on his door and tell him if he wanted a loan in January. There is a queue of clubs headed by Napoli keen to give him a home in the second half of the season.",
      "United would only sanction a departure once Amad and Mbeumo return, but in their absence, Mainoo could get more opportunities. If he does and he takes them, then those plans could change. If he remains on the outside looking in, then it will only harden his desire to leave.",

      "Spanish media have had their say after Marcus Rashford's goal helped Barcelona avoid a cup disaster at third-tier Guadalajara. Rashford's side struggled to break down their opposition but eventually found the net in the 76th minute.",
      "Barcelona had been expected to easily dispatch the Castilian side, who sit around 60 places below them in the Spanish league system. But with Rashford in from the start as a striker, they failed to score for some time.",
      "As full-time approached, an almost unthinkable result was on the cards before Andreas Christensen's deflected header gave the Catalan club a 1-0 lead. Rashford doubled the advantage in the 90th minute with the opposition stretched.",
      "The on-loan Manchester United star's team avoided the embarrassment and are safety through to the Copa del Rey round of 16. But while some media outlets were quick to commend Rashford, some did not think the Englishman enjoyed the best of games.",
      "Marca described Rashford's inclusion as a striker in Hansi Flick's team on Tuesday evening as a \"gamble\" and their blog of the match was somewhat critical of Rashford's performance.",
      "The 28-year-old had plenty of opportunities against the lower league opposition but either saw his shots go wide or be saved by an inspired Daniel Vicente. In the 68th minute, Marca wrote: \"Rashford's pass to himself is too long and he shoots it straight out. The Englishman isn't accurate.\"",
      "Vicente kept preventing Rashford from scoring and Marca's post-match analysis states he caused Barcelona and the forward \"considerable distress.\"",
      "Just before Rashford bagged his goal he fouled Guadalajara's Javier Ablanque when trying to get past him and the blog reads: \"Rashford couldn't get past Ablanque and ended up committing a foul. It's not the Englishman's night.\"",
      "Not all were critical of how Rashford performed, however. AS heaped praise on goalkeeper Vicente for how he stopped Rashford, not blasting the Englishman for misses. They even described Rashford's finish as \"class.\"",
      "AS wrote: \"There was curiosity to see if the German would come up with something at half-time. Joan Laporta [Barcelona president] wasn't entirely convinced either. It was time for Flick.",
      "\"The German made some changes. Above all, he changed all the attacking pieces. Lamine [Yamal] moved to the right, [Roony] Bardghji to the middle, Fermín [Lopez] to center forward and Rashford to the left. The Englishman had the first two chances of the second half. Vicente was lightning-fast on both. Excellent, one might say, on the second.",
      "\"Guadalajara fought back. Salifo unleashed a spectacular shot that tested Marc-Andre ter Stegen's return. It was his last gasp. With space to operate, Rashford sealed the victory with class.\"",
      "Sport focused more on Rashford's goal, lauding him for ending a barren run that had lasted since November 2. They wrote: \"The match began with Ter Stegen's unexpected inclusion in the starting lineup and ended with a crucial save from him to prevent Guadalajara from equalizing before Rashford sealed the victory.",
      "\"The Englishman, who had been a standout provider in recent weeks, hadn't scored since November 2nd against Elche. Rashy now has seven goals and 11 assists this season, having found the net in all three competitions.",
      "\"Against Guadalajara, he started as a center forward but showed his best form when he moved to the left wing. He scored one goal, but it could have been three.\"",
      "Sport rated the now-settled Rashford a seven out of ten for his performance on Tuesday and they used only one word to describe the way the English star played: \"Insistent.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo used a similar word to describe Rashford in their post-match analysis, as they wrote in their player ratings for the match that he was: \"Persistent.\"",
      "They continued: \"He didn't despair even though he missed two very clear chances with the score at 0-0 and ended up sealing the passage to the round of 16 by scoring with quality.\"",
      "Mundo Deportivo also suggested that Rashford's efforts on the night deserved a goal as they added: \"A brilliant assist from Lamine allowed Rashford (who deserved it) to score the second goal in the 90th minute.\"",

Anti-Glazer fans have encouraged supporters not to buy official United merchandise, but the club have banked an increase of £3.7m from the same period last year.",
      "United announced their latest financial figures on Thursday afternoon. Club sources have said the increased retail and merchandise revenue is due to the impact of a full three months’ trading under their new ecommerce model, compared to only one month in the prior year quarter.",
      "However, the increase will not be received warmly by anti-Glazer fans, who have protested against the American family and encouraged others to hurt their pockets by boycotting merchandise.",
      "United have protested against the American family since their controversial leveraged buyout in 2005, and the pressure has mounted in the last decade amid declining standards at the club.",
      "The Megastore at Old Trafford has been targeted during anti-Glazer protests, which has forced the club to close its shutters to prevent protesters from causing damage to property.",
      "In March, Sir Jim Ratcliffe spoke to The Times and said he would walk away from United if the protests were sustained against him. \"[Fan protests] can be unpleasant. And I’ve probably failed on the having fun front. I mean, I can put up with it for a while,\" he said.",
      "\"I don’t mind being unpopular because I get that nobody likes seeing Manchester United down where they are, and nobody likes the decisions we’re having to make at the moment.",

      "That means sponsorship revenue has dropped by 9.3 per cent due to changes with the club's sponsorship agreements, following the expiration of the training kit deal with Tezos.",
      "Tezos replaced AON as the club's training kit sponsor when they struck a £24m per season deal in 2022. The Tezos-branded training kit had been worn by United's first-team squad across the last three years, and the logo had also featured on the training kit worn by the women's team.",
      "Matheus Cunha was pictured in a Tezos-sponsored hoodie in unveiling pictures when he signed from Wolves, but the deal had expired by the time of Bryan Mbeumo's arrival.",
      "Although the sponsorship revenue has decreased in the latest figures, United sources have stated that sponsorship revenues were up slightly, if the training kit blow is excluded.",
      "United are braced for further sponsorship uncertainty, though, because their sleeve sponsorship deal with DXC Technology will expire at the end of the season.",
      "In the summer of 2022, DXC began to sponsor the sleeves of United's kits under an agreement believed to be worth £20million per season, but the deal will conclude after 2025/2026.",
      "For four seasons, DXC has been featured on the club’s home, away and third kits, providing global brand exposure for the global tech company. The multi-year partnership has also seen DXC use their expertise to improve the way United engage with fans through their digital platforms.",
      "The Premier League permitted sleeve sponsorship from the start of 2017/18. United announced the first sponsors of their sleeves, Kohler, for the following campaign under a multi-year agreement. That deal ended in 2022, which led to DXC coming in and sponsoring the sleeves.",

      "Mather, 21, is keen to leave United in an effort to kickstart his career in the professional game, and he is attracting interest from clubs in Turkey, Germany and Greece ahead of January.",
      "Discussions have taken place regarding the youngster's future, and United are willing to make concessions to allow Mather to leave as early as possible after his summer move collapsed.",
      "The fee and buyback clause were agreed, and it's understood personal terms were also verbally agreed with the forward. United outlined a time for an agreement to be finalised and sign-off by the board was required, but the club eventually decided they did not have enough time to facilitate the transfer.",
      "Mather's options for an exit were limited following the closure of the European transfer windows, which led to talks taking place with UAE club Al Wahda FC at the end of September.",
      "United insisted on including a buy-back clause during discussions to sell Mather, which is common practice for departures from the academy, but the UAE club did not agree.",
      "Mather was forced to deal with the disappointment of missing out on a fresh start. He has continued to train with the first-team and has made appearances in four academy fixtures to keep ticking over.",
      "The winger scored a brace against Norwich in his first appearance of the campaign, but he has outgrown academy football and is hungry to leave his boyhood club to further his career.",

      "The Russian winger, who was instrumental in ending United's 26-year wait for a league title, is fondly remembered for his hat-trick in a 5-0 victory over local rivals Manchester City in 1994. The club shared heartwarming footage of the 56-year-old receiving a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season during his tour, a campaign in which he played a pivotal role in securing the domestic double.",
      "Known for his blistering pace and nimble footwork, Kanchelskis' lean, tall physique often gave defenders a lot to deal with during his time in the Premier League. Almost two decades after hanging up his boots, he still sports a full head of hair, albeit styled more slickly than the curtain hairstyle he wore during his playing days in Manchester.",
      "The skillful winger had a successful footballing career, representing both the Soviet Union and Russia internationally. He also played for Everton, Southampton, Rangers and Fiorentina.",
      "Kanchelskis is currently coaching Russian Second Division team Dynamo Bryansk. After retiring, he served as sporting director at First Division side FC Nosta Novotroitsk before transitioning into management with various teams across central Europe.",
      "Upon his return to Manchester, the ex-winger was gifted a replica shirt from the 1993/94 season and enjoyed a trip down memory lane as he toured the training facilities.",
      "The United icon will be using his trip to England to gather fresh insights and inspiration before his side's domestic campaign begins in March. Kanchelskis had an exceptional 1994/95 season with the Red Devils, during which he claimed the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award.",
      "The attacker then made a surprising switch to Merseyside when Everton secured his signature for a club record £5million. Since then, he has maintained cult hero status at both clubs, a reflection of his exceptional ability on the pitch.",
      "Kanchelskis was accompanied by his son Andrei - a devoted Everton supporter - and also dropped by the Toffees' training complex this week. He met up with David Moyes and witnessed their victory against Nottingham Forest at the new ground.",
      "Reflecting on his time at Old Trafford, he said: \"Every name is a big name at Man United, it was an excellent time. I remember the big boss, Sir Alex Ferguson he helped me a lot. A lot of criticism for me also when I played bad crosses.",

      "Bittar added that it “would not be ideal” to interrupt his current season with a move away.",

      "JJ Gabriel became the youngest player to represent Manchester United in the FA Youth Cup on Tuesday. The forward started against Peterborough and scored the match winner in a 1-0 victory at Old Trafford.",
      "Gabriel started aged 15 years, two months and three days, which meant he broke the record previously held by United academy graduate Omari Forson (15 years and four months).",
      "The online records tracking United's Youth Cup appearance makers began from the 2006/2007 season.",
      "Gabriel recently trained with the first-team. It's unusual for a player so young to be given the opportunity to train with the first team, but Gabriel is one of the most highly-rated talents to come through the academy.",
      "Gabriel and his family were invited into the Old Trafford directors' box for the opening game of the season against Arsenal, and United recently introduced the youngster to Amorim at Carrington.",
      "Amorim was given a closer look at the youngster when he took part in training. \"Like everyone, I know he is a really talented guy and everyone paid attention on social media,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"You could see the Under-21s had a game and we had fewer players and tried to pick players for training that have talent, not just for me to see for tomorrow, but for them to feel what it means to be in the first team, the difficulties playing against our defenders, the difficulty of our training, the pace.",
      "\"If we can use every training we have to show the kids what they need to do to be here, it is important, not just for JJ but for everyone.\"",

      "The 2025 Africa Cup of Nations comes at a terrible time for both Manchester City and Manchester United. Both teams have endured their wobbles in the Premier League this season but have each made strides compared to last year.",
      "Ruben Amorim is set to be hit particularly hard by the tournament's selection, with Bryan Mbeumo and Amad both big losses. They'll link up with Cameroon and the Ivory Coast, respectively, while Noussair Mazraoui will represent hosts Morocco.",
      "The tournament hosts have made it to at least the semi-final stage of the past two AFCON competitions. This is worth bearing in mind given Morocco tend to be a perennial contender and enters their own competition as favourites this year.",
      "It's also worth highlighting that in addition to being absent for fixtures, those venturing deeper in the tournament won't return to club duty straight away. And any players that get their hands on the title may be entitled to a few extra days to lap up their achievement before coming back to England.",
      "Morocco are the clear frontrunners with the bookmakers to win a first AFCON crown since 1976, while seven-time champions Egypt are second in the stakes. The Atlas Lions are heavily backed to top Group A ahead of Zambia, Mali and Comoros, while Egypt appear to have a slightly harder line-up against South Africa, Angola and Zimbabwe in Group B.",
      "The competition doesn't get underway until December 21, although players will start to link up with their sides imminently. The tournament will conclude in Rabat on January 18, meaning some players could be away for a full month.",
      "During that span, there are six rounds of Premier League action due to be played. This includes a particularly demanding three-week period between December 20 and January 8, across which each top-flight club will play five times.",
      "Some of those Premier League outfits missing players over the next month face more testing periods than others. At least on paper given the current table and how teams are performing at present.",
      "For example, Aston Villa will face United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Crystal Palace (in that order) between December 21 and January 7. Brighton also has a testing run of fixtures over the next month or so, with Sunderland, Arsenal, City and Bournemouth each on the agenda while the AFCON is on.",

    "body": [
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Robin Roefs has probably been the better Dutch goalkeeper this season, but Verbruggen remains the Netherlands No. 1 ahead of the World Cup, and it’s Verbruggen who has been linked with Bayern Munich, Tottenham, Chelsea and all manner of other clubs. Probably Chelsea then.",
      "",
      "While Manchester City still have no specialised right-back, Livramento will continue to be linked with a move to the Etihad. And the summer exit of Alexander Isak perfectly illustrates that Newcastle United are not quite in that class of clubs that can declare a player unsellable when one of the truly big boys come calling.",
      "",
      "One-time (literally, and it was a 4-1 defeat) Brazil international Murillo should not really be dicking about in a relegation battle and it is surely only a matter of time before those Chelsea links become something a little more solid. Holding onto both him and Elliot Anderson feels like an uphill task for Forest.",

There are certainly no guarantees that he will end up at Liverpool, with the latest reports suggesting that he will demand a far bigger contract than the one he agreed last summer. Pretty much every Premier League giant bar Arsenal are interested, with Bayern Munich among his suitors on the continent.",

He is the first name in this XI who is not currently a target for any of the Big Six.",

Manchester United, biggest club in our football, maybe the second, third biggest club in world football.",

      "A former Premier League star who was on the radar of Manchester United has put off top cubs given his wages, with two options now available to him.",
      "Man Utd could still sign Ruben Neves from Al-Hilal in the January transfer window but there’s one main stumbling block, according to reports."

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank Premier League goalkeepers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below.",
      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Burnley appear in danger of being cut adrift but things might be worse were it not for their Slovakian stopper. Dubravka has made more saves than any other keeper having faced 17 more shots on his goal than anyone else. And he might have save of the season wrapped up after this late stop to preserve a win at Wolves.",
      "",
      "Henderson falls from the top of this ranking after conceding three to Manchester City from a PSxG of 1.7. The number is damning but the Palace keeper passed the eye test, especially around Erling Haaland’s brace, and to expect more in the face of Phil Foden’s 20-yarder feels harsh.",
      "",
      "Only Dubravka has made more saves than Roefs but he was able to enjoy the Tyne-Wear derby in relative peace. Against no side has he faced fewer than the two shots Newcastle could muster.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker before returning to Villa Park and playing a blinder. Most recently, he made seven saves v Arsenal with narrative out the wazoo. Sat out the win at West Ham.",
      "",
      "A big climber after a superb performance and a clean sheet at Manchester United from a PSxG of 1.8, only to follow it up with a shocker against Newcastle. The clean sheets v Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest were more like it and though the PSxG at Chelsea – two conceded from 1.2 PSxG – doesn’t look great, Pickford was badly exposed by his defence.",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season. On Saturday, like Pickford, he conceded two from a PSxG of 1.2 at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "A dire few weeks for the Spurs keeper saw him booed by his own fans after being culpable for Fulham’s second goal, though the Italian is entitled to ask why none of his defenders thought to offer some cover while he went walkies in the corner. Vicario conceded eight goals against Manchester United, Arsenal and Fulham from a combined PSxG of 5.7 but under-conceded in that batsh*t game v Newcastle. He was pretty much untested v Brentford, but respite was brief before a shocker at Forest.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games was followed by none in five. Pope had a shocker in the Champions League at Marseille amid calls for Aaron Ramsdale to be given a chance, with another injury giving Eddie Howe no choice but to change keeper for Newcastle’s first away win of the season.",
      "",
      "A fine display against Arsenal, conceding once from a PSxG of 2.2, capped a run of a few positive performances from Sanchez that took the Spaniard into the black. And then he conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds. He might have been the only Chelsea player happy with a 0-0 v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Conceding four from Bournemouth’s PSxG of 3.3 was sub-optimal. Questions were asked after Marcus Tavernier’s free-kick which went ‘keeper’s side’ but we would be looking more at the wall set-up than any failure to react to the shot. Arguably, Evanilson’s strike was more saveable.",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses. Saved a penalty against Leeds only to see the rebound dispatched. Conceded four goals v Fulham and looked a little lost. Made one excellent save v Sunderland and stopped all fur shots on his goal taken by Palace.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield. But Sels was busy again – and beaten twice – against Brighton. The clean sheet at Wolves was very, very welcome. The battering by Everton and a groin twang less so.",
      "",
      "Making just five saves in five Premier League appearances hardly screams ‘Make me Newcastle No. 1’. Powerless, though, to stop Nick Woltemade’s inadvertent derby decider.",
      "",
      "Came back into the Villa team for the Brighton game after Martinez suffered an injury in the warm-up and returned once more at West Ham. Conceding five goals from 2.8 PSxG was sub-optimal.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United have regain shreds of credibility. Not a coincidence.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in defeats to Palace and Villa. But he was absolutely culpable v Forest and not great against former club Manchester United. Then, at Arsenal, he was just plain unlucky.",
      "",
      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",
      "",
      "Raya has barely been tested for much of the season but when Arsenal have needed him, has he done enough? Reports suggest the Gunners might be looking to upgrade.",
      "",
      "Alisson’s return came as a relief after five games out but even he was powerless to stop Liverpool caving against Forest, who scored three from a PSxG of 2.5. The Brazilian wasn’t troubled even slightly by West Ham; Sunderland were a different story. Conceded three goals from five shots on target at Leeds United but kept out the only effort Brighton threw his way.",
      "",
      "Areola was a big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. But dipped again, especially after conceding three to Villa from a PSxG of 0.9. It’s hard to be too critical of him for failing to stop a Morgan Rodgers special, but perhaps a deeper start position would have taken out the risk of being bypassed by the dip and offered more reaction time.",
      "",
      "Darlow replaced Lucas Perri after the Brazilian sustained an injury and the stand-in’s form kept him in Daniel Farke’s XI. But Spurs and Burnley scoring four goals from an xG of 1.05 was not a good look on Darlow and Perri is back in.",
      "",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he has been keeping the wrong company down here for most of his first season with the Bees.",
      "",
      "The Brazilian was one of the biggest climbers before conceding two to Villa from a PSxG of 1.5. Leeds fans are especially unhappy at his failure to move for Morgan Rogers’ free-kick which, admittedly, did not look good. Conceded eight goals in his last four Premier League games but nobody gives a f*** at Leeds.",
      "Mamardashvili came into the side just as Liverpool had forgotten the basics of defending. There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland provided a small boost, but conceding once at Tottenham to a PSxG of 0.5 was a small hit. Then he conceded five to Manchester City and two more at Burnley.",
      "",
      "The feeling remains that Wolves would have sold Sa this summer if they received an acceptable bid. Perhaps they should have been more open to offers. Allowing Leeds to score three from an xG of 0.5 was especially damning.",
      "",
      "He’s no Kepa, is he? It has been a rotten few weeks for the Cherries keeper, who falls to the bottom of this ranking after conceding four at Old Trafford. United’s 3.3 PSxG was not as damning on Petrovic as Casemiro’s header that seemed to terrify the Serbian.",
      "As we approach January and Man Utd in particular pledge to strip every non-elite Premier League club, we look at the biggest assets outside the traditional Big Six.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has issued an ‘ultimatum’ that is in no way an ultimatum, while an ‘unrecognisable’ Premier League star is entirely recognisable.",
      "Manchester United are much better this season. But what it was, was complete turd. At the moment they’re still doing little more than polishing it.",
      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United are *finally* evolving for the better, but Kobbie Mainoo and five teammates will be the six victims of these changes…",
      "There are three England linchpins in a top four headed by a Real Madrid star, while Arsenal, Man City and Man Utd all have talking to do…",
      "We understand all the reasons why Eddie Howe isn’t currently under pressure. But they really are quite sh*t."

      "Crystal Palace are resigned to losing Oliver Glasner at the end of the season and reportedly have a La Liga manager lined up as his replacement.",
      "According to Spanish website Cadena Ser, Glasner will not renew his contract beyond next summer, and the Eagles are considering replacing him with Getafe’s Jose Bordalas.",
      "Glasner has done an outstanding job at Selhurst Park, guiding Crystal Palace to their first major trophy by winning the FA Cup last season.",
      "His effective counter-attacking 3-4-3 has earned widespread praise since he arrived in the Premier League in 2024, with players like Ebere Eze, Marc Guehi, and Adam Wharton all thriving under his system.",
      "Glasner’s success has sparked speculation about his future, with Manchester United constantly linked to searches for alternatives to current head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Austrian head coach employs a similar, albeit more effective, system to Amorim, but has shown greater tactical flexibility during his career. He has successfully used both a back three and a back four during his time at Eintracht Frankfurt, where he won the Europa League in 2022.",
      "Glasner has plenty of admirers, and Palace appear to be preparing for life without their highly-rated head coach.",
      "PREMIER LEAGUE FEATURES ON F365\n* Ten daft reasons why this Premier League season is already great and could be the best ever\n* Five players who will benefit from AFCON absences: Chiesa, Mainoo and more\n* PL clubs ranked on AFCON impact: Sunderland, Man Utd hit hard; Arsenal, Leeds profit?",
      "The Cadena Ser report from Jose David Palacio and Bruno Alemany states that Bordalas is expected to leave Getafe at the end of 2025/26 and ‘his next destination could be Palace’.",
      "Bordalas has reportedly been ‘identified’ as Glasner’s replacement, as the Austrian ‘has no intention of renewing his contract’ due to his ambition of taking charge of a ‘Premier League giant’ in 2026/27.",
      "Palace owner Steve Parish has been forced to start searching for a new manager but is ‘very impressed’ with Bordalas, though no contact has been made yet.",
      "It appears the move would suit Bordalas as well, as Palace ‘offer him a project that aligns with his wishes’.",
      "Still, this is bad news for Palace fans. Glasner has already established himself as a club legend, and his departure will feel like the end of an era at Selhurst Park.",
      "Meanwhile, an insider on X with a ‘team of five elite reporters’ and over 690k followers claims Glasner has rejected two offers to extend his contract because he wants to ‘manage a top club’.",
      "Manchester United is the club most frequently linked to him, though Liverpool could be an option if they part ways with Arne Slot.",
      "Elsewhere in the Premier League, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United are likely to be connected with the 51-year-old as Thomas Frank and Eddie Howe both fight to save their jobs.",
      "The report adds: ‘Oliver Glasner has turned down two contract offers in the last six months, signaling his ambition to stay in the Premier League and manage a top club. He’s not just looking for any job; he wants to make an impact at a bigger team.",
      "‘What sets him apart is his flexibility. He’s ready to adapt his tactics to fit the strengths of his players, knowing that clubs expect versatility in today’s game.",
      "‘With eyes across Europe on his next move, Glasner could very well be the next big name in football management. His strategic mindset and willingness to evolve make him a hot prospect for clubs looking to elevate their game.’",
      "Ruben Amorim is reportedly ‘to leave’ Manchester United and will ‘not’ be in charge next season, with INEOS ‘ready to make a dramatic decision’.",
      "Sunderland v Newcastle is back on the Premier League fixture list after almost a decade away, and have Aston Villa set themselves up for a fall?",
      "Liverpool have been told to sign a teammate of Marc Guehi at Crystal Palace, but this transfer only makes sense if Oliver Glasner replaces Arne Slot…",
      "Theoretically, if ‘preferred candidate’ Oliver Glasner replaced Liverpool head coach Arne Slot this season, this is the XI he would select…",
      "Liverpool have their eye on Man Utd manager target Oliver Glasner at Crystal Palace if they decide to sack Arne Slot, according to reports.",
      "Oliver Glasner will obviously leave Crystal Palace at some point. It has to happen. But *how* it happens matters more than *when* – and here’s why."

      "According to reports, Manchester United’s players ‘feel’ captain Bruno Fernandes is in his final season with the Premier League giants.",
      "Fernandes has been heavily linked with a move elsewhere in recent months, and he looked likely to leave in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "The Portugal international has been Man Utd‘s best player over the past few years, but he attracted interest from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal ahead of the Club World Cup in the summer.",
      "This transfer looked likely in the summer, but Fernandes eventually decided to remain at Man Utd for at least one more year.",
      "Fernandes has made a strong start to this season as he has five goals and six assists in his 15 Premier League appearances, but he has remarkably claimed that club chiefs wanted him to leave in the summer.",
      "In a new interview, Fernandes said: “From the club I felt it was, ‘If you go it’s not so bad for us’. It hurts me a bit.”",
      "READ: Kobbie Mainoo among six losers as new Manchester United arrives under Ruben Amorim",
      "He added: “More than hurting me, it makes me sad,” Fernandes said. “I’m a player that no-one can criticise, I’m always available, I always give my best.",
      "“I could have left in this transfer window, I would have earned much more money.",
      "“I would have won many trophies this season, but I decided not to go, not only for family reasons but because I genuinely love the club.”",
      "Fernandes’ comments have added fuel to transfer speculation in recent days, with a report from talkSPORT claiming Man Utd’s squad ‘believe’ he had this interview to ‘pave the way for his exit’ next year.",
      "The report also claims they think Fernandes could be in his ‘final year’ at Man Utd. They claimed: ‘German giants Bayern Munich are known to be big admirers of Fernandes.",
      "‘Sources have told talkSPORT there is a feeling within the Manchester United dressing room that this season could be Fernandes’ last at the club.’",
      "Regarding Bayern Munich’s interest, a report from Spanish outlet Fichajes claims they have ‘made a move’ for Fernandes ahead of January.",
      "‘The German club is preparing a financial offensive of around €50 million to convince the British club’s management to sign Bruno Fernandes in this transfer window.  Fernandes is seen as a top-tier signing capable of providing immediate experience and world-class ball distribution.",
      "‘His contract situation is a determining factor, as the end of this season will mark a critical stage for his professional future. Bayern Munich’s interest is no coincidence, as the Bavarian club has long admired the Portuguese midfielder’s playing style.’",
      "Bruno Fernandes has issued an ‘ultimatum’ that is in no way an ultimatum, while an ‘unrecognisable’ Premier League star is entirely recognisable.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United would be willing to ‘fast-track’ a move to sign Antoine Semenyo from AFC Bournemouth on two conditions.",

      "Manchester United ‘insiders’ have responded to Bruno Fernandes after the captain claimed that they wanted to sell him in this summer’s transfer window.",

      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has revealed that the Red Devils wanted to sell him in the summer but the board lacked the “courage” to do a deal."

      "Premier League • England",
      "Manchester United’s transfer strategy will continue to take shape with the club increasingly focused on signing players already proven in the Premier League, and we can reveal that a quartet of players from Bournemouth are firmly on their radar.",
      "United’s hierarchy are keen that future additions can hit the ground running in England’s top flight, leading them to scour the league for standout talent from clubs further down the football food chain.",
      "That approach has already seen results, with Matheus Cunha arriving from Wolves and Bryan Mbeumo secured from Brentford as part of the club’s evolving rebuild.",
      "The Red Devils have also shown a willingness to test the resolve of other Premier League sides. United previously attempted to unsettle Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba and have continued to monitor emerging talents at less glamorous clubs, including Wolves’ Joao Gomes and Brentford’s Yehor Yarmolyuk.",
      "Now, however, Bournemouth are becoming particularly interesting to United, who would have had members of club staff watching Monday’s 4-4 draw with the Cherries particularly closely.",
      "We have already exclusively revealed United’s strong interest in Antoine Semenyo, and that they feel they have the financial capability to trigger his £65m release clause in January.",
      "The Indepedent’s Miguel Delaney reported the same on Tuesday, a good seven days after our exclusive went live.",
      "The 25-year-old Ghana international is admired for his versatility and ability to operate in multiple roles – including wing-back if required.",
      "But sources have now confirmed that Semenyo is not the only Bournemouth player on United’s list. The Old Trafford club are also tracking three more Cherries stars as long-term options.",
      "Ensure you don’t miss our exclusive content by personalising your Google homepage settings to TEAMtalk to ensure you’re seeing our latest breaking and originally-sourced content first.",
      "The Bournemouth trio in question are Tyler Adams, Alex Scott and Adrien Truffert, all of whom are highly rated within United’s recruitment department.",
      "My colleague, Graeme Bailey, reported yesterday how Cherries midfielders Adams and Scott have both emerged on the Red Devils’ radar, and that they both stood out during analytical studies by United’s footballing department.",
      "The interest for Adams emerged via analytic and scouting, Bailey reported. This has been backed up by his previous relationship with current United director of recruitment, Christopher Vivell. Adams found his best form at RB Leipzig whilst Vivell was technical director, and he oversaw his move to Leeds United. He is now a key player for Bournemouth, joining from Leeds in the summer of 2023.",
      "Scott, meanwhile, has emerged on United’s radar following his hugely successful spell with England’s Under-21s –  where he starred alongside another United target, Elliott Anderson, in the summer.",
      "As for Truffert, the one-time capped France international has emerged as a potential target as Amorim looks to strengthen his options in the left wing-back position.",
      "While no immediate moves are planned, Bournemouth’s growing reputation as a top destination for Premier League talent has clearly caught United’s attention as they plan for the future.",
      "Meanwhile, my colleague Bailey has revealed United’s response to a controversial Bruno Fernandes interview, in which he said the club let him down by trying to force a move to Al-Hilal, who made a bid to sign him last summer.",
      "He reports that United’s top brass are very unhappy and shocked with Fernandes’ claims, and say the opposite is true.",
      "In other news, Fabrizio Romano has named Brighton midfielder Baleba as United’s top target, with Amorim personally keen on his signing.",
      "Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton and Nottingham Forest’s Anderson also remain firmly on the shortlist.",

      "Unsurprisingly, FIFA have ‘sided with Morocco’, as the release period began on Monday, the day of the Bournemouth fixture.",
      "The Red Devils benefited from ‘constructive talks’ with Cameroon and Ivory Coast, which allowed Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to be available against Andoni Iraola’s side.",

      "United may feel hard done by, but rules are rules, and their frustration comes across as ignorant.",
      "ESPN claims Mazraoui’s absence, combined with injuries to Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, ‘forced Amorim to field a makeshift defence’ that included Leny Yoro and Ayden Heaven.",
      "Amorim hardly had to draft in Tyler Fredricson, and Lisandro Martínez has been back long enough to start a Premier League match, albeit with a minutes restriction.",
      "Yoro is a £55million player, while Heaven was making his third consecutive start.",
      "Mazraoui would probably have started had he been available, but Amorim was not forced to play anyone he would only turn to in a genuine crisis.",
      "Morocco have every right to expect Mazraoui not to play within seven days of their opening AFCON fixture, and FIFA backing them up confirms United do not have a leg to stand on.",
      "Nevertheless, Amorim’s side feel ‘irked’ and have lodged a complaint with FIFA.",
      "Unfortunately for African nations and players, European clubs often underestimate the significance of AFCON.",
      "Just look at events in Italy this week. Como manager Cesc Fabregas has been heavily criticised for playing Senegal youngster Assane Diao over the weekend.",
      "Fabregas had complained about Diao’s call-up, citing his injury record and Senegal’s midfield depth, and the 20-year-old is now a doubt after being injured against Roma on Monday, eight days before Senegal face Botswana.",
      "The situation reflects poorly on both Fabregas and Senegal boss Pape Thiaw, who reportedly said Diao would not go to the World Cup if he were not allowed to travel for AFCON, and comments from the former have not helped matters.",
      "Fabregas said: “He probably shouldn’t have played today either, but I selected him because he’s leaving this Tuesday and I won’t have him for five weeks, so since we’re paying his salary, we might as well let him play a little for us.”"

      "Indeed, that is the very crux of the current problem for Ruben Amorim and Manchester United.",
      "They are no longer utterly, humiliatingly mortifying. That deep sense of embarrassment at being just so profoundly sh*t that United felt throughout last season and into the start of this one has now dissipated.",
      "The stain of finishing where they finished last season and bottling a cup final against a Tottenham – Tottenham! – side apparently being player-managed on the fly by Cristian Romero and Micky van de Ven will never truly come off. And nor should it.",
      "You don’t have to be This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About for that to be an unacceptable season. There can exist no mitigation that justifies finishing 15th and collecting fewer league wins than a Wolves team now making a historic attempt at knocking Derby County off their f*cking perch.",
      "That shame will always be there. Grimsby will always be there.",
      "But it’s fair to say now that those very darkest days do appear to be behind United. Things still aren’t perfect by any stretch. At almost any other period of United’s Premier League history their current effort would be a poor one, and that itself is part of the problem for anyone trying to turn this ship around.",
      "Even after the historic lows of last season even the significant current improvement doesn’t constitute success.",
      "And herein lies the ongoing niggle. United are now at the very least competent. That doesn’t sound like much, and it isn’t, but it’s a huge step up from last season. Competence is welcome at this stage.",
      "But with it have already come some extremely irritating missed opportunities. Last year’s incompetence may have only slightly dampened expectations, with the club’s own stated aims for this season a nine-place leap into the top six, but it has handed United another advantage.",
      "It’s not the advantage any club of United’s stature wants, but the absence altogether of any European football – with the Grimsby debacle almost eliminating midweek football altogether – offers United benefits that none of their theoretical rivals can enjoy.",
      "And they just keep refusing to fully accept those chances. They have dragged themselves towards the top of the mid-table peloton but they really could have got themselves into something approaching Villa’s current situation.",
      "United have only lost once in seven Premier League games since the start of November, but it’s a run riddled with annoyance and frustration.",
      "The defeat was a ludicrous one, at home against a good-not-great Everton side who handed United an absurd early advantage by friendly-firing themselves down to 10 men.",
      "And the other six games in that run have all been against distinctly beatable opponents. The league positions for the seven teams at the time United played them were 18th, 6th, 13th, 5th, 17th, 20th and 13th.",
      "The sixth-placed team was Tottenham, who we now know to be more rubbish than that, and the fifth-placed one was Palace, who United beat. The only other win was against the team in 20th, who we don’t think we need identify by name.",
      "In the last seven weeks United have drawn four games against opposition of bottom-half standard. And they have been in front in every single one of those games. In three of them they have led going into the final 10 minutes.",
      "Sure, at Spurs they ended up salvaging a point in the last seconds but only after throwing away a winning position with six minutes of regular time remaining.",
      "West Ham equalised on 83 minutes at Old Trafford, and Bournemouth 84 in a game United had already led twice and trailed once before getting their noses in front again to no avail with 11 minutes to go.",
      "And such is the congested nature of the league table that these spaffed points really, really hurt. They have had so many chances now to get themselves into the (likely) Champions League places and every time they seem to sabotage themselves, very often infuriatingly late on in games.",
      "Ifs and buts are candy and nuts, but when the table is so tight it is impossible to resist thinking about what might have been. There is a compelling case to make that United could have won every single one of their last seven league games, which is good. Instead, they have won only two.",
      "Even turning two of the five failures into the wins United really should have managed would be enough to have them in the top four now. You might even, if you wanted to be entirely reckless, talk about them being on the fringes of the title race.",
      "Instead: there they still are in the mid-table bunch, still having to worry every bit as much about what’s behind them as ahead of them, still in danger of slipping right back into mid-table should they stumble again.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United would be willing to ‘fast-track’ a move to sign Antoine Semenyo from AFC Bournemouth on two conditions.",
      "Semenyo has been one of the standout performers in the Premier League this season as he has shone for Andoni Iraola’s side.",
      "The 25-year-old has taken his game to another level this season, grabbing seven goals and three assists in 15 Premier League appearances.",
      "This could help to secure him a move elsewhere in January. I has been revealed that he has a £65m release clause in his contract that can be activated next month. If he stays until the summer, he will be available for £50m.",
      "Semenyo is unlikely to remain at Bournemouth until the summer as talkSPORT claims Man Utd, Liverpool, Arsenal, Man City and Spurs are ‘all showing interest in him’.",
      "READ: Kobbie Mainoo among six losers as new Manchester United arrives under Ruben Amorim",
      "In recent months, Liverpool have been mooted as his most likely destination as the Premier League holders target him as a potential long-term replacement for Mohamed Salah.",
      "However, Man Utd are also in the running to sign Semenyo as they look to increase their depth in forward areas.",
      "A new report from The Daily Mail claims Semenyo ‘falls into the category’ of a player who INEOS would ‘fast-track a transfer to sign six months early’.",
      "Though it is explained that a potential move for Semenyo in January hinges on two conditions.",
      "‘Landing the 25-year-old won’t be easy, however. Not only will United face competition from Manchester City, Liverpool and Tottenham, they also have to find a way of financing the deal when a defensive midfielder remains the priority next month.",
      "‘Selling Joshua Zirkzee is one option. The Dutchman is wanted on loan by Roma and United could include an obligation to buy as part of the package, similar to the £38m clause in Rasmus Hojlund’s move to Napoli.’",
      "Man Utd could also raise funds by offloading captain Bruno Fernandes, as he remains heavily linked with a potential move to the Saudi Pro League or European sides.",
      "Fernandes opted against an exit in the summer, but he has remarkably claimed that club chiefs wanted him to leave in the previous transfer window.",
      "This has fuelled speculation regarding a possible transfer in 2026, and the same report from The Daily Mail claims he could cost much less than £100m.",
      "They claimed: ‘Those familiar with the talks have explained that there has been growing confidence for a while that the actual fee it would take to land Fernandes is closer to the £65-70m mark, rather than £100m.’",
      "As we approach January and Man Utd in particular pledge to strip every non-elite Premier League club, we look at the biggest assets outside the traditional Big Six.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s players ‘feel’ captain Bruno Fernandes is in his final season with the Premier League giants.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has issued an ‘ultimatum’ that is in no way an ultimatum, while an ‘unrecognisable’ Premier League star is entirely recognisable.",
      "We can reveal that a quartet of players from Bournemouth are firmly on the radar of Manchester United.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are ‘ready’ to offload four players in a ‘fire sale’ during next summer’s transfer window.",

      "Man Utd‘s positive summer transfer window has helped them, with club chiefs offloading most of their unwanted players to raise funds for their squad overhaul.",
      "The exits of Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho enabled Man Utd to sign Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for around £230m combined.",

      "United were priced out of a £100m+ move for Brighton standout Carlos Baleba in the summer, but they have also been linked with several potential alternatives ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "This includes Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson and Crystal Palace’s Adam Wharton, but Romano has confirmed that Baleba remains their preferred option.",

      "The same report has named six potential replacements for these players. They explained: ‘The situation could again hinge on United signing a midfielder with Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton, Conor Gallagher, Carlos Baleba, Tyler Adams and Joao Gomes along the players who have been discussed.",
      "‘United remain adamant that they won’t make any panic buys in January and will only sign a player if it’s a deal that can be brought forward from the summer.",
      "‘With so much uncertainty hanging over Fernandes, Casemiro, Ugarte and Mainoo, it’s likely there will be more than one new midfielder coming through the door. It’s not as though United have reinforcements coming through from the academy either, with Toby Collyer and Sekou Kone likely to go out on loan.’",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s players ‘feel’ captain Bruno Fernandes is in his final season with the Premier League giants.",

      "A total of 32 Premier League players are currently making their way to Africa ahead of the tournament’s first game on Sunday but when one door closes, another one opens and there will be plenty of players hoping to make the most of some of the absences.",

      "With Amad away, the Portuguese boss could deploy a 4-3-3 with Casemiro, Bruno Fernandes and Mainoo occupying the midfield spots and given how much fuss there has been around the England youngster’s place on the bench, it would be a chance to prove he warrants a place when the AFCON boys return.",

      "Ruben Amorim has had more than his fair share of critics in his first 13 months in charge of Manchester United, and he is supposedly far from safe despite there being improvements this season.",
      "The under-fire boss deserves credit for ensuring Man Utd are in a better place than they were when he arrived, though this does not make up for the bleak mess of last season.",
      "Their positive transfer business has contributed to their improvement, though they have been hamstrung by Amorim stubbornly refusing to waver from his flawed 3-4-3 formation.",
      "So, it is refreshing that Amorim has made a U-turn on this stance, with the Man Utd boss trialling a 4-3-3 system in training to combat the absence of Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui during the African Cup of Nations.",
      "We were treated to a glimpse at what Amorim and his players have been working on against AFC Bournemouth on Monday night, with the head coach’s tweaks contributing to Man Utd’s best attacking display in the past year.",
      "There were teething issues as Man Utd were woeful defensively, which is to be expected with Luke Shaw and Ayden Heaven as a makeshift centre-back partnership. But they will be far more solid once they have preferred options available, while Mbeumo, Diallo, Matheus Cunha, Mason Mount and co. can continue to flourish.",
      "It is clear that Amorim’s squad is more suited to a four-man defence than his preferred system, and he should stick with this set-up for the long term, but there will be victims (six, to be exact) of these changes. Here are the expected losers as the new Man Utd arrives…",
      "",
      "Amorim reportedly feels Dorgu has ‘best in the world’ potential, but his first full season at Man Utd is proving difficult following his £29m move from Lecce in January.",
      "His underlying stats prove that he certainly is not the ‘dud’ he has been accused of being, but the more experienced Diogo Dalot – who is less suited to the wing-back role – has often been preferred on the left flank this season.",
      "Dorgu definitely has the attributes to grow into a great player for Man Utd, but he is currently pretty raw, and Amorim’s move to a back four does not benefit him.",
      "The 21-year-old is stronger in the attacking half than Dalot, but his teammate is more suited to playing as a traditional full-back, as he is more reliable in his own half. Therefore, he is likely to further cement himself on the left for as long as Amorim adopts a four-man defence.",

      "His brother might be a d*ck, but Mainoo had a rare positive night against Bournemouth as he had a very commanding 30-minute cameo off the bench. Or did he?",
      "He was Man Utd’s deepest midfielder after replacing Casemiro and, especially with his ball progression, did a fine job.",
      "But Mainoo should not get too excited; he benefited from Man Utd needing to chase the game, and another natural No.6 would typically replace Casemiro, who is still preferred to play alongside the Englishman’s main rival, Bruno Fernandes.",
      "So, with Manuel Ugarte or United’s next marquee signing to replace Casemiro, Amorim preferring Fernandes as his partner and with other No.10s also favoured, Mainoo’s situation is unlikely to change with his side’s formation, and he should still get himself a move in January.",
      "",
      "United’s hit rate with their summer signings has been uncharacteristically high, with Sesko currently the only standout candidate to be a mega-flop as Mbeumo, Cunha and Senne Lammens impress.",
      "It is no coincidence that the Red Devils’ best displays this season have come when Sesko has been missing from their forward line as Mbeumo and Cunha spearhead their attack.",
      "As for Sesko, it is far too early to fully write him off, and he has the necessary natural attributes to eventually prove himself at Old Trafford, but, in the meantime, versatile attackers are needed for the best results in this fluid system.",
      "",
      "Monday’s game versus Bournemouth was the latest in a string of poor games for Shaw this season, with Gary Neville not pulling any punches in his assessment of the declining defender.",
      "Shaw’s ability to play at wing-back or as an inverted centre-back was expected to make him a big winner of the Amorim era, but this is not panning out.",
      "It looks as if injuries have caught up with Shaw. So, Dalot remains the firm favourite to continue at left-back, while the England international has no chance of continuing at centre-back in a back four after Monday night either. There’s no wonder he’s among the five doomed Man Utd players in 2026.",

      "Unlike the Man Utd youngsters needlessly caught in the crossfire, Ugarte has deserved all the criticism he’s received as the club’s £42m investment has proved massively misjudged.",
      "Ugarte was once a favourite of Amorim, but he has been reduced to being a bit-part player under United’s boss and often makes his side worse when introduced. New system or not, he should be gone next year and be replaced by Carlos Baleba/Elliot Anderson.",
      "",
      "Reports suggest otherwise, but Zirkzee should be rueing missing out on a transfer in the summer. He had the opportunity to follow in rejuvenated Rasmus Hojlund’s footsteps in shining back in Italy but instead, he’s been left to rot on the United bench.",
      "Zirkzee was better than Hojlund last season, but he is definitely stronger as a No.10 than a No.9 and is inferior to Man Utd’s other options, new and old, in the supporting role.",
      "The best he can hope for is that his standing at Man Utd remains unchanged as Amorim’s changes, which do not benefit him at all, are implemented. His future clearly lies elsewhere.",

      "For a multi-millionaire, elite-level – no laughing in the back – footballer with a reputation for throwing tantrums about as often as he creates chances for hilariously inferior teammates, Bruno Fernandes is eminently relatable.",
      "He fundamentally just wants to be wanted.",
      "And such is the absurd nature of This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About, not even 103 goals, 93 assists, 307 appearances and a handful of rejected offers to be happier, financially healthier and infinitely more rewarded elsewhere guarantees even that at the absolute worst of times.",
      "Fernandes has gone into more depth on how he is “hurting” and “sad” at feeling that Manchester United “wanted me to go” but ultimately lacked the “courage” to take the Saudi offer.",
      "But it is not particularly new information. In June he explained that he “spoke to the club, who said they weren’t willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave”. By October he cited specific conversations with Jason Wilcox and Omar Berrada, who he paraphrased as saying: “‘We won’t say no but we want you to stay at the club. If you want to go, we won’t say that it’s not the offer for us because obviously it’s massive money’.'”",
      "On both occasions he credited Ruben Amorim with persuading him to stay, as was again the case when Fernandes opened up once more after the Bournemouth draw.",
      "“The club wanted me to go, I have that in my head. I told the directors this, but I think they didn’t have the courage to make that decision.",
      "“From the club’s side, I felt a bit like, ‘if you leave, it’s not so bad for us.’ It hurts me a lot. More than hurting, it makes me sad because I’m a player they have nothing to criticise about. I’m always available, I always play, good or bad. I give my all. Then you see things around you, players who don’t value the club as much and don’t defend the club as much… that makes you sad.”",
      "The impotent fury he unleashed on the Old Trafford pitch at Manuel Ugarte, Casemiro and anyone else who came within his enraged orbit, triggered by another successful episode of Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United, certainly added credence to the idea he simply cares more than anyone about their plight, at least outwardly.",
      "It is a connection and a “loyalty” Fernandes does not always feel has been reciprocated, a relationship Manchester United have exploited and taken for granted for more than half a decade.",
      "But of course the killers of free lunches, charity donations and jobs looked at a nine-figure offer for a 30-year-old and did not immediately dismiss it out of hand. It was simple business practice to reserve it as a live option, albeit with keeping Fernandes the clear preference.",
      "As the Portuguese himself said, “for them, money is more important than anything”.",
      "For a player who has very possibly sacrificed trophies and awards in the name of the worst modern iteration of this club, however, it inevitably “hurts”.",
      "“I was valued,” Fernandes said, “and what values ​​me most has to be my club, although lately I feel like I’m on thin ice. In England, when a player starts approaching 30, they start thinking they need a makeover. It’s like the furniture.”",
      "Fernandes, in an ideal world, should really be part of United for as long as he wants to be. But it also doesn’t work like that, especially when new landlords have taken over and are trying to run things properly.",
      "Had he left for £100m, Fernandes would have been the most expensive 30-year-old sale in football history.",
      "Manchester United executives had to consider it. Amorim had to overrule it. Fernandes has to be “hurt” by it. This is the sort of thing which fuels rather than foils him, as being behind only Erling Haaland for combined goals and assists in the Premier League so far this season suggests.",
      "There is no wrong party here, only miscommunications and different perspectives. Fernandes, for all his faults, is just the high-maintenance partner who does sometimes need and deserve a bit more back.",
      "As we approach January and Man Utd in particular pledge to strip every non-elite Premier League club, we look at the biggest assets outside the traditional Big Six.",
      "There is a new leader at the top of the Premier League goalkeeper rankings. It’s definitely not David Raya or either of the Liverpool keepers…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United’s players ‘feel’ captain Bruno Fernandes is in his final season with the Premier League giants.",
      "Bruno Fernandes has issued an ‘ultimatum’ that is in no way an ultimatum, while an ‘unrecognisable’ Premier League star is entirely recognisable.",
      "Manchester United are much better this season. But what it was, was complete turd. At the moment they’re still doing little more than polishing it.",

      "It is really interesting to be reminded in the mailbox and on other social media platforms how people view football through this aesthetics prism of reels and compilations that is fed to us.",
      "Obviously, they are generally the moments that we like to celebrate and last night’s match was indeed an incredible game with top quality attacking players showcasing some excellent moments. More of that, please.",
      "On the note of pleasing things, I was happy to see Kobbie Mainoo’s introduction onto the pitch and the subsequent increase in Manchester United’s tempo. He really knits the play together well at times.",
      "However, it was another example of how we have been trained to view football as an ‘on the ball’ game. Enjoy the exciting actions but overlook ‘invisible moments’ that often define matches. It is very easy to miss the subtle actions that allow attacking players to prosper. Cole Palmer failed to cut off the passing lane that supplied Fabian Ruiz in the build up to Spain’s knockout blow in the Euro 2024 final, yet I heard little mention of this in any pundit’s analysis.",
      "Mainoo’s below the radar defining actions last night were another perfect example. His moments on the ball were as sound as usual and his interplay with teammates advanced the ball well on a couple of occasions. But hands up who noticed Mainoo dive into a failed tackle on the left side of the pitch near the halfway line, resulting in Bournemouth’s fourth goal? His abandonment of position allowed the ball to reach Jimenez and for Kluviert to bomb forward, creating an overload. There was then space for the pass to Kroupi and he equalised. Rewatch it and see for yourselves.",
      "Further on in the game, an unnecessary Mainoo handball led to a clear chance for Brooks and a smart stop from Lammens. A few moments later, Dorgu and Mainoo both collided when going for a header, leading to another chance for Bournemouth at the death. I was deliberately watching Mainoo, to try to garner an understanding of why a player who featured for half of a dismal England Slovakia wash out and was subbed at 0-1 against each of Slovenia, Switzerland and Spain could be held in such high regard.",
      "Yes, he played a lot of successful short passes. Yes, he played relatively well against the Netherlands. Yes, he wasn’t Trent Alexander-Arnold or Connor Gallagher. But, overall, the ball wasn’t moved with speed to our forwards and resulted in a dearth of opportunities, as reflected in England’s attacking data. There were many others to blame here, of course.",
      "Compilations on Twitter/X can paint anyone in any light. That Liverpool game in the cup comes to mind. I certainly see the talent that Kobbie Mainoo has, but a more expansive passing range and a more diligent approach to defending are required to succeed in today’s game. His invisible moments were costly and almost fatal yesterday and I gained an understanding of why Amorim might view him as a liability who doubles up as a smooth operator.",
      "Ultimately, I wonder what position would be most suitable for him. An advanced 8 in a 4-3-3 set up? Perhaps alongside a hypothetical carbon copy of Rice and Zubimendi, we would see more of his full potential. Mainoo seems to be a model professional, so good luck to him.\nAC in Milan",

      "Second is a wild card: Dalot. Yes I know, but hear me out. He’s actually ok with shooting, he *can* tackle although often you do wonder about that, and he can run a lot which is always nice.",
      "Third, to keep it topical, I’ll say Mainoo. Since he used to be a forward anyway, that’s covered and defensively he would probably do fine although it would definitely need to be a fluid formation as we couldn’t have 9 players all hovering around the edge of the box.",

      "Watching the game, off the ball at times we had 4 at the back as Yoro shifted across right and Dalot dropped in, with Amad staying higher. But there were also times we had 5 at the back when Yoro stayed more compact and Amad dropped back. On the ball the shape was more familiar looking as we maintained 3 at the back and the wingbacks bombed forward. Even when Mainoo came on we kept the 2 in MF, and at one stage we did play 4-2-4 chasing the 4th goal.",
      "Point being that the shape is flexible, and has been all season. It all depends on the phase of play and opposition. Players will interchange, cover certain areas, track certain players and also sometimes there will be chaos and everyone gets swept up in it (like last night).",
      "The manager is still learning and hasn’t found the right balance yet (we are definitely too open at times) but he has shown he can be flexible, he has a few tricks up his sleeve and I have faith he will get it right. At the very least it is entertaining attacking football.\nGarey Vance, MUFC",

      "What motivates a man, so angle minded in his approach, to just, throw it all away?",
      "As a Manchester United fan, I was happy to see something resembling a back four against Bournemouth. But I’m also feeling a little sad for Ruben,",
      "Whilst I really dislike the Amorim 3-4-3, I could begrudgingly admire the commitment to the bit. For over a year, an incredibly disappointing year, where it seemed half the squad didn’t fit, many being driven Amorim, often in a very public manner, Ruben held fast to his principles. And just like that he p***ed it all away.",
      "Feels like a waste really. because if he’s just going to give up now, it makes the last year feel even more infuriating.",
      "It’s been obvious to anyone paying attention that the Amorim style did not suit the squad. And while the money spent over summer was nothing to sneeze at, it was nowhere near enough to give Amorim the squad he wanted any time soon.yet he still persisted.",
      "So what made Amorim decide that a Monday night against Bournemouth, was the night to give up on the one thing that defined his managerial career?",

      "First xG does seem to split opinion, I’m a fan of it but realise its limitations. It’s not perfect but it’s better than almost any other stat at showing chance creation and threat in a game. Shots on target and possession are far worse.",
      "Morgan Rogers’ goal being ranked 0.02xG isn’t saying Rodgers has a 2% chance of scoring, it’s an average of all professional players who have previously taken a shot from there. Yes not an exact science because how close were the defenders, who was in goal, was it windy etc, but a league 2 CB with a nosebleed shooting from there would be far lower xG just as the very best players (which given the wide sample Rogers would certainly class in) would be far higher.",
      "xG is not a prediction, it’s an average number of goals scored from very similar shots. When looking at a teams’ xG you can get a better idea of the game than just the score. Stats in football are always best used alongside watching the game, they can confirm or debunk your eye test.",
      "There is a phrase that you can’t outrun your xG. In the opening 5 or so games Liverpool had 5 wins but their xG for and against showed thy were fortunate – I understand you could also see that by watching all the games, but their xG showed they ‘should’ be more like 8th, and it caught up with them. For a short period Chelsea were the same then they dropped points in 3 straight games. Spurs earlier in the season were similar.",
      "Right now Villa are drastically out performing their xG. Perhaps we’ll see their results turn as it has for others….perhaps not after all it’s unlikely we finish with a table where every team finishes exactly where their xG says they should.",
      "Finally a quick one on Arsenal. No club is judged on their last result or performance more than Arsenal. As someone yesterday said, it’s like every result is treated as do or die. Now perhaps that is partly down to the Arsenal fans and our desperation for the title and knowing (to our cost) that one bad result, or one goal can be the difference between 1st and 2nd given the high standards at the top of the league. But I think there needs to be some reframing of expectations and rational analysis of results in context.",
      "I don’t think you can have only 1 team who is expected to win the league, and if they do then all other top teams are given a pass for not winning. This season all 3 of Arsenal, Liverpool and City should be expected to win the league, and 2nd is a failure.",
      "Given the amount of money they’ve spent I’d be tempted to include Chelsea there but most give them a pass because they haven’t challenged for a while forgetting what has been spent. But currently it seems like Arsenal are the only team expected to win the league, a reminder that whilst Arsenal have spent a lot of money assembling this very good squad, it’s no more money than most top teams and Spurs, Arsenal are not reigning champions, they haven’t won 6 of the last 8 titles, they weren’t favourites before the season started, they have no experience of winning, they don’t have a goal a game striker, they don’t have arguably the best manager ever in the game etc etc. it’s a strange dichotomy where all the things people use to bash Arsenal are the very reasons why it’s hard for Arsenal to win the league, but those same people will call it a huge failure if they don’t win it.",
      "This isn’t some way of trying to paint Arsenal as plucky underdogs, we’re 2 points clear and doing ok, and have built a depth of squad that should have every chance of winning it, and it will be a disappointment if we don’t, just as it should be for City and Liverpool.",
      "If Arsenal need a title/squad boost in January we could always sell our women’s team to ourselves for £80m, or sell Highbury house real estate to ourselves for another boost, perhaps even pay our staff off the books and get Kronke Sports empire to sponsor Win the dog’s collar for £200m.

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has reportedly made one January transfer request as Fabrizio Romano reveals the truth about their rumoured interest in Tyler Adams.",
      "Amorim is looking to finish in the European places this term after a disastrous first season in charge saw Man Utd finish 15th in the Premier League.",
      "INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe threw their weight behind Amorim in the summer transfer window with over £200m spent on five new plaeyrs.",
      "But now Amorim wants a new midfielder – one position Man Utd failed to strengthen over the summer – in the January market with a report in Spanish website Fichajes claiming that the Red Devils boss has made a ‘direct request’ to sign Al-Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves.",
      "Neves has made clear his ‘desire is to return to a major European league’ with the Red Devils’ ‘priority would be to finalise the deal in January’ – but they may have to wait until the summer.",
      "READ: Manchester United might need transfer policy change as Garnacho problem threatens to strike again",
      "The report adds: ‘The main obstacle is Al-Hilal . The Saudi club is in no hurry to sell and is maintaining a firm stance regarding the winter transfer window. However, the player’s contract expires at the end of the season. This opens up a very attractive alternative for the English club.",
      "‘If no agreement is reached in January, Manchester United are confident they can sign him as a free agent in the summer. A move of enormous market value. Those in Saudi Arabia acknowledge that retaining the player will be difficult if he intends to return to Europe. The player’s desire carries weight.’",
      "Bournemouth midfielder Adams was recently named as a potential option for Man Utd to explore over the next couple of transfer windows and Romano insists the former Leeds player is on their “list”.",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel: “On Tyler Adams, from what I’m told, he is one of the names Man Utd are monitoring, but he is not the only one because there are several players on the list.",
      "“There are two separate lists. There are top, top targets like Carlos Baleba, Joao Neves and Adam Wharton – players considered top targets but very difficult, very unlikely for January, maybe more realistic for the summer. For January, it could be more about opportunities.",
      "“Bournemouth want to keep a player like Tyler Adams. They believe he’s a really important player for them, and it’s not going to be easy for Man Utd to find a solution in terms of pricing and timing. Bournemouth want to keep Tyler Adams also because of the Antoine Semenyo situation, which is also close to being evaluated in January.",
      "“At the moment, Bournemouth insist on keeping Tyler Adams at the club. Man Utd like the player, they see him as a potential option, but at the moment he’s not the only one and it’s not an easy one because Bournemouth insist on keeping the player in this January transfer window.”",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘held talks’ over signing Al-Hilal star Ruben Neves, who is also linked with Newcastle United and Spurs.",

      "Sources can confirm that the interest in Marc Guehi is as expected and amid strong claims that Manchester City have now made the player a ‘leading target’ in 2026, we can confirm the names of every major club in Europe who have made contact with his camp ahead of his exit on a free transfer away from Crystal Palace next summer.",
      "Guehi came close to joining Liverpool on the summer deadline day when a fee worth £35m was agreed by the Reds that would have also guaranteed Crystal Palace a further 10% cut of any future deal. But with the Eagles pulling the plug, where Guehi ends up next remains a wide-open question and with as many as THIRTEEN sides understood to have reached out to his camp ahead of a potential transfer.",
      "Per The Times, Guehi has now appeared on Manchester City‘s radar amid claims Pep Guardiola is planning a defensive overhaul at the Etihad in 2026.",
      "And while sources close to Guehi’s camp can confirm that interest is genuine, the Cityzens are far from the only side in the transfer mix for a player fast becoming the hottest commodity of the 2026 transfer windows.",
      "Whilst official offers and negotiations can’t begin until after January 1, interest has been lodged from more than a dozen clubs from across England and Europe.",
      "And we confirm that all but one of England’s big six are keen to sign Guehi. Liverpool, Chelsea, City, Manchester United and Tottenham have confirmed to the player’s camp that they are ready to offer him terms.",
      "Of the big six, Arsenal are the exception to that rule, with Mikel Arteta an admirer of the player but confident in his options, recently solidified by having tied down first-choice pairing Gabriel and William Saliba to long-term deals.",
      "However, sources with knowledge of the situation have confirmed to TEAMtalk that Guehi is in no rush to commit to a new club and wants to assess his options.",
      "The source confirmed: “Marc is doing his thing, he is very happy with his form, and if you ask him, his main focus is on Palace and England ahead of the World Cup finals.",
      "“He is leaving his agents to assess his options, and they have told him he literally is going to have his pick of clubs. His people told him he is going to be one of the most wanted free agents of all time, if he leaves on a free, and that is exactly how things are panning out.”",
      "After the summer deal to Liverpool collapsed, Guehi’s camp confirmed to the Premier League champions, as well as all his other suitors, that the slate has been wiped clean and the race to land him was starting from that point.",
      "Since the breakdown of that move to Anfield, though, Guehi’s stock has risen further, fuelled by his impending free agency status but also by way of the fact that the 25-year-old has enjoyed a brilliant campaign to date.",
      "Now he heads into 2026 knowing he has his choice of Europe’s elite clubs.",
      "And as well as the interest from within the Premier League, we are told that there is a significant chance for Guehi to move abroad.",
      "We can confirm that Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, PSG, Juventus, Inter Milan and Galatasaray have all registered their interest in opening official talks from January 1.",
      "Of those, it is Bayern Munich who have pushed the hardest, with their directors making clear the big push they are willing to make to win the race for his signature next year and with even Harry Kane trying to persuade his England teammate to join him in Bavaria.",
      "My colleague, Fraser Fletcher, also revealed recently that Barcelona have launched two formal approaches over the past fortnight.",
      "Palace could yet attempt to sell Guehi in January, but we can confirm that Eagles boss Oliver Glasner has once again confirmed to the club’s hierarchy that he is very much opposed to this.",
      "And Guehi himself is not in a hurry to leave Selhurst Park. Sources confirm he is open to finishing the season, with the hope of delivering yet more silverware to the club and having lifted the FA Cup and Community Shield with them last year.",
      "On the subject of Guehi, Palace are also understood to be doing their due diligence on a number of potential replacements.",
      "To that end, we revealed earlier this month that the Eagles are now chasing a title-winning centre-back who only just changed clubs for €20m earlier this season.",

      "The concept of Manchester United’s ‘no dickheads’ policy – myriad horses having bolted long before – was underlined by their first signing since the transfer edict.",
      "It is difficult to think of a more ‘no dickheads’ player than Mason Mount, with Jonny Evans arriving a fortnight later.",
      "That was the same summer in which Dean Henderson was their biggest sale. A phenomenal keeper and Crystal Palace stalwart he may have become, but one can absolutely see how he might have developed a certain difficult reputation at Old Trafford.",
      "Mason Greenwood, by the way, was offloaded the following year.",
      "Gilbert Enoka, the mental performance coach credited with transforming the All Blacks with what shouldn’t have been a particularly ground-breaking strategy of just not employing complete arses, once explained:",
      "“A dickhead makes everything about them. They are people who put themselves ahead of the team, people who think they’re entitled to things, expect the rules to be different for them, people operating deceitfully in the dark, or being unnecessarily loud about their work.”",
      "There is precisely no reason to believe Kobbie Mainoo falls into that category. He has received his 212 of a possible 1440 Premier League minutes this season with public grace and humility, keeping his counsel and only privately expressing a desire to leave on loan for more playing opportunities in a World Cup year.",
      "He has been a model professional and one of the better players even in a mere 29-minute cameo in the absurd draw against Bournemouth.",
      "But if you are the company you keep, Mainoo would do well to heed the warnings of his former academy equal. While Jordan Mainoo-Hames is not even vaguely on the same level as Roberto Garnacho in terms of brotherly bother, what transpired at Old Trafford feels like a slippery slope in that unhelpful direction.",
      "It did not feel like an act born of half-brotherly love or support. It seemed like little more than a publicity stunt from a former Love Island contestant turned influencer. And considering how Mainoo himself has handled the situation, it is tough to imagine him sanctioning, condoning or welcoming it.",
      "Over the weekend, Ruben Amorim had said he was “completely open” to discussing the player’s options, that he would “be really pleased if Kobbie comes to talk to me about” his future because “I just want my players happy and I understand that every individual has their goals”.",
      "The manager added that “frustration doesn’t help anybody”.",
      "Yet frustration is all that can really be felt when Amorim’s words were so quickly undercut by someone sitting front and centre in the Old Trafford stands before the game wearing a ‘FREE KOBBIE MAINOO’ t-shirt – which coincidentally is available for under £20 and is supposedly low on stock if the website now shilling it is to be believed.",
      "That made everything about Mainoo. That put him ahead of the team, made him seem entitled, that the rules for him were different. It was certainly unnecessarily loud in the tabloid ‘speaks volumes’ sense.",
      "It was a noise Manchester United, Amorim and indeed Mainoo could have done without; the game itself was raucous enough.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, entirely predictably, has liked one of the offending posts, presumably with a tingle of nostalgia. It remains to be seen whether his brother believes Mainoo to have been ‘thrown under the bus’. But even just a brief reminder of the sideshow they encouraged before jumping ship to Chelsea in the summer should discourage Camp Mainoo from venturing further down a path that leads only to more problems.",
      "After the issues with the Garnachos and to a far, far, far lesser but still relevant extent the Rashfords, it might be time for Manchester United to add a brother-based appendix to the ‘no dickheads’ policy, with Mainoo’s kin the first case in point.",

      "Wednesday 17 December 2025 08:53, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim got Manchester United fans back onside with tactical flexibility against Bournemouth, but AFCON absences raise new problems, writes Dan Khan...",
      "As I go for walks around Manchester I constantly bump into United fans and we always end up chatting about how they feel their club is doing.",
      "After drab, lacklustre performances against Everton and West Ham, one gentleman in my barbers last week - a season ticket holder in the Stretford End - told me he just wants to see United 'go for it' and put on a performance. That's all.",
      "Despite the draw against Bournemouth extending their run of form to just two wins from seven, the overall performance saw most fans leave Old Trafford satisfied with the display they had witnessed.",
      "You can look at the metrics like xG and shot count to explain why United could have had a hatful in the first half, but it was not just that which left their supporters content.",
      "It was Leny Yoro at right-back, looking revitalised on his return to the side, showing aggression and pressing high.",
      "Ayden Heaven and Luke Shaw, a centre-back duo I did not think I would ever write, also echoed that aggression with Mason Mount looking even more like the player United signed from Chelsea in July 2023.",
      "This was the difference: the intent from Amorim's team. This is what the home fans responded to and what Amorim had been asking from his players. To show that aggression, win their duels and give the fans at Old Trafford a show and they duly obliged despite the disappointment at sharing the points in the end.",
      "It is impossible to gloss over the ease which some of Bournemouth's goals were scored but perhaps context is required as well to explain United's defensive woes in recent weeks.",
      "Amorim told us after the game he does not believe significant investment is required in defence, and that he has the characteristics among his players to improve and defend better as a team.",
      "It is easy to forget United were without their best defender this season, Matthijs de Ligt, and two other potential starters in Harry Maguire and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "Lisandro Martinez made another cameo off the bench but looked understandably rusty after returning from a knee injury that kept him out since February.",
      "With the defensive issues highlighted, it is also important to focus on an area which was of utmost urgency to improve from last season: scoring goals.",
      "Last season, United were among the division's lowest scorers and, of course, spent hundreds of millions of pounds to address that through signing Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "But even with that added fire power the new front three have started just three Premier League games together due to untimely injuries to Cunha and Sesko.",
      "All things considered, if had you said at this point United would find themselves sixth, two points off a top four spot and the second-highest scorers in the division, you would have thought not is all bad for a team still working itself out.",
      "Despite positives about what could be going forward, I also cannot help but have a feeling of frustration for Amorim.",
      "Not that he needs empathy after the Bournemouth performance or result, not because he showed he can be flexible in his tactical system when often accused of the opposite, and certainly not because United were the better team but once again failed to see out a lead.",
      "I feel frustration for Amorim because just as we have finally seen his side put on their best attacking and entertaining home performance of his reign, other than maybe against Brighton this season, he now waves off two of his star attacking players, Mbeumo and Amad Diallo, as they depart for AFCON.",
      "Neither we nor Amorim will see a United team with that pace or threat of attack again for at least a month, until both players return.",
      "Amorim will welcome Sesko's return to the matchday squad and he could easily slot into Mbeumo's position alongside Cunha, but he has a huge dilemma on how to balance the right-hand side, which looked so effective against Bournemouth with the pace and combination play of Mbeumo and Amad.",
      "How does he fill that hole? There is no straightforward answer.",
      "The immediate thought is that if Yoro continues at right back, Diogo Dalot may be the most natural to slot in ahead of him as a makeshift winger with Patrick Dorgu on the left of defence - but United have often looked blunt in attack when both have started this season.",
      "Potential solutions may present themselves, perhaps. Kobbie Mainoo could get more game time if Bruno Fernandes is shifted upfield, or he could perhaps even find himself on the right of a narrow diamond in midfield.",
      "Mainoo has yet to start a league game this season but did enjoy a 30-minute cameo against Bournemouth and could be in line to replace the suspended Casemiro against Aston Villa.",
      "The Brazilian's absence adds another headache, robbing Amorim of his midfield enforcer against such an in-form Villa side. There will also be a focus from fans about Amorim utilising Academy products.",
      "The likes of Shea Lacey and Jack Fletcher will more than likely find themselves on the bench in the coming weeks but is Amorim comfortable enough to turn to them? So far, the answer has been no.",

      "Between the Lines returns with a data-led look at the Premier League's game-changing players; Mohamed Salah's numbers are unmatched since 2010/11 but Bruno Fernandes has made the biggest contribution to his team this season",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and David Fraser",
      "Wednesday 17 December 2025 15:56, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes showed his importance to Manchester United yet again as he produced a goal and assist during a man-of-the-match performance in their 4-4 draw with Bournemouth.",
      "In an interview published after the game, he then accused the club's hierarchy of trying to cash in on him during the summer, saying the episode had left him \"hurt\" and \"sad\".",
      "But just how vital is he to Man Utd? And where does he rank among the Premier League's biggest game-changers?",
      "Between the Lines reveals which players' goals and assists have won their clubs the most points, both this season and historically - and Fernandes and Mohamed Salah, another player under the microscope lately, feature prominently.",
      "Fernandes comes out top for this season as he continues to show his value even in another tough campaign for Manchester United.",
      "His four goals and six assists have won Ruben Amorim's side a whopping 14 points.",
      "The Bournemouth game was the latest example, with his goal involvements proving the difference between a loss and a draw. He won Manchester United two and three points respectively in their recent wins over Wolves and Crystal Palace too.",
      "As shown in the graphic below, Fernandes has made result-altering goal involvements in eight Premier League games this season.",
      "Morgan Rogers sits second in the list with goal involvements worth 12 points to third-placed Aston Villa, a total which includes the three points won by his double against West Ham on Sunday.",
      "The England international has only contributed a combined eight goals and assists for Unai Emery's side in the Premier League but, with the exception of his assist in the 3-1 win over Fulham in September, all of them have been game-altering.",
      "His total puts him two points ahead of Erling Haaland. The Manchester City striker has nearly twice as many goal involvements as any other Premier League player this season, with 17 goals and three assists, but only seven have directly changed results.",
      "Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo is tied with Haaland on 10 points won after his goal helped Bournemouth grab a point at Old Trafford on Monday, with Everton's Jack Grealish and Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike next on nine.",
      "Another way to measure player influence is to look at whose goal involvements have earned the highest proportion of their team's points. Again, it's Fernandes who sits top of the pile this season.",
      "The 31-year-old's goals and assists have won more than half of Manchester United's 26 points after 16 games.",
      "Semenyo is second, while Brentford striker Igor Thiago ranks third, his 11 goals having won 40 per cent of the side's 20 points.",
      "Grealish is just behind him on 38 per cent, with all of his six goal involvements this season having directly impacted Everton's results.",
      "Rogers, Ekitike, Newcastle's Bruno Guimaraes, Sunderland's Granit Xhaka, West Ham's Callum Wilson and Brighton striker Danny Welbeck make up the rest of the top 10.",
      "So, Fernandes leads the way this season, but when factoring previous seasons, going back as far as 2010/11, it's Salah who comes out on top as the Premier League's biggest game-changer, despite his much-discussed recent dip in form.",
      "Salah's 280 Premier League goal involvements have been worth 177 points, putting him just ahead of Harry Kane on 173 points and highlighting the size of his contribution to Liverpool following his short spell at Chelsea earlier in his career.",
      "Former Leicester striker Jamie Vardy has the third-highest total for points won by goal involvements, with 127, while Kane's former Spurs team-mate Heung-Min Son is fourth on 106 and Manchester City legend Sergio Aguero is fifth on 104.",
      "Salah, in addition to having the highest total, boasts the highest percentage of a team's points won by goal involvements in a single season since 2010/11, with his 45.2 per cent last term just ahead of Robin van Persie's 42.7 per cent for Manchester United in 2012/13.",
      "Salah's output has of course dipped this season. He only has four goals and three assists in 14 Premier League appearances so far.",
      "But it is worth noting, as shown below, that those goal involvements have still won 23 per cent of Liverpool's points total, a higher proportion than in three of his previous campaigns at the club.",
      "So was he right to suggest he has been unfairly singled out during a difficult campaign for everyone at the club? The numbers suggest he has still made a useful contribution.",
      "But nobody can match that of Fernandes this season.",
      "Ninety-three injuries in 18 months? We dissected Arsenal's continued injury issues in last week's edition and the knock-on effects of losing players in the same positions.",

      "Wednesday 17 December 2025 08:39, UK",
      "Bruno Fernandes has claimed Manchester United bosses wanted to cash in on him in the summer but lacked the courage to defy Ruben Amorim.",
      "The United captain, who could have joined Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal for £100m, said he was \"hurt\" and \"sad\" about how the situation had been handled in an interview with Portuguese TV station Canal 11.",
      "Fernandes said in October that United's hierarchy told him they would not stand in his way if he wished to leave but that they wanted to keep him.",
      "However, the 31-year-old, who has a contract until 2027 with the option of a further year, struck a very different tone in this interview which was recorded in November.",
      "\"I decided not to go [to Saudi Arabia], not only for family reasons, but because I genuinely liked the club,\" Fernandes said.",
      "\"From the club I felt, 'if you go it's not that bad for us'. It hurts me a bit. More than hurting, makes me sad, I'm a player who has nothing to point to, I'm always available, I always give the best of me.\"",
      "\"Jason [Wilcox], like Omar [Berrada], said 'we won't say no but we want you to stay at the club. If you want to go, we won't say that it's not the offer for us because obviously it's massive money'.\"",
      "Amorim publicly said in the summer when Fernandes was weighing up his future that he hoped the midfielder would stay.",
      "Fernandes believes there was an unwillingness from those above Amorim to challenge the head coach.",
      "\"The club wanted me to go [away],\" Fernandes added.",
      "\"I told the directors that, I don't think they had the courage to make that decision because the coach wanted me. But if I said I wanted to leave, even though the coach wanted me to stay, the club would let me.\"",
      "\"Al Hilal are not guaranteed to make another move for Bruno Fernandes next summer, especially because the club is about to be bought by billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.",

      "\"Prince Alwaleed's takeover, which could value the club at up to 2 billion Saudi Riyals [£397.2m], would see one of Saudi Arabia's biggest clubs being privately owned for the first time.",
      "\"Al Hilal are expected to spend big under new ownership in the summer but Fernandes will be 32 in September and Saudi clubs have been targeting younger players.\"",
      "Fernandes has been United's best player in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but the offer of £100m for a player turning 31 was viewed by many as too good to turn down.",
      "The Portugal international was frustrated that he perceived this to be the view from within the club after he had stuck with United through so many lows despite having the chance to win silverware elsewhere.",
      "Fernandes also revealed he could have left to join another club the season before Saudi came in for him.",
      "\"I was valued, what values me most has to be my club, although I feel, lately, that I'm a little on the tightrope. Because in England a player reaches 30 and they think he has to remodel.",
      "\"The issue of loyalty is not as well-regarded as it used to be. I could have left in this market, I was going to earn a lot more money, a season ago I was going to leave, I was going to win many trophies this season.\"",

      "By Lyall Thomas & Rob Dorsett",
      "Tuesday 16 December 2025 15:16, UK",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are firmly in the race to sign Antoine Semenyo from Bournemouth.",
      "Semenyo, who scored at Old Trafford in Monday night's thrilling 4-4 draw against United, has a £65m release clause in his contract which becomes active on January 1 and the forward is attracting interest from a number of top Premier League clubs.",
      "City are keeping close tabs on developments with the 25-year-old, with Tottenham also keen - and some insiders believe Pep Guardiola's side are now the strongest contenders for his signature.",
      "United are considered serious rivals for both City and Spurs, however, with Liverpool believed to still be in the background. Ruben Amorim described Semenyo as a \"special player\" ahead of the game against Bournemouth.",
      "United have not been actively looking to sign another forward in January but believe the opportunity to sign Semenyo - which will come next month and for a set price - is something they must genuinely consider.",
      "The biggest obstacle for United is financial, though. While they are not currently at risk of breaching the PSR regulations, a £65m fee could have serious repercussions on what they can afford to spend in the summer, where a defensive-midfielder is the absolute priority.",
      "They are reluctant to get involved in a bidding war for Semenyo with some of the biggest clubs in the Premier League and will not jeopardise their ability to strengthen the midfield next summer in favour of another attacker.",
      "Arsenal have kept an eye on Semenyo's development but - as it stands - they are well stocked in the forward areas and have five players who can play wide-left.",
      "Despite the speculation over his future, Semenyo's inner circle insist he remains exclusively focused on training, fitness and match performance for Bournemouth.",
      "The south-coast club hope to keep the Ghana international, whose country will not be at the upcoming AFCON but will face England at next year's World Cup.",
      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim described Semenyo as a \"special player\" unprompted in his press conference ahead of Monday's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It is a top team, top manager with a special player,\" Amorim said of Bournemouth, without clarifying which player he was referring to.",
      "Asked if his comment was about Semenyo, he added: \"Yes.\"",
      "Pressed on if he would like to sign the winger, Amorim said: \"It is not that case. There are a lot of special players in the league.",
      "\"What I feel is that [Bournemouth have] a top manager, top team - I really like the team - and a top play, I think he is a special player.\"",
      "United held strong interest in Semenyo over the summer but ended up signing Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha for the forward positions.",
      "Semenyo scored at Old Trafford on Monday night after United's opener to equalise for Bournemouth. It was not the first time he has been among the goal against Amorim's side.",

      "In a riveting, rollercoaster contest, that Jamie Carragher subsequently hailed as \"the best game of the Premier League season so far\":",
      "Amorim has staunchly defended his 3-4-3 system, but looked to be playing a tweaked or even entirely altered formation from kick-off. And the middle of the second half, he had thrown caution to the wind and gone for a 4-2-4.",
      "The changes certainly worked with Manchester United dominant in the first half and making a deserved breakthrough in the 13th minute when Amad Diallo nodded home on his final appearance before the Africa Cup of Nations.",
      "But their good play going forward was undone when Luke Shaw was too easily barged out of the way, allowing Antoine Semenyo to power forward. He then swept home, with the goal coming against the run of play.",
      "Deservedly though, Casemiro nodded Manchester United back in front on the stroke of half-time from a corner - the hosts' seventh from the set piece this season, with only Arsenal (9) scoring more.",
      "But just seven minutes after the break, the Red Devils somehow found themselves 3-2 behind. Bournemouth equalised with a brilliant finish from Evanilson 38 seconds into the second half, before Marcus Tavernier curled a wonderful free-kick into the bottom left corner.",
      "Then it was Manchester United's turn to score two quick goals to restore their lead as the pendulum swung back the other way. Bruno Fernandes scored a wonderful free-kick to level, before Cunha turned home inside a packed box as the ball fell kindly his way.",
      "But the drama wasn't over yet.",
      "Bournemouth hit back again to round off an incredible eight-goal thriller. Eli Junior Kroupi - just on as a substitute - added to the raft of high-quality goals as he squeezed through the central defenders before arrowing home his effort.",
      "The result moves Manchester United into sixth place on 26 points - level with Crystal Palace, Liverpool and Sunderland. Bournemouth are nudged up into 13th spot.",
      "\"We have just seen the best game of the Premier League season so far. That's what makes the Premier League the greatest league, the greatest product or whatever you want to call it, in the world.\"",
      "\"I think it's the best I've seen Manchester United play, certainly in the first half, under Amorim, maybe going back to the first game of the season with Arsenal.",
      "\"Manchester United were fantastic in those first 25 to 30 minutes. It was almost a throwback to Sir Alex Ferguson - fast, attacking football, people being energetic, making runs forward, being positive, being on the front foot, winning the ball back early. There was lots of that.",
      "\"Bournemouth were not at the races in the first half but they were fantastic in the second half.\"",
      "\"A fun game. We started really well, did a very good first half. The result should be completely different.",
      "\"We lost the concentration and they scored two goals. But we managed to get back to the game, we scored two goals again and then we have to finish the game.",
      "\"We need to think about not to go again, but to take calm and to close the game. A lot of good things, but a lot of things to work.",
      "\"We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five. It's the details that we need to work, understand the momentum of the game. You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.",
      "\"We need to focus on the performance today, different from the last two at home. That is also a point that we pay attention to. The result is the same and at one point, it's frustrating, but the performance is different.\"",
      "\"It had everything. Moments where you think it's a loss, moments where you think we have this one, we are comfortable.",
      "\"Even at the end, at the last minute, two clear chances, and I was thinking, 'maybe win this one'. It's just a point, it's not a lot in the standings, but I think we can take good and bad things from today.",
      "\"We are two teams that play quite aggressively, quite open and probably today we attacked much better than we defended. The second goal is a cheap goal, a cheap one for us to concede. The corner is not even a great header.",
      "\"We finished really well the first half. When we scored the 1-1 we were feeling comfortable and were finishing the half much better. That's why the goal we conceded just from the corner has hurt me because we were in a good moment.",
      "\"You didn't even know if we were happy finishing the game, or give us one minute more.\"",

      "United and Bournemouth produced the game of the Premier League season so far, with Neville relieved by United's attacking intent despite their failure to secure three points.",
      "Speaking on his podcast, Neville said: \"It was a stunning watch. I was really critical after the Everton and West Ham games because of just the nature of the performance. I thought it was really bland.",
      "\"This was the complete and utter opposite. I can live with that all day long in terms of a performance and a standard because they played with real intent, played the ball forward, always played at full pace.",

      "\"The second half was absolute mayhem. There were big boos after the West Ham and Everton games but there weren't the big boos here after this game. There was disappointment but there were a lot of fans we've just seen who stayed in the stadium to clap the team because they can live with that.",
      "\"If you're a kid coming to United - my two girls have come tonight, and they'll be thrilled walking back. They won't be happy that United haven't won, but they'll have seen a great game of football and that's what you come to Old Trafford for.",
      "\"You come for entertainment. Of course you come to see your team win, and I get it, you've got to go and win games, win trophies, win titles and we could say it's not good enough in respect of what's happened, but I think getting the entertainment bit right, the performance and style right, is absolutely critical at this football club.",

      "Gary Neville hails mid-game tactical tweaks from Ruben Amorim as Man Utd manager shows more flexibility in draw with Bournemouth but says 'big problems' remain",
      "Tuesday 16 December 2025 08:35, UK",
      "Gary Neville said Ruben Amorim finally got his system \"spot on\" during Manchester United's thrilling 4-4 draw with Bournemouth on Monday Night Football - but the head coach was again left frustrated as he watched his side \"lose concentration\" to give up their lead three times at Old Trafford.",
      "And there appeared a new sense of fluidity not seen before by his United side to date.",
      "\"But Ruben Amorim has certainly done something different here tonight. Maybe it's Leny Yoro is coming over towards Antoine Semenyo.\"",
      "Later into the second half, with the hosts trailing 3-2, Amorim switched to a clear four-man defence with Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot as full-backs and Amad Diallo and Matheus Cunha either side of Bryan Mbeumo and substitute Benjamin Sesko in attack.",
      "\"We've been critical of Amorim for not having the right system and players on the pitch with the stubbornness for the system he plays, but in this period of the game, he's got it spot on,\" Neville said.",
      "\"The players you want on the pitch are there. Amad on the right, Mbeumo and Sesko up front, Cunha to the left, Mainoo and Fernandes as the midfield pair and then the back four.",
      "\"There's no excuses now.\"",
      "But for all their good play, United's continued inability to hold onto a lead saw them drop two more points through Eli Kroupi Jr's 84th-minute leveller, meaning they have let 10 points slip from winning positions this season - enough to put them joint top of the Premier League.",
      "\"We are not winning games sometimes in the details because it's a back four, back three, back five,\" rued Amorim. \"It's the details that we need to work, understand the momentum of the game.",
      "\"You need to be more clinical, because today against a very good team we create so many chances to win the game.\"",
      "Carragher was similarly unimpressed by Manchester United's defending but felt the quality of their attacking, particularly before half-time, was as good as he had seen from an Amorim side in the 59 games since he joined the club.",
      "\"It's the best I've seen Manchester United play, certainly in the first half, under Amorim,\" he said. \"They were fantastic, especially in that first 25 or 30 minutes.",
      "\"It was almost a throwback to Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, with Gary Neville playing. Fast attacking football, people being energetic, making runs forward, being positive, being on the front foot, winning the ball back early. There were lots of that.\"",
      "On the club's ongoing lack of clean sheets - of which Amorim now has the seventh-worst ratio in Premier League history - Carragher added: \"It's a big problem for them. They had problems at both ends of the pitch last season.",
      "\"We highlighted pre-match that they're improving in attack and we saw that again tonight. I thought the attacking players for Manchester United were fantastic.",
      "\"They had a lot of young defenders out there tonight that didn't help. I've been there, more often than not when you make a mistake as a young defender, it ends up in the back of your goal and that was the mistake tonight.",
