      "Paul Scholes has opened up on his family life, revealing that he gave up doing commentary work in order to spend more time with his autistic son. The Manchester United legend has taken a step back from media work so he can prioritise Aiden, who has special needs.",
      "Scholes is a hero at United, where he made over 700 appearances and won 25 trophies as a midfielder between 1993 and 2013. His exceptional playing career and one-club status with his boyhood team makes him an authoritative voice on United, yet he has decided to reduce the amount of work he does.",
      "He shares Aiden and two other children with his former wife Claire, and speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Scholes explained how he balances his work life with caring for his son.",
      "\"All the work I do now is just around his routines because he has quite a strict routine every single day,\" he said. \"I’m not with Claire anymore so we have him three nights each and Claire’s mum has him on a Friday night. We always do the same things with him as he doesn’t know what day of the week it is or time. But he’ll know from what we’re doing what day it is.",
      "\"I pick him up every Tuesday from his daycare and we go swimming. [He] loves swimming then we get his pizza on the way home. Thursday [I] pick him up, go for something to eat, go home. Sunday, I pick him up from Claire’s house and we go to Tesco where he buys a trolley full of chocolate. So, he doesn’t know what day or time it is, but he knows from what we’re doing what day it is. He’ll be 21 in December.”",
      "Scholes has posted about Aiden on Instagram and has been encouraged to share his story after receiving positive feedback from other parents how have autistic children.",
      "“Well, he’s non-verbal so he can’t speak,\" he said. \"When I say he can’t speak, I think he understands a lot more than we think. He has sounds but it’s only people that are close to him that will know what he’s saying. He has autism, but it’s like a really severe autism – because you can have it and go to school normally and such.",
      "\"I did it [sharing on social media] one or two times and I only showed the good bits, there’s obviously some that aren’t great. And it was just the response he had from people, you know parents, the amount of people saying 'god that helps, we’ve got a kid that’s the same' or something like that. That’s why I carried on doing it.",
      "He added: \"I will reply to people on Instagram, because it’s hard, especially when they’re young because there’s the harm and attacking people and I only put the nice stuff on. I do think about putting the stuff on when he’s not too happy when he might try and bite or scratch. But then I think it’s probably not the right thing to do.”",
      "Scholes used to come into training with United with scratches and bite marks on him. Aiden was diagnosed with autism at the age of two and a half and the midfielder initially didn't tell his team-mates or manager Sir Alex Ferguson what was going on at home, despite it affecting his performances.",
      "“We didn’t know what was in store for us,\" he said of the diagnosis. \"There’s some kids who don’t speak at one and a half, two years of age, then at five or six, bang they’re speaking they call it a late development stage. But we just knew it was never going to be like that.",
      "\"I didn’t speak to anyone at the club about it. Even now I don’t want sympathy or anything. I just thought even if I did speak to someone about it, it’s not going to help Aiden. I don’t know what would help me.",
      "\"The big concern now is because you’re getting a bit older, what happens when you’re not here? That’s the thing that’s now on my mind all the time. There are times when it’s not in your head, it’s like anything, then there’s times like now when you do start speaking about it, it’s at the front of your mind.”",
      "This week’s Stick to Football podcast with Paul Scholes is available now on YouTube and all leading podcast platforms",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "After a poor start to the season, manager Amorim was tipped to leave Old Trafford, but United seem to have turned things around. They have won their last three matches, including a 2-1 triumph over rivals Liverpool and are starting to see the influence of new summer signings.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha both found the back of the net last time out against Brighton and will be aiming to keep up such momentum when they face Forest. But soon Amorim will be without star forward Mbeumo, who only arrived this summer from Brentford for an initial £65million.",
      "Mbeumo has found his feet under Amorim and already has four league goals to his name. But just as he starts to gel with his new team-mates, the club could be without him for an extended period.",
      "United are all set to be without Mbeumo for at least two matches in late December as he heads to the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon. Mbeumo's country play three group stage games from December 24 to December 31. This means he will almost certainly be absent for clashes with Newcastle and Wolves.",
      "However, if his team progresses further in the competition, he could be away for much longer. The Round of 16 takes place from January 3 to 6. The quarter-finals are on January 9 and 10. The semi-finals take place on January 14 and the final is on January 18. A third-place playoff is also scheduled for January 17.",
      "In this time, United play Leeds United, Burnley and a derby against Manchester City, which is currently scheduled for January 17 but is subject to change. They will also play an FA Cup third-round tie on the weekend beginning January 10. Mbeumo could miss all of these should his side reach the final.",
      "Another new signing who is still settling down in Manchester is Benjamin Sesko. The 22-year-old striker cost £74m from RB Leipzig this summer and has bagged just two goals so far. Given his mediocre start, ex-United marksman Dimitar Berbatov has issued some advice.",
      "\"Be confident in yourself,\" Berbatov said as he aimed a message at Sesko whilst speaking on the Rio Ferdinand presents YouTube channel. \"Be arrogant in a way that you demand the ball from your team-mates when you make the run.",
      "\"When you make a good run, if the ball doesn't come for you, say it or express it in a way that your team-mates will understand. That, 'I am here. I'm making the run for you. Respect my run. Not every time but try to see me and believe in what I can do with that run.'",
      "\"Sometimes be angry. Scream, swear at him, whatever. [It's] not personal. Half-time, before and after the game, speak. Sometimes I think the players need to be more aggressive and emotional, in a way like, 'Pass me the damn ball, man!'\"",
      "Amorim made it clear that Marcus Rashford wasn't in his plans at United almost immediately, and after being shipped out to Aston Villa in January, he joined Barcelona on another temporary deal this summer.",
      "In Spain, Rashford has been starting and performing well. There are no guarantees that he will return to Old Trafford, but if he does United legend Bryan Robson insists he will have to work on his attitude.",
      "\"Marcus is a great talent and everything, but I do think his attitude's got to change if he does come back to United,\" Robson told Grosvenor Casinos. \"Barcelona is different because we always know that Barcelona and Real Madrid are going to be dominant in their league.",
      "\"He will improve and he will start enjoying his football a little bit better if he were to come back to United. I can't believe that people say that he's enjoying the two clubs that he left us for and that you can't enjoy your football at Man United. That seems crazy to me.\"",

      "Each of these wins showcased different strengths, with their latest 4-2 triumph over Brighton highlighting the attacking prowess they've added to their ranks this summer. Bryan Mbeumo netted twice, with one goal set up by Benjamin Sesko, after Matheus Cunha had given them the lead.",
      "Casemiro was another standout performer for United, scoring a deflected goal that flew past Bart Verbruggen, while also providing an assist.",
      "The Brazilian international was also particularly impressive against reigning Premier League champions Liverpool, clearly thriving on playing just once a week.",
      "However, Amorim may soon have to plan for a United match without Casemiro, and not due to injury. The midfielder is already on three yellow cards, and two more before United's 20th league game will result in a one-match ban.",
      "Another potential suspension worry for what could have been as early as this weekend's clash against Nottingham Forest at the City Ground also emerged in the win over Brighton. For Danny Welbeck's superb free-kick to bring Brighton back into the game, Patrick Dorgu had fouled Yankuba Minteh as he was making a break for goal.",
      "The Denmark international was only shown a yellow card as it was deemed that Minteh's heavy touch meant it was not the denial of a clear and obvious goal-scoring opportunity.",
      "However, it was his third caution of the campaign already which puts him in the same suspension predicament as Casemiro.",
      "Amorim has favoured Diogo Dalot at left wing-back over Dorgu when deploying Amad on the opposite flank, but he has still been booked three times despite not starting any of United's last three league games.",
      "In terms of potential replacements for Casemiro, both Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo can be used alongside Bruno Fernandes, though Amorim would certainly prefer to have Casemiro available given his impact in recent weeks.",
      "If one of Dorgu or Casemiro picks up that fourth yellow card over the next few weeks, Amorim could be facing some big dilemmas.",
      "It is unlikely to come into his thinking but it is possible the United boss may not deploy Casemiro at home to Bournemouth in December on Monday evening as he would be suspended for the challenging trip to Aston Villa later that week.",

      "Former Manchester United striker Louis Saha believes Ruben Amorim has adapted his football to cater for Benjamin Sesko's strengths. United snapped up Sesko from Bundesliga outfit RB Leipzig for a fee that could reach £73.7million.",
      "The Red Devils pipped Newcastle United to Sesko's signature, with Arsenal also keen on the striker before choosing to land Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting instead. The Slovenian forward suffered a sluggish beginning to his Old Trafford career, failing to find the net in his opening six outings.",
      "However, Sesko, 22, went on to open his account against Brentford in September, before netting in the 2-0 home victory over Sunderland. He then registered his maiden assist for United during Saturday's thrilling 4-2 triumph over Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "That victory against Fabian Hurzeler's side marked a third consecutive win for the Red Devils, who now occupy a European qualification spot after nine matches. Sesko's Premier League arrival came at the cost of Rasmus Hojlund, who endured difficulties at United before departing to join Napoli shortly afterwards.",
      "Now, Saha, who netted 42 times in a Red Devils jersey, has voiced his opinion on how the club have altered their strategy with some of their stars following previous disappointments. Speaking to Betvictor, the Frenchman said: \"What I really like is that we're not making the same mistake we've made with Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "\"They were starting games with a certain status and had an immense responsibility to score. They need to be introduced game by game, understanding the principles, and if they don't perform, they'll be benched.",
      "\"Some of these moments are difficult to manage, while others are good. This will also apply to other players like Kobbie Mainoo or Mason Mount.",
      "\"No player deserves anything, and Benjamin Sesko is starting to understand that he will have to fight for his place. Every opportunity he gets off the bench, he has to perform as he did on the weekend.",
      "\"I think he did really well, he didn't score, but he did his job confidence-wise. He was tracking back, and one day it will be rewarded.",
      "\"This is the type of introduction that hasn't been done for maybe the last seven to eight years, which was a big mistake.\"",
      "Sesko's upcoming opportunity to find the net will come in Saturday's encounter at Nottingham Forest (3pm kick-off). Success at the City Ground would mark United's fourth straight triumph - something they haven't accomplished since February 2024.",
      "They ended the weekend in sixth position, level on points with fifth placed rivals Manchester City. United are also only one point behind fourth placed Sunderland and Tottenham Hotspur in third.",
      "The Red Devils have not finished in the top four since the 2022-23 season, when Erik ten Hag steered them to third in his debut campaign.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been advised that Kobbie Mainoo could prove crucial in getting the best out of Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United. The skipper has been deployed in a deeper midfield position since Amorim's arrival, which has led to fewer direct goal contributions.",
      "The Portugal star still notched 19 goals and 19 assists last term, with those figures made even more remarkable given United's woeful campaign. Though Fernandes has managed just three goal contributions so far this season, United have enjoyed a productive spell with their recent form looking particularly encouraging.",
      "Successive victories against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have materialised with Fernandes excelling alongside Casemiro. A subtle adjustment - from Amorim - has allowed the former to drift into more attacking positions with one of the three centre-backs pushing out more boldly during the press.",
      "Nevertheless, United icon Bryan Robson is keen to see Fernandes returned to his forward role and thinks Mainoo should then take his place in a midfield partnership with Casemiro. \"I think Bruno Fernandes himself loves the club and I think Bruno would like to stay and will stay,\" he confessed to Grovesnor Casinos.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo can play in that position - at a push. But for me, if I was a coach within Man Utd, then I would be trying to develop him so then he can play alongside Casemiro and then Bruno can go off and do what Bruno does brilliantly.",
      "\"There's still improvement in Mainoo, but I could see him being in the role where he can be a midfield player who can do both and have a bit more responsibility in the defending side of the game.\"",
      "Mainoo has found it tough to secure regular game-time in 2025, with the academy graduate missing out on a loan move during the summer transfer window's deadline day. Robson has, since then, outlined what he needs to do to reclaim his spot in the starting line-up.",
      "The United legend stated: \"The first year Kobbie Mainoo came into the squad and into the team, he had probably half a season where he'd played well. In the second season, he was outstanding. He's actually shown the qualities he's got.",
      "\"So for me, if he stays away from injuries and gets in the team and gets a run of games, I think he's only going to improve and be a great talent for United.",

      "Former Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley has been given the vote of confidence at Plymouth Argyle. Cleverley took the reins at League One Plymouth after being sacked by Watford in May, but results have been underwhelming so far.",
      "The Devon club fell just short of a great escape under Milon Muslic last season, finishing three points off safety. Muslic subsequently left for Schalke in the German second tier, and Cleverley is at risk of delivering a second successive relegation.",
      "The Pilgrims lost their first four games of the season before rallying under their new boss, but have picked up just one point from their last four games to sit 22nd of 24 teams in the third tier. However, chief executive Paul Berne insists Cleverley still has the backing of the higher-ups, though - as managers elsewhere have learned in the past - things can always change quickly in football.",
      "\"In the case of our Head Coach, let me be more explicit,\" Berne said after Tuesday's defeat at Mansfield, having argued recovery from \"an enormous period of instability\" will take time. \"We hired Tom as a young, bright, ambitious Head Coach who could come and be a big part of Argyle’s next phase.",
      "\"We are a quarter of the way into Tom’s first season with us. Whilst results have been disappointing, nothing has changed in terms of Tom being the right person for this club. We need to bring that stability throughout the club, and this comes from Head Coach downwards.\"",
      "Berne continued: \"We are confident that things will improve. We’ve had a number of circumstances which have hit us in recent weeks, resulting in key players being missing throughout the opening 14 league games. This was emphasised last night, with Tom unable to fill the substitutes bench, and nine players being unavailable for selection, with the vast majority considered first-team starters.",
      "\"These are not excuses, but facts, and are clearly not ideal circumstances for any Head Coach to deliver consistent, winning performances. But, we believe Tom has all the tools to still deliver this.",
      "\"Throughout all of this, the support of the Green Army has never wavered, with continued sell-out home crowds and incredible away backings. This support is never taken for granted by anyone at the football club, especially Tom, his staff and the players. We are One Argyle, and as history has proven, when we are united we can achieve special things. Let’s stick together. COYG.\"",
      "Plymouth named just six substitutes for their midweek trip to Mansfield, with goals from Will Evans and Jordan Bowery giving their opponents all three points. Ayman Benarous was the latest player to join the absentee list after picking up a freak injury in training, though team-mate Matthew Sorinola will be available to return for Saturday's FA Cup trip to Wycombe after serving a yellow card suspension.",
      "\"It's an action that he would have done tens of thousands of times opening his knee out a little bit to receive the ball and something's clicked in there which has caused a little bit of ligament damage,\" Cleverley said of Benarous. \"It's disappointing for him because after the last couple of performances and the way he's been training he would have featured a lot in a few games.\"",

      "Napoli are planning to test Manchester United's resolve over a deal for Kobbie Mainoo. The Italian giants are hoping to find more success from signing talent from Old Trafford following the boost Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund have offered in successive seasons.",
      "Antonio Conte's side won Serie A last season and lead the way this term, with McTominay winning MVP honours in his debut season. This year, Denmark star Hojlund has shown little trouble finding the net since his summer move and has bagged four goals in seven outings.",
      "Napoli appear to have found a winning formula by elevating frustrated United stars, and having expressed interest in Mainoo over the summer, the club's interest has not diminished. United prevented their midfield ace from leaving the club during the transfer market and Ruben Amorim is said to be unwilling to see him exit, even temporarily, in January.",
      "Mainoo has played just 138 minutes across seven Premier League appearances this term. The 20-year-old will hope for more playing time in a bid to reinvigorate his chance of making England's World Cup squad, two years on from a breakout season which saw a Euro 2024 call-up.",
      "According to reports in Italy, Napoli 'will try again' to land Mainoo. Their ambitions are sure to have increased amid their injury crisis.",
      "Kevin de Bruyne faces months out after suffering a muscle tear after scoring a penalty against Inter Milan. The 34-year-old has been a regular in the team since joining for free in the summer.",
      "Central midfielder Stanislav Lobotka is also out injured, with ex-Brighton and Chelsea ace Billy Gilmour deputising. And later this year, Conte will be without former Fulham star Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa when he heads to the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon.",
      "Bringing Mainoo to the club will certainly become increasingly appealing as the Serie A leaders look to plug the gaps in their side.",
      "Speaking earlier this season about Mainoo's situation, Amorim accepted he wanted to feature more. \"No, like a lot of guys, he wants to play more. I didn't have a conversation with him before the window closed – I did this week,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"Because I don't want Kobbie Mainoo thinking that I was having any conversation with him just to hold on to him. I don't want that feeling.",
      "\"I believe a lot in Kobbie, but some of you think that Kobbie Mainoo is already done (the finished article). I think he can do so much better, he can improve a lot.",

United have strung together three successive Premier League victories for the first time under the Portuguese manager and now sit sixth in the table after beating Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Since arriving at Old Trafford, Amorim has faced considerable scrutiny, with United enduring their poorest-ever top-flight campaign in 2024/25. The club invested heavily during the summer transfer window to strengthen Amorim's squad and there have been evident signs of progress in recent weeks.",
      "McCarthy, who served at the club under former United manager Erik ten Hag, told BestBettingSites.co.uk: \"Manchester United is a huge club, and I think everyone wants something to say about United because they know it will make big news. It will make headlines because of the magnitude of the club.",
      "\"You know, we felt that way inside the club. What we would do in response was to try to control everything in our power and accept people will talk about United.",
      "\"So as long as we could control that side of things, legends and ex-players will always talk, because they are not in the day-to-day setup of the club. That's how we just kind of filtered out all the noise that was coming from outside.",
      "\"We tried to work the best way that we could, and to make it as positive and enjoyable for everybody that was part of the club at that point in time. We can't control the noise from outside, and former players and legends, what they say, because it's a free country, everyone is entitled to their opinion.",
      "\"But we knew what we wanted to achieve and what we did while we were inside the club. So we weren't really bothered too much about the noise from the outside.",
      "\"But yeah, it does affect people, and it does get to people. When there's so many voices from outside and you're trying to build, to work on achieving something.",
      "\"Even now, when you watch Man United, everyone has something to say about Ruben Amorim. I'm glad that he's tough and he just blocks everything out. He works the way he wants to work.",
      "\"That's why he was brought to the club, because of what he's capable of, and the club is supporting him. Everybody else on the outside, let them talk, and he just continues to do his work and slowly but surely it's starting to pay off.\"",
      "McCarthy went on to discuss the pressures facing any United manager at Old Trafford, highlighting what he believes was Ten Hag's biggest obstacle at the club.",
      "\"I think the biggest challenge any manager faces is the magnitude of the club,\" he said. \"Manchester United is a massive club. I think every bit of news, whether we think it's irrelevant, is big news when it concerns Man United.",
      "\"The manager's job comes with a hell of a lot of pressure when you are the leader of Man United. So you gotta get it spot on from day one, from the day you walk in there. Any little rifts or problems get out.",
      "\"And it's not just gossip, it becomes massive news and it affects the players and then right up to the top of the management in the club. I think that was probably our biggest problem because I think the players were really phenomenal.",
      "\"There were bits and bobs here and there where some players wanted certain things that weren't according to what the manager wanted at the time. You have little misunderstandings or disagreements, but it was pretty harmonious and everyone worked really well.",
      "\"Then obviously there was just the odd outburst, which wasn't what was in the manager's plan. That was the biggest problem Erik ten Hag had at Man United.\"",

      "Nottingham Forest star Morgan Gibbs-White believes Ruben Amorim getting Manchester United closer to where they should be in recent weeks has been \"incredible to see\". Gibbs-White will be part of the Forest team tasked with ending United's winning run - currently standing at three games - when the Premier League resumes over the weekend.",
      "Gibbs-White was part of a squad which did the double over United last season, scoring in a 3-2 win at Old Trafford. Forest have changed managers twice since then, dismissing Nuno Espirito Santo and Ange Postecoglou, but United have kept faith with Amorim despite a challenging few months.",
      "Amorim's team have now started to seen an upturn in form, with home victories over Sunderland and Brighton sandwiching a statement win away at Liverpool. They sit just one point outside the top four ahead of Saturday's trip to the City Ground, and could end the weekend as high as second if results go their way.",
      "The improvement hasn't been lost on England international Gibbs-White. \"It’s been incredible to see, obviously they’ve been going through a tough time in the past couple of years,\" he told Stan Sport (via Goal).",
      "\"But they’ve stuck with the gaffer [Amorim] and the past four or five games, you’re really starting to see how Man United should be playing, that grit and that determination to want to play for the badge. I feel like it’s been incredible to see, it’s something I feel like the league has missed.\"",
      "Forest followed their 3-2 win away to United last term with a 1-0 home victory, while a Gibbs-White winner saw them beat the same opponents 2-1 in December 2023. A third straight home win in the fixture would be a welcome sight for a fanbase who haven't seen the team win in the league since August, and their playmaker knows they have to focus on doing their own jobs first and foremost.",
      "\"All we can do is focus on ourselves, we can’t focus on how Man United are doing and how their performances are because if we do that, we’re just almost bowing down to them,\" Gibbs-White said. \"We’ve got to focus on what we want to do and how we can win the game. I feel like this week we’ve already started to implement some ideas, and obviously we’ve still got a few more days until the game, so I’m sure the gaffer [Sean Dyche] will have more ideas of how we can beat them.\"",
      "Both Forest and United have had a midweek break after suffering early eliminations from the Carabao Cup. United were beaten on penalties by lower-league Grimsby Town while Forest threw away a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 away at Swansea City of the Championship.",
      "Amorim has confirmed Luke Shaw will be available despite only managing 65 minutes against Brighton last time out. “Luke Shaw is fine. He had a virus during the week. He struggled a little bit in the game, but he’s going to be ready for the next one,” he said.",

      "Patrice Evra has ruled himself out of returning to Juventus as a coach or a director in the wake of Igor Tudor being sacked by the club. The former Manchester United defender delivered a savage assessment on the current squad in Turin and called upon them to take responsibility.",
      "The Frenchman spent three years with Juve after leaving Old Trafford and made 82 appearances for the Italian giants. Evra has been retired since 2019 and spent a year as a free agent before coming to that decision, and is in no rush to return to the day-to-day life of football just yet.",
      "Luciano Spalletti is set to become the club's new head coach, months on from announcing his own sacking by Italy in a press conference. Juventus currently sit eighth in Serie A with 12 points from eight matches.",
      "Admitting he is too selfish to return to the frontline of football, Evra compared Juventus' situation to his own experience of seeing David Moyes getting sacked at Manchester United. By removing the manager, the players no longer have excuses, in his opinion, though the 44-year-old is not convinced they will respond.",
      "“Dear Juventini, I saw some messages from people saying they want me as a director or a coach, but I retired four years ago and won’t go back into football,\" Evra said on Instagram.",
      "\"This is because I would have to sacrifice everything for football, and I am enjoying myself too much right now. I am a happy man and therefore I will be selfish about it.",
      "“I just want to go back on the sacking of Tudor. Thank you coach for everything. This is a message for the players.",
      "“When they fire the coach, it means you haven’t done your job on the field. It only happened to me once in my whole career, when I was at Manchester United and they sacked David Moyes. I felt like s**t, and I hope the players right now at Juventus feel the same way, because they’ve gone through three or four coaches in a couple of years now.",
      "“You are at Juve, you have to take responsibility. The problem is this doesn’t work on the new generation, it is a soft generation. So all the commentators and pundits who are ex-players are wasting their time talking to them.",
      "“We were football players, we played for passion, for the shirt, for history, to put food in the mouths of our families. This generation are athletes more than players. They are brands, they are rappers, fashionistas, get involved in politics. There are too many distractions.",
      "“This is why I am not harsh on them, as we didn’t have those distractions. We would eat, sleep, play football, that’s it. The world has changed, not just football.",
      "“Juve have changed completely, we have lost the real values. I remember my first game with Andrea Agnelli, I was happy to see the history everywhere, we had Pavel Nedved, Platini, others.",
      "“One day I will return to football, but not now. I am just saying this because when you play for Juve, you have to sacrifice everything, including your family.",
      "“The best league I won in my whole life was with Max Allegri in 2014/15, I think we were 13th in the league, lost to Sassuolo, many players wanted to get rid of Max, but I saw the same thing at United when they tried to suggest Moyes was the only reason they were losing.",
      "“Remove the coach, now there is no excuse. If you don’t want to stay there at Juve, then leave. You are too soft.”",

      "Rhodri Giggs is set to remarry, 14 years on from his brother's crushing affair with his ex-wife. The 49-year-old has been dating Victoria Phillips for over a year now, and popped the big question earlier this month.",
      "He and his new beau went public with their engagement via Instagram earlier this week, with Victoria posting a photo of her sparkling ring while writing: \"18/10/2025.\" Rhodri, then quipped: \"Couldn't say yes quicker enough. Thank you everyone, I agree she is very lucky.\"",
      "The couple received plenty of loving messages after the announcement, including from Coronation Street star Andy Whyment, who wrote: \"Congratulations to you both.\"",
      "It's not the first time that Rhodri's love life has made headlines. Back in 2011, it was revealed that his brother, Ryan Giggs, had been having an affair with his wife at the time, Natasha. The affair, which dated back to 2003, caused a major rift in the Giggs family, and ultimately ended in Rhodri and Natasha divorcing.",
      "The affair was also conducted behind the back of Ryan's then-wife, Stacey, who later filed for divorce in 2017. Despite the infidelity, Rhodri has since gone on to make amends with his brother, even admitting that he profited from it.",
      "Replying to a social media user about the affair, Rhodri wrote, as per GB News, earlier this year: \"Mate, it was over 14 years ago and I've got two kids with someone else and made s*** load of money from it.\"",
      "He added: \"I buzz off it. It was 14 years ago and I made about £1million from it. Can't be on X and not expect a little bit of shrapnel coming your way. All part of the fun.\"",
      "Rhodri, who currently runs a podcast and works in recrutiment, gained noterierty when the affair came to light in 2011. Gigg's younger brother had also had a career in football in the lower leagues, representing the likes of Salford and FC United before moving into coaching and eventually stepping away from the sport.",
      "The news of Rhodri's engagement comes hot on the heels of Giggs' younger brother slamming the Premier League's decision not to include his brother in a shortlist of inductees into the Hall of Fame last month. Taking to social media, the Premier League wrote: \"Home of the greats. Two more players will be voted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2025...\"",
      "And after seeing Ryan's name absent from the list, Rhodri fired back with a compilation of Giggs' heroics with Manchester United, writing: \"13 Premier League medals and countless goals and the record number of Premier League assists. #TheShamHallOfFame.\"",
      "While Giggs didn't make the shortlist, a number of his former United team-mates did, including Patrice Evra, Teddy Sheringham, Michael Carrick, Nemanja Vidic, Edwin van der Sar and Michael Owen. Elsewhere, Sol Campbell, Jermain Defoe, Cesc Fabregas, Les Ferdinand, Robbie Fowler, Eden Hazard, David Silva and Yaya Toure completed the list.",
      "In the end, it was Neville and Hazard who made the cut for induction, with the Premier League sharing of the latter on Wednesday: \"Eden Hazard, this is where you belong. Welcome to the Premier League Hall of Fame.\"",

      "But McKenna should think long and hard about making a move north of the border, should Celtic decide to offer him the chance to replace Brendan Rodgers. Because McKenna has built an impressive reputation in English football, having led Ipswich Town to promotion from League One to the top flight.",
      "He had the courage to leave his coaching role at Manchester United, to seek a brave challenge elsewhere. And he made such an impression as Ipswich manager, some senior figures at United even discussed the possibility of recalling McKenna as manager, when Erik ten Hag was struggling to survive.",
      "While during his time at United, a certain Jose Mourinho demanded McKenna took his training sessions. But Portman Road is a different world to Celtic Park, and the footballing hotbed that is Glasgow. Winning is taken for granted. Failure is not an option.",
      "And it is clear right now, as Rodgers pointed out to his ultimate cost, that Celtic have an inferior squad to ones of the past.",
      "Celtic have opted for some welcome nostalgia, having appointed former boss Martin O'Neill on a caretaker basis. But it's positive results Celtic need, not a trip down memory lane. Storm clouds have hung over Celtic for a while, leading to a somewhat toxic atmosphere.",
      "The team has lost three of its last five games. Celtic might be second in the Scottish Premiership, but they still trail leaders Hearts by eight points.",
      "McKenna would be expected to overhaul Hearts. He would be expected to succeed in the Champions League next season. But what funds would he be given to strengthen his squad between now and the start of next season?",

He joined Aston Villa on-loan in the summer transfer window, but has not started a game yet. And he suffered the ultimate humiliation in last weekend's win over Manchester City, when he was sent on as a first half substitute, but hauled off again after the break.",

      "At the Catalan club, Rashford has netted five times and provided seven assists in 13 appearances across all competitions so far. And while the attacker is rediscovering his spark under Hansi Flick, it might spell trouble for the player when the campaign concludes.",
      "Should Rashford make his way back to Old Trafford, there's no certainty he would earn a spot in Amorim's first team, despite enhanced displays on Spanish soil. But United icon Robson believes a change in his mentality would significantly help him reclaim his position with his childhood club.",
      "Speaking to Grosvenor Casinos, Robson said: \"The thing is for me, Marcus lost his focus. Commentators annoy me a wee bit where they say that Marcus is enjoying his football and they were saying that at Villa. Well, when you look at it, he didn't do that well at Villa because he didn't score that many goals.",
      "\"Marcus is a great talent and everything, but I do think his attitude's got to change if he does come back to United. Barcelona is different because we always know that Barcelona and Real Madrid are going to be dominant in their league.",
      "\"So for a player like Marcus playing with the top players like Barcelona have, he will improve and he will start enjoying his football a little bit better if he were to come back to United.",
      "\"I can't believe that people say that he's enjoying the two clubs that he left us for and that you can't enjoy your football at Man United. That seems crazy to me.\"",

      "\"Mainly because of his attitude. His attitude towards Man United towards the end was disgraceful. The amount of times I saw him walking because he wanted to leave...His whole demeanour about him was a disgrace. I think he quit on Man Utd.",

      "He was instrumental in securing victory for the Italian heavyweights against Lecce on Tuesday night, coming off the bench to bag three huge points in the title race. Within moments of McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund coming on, André-Frank Zambo Anguissa finally broke the deadlock for Napoli.",
      "Although the Scotsman wasn't directly involved in the goal, his presence undoubtedly altered the game's dynamics. McTominay, who had an outstanding season last term, had found it challenging to replicate that impact this season but is now finding his form again.",
      "Anguissa is also making a splash in Italy, netting the match's only goal in the 69th minute after connecting with a superb cross from David Neres, heading the ball past Wladimiro Falcone. Napoli are now three points ahead of AC Milan in Serie A as they aim to retain their title as champions of Italy.",
      "Speaking to DAZN after the game, Conte downplayed Gli Azzurri's promising start to the campaign. The former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur boss dismissed claims that they're benefitting from injuries to Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne as 'completely absurd'.",
      "\"All we've got in goal now is [Vanja] Milinkovic-Savic, but some over the summer were asking why we had invested so much in a quality goalkeeper. [Noah] Lang had two knocks in the same spot, so I think his muscle hardened. It is not a serious problem.",

      "Conte singled out Anguissa, who sits second in the league's scoring charts, whilst showering his squad with praise for their attitude. The Napoli boss said: \"These games are never easy, especially after a match like the one with Inter that used up so much energy.",
      "Fanatics has slashed up to 60% off football kits and merch. Until Sunday, fans can find discounts on products from Premier League clubs including Man United, Man City, Liverpool, Everton, Arsenal, Spurs and more.",
      "\"We played against a very good team. It is always tough to play here in Lecce. I think we should've controlled the final stages better, even if we didn't run many big risks - mentality is first and foremost.",
      "\"It was a very good first half, then this penalty could've changed the course of the game, but our goalkeeper did well and we went on to deserve the victory. I am very happy for Frank.",
      "\"If he's constantly switched on, then there are few players like him, but he still needs to improve his finishing. We need to score goals from everyone. It doesn't matter if they are strikers, midfielders or defenders.\"",
      "McTominay has made 11 appearances this season, netting four times, with his most important goal coming against Inter Milan just last weekend. The Scottish international doubled the lead for his team against the Nerazzurri, slotting home a perfectly timed half-volley.",
      "Following the match, McTominay commemorated the moment with a celebratory Instagram post, which rapidly surpassed 150,000 likes. Among the thousands of comments from fans, Bruno Fernandes left a classy message.",
      "\"Pazzesco [love heart eye emoji],\" wrote the United skipper, which translates to 'crazy' in English. McTominay will be aiming to maintain his 'crazy' form when Napoli face off against Como on Saturday afternoon.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly refusing to let Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee leave due to the potential impact of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) on their squad. Meanwhile, Jadon Sancho is expected to complete his loan spell at Aston Villa, with no break clause included in the deal from Old Trafford.",
      "Ruben Amorim is enjoying his best spell since taking charge, with three consecutive league victories. Wins against Sunderland, arch-rivals Liverpool and Brighton & Hove Albion have put United just a point shy of the Champions League spots as November begins, with an opportunity to strengthen their European credentials against struggling Nottingham Forest this weekend.",
      "The summer signings of Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo have significantly improved United's attacking prowess compared to last season. The Cameroonian international has scored three goals in two matches, Sesko found the net twice before the international break, and Cunha opened his account during the 4-2 victory over Brighton.",
      "However, United have been dealing with ongoing speculation about the futures of fringe players Zirkzee and Mainoo. Both have been linked with moves away from Old Trafford, with clubs such as West Ham United, Sevilla and Napoli reportedly interested.",
      "However, due to their players' participation in the upcoming AFCON, United bosses face some crucial decisions. One of these, as reported by the Daily Mail, is that Sancho won't be making a return to the club owing to the absence of a break clause in their agreement with Villa.",
      "Such a clause would have permitted United to recall him when the opportunity arose, much like with Sergio Reguillon when he departed the club mid-season on loan. However, other reports suggest that United will prevent exits for Zirkzee and Mainoo due to the squad's involvement in the tournament, which takes place from late December to early January in Morocco.",
      "Mbeumo is expected to join his Cameroon teammates, while Amad could receive a call-up for Ivory Coast. Consequently, it's been suggested that the January departures have been halted to avoid leaving the team short-staffed during a busy period.",
      "Amorim is set to face a selection dilemma during this time, with both players likely to miss consecutive home games against Newcastle and Wolves on 27th and 30th December respectively. Also included in their fixture list are matches against Bournemouth, Aston Villa, Leeds United, Burnley and Manchester City, along with the FA Cup third round at the start of the new year.",
      "Sancho, on the other hand, has had a challenging start to his loan spell at Villa Park. This weekend, he was brought on as a substitute in the first half, only to be taken off towards the end of their 1-0 victory over Manchester City.",
      "The 25 year old has struggled to make an impact at Unai Emery's side, managing only five appearances in all competitions, including just two Premier League games. It's now been suggested that he'll be staying put in the Midlands as there was no recall clause included in their loan agreement.",

      "Casemiro’s time at Manchester United has been a rollercoaster journey – and there is no doubt that the Brazilian is currently on the up. The experienced midfielder has been key to United’s three straight wins, starting alongside captain Bruno Fernandes in the middle of the park – and his influence extends well beyond the pitch.",
      "Casemiro has allayed fears about his lack of mobility to re-establish himself as the dependable presence in midfield that United thought they were signing for £70million in the summer of 2022. The 33-year-old’s sky-high £350,000-a-week wages have often been used as a stick with which to beat him, but he has managed to turn the tide through his performances.",
      "It is quite the turnaround for a player who looked surplus to requirements in the summer and was constantly linked with a move to Saudi Arabia. Rather than go and make even more money in the Middle East, Casemiro made it clear that he wanted to stay at Old Trafford and fight for his place in Amorim’s side.",
      "He has done just that, starting all but one of United’s Premier League matches this season while helping to solve Amorim’s biggest issue of the 2024/25 campaign. The Portuguese coach’s insistence on playing a 3-4-3 system created problems last season, with United’s two-man midfield constantly exposed.",
      "Yet Casemiro’s upturn in form has helped ease those fears, with £50m signing Manuel Ugarte and academy graduate Kobbie Mainoo stuck on the bench. Asked about his performances after Saturday's 4-2 win over Brighton, Amorim said: “I think he gives a lot of experience. He's an example for everyone.",
      "“In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby [Collyer], but he fought and he worked, and now he's back in the national team. He's so important for us.”",
      "As you would hope from such an experienced player, who won five Champions League titles and numerous other trophies with Real Madrid, Casemiro is sharing his wisdom in the United dressing room. There have previously been suggestions that his English is limited, but that is no longer the case.",
      "The i says he’s called “Uncle Cas” by his team-mates, has formed a close bond with Matheus Cunha and takes it upon himself to speak to the younger players after training sessions, rather than just sticking to the Portuguese speakers. The fact he is willing to contribute so positively in the final year of his contract speaks volumes.",
      "Former United defender Rio Ferdinand has been particularly impressed, especially given Casemiro’s sidelining last season. Speaking about Amorim’s treatment of him, the ex-United star said on Rio Ferdinand Presents : \"That could have absolutely humiliated him, and it would have. Football players are intelligent in a football environment.",
      "\"They all smell where they are in the pecking order. So if Amorim's telling you that, every player in that squad would have known Casemiro is at the back of their pack, Toby's being called upon before him.",
      "\"Do you know how embarrassing that would have been for Casemiro? But for him to roll his sleeves up and say: 'ain't happening, you all know I'm better than him, you all know I'm the best holding midfielder at the club. Watch this space’.”",
      "Casemiro’s deal expires on June 30, but United have the option to extend it by 12 months. The idea they would do so appeared preposterous earlier this year. Now you wouldn’t bet against it.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Dimitar Berbatov has told Benjamin Sesko to get nasty if he wants to start scoring goals regularly at Manchester United - insisting he needs to be more demanding about the service he's receiving.",
      "The Slovenian was the club's most expensive summer signing, joining from RB Leipzig for £74million, but has endured a mixed start to life at Old Trafford. He is playing in a team that struggled in the opening weeks of the season, which didn't help his cause.",
      "Sesko's goal return has been a concern though with the 22-year-old only scoring twice in 10 outings thus far. His first strike came in the loss at Brentford before he notched against Sunderland the following week.",
      "More was expected though of the frontman, who has been hailed among the best young strikers in Europe, and Berbatov believes he needs to be more aggressive when it comes to demanding the ball.",
      "The Bulgarian was a Golden Boot winner during his time in Manchester and claims Sesko doesn't need to be \"polite and best friends and buddies\" with his team-mates if he's not getting the ball in scoring positions.",
      "Berbatov issued his advice to the Slovenian when asked on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast: \"Be confident in yourself. Be arrogant in a way that you demand the ball from your team-mates when you make the run - and when you make a good run, if the ball doesn’t come for you, say it or express it in a way that your teammates will understand that, ‘I am here. I’m making the run for you. Respect my run. Not every time but try to see me and believe in what I can do with that run’.",
      "\"Sometimes be angry. Scream, swear at him, whatever. [It’s] not personal. Just in a way that I’m here, man. That’s why I’m here. Just give me the ball. Pass to me. I will try to score for you.",
      "\"Half-time, before and after the game, speak. Sometimes I think the players need to be more aggressive and emotional, in a way like, ‘Pass me the damn ball, man!\"",
      "United have trusted Sesko to lead their line after seeing several of their former strikers struggle to deal with the expectation. Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee both found it difficult to deliver last term, forcing United into the market.",
      "Ruben Amorim has eased Sesko into the fold, often leaving him on the bench and introducing him in the second-half, and he's confident the striker will come good.",

      "McCarthy reckons the magnitude of United overwhelmed Ten Hag in the end. And the former South Africa and Blackburn striker believes Amorim has to turn a deaf ear to all the noise around him, and continue to believe in himself.",
      "He said: \"I think the biggest challenge any manager faces is the magnitude of the club. Manchester United is a massive club. I think every bit of news, whether we think it's irrelevant, is big news when it concerns United. The manager’s job comes with a hell of a lot of pressure when you are the leader of United.\"",

Dorgu, whom Ruben Amorim signed from Lecce for £25m at the start of the year, made minimal contact with the ball, with the follow-through catching his opponent late on the top of the shin.",
      "England initially brandished a yellow card, but the Video Assistant Referee advised him to review the incident on the pitch-side monitor. Following a quick check, the decision was overturned, and Dorgu was given his marching orders.",
      "The former PGMOL chief and ex-FIFA referee said: \"The red card issued by Darren England is correct, this is a challenge with excessive force, that endangers the safety of his opponent.",

      "Manchester United will not have been surprised to see reports that Joshua Zirkzee wants to leave the club in the January transfer window.",
      "MEN Sport understands Zirkzee is anxious for more playing time ahead of the World Cup, and his concerns are justified. The Dutchman featured at Euro 2024 but has not been called up for the Netherlands since November last year.",
      "For his club, Zirkzee has yet to start this season, and his cameo against Brighton did little to change that status. The 24-year-old lost his marker for the away side's second of the game and was largely anonymous spearheading the attack.",
      "It is clear the forward is not in Ruben Amorim's plans at the club. However, there is a consensus that United would not be willing to let him leave in January.",
      "The mid-season market is difficult for clubs wanting to sign replacements, and if Zirkzee were to leave, there is a theory that United would be short in cover. But there are three reasons which prove why the Reds should sanction the transfer.",
      "Firstly, United have a player coming through their ranks who could slip into the role of cover immediately. Chido Obi has earned praise since making the move to Old Trafford from Arsenal and was a back-up last season for United.",
      "This year, he has managed to continue his development in the academy and scored on Tuesday night in the young Reds' win against Rochdale's first-team. More exposure to the first-team environment at United will only be beneficial for the 17-year-old and it won't necessarily affect his game time for the academy either.",
      "And that is where the second reason comes in. Obi may not be called upon often thanks to the success of the strikerless system in recent weeks.",
      "Against Liverpool, Matheus Cunha leading the line with Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo behind him, caused Arne Slot's team multiple problems. If it had not been for Mount's knock, we may have seen these three feature together against Brighton.",
      "Clearly that system works and currently, this option is ahead of Zirkzee starting. The final reason in favour of sanctioning the transfer request would be to help Zirkzee.",
      "This is a player who struggled tremendously in his first season and was unfairly targeted during a disappointing loss to Newcastle over Christmas 2024. To his credit, he knuckled down and his performances since that day improved.",
      "Zirkzee is no longer part of the plans though and Amorim should do right by him and allow him to leave.",

      "However, Lacey is understood to be fine after the knock and has trained normally this week. The Liverpool-born lad is seen as a high-potential talent and United did not risk him to face Rochdale as a precaution.",
      "Lacey is pushing to make a first-team debut this season. The youngster has long been considered one of the best talents in the academy and has starred for the U21s during this campaign.",
      "Earlier this month, Lacey was drafted into England senior training by Thomas Tuchel to supplement the session. He was named in England's Under-20 squad for the October international break and was given the opportunity to train with the Three Lions' first-team at St. George's Park.",
      "\"He is in the same sort of area as Chido because of time lost. Different to Chido, Chido is fast progression. Because of time lost with Shea, he still has lots to come tactically, physically and mentally.",
      "\"Everybody can see - you have to be blind not to see - the talent he's got. He's got lots to do in his game and he knows. We're still managing him physically because if he can stay on the pitch and can train every day, I think everyone thinks he could be a top, top player.\"",
      "United consider Lacey as a first-team prospect and they were protective of his minutes last season, wanting to ensure that the youngster did not suffer further small injury problems.",
      "Lacey has generated immense interest in the last few years because followers of the academy are excited about his potential.",
      "There have been comparisons made between Lacey and Phil Foden and, just like the Manchester City star, Lacey's long-term future could be as an attacking midfielder.",
      "The youngster was born in Merseyside and comes from a family of Liverpool fans, but he's a United supporter and grew up idolising multi-Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi.",

      "While Amorim's 3-4-3 system relies on wing-backs who can provide an attacking threat, the United boss knows he can't afford to leave his backline exposed, and so he tends to choose a more attack-minded option on one side with the balance of a more defensive option on the opposite flank.",
      "Dalot has been his go-to defensive option in recent weeks, and while the team have been playing well, Dalot has struggled.",
      "The Portugal international doesn't provide enough quality in the final third when presented with a chance to get forward, and he's also struggled defensively at times. United's winning run has meant his performances have gone somewhat under the radar, and a change is needed before he costs United.",
      "A right-back by trade, it must be acknowledged that Dalot has often been playing out of position on the left, a position Noussair Mazraoui filled in at on multiple occasions last season.",
      "The former Bayern Munich defender has suffered a couple of knocks this term that have limited his playing time, but he has made the last two matchday squads without being introduced from the bench.",
      "He was one of United's most consistent performers in his first season at the club, and while he is unlikely to unpick defences with attacking guile, he will provide the defensive solidity United need, allowing Amad to provide the threat on the opposite side.",
      "Forest's fluid front three will be a test for United this weekend and so their defence need to be at their best.",
      "Amorim would be wise to make a change.",

      "Chido Obi nonchalantly celebrated after scoring against Rochdale on Tuesday night.",
      "Rochdale attempted to play out from the back, Jim Thwaites won the ball and Obi reacted quickly to finish intelligently in the box, firing Manchester United's Under-21s into an early lead.",
      "Obi didn't show any emotion as he glared at the home fans at the Crown Oil Arena. The youngster was all business because scoring academy goals is second nature to him. They are as often as hot dinners.",
      "There was a minute's silence held before the game after the passing of Rhys Bennett's father. The players wore black armbands as a mark of respect and Bennett watched from the terraces with his family.",
      "Bennett has been granted compassionate leave and United are offering pastoral care to the youngster.",
      "The U21s began their National League Cup campaign against Tamworth in August. That game was abandoned after a Sekou Kone head injury, and Travis Binnion's side lost against Brackley in September.",
      "United needed to bounce back in the competition against Rochdale, who had made wholesale changes to their team due to their focus on securing promotion back to the Football League.",
      "Obi was asked for a photograph by a young fan when he stepped off the coach. The 17-year-old made seven appearances in the Premier League last season but has exclusively played in academy fixtures this term.",
      "United were knocked out of the Carabao Cup second round by Grimsby Town and there is no European football, so there are fewer first-team opportunities for academy prospects.",
      "Obi must be patient and keep scoring goals for the U21s to earn the first-team involvement. He will force his way into the squad again by the end of the season if he continues to score at a rate of knots.",
      "And although Obi opened the scoring within 10 minutes against Rochdale, it was Thwaites who was the standout performer, catching the eye in midfield with his dynamic range of passing.",
      "Thwaites has a name fitting of a player from a bygone era. His technical ability on the ball would probably make him seem like an alien if he were teleported to the 1940s, though.",
      "The Bolton-born lad only seems to have one setting: to pass the ball forward. He sprayed it around the pitch and slipped through Bendito Mantato down the right wing just before the interval.",
      "Thwaites is a dead-ball specialist, which may help him progress to the first-team, as set-pieces have suddenly become fashionable again in the Premier League in the last 18 months.",
      "United were value for their one-goal advantage by half-time. Rochdale had not threatened goalkeeper William Murdock between the sticks and Binnion would have been delighted with the performance.",
      "Obi is a goal machine at academy level and his finishing prowess is impressive, but he needs to improve his out-of-possession work, his pressing and link-up play with his teammates.",
      "Godwill Kukonki started for the U21s for the first time this season. Kukonki has been involved with first-team training sessions and acquitted himself well on the left side of central defence.",
      "Diego Leon scored his first goal for United last weekend and he is gradually finding his feet after his summer move from Paraguay. Leon delivered another competent display before being replaced on the hour mark.",
      "The U21s won 1-0 against Rochdale when they visited the Crown Oil Arena last year, and they went one better this time around thanks to a late goal from James Scanlon during injury time.",
      "United thoroughly deserved the three points and are now up and running in the National League Cup",

      "The January transfer window is fast approaching but for Manchester United, they are riding the crest of a wave after claiming their third win in a row after beating Brighton 4-2 over the weekend.",
      "United were red hot against the Seagulls at Old Trafford and raced into a 3-0 lead thanks to goals from Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and Bryan Mbeumo. Brighton provided a late scare with two goals before Mbeumo made sure of the three straight wins.",
      "While the immediate focus is on United's recent upturn in form and next Saturday's trip to Nottingham Forest, transfer talk is still bubbling in the air with the January transfer window approaching.",
      "United are reportedly showing an interest in Angelo Stiller. It is being claimed that the club's director of football, Jason Wilcox, has monitored the midfielder in recent years.",
      "Meanwhile, Napoli are reportedly preparing to make a fresh offer for Kobbie Mainoo during the January transfer window, having failed with a move for the Englishman over the summer.",
      "While Conor Gallagher has also been linked with a move to United, Scott McTominay is also reportedly being eyed for a Premier League return, with United's rivals weighing up a move.",
      "Jobe Bellingham has had a tough start to life with Borussia Dortmund - with Manchester United weighing up a potential loan deal for the Borussia Dortmund star.",
      "However, according to a report from German publication Bild, via Sport Witness, a January exit is 'completely out of question' despite his early difficulties.",
      "The report also goes on to claim that Dortmund are said to be confident Bellingham will develop into a 'difference-maker' in the future.",
      "Manchester United are reportedly showing an interest in Angelo Stiller.",
      "That's according to journalist Fabrizio Romano, who told GiveMeSport: \"One of the names being linked to Manchester United is Angelo Stiller, a central midfielder who has been shining for years at Stuttgart and is also part of the German national team. A quality player, he is ready to make an instant impact but also has great potential in terms of future development.",
      "\"What’s the truth about his situation? Sources confirm the appreciation by the Red Devils, as Stiller has been on their shortlist of players monitored for years.",
      "\"Director of football Jason Wilcox is also understood to be one of the influential figures around Europe who has monitored Stiller more over recent years, so Manchester United are surely very attentive to him and his development.",
      "\"But, despite rumours about a mission in August, nothing happened last summer and the Red Devils never started any negotiations back then. Stiller is one of the names on the list, but not the only one as Brighton & Hove Albion's Carlos Baleba and more players are also being followed, so we can’t consider Stiller as the only option available at all.",
      "\"Sources add that Stuttgart can buy out the release clause in Stiller's current contract until June 2028 for as little as a €2m (£1.7m) fee, and they’re expected to do so. In that case, negotiations could take place for a fee around €50m or €60m (£44m or £53m), but it is very difficult to imagine a transfer in January. It is way more likely in the summer.",
      "\"Manchester United have not made any decision yet on their favourite target, while there are more clubs keen on Stiller. For sure, he is one to watch in the near future.\"",

      "Bouaddi, who has a contract to run until 2027, is expected to leave Lille for £40million next summer. The 2007-born talent has already clocked 42 first-team apperances since his debut in October 2023.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has forced Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim into one big change this season - and it doesn't involve his own personal goalscoring accolade.",
      "It's Mbeumo's corner-taking prowess that has left a lasting impact on Amorim. Last season, Bruno Fernandes was typically United's attacking set piece deliverer, with fellow right-footer Christian Eriksen also having his fair share in a more limited amount of minutes. Amad, a left-footer, took the third most in the United squad.",
      "United lacked a genuine, left-footed option for taking corners who would start on a regular basis and play a large proportion of minutes in the Premier League. Mbeumo's arrival, however, has changed that.",
      "He and Fernandes have shared corner-taking duties this season, with an almost-even split. Mbeumo has been instructed to take them from United's right-hand side, Fernandes delivering them from the left.",
      "Marcus Rashford is expected to depart Manchester United on a permanent deal next summer. The 27-year-old left the Reds to sign for Barcelona on loan in July and he has impressed since his move to the Catalan club, scoring five goals and providing seven assists in 13 appearances.",
      "The England international may have endured a slow start at Barcelona, but he is in red hot form right now. Indeed, he has either scored or assisted in nine of his last 10 matches. Alongside this, the ex-Aston Villa man is back in Thomas Tuchel's Three Lions squad and in contention for a World Cup spot.",
      "Barcelona have the option to buy Rashford for £28million - a lower fee than the £40m United would seek from any other club. Rashford still has just over two-and-a-half years left on his United contract, but he appears to have no future at Old Trafford after falling out of favour under head coach Ruben Amorim.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United are reportedly closing in on a move to sign one of Europe's brightest talents.",
      "United had a relatively busy end to the summer transfer window, which saw five new signings added to Ruben Amorim's squad. Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon were all signed by the Reds and there is the potential for more to come later in the season.",

      "Manchester United appear to have hit a stumbling block in their ambitious plans to build a new £2billion stadium. Higher-ups at Old Trafford could be forced to wait until AC Milan and Inter Milan finalise their own plans to construct a 71,500-capacity ground.",
      "The clubs share a vital partner as they all seek to transform historic venues in world football. Foster + Partners is the firm behind Sir Jim Ratcliffe's vision for a 100,000-seater venue, with completion targeted for 2030.",
      "However, the global studio specialising in sustainable architecture, urbanism, engineering and design is now commencing work on designing the new San Siro, according to the Mail Online, as quoted by the Mirror.

      "\"The Man Utd players were never bad players, they just lacked confidence, but now they are starting to play and that was a good win against Brighton. They got handily beat by Brighton last year so getting four goals was a superb result.",
      "\"They are now starting to turn a corner. They had back-to-back wins, and I was still concerned about this Brighton game. I thought it was a real banana skin for them. It's still early days but that win tells me they are slowly building some momentum.\"",
      "Wayne Rooney has admitted he would prefer to see Marcus Rashford playing well for Manchester United rather than the England international impressing for Barcelona.",
      "Rashford made a season-long loan switch to the Catalan giants this summer after being deemed surplus to requirements by Reds head coach Ruben Amorim. Barca have the option to sign Rashford for £30million in 2026 and are reportedly interested in making the move permanent, but at a cut-price rate.",
      "The 27-year-old has impressed in his early days at the Camp Nou - netting five goals and providing seven assists across all competitions for Hansi Flick's team so far this season. His return to form has seen him earn a recall to the England squad under Thomas Tuchel.",

      "Ruben Amorim's side beat Brighton & Hove Albion 4-2 at Old Trafford to record a first home victory over the Seagulls since February 2022. Victory over Fabian Hurzeler's team moved United up into the European places after previous wins over Liverpool and Sunderland.",
      "The Reds are finally looking up under Amorim, and their absence from Europe means they will have a full week to prepare for most fixtures this season. United's record so far in 2024/25 across all competitions reads five wins, one draw and four defeats with no games outside of the Premier League for Amorim's men until they play in the FA Cup third round in January.",

      "\"Every time I put on my boots or gloves, I want to win. Because at the end of the day, that's what we play for.",
      "\"We play to win, and I’m not afraid of anyone. When I step onto the pitch, I either win or I learn. I don’t see myself as a loser. If I don’t win, I take it as an opportunity to learn.",
      "\"Let me give you an example: my first match here was against Fenerbahce. We played well, but we didn’t win. But I don’t see it as a loss. I learned something, for instance, I learned how the referees are here.\"",

      "The Scotland international has been instrumental for Antonio Conte after helping the Serie A club back to the summit and, thus far, defending it successfully.",
      "He left United a couple of seasons ago but his performances are illustrating that it is bad business from the Old Trafford chiefs.",

      "A source has told the outlet that Outlet has \"got one hell of a future ahead of him\".",
      "Scott McTominay is the subject of transfer interest from La Liga and the Premier League after a superb first season at Napoli.",
      "The Scotland international traded Old Trafford for Naples last summer for £25.7million deal, which now looks like a bargain after he helped Napoli win the Serie A title while also being named MVP.",
      "Unsurprisingly, interest in his services from elsewhere has come to light with Barcelona - alongside Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United - also eyeing McTominay. looking at another United academy star, according to Teamtalk.",
      "They have already signed Marcus Rashford and look likely to sign him permanently and yet more funds could be on the way to United from Barcelona.",
      "That is because a 10 per cent sell-on clause was included in his move to Napoli which would see £5million head to United if he departed Napoli for £50million.",
      "Andre Onana may have just aimed a thinly-veiled dig at the Manchester United squad when referencing the praise he has been handed by Pep Guardiola.",
      "The Manchester City boss is particularly fond of his distribution and when that was recently brought up to him, Onana seemed to direct a subtle jibe at his United teammates.",
      "\"As I always say, most of the time, it's my teammates who give me the options when I'm building up the game,\" he said, per Sporx (via Sport Witness). \"If they help me, the work looks much better.\"",

      "Monga played significant minutes in Leicester's Premier League relegation season with Van Nistelrooy offering him several cameos off the bench. New head coach Marti Cifuentes has handed him 579 minutes of action so far this season.",
      "While Harry Maguire's training absence was a blow, Mason Mount has fully overcome the minor issue that made him a doubt for the win over Brighton.",
      "He managed to be fit enough for a place on the bench but was not risked against the Seagulls.",
      "The midfielder took part in Sunday's training session and looked to be moving freely as he aims to regain his place in the team on Saturday.",
      "Marcus Rashford spoke on a number of topics before the El Clasico clash between Barcelona and Real Madrid. The England international assisted Fermin Lopez in his side's 2-1 defeat.",
      "That is now 10 goal contributions for the season with Rashford certainly enjoying life at the Catalan giants. It is perhaps no surprise he is doing so well having made it clear during an interview with ESPN that a fresh challenge may have been needed",
      "It was so many years in one place. People forget this, but 24 years, 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything.",
      "While several Premier League clubs are preparing for Carabao Cup action, Ruben Amorim will have plenty of days on the training ground ahead of Manchester United's next clash against Nottingham Forest.",

      "Victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton have built confidence with fixtures against Forest and Tottenham their only two matches prior to the November international break.",
      "Forest have also been eliminated from the Carabao Cup however, with Sean Dyche having 24 hours less prep than Amorim after his side played on Sunday.",
      "Harry Maguire was not spotted participating in Manchester United's latest training session having missed the win over Brighton through injury.",

The Norwegian was in charge of United for three years with performances arguably as consistent as any head coach had managed since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "During his tenure, United finished in the top four twice and also reached the Europa League final but did suffer defeat in that showpiece clash to Villareal. A 4-1 defeat to Watford just a few months later was his final game in charge with United having had five big names take the helm since his exit.",
      "Since being given an opportunity in the senior team by Louis van Gaal, he has played under eight different managers and his recent comments suggest that his best memories came with Solskjaer in charge.",

      "He said: \"I made a decision this year cos of Aiden, obviously due to his special needs you might know about. All the work I do now is just around his routines cos he has quite a strict routine every single day, so I just decided everything I’m going to do it is around Aiden.\"",
      "He added: \"I'm not with Claire anymore so we have him three nights each and Claire's mum has him on a Friday night. We always do the same things with him as he doesn't know what day of the week it is or time.",
      "\"But he'll know from what we're doing what day it is. I pick him up every Tuesday from his day care and we go swimming. Loves swimming, then we get his pizza on the way home.",
      "\"Thursday pick him up, go for something to eat, go home. Sunday, I pick him up from Claire's house and we go to Tesco where he buys a trolley full of chocolate.",
      "\"So, he doesn't know what day or time it is, but he knows from what we're doing what day it is. He'll be 21 in December.\"",
      "On the extent of his son's 'severe autism', Scholes explained that Aiden communicated through sound only recognisable to the people who are closest with him. He also detailed how the condition impact him during his playing days.",
      "He said: \"He'd bite your arm or scratch you just out of frustration for him cos he didn't understand things, couldn't tell you how he was feeling. I never got a break from it, even when playing.",
      "\"It was very hard in those days, feels like it was years ago. I don’t think they [doctors] diagnosed it til they were two-and-a-half-years-old. But you knew early something was wrong but then you get the diagnosis, and I'd never heard of it.",
      "\"Then all of a sudden you start seeing everything, I don't know if it just consciously happens, I don't know. I remember the first time after we were playing Derby away and I just didn't want to be there.",
      "\"I remember the manager dropped me the week after actually, and I hadn't told anyone [about the diagnosis]. I ended up telling them a few weeks later, I think as it was quite hard.\"",
      "Nowadays, Scholes has explained that everything he does works around his son in terms of career, explaining he ditched commentary work as a result of Aiden getting agitated due to a change in routine. He explained: \"Everything I'm going to do now just works around him, I do studio work, but everything is built around his day.",
      "\"Last season on Thursday nights I'd do the Europa League for Man United, that's the night I'd usually have him, so he was getting all agitated, biting and scratching. He knows the pattern's not there straight away.",
      "\"And I did that for years really, always thinking I've got to stop this at some point so I had the chance to do the podcast and I thought that would suit me more - well not me, Aiden.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford is thriving on loan at Barcelona after falling out of favour at Manchester United.",
      "The England international completed a season-long loan move to the Spanish giants during the summer transfer window. Rashford's career at Old Trafford appeared over when Ruben Amorim claimed he would rather put his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach on the bench than the forward because of what he considers a lack of effort.",
      "After showing flashes of what he can do in the second half of last season while on loan at Aston Villa, Rashford has impressed for the Catalan side. He has scored five times in 13 appearances in all competitions, as well as claiming seven assists, but was powerless to stop Barca losing Sunday’s El Clasico 2-1 to Real Madrid.",
      "However, the hard work has continued for Rashford, even during a quick return to Manchester this week. Taking to Instagram, the 27-year-old uploaded a series of videos showing him working out at The Performance Space gym in Salford.",
      "The forward captioned the video: \"Marginal gains 48 hours back home.\"",
      "In a recent interview with Barca's YouTube channel, Rashford revealed he’s loving life in Spain. He said: \"I'm really enjoying my time in Spain. The weather is the best part. It's a very big change. I'm learning every day, I'm really enjoying it.",
      "\"I hope to be here for a long time. I get along really well with Roony (Bardghji), as well as Jules (Kounde) and Frenkie (De Jong). It's a team where we all blend together. We're united.",
      "\"The team is fantastic. I just have to be in the right position. I'll keep trying to do this. We have to keep going like this to be our best. We have a lot more to do this season.\"",
      "He then continued: \"I'm enjoying this football club and I think for anybody who loves football, Barcelona is one of the key clubs in the history of the game so to play here is an honour.",
      "\"I just believe that things happen when they're supposed to happen. It's not the first time I spoke with Barcelona about potentially coming here, but for whatever reasons it didn't happen in the past, and now is my opportunity to make it happen.",
      "\"I feel like there's no time like the present now. People forget this, but 23 years of my life was with Manchester United. So sometimes you just need a change.",
      "\"I think maybe this is the case with me and yeah, I'm enjoying everything. I don't feel there is much change in me, I just feel it's a new environment and culture and one I looked forward to coming here. It's just about me adapting and fitting in as well as possible. I'm so hungry to keep improving.\"",

      "Manchester United return to Premier League action on Saturday when they take on Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. Ruben Amorim's men go into the game on the back of three straight victories after beating Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "The turnaround in form has left United sixth in the table, just two points off second. This weekend, they take on a Forest team languishing in the relegation zone after a disastrous start to the season.",
      "Amorim's side are also nearly at full health with just Lisandro Martinez the only long-term absentee. Fortunately, the centre-back is edging closer to his return after being out since February.",
      "So with that mind, MEN Sport bring you all the latest injury news from Old Trafford before we hear from Ruben Amorim...",
      "After netting the winner in the 2-1 victory over Liverpool nearly two weeks ago, Maguire missed the Brighton game due to a knock picked up in training. It's hoped he is back for the trip to the City Ground.",
      "What Amorim has said: \"We have some doubts, we had some issues during the week, with Harry Maguire and Mason Mount. Knocks, but nothing serious.\"",
      "Possible return date: November 1 vs Nottingham Forest (A).",
      "Shaw's run in Amorim's team continued in the win over Brighton, despite him suffering from illness in the week prior. The United boss admitted the England international 'suffered' against the Seagulls, but it is expected that he will be OK for this weekend.",
      "What Amorim has said: \"Luke Shaw is fine. He had a virus during the week,\" said Amorim when asked about Shaw. \"He struggled a little bit in the game, but he's going to be ready for the next one.\"",
      "Possible return date: November 1 vs Nottingham Forest (A).",
      "Injury: Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL)",
      "The Argentina centre-back suffered the injury against Crystal Palace at the beginning of the year. While United will not take any risks with Martinez, he could be available for selection just before November's international break.",
      "What Amorim has said: \"I don't know [when he will return], he trained really well. Not with us, but on the next pitch and I was watching also the training. He's feeling well and the knee is responding really well, so I don't want to say one specific day or week, but he's near to starting the training with the team.",

      "Amorim has overseen three successive victories which have propelled the Reds into the top-six and European contention.",
      "United visit Nottingham Forest this weekend, before then travelling to Tottenham in the final game before the November international break. Those two fixtures offer a further chance for United to show they have turned a corner and Amorim will be hoping next month's top-flight pause is more relaxing than the October break when speculation was rife over his future.",
      "The 40-year-old oversaw a dismal domestic campaign last season while their bid for glory in the Europa League was ended by Spurs in the final, meaning United missed out on European football.",
      "This season, they suffered a poor start with the nadir coming in an embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at the hands of League Two outfit Grimsby Town. But there have been signs of improvement in recent weeks and Amorim knows the next 12 months will be crucial as he approaches a year in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "His arrival last November was seen as a significant coup such was his body of work in Portugal at Sporting Lisbon and while United have yet to hit the heights they hoped to when appointing Amorim, the Reds chief said when he arrived that patience would be needed - citing the two-year mark as an accurate position to judge his impact.",
      "\"I think, in two years, you guys can understand if I am the right man in this process,\" he said in his first United press conference.",
      "\"We will need more time because, if you look to the other clubs that are winning this league, they are doing this process for a long time but they are winning so they have time to do this project.",
      "\"I understand we will need more than two-and-a-half years, we have to win something, somewhere, but, in two years, you can understand if you want to continue on this path or change. So we will see how long it will take.\"",

      "Any positive momentum that was built up from the victory over Chelsea seemed to disappear in an instant and suddenly the scrutiny on Ruben Amorim was harsher than ever. The win against Sunderland was needed to keep the critics at bay during October's international break.",
      "But once United returned to action, the mood surrounding the club changed entirely. From Amorim's pre-Liverpool press conference to today, it was like a light switch had been flicked on.",
      "This United team now is playing some of the best football they have managed for a long time. On Saturday against Brighton, the Reds were the intelligent team knowing when to press their opposition into a mistake.",
      "Three of the four goals came from working hard as a unit and it will have been a pleasure to watch for supporters. However, there is always concern that any improvements are being over-exaggerated after years of mediocrity, or worse.",
      "But the reason you can tell that United are changing for the better is that other clubs are starting to notice the difference. \"It is the best [United] side we have faced in a while,\" Danny Welbeck explained on Saturday evening.",
      "\"They were really organised and structure, they always have incredible players and today they really punished our mistakes.\" This sentiment was in turn echoed by Morgan Gibbs-White in midweek ahead of his Nottingham Forest side taking on United.",
      "\"Yeah it has been incredible to see,\" the 25-year-old said to Stan Sport - when asked about United's turnaround. \"Obviously they have been going through a tough time, the past couple of years but they have stuck with the gaffer and the past four or five games you’re really starting to see how Manchester United should be playing - that grit and that determination to play for the badge. I think it has been incredible to see.\"",
      "It has been too long since United received actual praise from other clubs. Of course, we are used to the same cliches regarding the Reds.",
      "\"This will be a tough game,\" and \"Old Trafford is a tricky trip,\" have been repeated on a loop so many times before United actually proved the opposite was the case. But now the Reds are being spoken about in positive terms by opposing players which shows the tide truly is changing at the Theatre of Dreams.",

      "All three performances have been impressive but very different, with their latest outing against the Seagulls - that ended 4-2 - showing the quality of the attacking power brought to the club this past summer. Bryan Mbeumo bagged a brace, with one of those assisted by Benjamin Sesko, after Matheus Cunha put them in front.",
      "Casemiro was United's other scorer on the night as his deflected effort flew past Bart Verbruggen with the Brazil international also picking up an assist.",
      "The previous weekend, he was superb against Premier League champions Liverpool with it clear he is benefitting from only playing once per week.",
      "Despite that, Amorim may have to soon prepare for a United game without Casemiro and not because of injury. That is because he is already on three yellow cards and picking up two more cautions before United have played their 20th game of the league season will see him serve a one-match ban.",
      "Amorim and United were likely fearing the worst for their trip to Nottingham Forest over a different suspension worry during the clash against Brighton.",
      "For Danny Welbeck's excellent free-kick that brought Brighton back into the game, Patrick Dorgu fouled Yankuba Minteh when he was breaking through on goal.",
      "The Denmark international was only shown a yellow card with it deemed Minteh's heavy touch meant it was not the denial of clear and obvious goal-scoring opportunity. Nonetheless, it was his third caution of the campaign already which places him in the same boat as Casemiro.",
      "Amorim has preferred to use Diogo Dalot at left wing-back over Dorgu when deploying Amad on the opposite flank, but he has still been booked three times.",
      "In terms of potential Casemiro replacements, both Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo can be utilised alongside Bruno Fernandes, though Amorim would certainly prefer to have Casemiro available given his impact in recent weeks.",

      "The eldest son of the United legend hopes to emulate his father's incredible career, but he suffered an injury setback, stating: 'Life couldn't get any worse.'",
      "The youngster clearly has his father's passion for the game and has impressed for United's youth sides this season. He caughgt the eye during the Super Cup NI in Northern Ireland earlier this summer, a tournament in which his father also shone as a youngster at Everton.",
      "Kai was in the midst of a meteoric rise, having been called up to United's Under-19s side, where he competed against professionals four-years older than him.",
      "Prior to that call-up, he'd scored an incredible goal for the Under-18s, a left-footed volley that nestled in the top corner, reminiscent of some of his father's brilliant strikes.",
      "Earlier this year, Kai shared an image on social media of his right foot in a boot, but has now updated fans on his recovery.",
      "Taking to Instagram, he shared two photos enjoying some down time in Dubai, with his foot no longer in a protective boot. The youngster captioned the pictures: \"Recovering\" followed by an emjoi shrowded in smoke.",
      "It's still unclear the exact nature of his injury, though the images suggest a return to action may not be too far away.",
      "The youngster tends to operate in a central attacking role, like his father Wayne, but can also play on either side of the attack.",
      "When asked about his son's football, in an interview with BBC Sport, Rooney said: \"I just let him play. I think they started the competition well, they won 3-0, he scored the penalty and got an assist. So I think he started OK. He just plays and that's all he's done during his time playing.",
      "\"I think it's very unfair for anyone to expect him to go and do all kinds. He's just playing, he's a 15-year-old boy playing his football, enjoying it. Of course he gets different attention to a lot of his team-mates but I think he handles that really well.\"",
      "Rooney also praised the coaching staff at United, stating: \"He has great coaches at Manchester United, so I take a stand off approach. I speak to him, but for me it's all about his mentality and his mindset, to make sure he keeps enjoying it - that's the main thing for me.\"",

The 24-year-old managed to net just seven goals in 49 appearances across all competitions last season.",
      "This season, he has featured only four times, with his most recent league goal for United dating back to December, 10 months ago. While Mainoo has also been linked with a midseason move away from the Reds.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho showed his true colours after being substituted during Chelsea's 2-1 defeat to Sunderland at Stamford Bridge.",
      "The former Manchester United winger was visibly frustrated when Enzo Maresca replaced him with Estevao in the 58th minute. After scoring the opening goal inside four minutes, Garnacho believed he had more to offer before Chelsea went on to lose 2-1.",
      "Maresca's decision sparked backlash from Chelsea fans on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).",
      "One said: \"Garnacho was probably the only attacker having a decent game … so of course he’s the first one Maresca subs off. No wonder he was shaking his head,\" while another posted: \"Maresca taking out the attacker who was most likely to score today in Garnacho was not the move.\"",
      "A third continued: \"Maresca makes terrible substitutions. Why take off Garnacho so early?\"",
      "Garnacho celebrated his goal by sitting on the advertising hoarding, joined by team-mate Pedro Neto. The moment served as a reminder for United fans - a similar celebration took place during their win over West Ham in February 2024 when Kobbie Mainoo and Rasmus Hojlund struck the same pose.",
      "At the time, the trio were seen as the future of United. But Garnacho later completed the £40million move to Stamford Bridge while Hojlund is also expected to leave Old Trafford, having shown positive signs following a loan move to Napoli.",
      "Before his switch to west London, Garnacho found himself in United's so-called 'bomb squad' - sidelined during pre-season as Ruben Amorim eyed an overhaul that included moving him on alongside several teammates.",
      "As for Chelsea, their run of four straight wins in all competitions came to a dramatic halt as Sunderland's Chemsdine Talbi struck a stoppage-time winner at Stamford Bridge.",
      "\"I think in general we were not good enough,\" said Maresca afterwards. \"When you are not good enough in the Premier League we know that the consequences can be bad.",
      "\"I have said many times, when you are not able to win it is important you do not lose.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo admits \"it hasn't been easy\" for Manchester United's new-look attack in the early stages of the season but insists the connection between himself, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko is starting to develop.",
      "Mbeumo scored twice on Saturday as United made it three wins in a row. United took a 2-0 lead into half-time and looked home and hosed when Mbeumo made it 3-0 after the break. However, a nervy finish was in store after Danny Welbeck's free kick and Charalampos Kostoulas' header in added time.",
      "Mbeumo stepped up to seal the victory late in the game, meaning he now has five goals since his move to United. Cunha's strike was just his first for the club and Mbeumo admitted it was a relief for the Brazilian to get off the mark. \"Yeah, of course the pressure is off his shoulders today with the goal, he was waiting for it and we were waiting for it as well,\" he explained.",
      "\"We are very happy for him. We are growing the link-ups between each other [himself, Sesko and Cunha].",
      "\"It hasn’t been easy obviously because we all came this year and we tried to make the connections in training. It hasn’t been easy coming into this environment, a big club, the expectations are not easy to handle but with the teammates, everyone is helping me, helping the team, helping the new players and I think that was very important.\"",
      "When asked whether he could match the 20 goals he scored in the last campaign, Mbeumo said: \"I always try to aim big in everything that I do. I try not to set limits on myself and on what I can reach. I am just going to work on that as much as possible.",
      "United's win moved them up to fourth and Mbeumo is optimistic for the future. \"Everyone wants to fight for as high as possible,\" he said.",
      "\"We want to win as many games as we can and that is what we are going to try and do.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba joked that he was 'coming to Old Trafford' on social media prior to Manchester United's 4-2 victory over Brighton and Hove Albion.",
      "While the post was deleted, the impact of it perhaps lingered as the Cameroonian's hour at Old Trafford played out. At 21, there is plenty of room for improvement but that possible United transfer will need to be put on hold for now.",
      "Baleba was the player United fans had their eye on in the opposition ranks but he struggled. Bryan Mbeumo gave him a torrid time and when the midfielder unleashed a wayward shot in the second half, Fabian Hurzeler knew it was time to make a change.",
      "With Baleba not being the £100m man that Brighton hoped he would be at Old Trafford, his exit allowed another player to catch the eye in the form of Yankuba Minteh. When the 21-year-old left Newcastle in 2024, eyebrows were raised considering he had only been at St James' Park for a year.",
      "During that 12 months he was loaned to Feyenoord so Newcastle supporters did not get to see his potential. Eddie Howe may have been kicking himself had he watched Minteh's display at Old Trafford.",
      "He showed what he could do early in the first half as he turned the normally unflappable Leny Yoro inside out, before just running out of room. However, he continued to be positive and direct, proving to be the main source of all that was good about Brighton's play.",
      "In the second half, he switched to the right-hand side but was no less effective, providing a stern test for Ayden Heaven. When he broke down the middle, Patrick Dorgu was in trouble and was very fortunate to see the winger take a slightly heavy touch.",
      "Minteh and Danny Welbeck were arguably the two Brighton players who did not deserve to be on the losing side at Old Trafford.",
      "Would Minteh fit into the United system? Potentially. He is young and you could see him playing a similar role to Amad or Mbeumo.",
      "Should United pay £100m for him? Almost certainly not, especially as that position is well stocked at present and it may not take that much to sign Minteh anyway. But the winger showed Baleba the level you need to be at to earn that United move.",
      "Yes, one is a forward and the other a defensive midfielder, but Minteh played with the freedom that his teammate did not.",
      "Instead of being overawed by the occasion, Minteh relished it, and United would not go wrong looking at him in the future.",

      "United continued their fine run of form under Ruben Amorim with another emphatic display at Old Trafford. The Reds raced into a 3-0 lead thanks to goals from Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and Bryan Mbeumo before the Seagulls pegged them back.",
      "The wing-back seemed to be clipped by Maxim De Cuyper, but referee Anthony Taylor was quick to wave away any claims for a spot-kick. A statement from the Premier League Match Centre account on X read: \"The referee’s call of no penalty to Manchester United was checked and confirmed by VAR – with it deemed that De Cuyper played the ball.\"",
      "In the aftermath of the game, both Gallagher and Bothroyd debated a host of controversial refereeing decisions, including Amad's incident. However, they were unable to reach an agreement.",
      "Bothroyd said: “This is a definite penalty for me. Amad Diallo is running into the box. There is the slightest touch.",
      "“The defender, he puts his leg out, so obviously he has made contact. He touched the ball slightly, but that contact, has stopped Amad getting to the ball.",
      "“So whether he has touched the ball or not, and it’s a miniscule that he has touched that, because the ball is basically travelling in the same direction, he has stopped Amad getting to that. That’s why I would say that is a penalty.",
      "“It’s the same as [Viktor] Gyokeres, again the smallest touch. These touches are not enough to say, ‘Oh he has touched the ball. It can’t be a penalty,’ because players can still get back to the ball. That’s why I would say the Amad one is a penalty.”",
      "Gallagher, who spent over 15 years refereeing at the top level, disagreed with Bothroyd and pointed to previous incidents as to why the decision was made.",
      "He said: “It’s interesting we have seen Gyokeres with Pope, we saw Saka with Kevin and we’ve seen this one, they’ve been consistent - if they get a touch on the ball, they are not going to give a penalty, they’ve done it for week six, week eight and week nine.\"",
      "Bothroyd then replied: “But they did not do it for week five when Sanchez touched the ball and Mbeumo goes through. So they’ve changed the rule after week five is basically what you are saying.",
      "Gallagher then said: “I didn’t say that at all. I said since the Gyokeres one where they came out and said, ‘He’s got a touch on the ball.’ In this situation, they have been consistent, as you’ve asked for, and they haven’t given any of them.”",

      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "In an attempt to move on from the hyperbolic headlines, here is my attempt at diagnosing the problems and potential solutions to the poor run of form at Liverpool.",
      "Problems:",
      "Evolution from 433: Clearly this years’ signings marked an evolutionary move from Liverpool’s long serving 433 formation. Slot admitted that the signings were intended to give us more flexibility in the way we lined up against teams. Wirtz a clear number 10 means we were at times moving away from Klopp’s 6 and two 8s and Slot’s two 6s and an 8. It is also a clear move away from a team which gets its running and physicality from 3 midfielders with creativity provided by the full backs and the attackers. MacAllister and Wirtz are a long way from Hendo and Gini. Wirtz is most like Coutinho who didn’t fit within the 433 and had to leave. Buying Wirtz for 9 figures means we are moving away from 433 which will naturally unsettle some players who have played it for years. I see the logic in having someone like Wirtz to unlock the low block which Liverpool often face.",
      "The combined signing of Isak and Wirtz suggest a possible move away from 3 up front or certainly configuring the 3 differently. Is Slot’s ultimate long term vision 2 upfront, Wirtz at the tip of a diamond midfield behind, with Frimpong and Kerkez providing the width and legs?",
      "Leaking goals: Whether it’s the change in the formation, change in players or just poor form. Liverpool have leaked goals particularly of late.",
      "Missing Trent: I hope the long-time critics of TAA can see the error of their ways. Defensively Trent was never as bad as people alleged and Liverpool have not locked down the right hand side of the defence since he left. Issues on the right were never Trent being ‘the worst defender’ in the world. They were chiefly the result of Salah not tracking back and neither Milner or Henderson being replaced to fill in the gap.",
      "There is a Trent shaped hole in this team from an attacking perspective. It lacks creativity from deep and the ability to turn defence into attack with one quick pass",
      "Salah out of form: No one misses Trent more than Salah whose form has dipped noticeably. No one expected last year again but he has been poor. He has not found the right chemistry with teammates on the right. The lack of a consistent ball over the top (Trent!) means he is easier to mark. Putting Wirtz into midfield means there is one less person to do his running leaving us badly exposed to pace on the opposition left (Semenya, Eze, Mbuemo etc…). If I zoom out, I think in the absence of Trent, Salah is more likely to drift infield to an inside right position which I think is really where Wirtz would like to play. Really what we are seeing is the painful transition from a Salah led offense to a Wirtz led offence. It is now a question of how soon this happens.",
      "Big names, small performances: New signings have not settled. Isak in a red shirt is still miles from Isak in a Newcastle shirt. Frimpong is supposed to bring pace on the right to provide an overlap for Wirtz and others creating from midfield. He has had a shaky start and doesn’t seem to be a defensive upgrade from Trent. Wirtz has not looked like the best player in Germany and doesn’t seem to know where he should play. He looks for time he’s not going to get in the PL. Most disappointing for me has been Kerkez who isn’t adapting to a new league and should have been an immediate improvement on the left. He has been physically weak and reckless in tackles.",
      "MacAllister has been poor in every aspect of the game from tackling to passing and has rightly been dropped for Jones. Konate had a shocking start to the season and there is a risk his head has been turned. Salah, see above.",
      "Missing Allison: The new keeper does not look like the best young keeper in the world. He’s been nervous coming and dealing with crosses and dived too soon twice for Brentford goals. It was tough watching Kelleher for Brentford on Saturday. When you miss Allison you miss a keeper who makes saves he shouldn’t and is lethal in one on ones.",
      "Brass tax, Liverpool have conceded 7 in GM’s 3 PL games vs. 7 in Allison’s 6 PL games.",
      "Look at the 3 games and the goals conceded and ask would Allison save it? Mbuemo definitely, Caicaido he could have and the Brentford goals he would certainly have done better.",
      "Solutions:",
      "Sort the defence first. It applies to Sunday league and premier league alike. You cannot win games conceding too many goals. We need to get a defence sorted. For me that means putting Gomez at RB and Robbo at LB. Play a flat back 4. If the game requires it, start Endo at the base of MF until RG is fit again. This also means getting midfielders and wingers to put in a shift to cover the defence.",
      "Continue everyone is droppable: Salah and MacAllister have rightly been dropped for playing badly. This needs to be the case. Chiesa and Jones deserve their chances and if they don’t get them now then they have to leave the club. Past performances and big transfer fees shouldn’t guarantee a player a spot either. Isak and Wirtz similarly need to be droppable.",
      "Play Szoboszlai in MF: He’s our only shining light this season. Just start him in midfield every game, no messing around at RB. Play him at 6 or 8. With RG out we should start him at 6 for now.",
      "Use the injuries to settle the team: Injuries mean there are less options and allows the team to settle a bit. Isak being injured means continuing with 3 upfront and playing Hugo at 9. This should always have been the case but it’s easier to have the big transfer injured than dropped. Jones and RG being out means playing an offensive midfield 3 of Macallister, DS and Wirtz which makes the solid 4 at the back even more important. Hopefully this will see MacAllister and Salah settle and find their form but if that doesn’t happen Chiesa and Endo should be put in.\nPL from DL",

Ed more than welcome to tell me if I’m talking bollocks",
      "With regards to the stitches, having worked at sea for 10+ years, I’ve had (cumulatively) 7 staples and 12 stitches in my head over three separate occasions, it’s nothing more than an elaborate boo boo that McAllister definitely made the most of and considering there was no actual concussion test or anything that I saw, in hindsight, I think the ref got it right.",
      "Ryan, Bermuda: All salient points made, well done that man – and decent PS from Ed. Which leads me on to one of my bugbears in football. A defender can often come sliding through, absolutely clattering a striker after they have had a shot without any censure because of some weird logic that they’ve already had a shot without any consideration to the fact that an uncontrolled ~100kgs of defender sliding at the striker across the turf at 20km/h, may have in fact, put the striker off.",

It is truly baffling and Ryan certainly is Me when I scratch my head at some of the rules, the opaqueness of their application and disaster refereeing.

      "READ: Carragher and Ratcliffe force-fed humble pie by reborn Casemiro",
      "Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel: “I admire it to a certain extent. But, like I said, I think he is playing Russian Roulette with his job. I don’t think he’s changed drastically, he’s just tweaked.",
      "“That’s what a lot of fans were asking for. Just tweak what you’ve got. Maybe don’t be so much on the front foot, maybe be a bit more conservative at times when we haven’t got the ball.",

      "Gary Neville insists he was “a little worried” that Amorim had lost the belief of the players a few weeks ago but now believes the Man Utd head coach has survived the “month of reckoning” at Old Trafford.",
      "“But one thing that’s been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people around the club is that they really like him as a person, and that does count for a lot. Because I think there’s no doubt – he’s not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him.",
      "“I think they want to play for him, they’re desperate to win and I think you’ve seen that coming together in the last week. I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special, but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected I think has given them such a big lift.",
      "“We’ll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after – there’s still a big job to do in the next month. But I felt it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week against Liverpool it could have gone a different way but it feels very different, it feels like the momentum is with them a little bit and the spirit is good.”",

      "While Harry Maguire’s revival has been built on moments, Casemiro has plugged away to make a mockery of the criticism from Liverpool-leaning pundits and Man Utd’s actual owner…",
      "When it was written that Manchester United’s refusal to buy a midfielder in the summer offered a chance to one of their current engine room operatives to step up, we were right. We just picked the wrong one.",
      "And when it was said that Ruben Amorim’s players, in their bid to make United credible again, have the template to follow in one of their renaissance men, we were also right. Again, though, we may have fingered the wrong fella.",
      "Amorim believes that shining example is coming not from Harry Maguire, but a star similarly maligned. “The other guys need to look at Casemiro,” said the boss after the Brazilian presented more evidence to suggest that he is once again one of United’s most important players.",
      "Look at the difference between United pre and post Casemiro’s withdrawal against Brighton. With the veteran midfielder, Amorim’s men were in control against a side more used to winning at Old Trafford than United of late. At 3-0 up with three-quarters of the game gone, Amorim thought it wise to give the Brazil star a break for the last 20-plus minutes.",
      "It is not often Amorim has been in such a privileged position so we can forgive him for fumbling this particular decision. Because removing Casemiro might have allowed the 33-year-old a breather, but it also breathed new life into Brighton, who had significantly less trouble playing around and through a midfield of Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "It is not necessarily their fault. We are learning that Fernandes can play deeper as long as he has Casemiro to hold his hand. Mainoo has only partnered Casemiro for a half or longer once in the last 11 months since United beat Everton 4-0 at Old Trafford.",
      "Regardless, the contrast with and without Casemiro was stark enough to recognise the importance of the Brazilian. But if you prefer to trust numbers over your eyes, here you go…",
      "Man United with Casemiro on the pitch: 3 goals conceded",
      "Man United without Casemiro on the pitch: 16 goals conceded",
      "Impact. pic.twitter.com/byjTwd7WbU",
      "As comebacks go, Casemiro’s is certainly up there with Harry Maguire’s. In the context of Jamie Carragher’s criticism, it might rival Jesus Christ’s.",
      "“There was a saying I always remember as a footballer, ‘leave the football before the football leaves you’. The football has left him at this top level he needs to call it a day at this level of football and move”.",
      "Carragher went in two-footed on Casemiro 18 months ago, back in May 2024 after a calamitous display at centre-back, but the pundit was certainly no lone voice, even if his tone prompted more than the odd wince.",
      "No question, Casemiro’s second season at Old Trafford was poor. He told Ed Woodward that he would ‘fix’ United when he signed from Real Madrid and his first year suggested he was serious. What happened, though, in the summer of 2023, perhaps one day we’ll find out, because Casemiro returned for season two hungover or haunted from his lay-off. Possibly both.",
      "By any measure or metric, his form plummeted and the serial winner, as one of the Premier League’s highest-paid players, became one of the poster boys for United’s decade-long decline.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe even namechecked Casemiro in March – not for the first time – when discussing players recruited in the past who were ‘overpaid’ and ‘not good enough’ for Manchester United.",
      "Being bunched with Antony, Jadon Sancho, Rasmus Hojlund and Andre Onana must have been a humbling experience for Casemiro, a five-time Champions League winner. Indeed, his performances suggest he took it personally. Unlike some targets for criticism at Old Trafford in recent years, and others who were on the fringes in the early days of Amorim’s reign, Casemiro focused his energy on proving his doubters wrong and himself worthy of his wage.",
      "As Amorim got his feet under the table and assessed which characters he could trust, Casemiro’s role became more prominent. He played a major role in taking United to Bilbao for the Europa League final, but while fattening himself up for the summer market, in Ratcliffe’s eyes at least, he also became one of his manager’s most-trusted lieutenants. When those in the United boardroom would have piggy-backed him to anywhere they might find a club who would take his salary off their books, Amorim was reluctant to lose an ally.",
      "It benefits Casemiro that United have a shamefully light schedule this season. Even so, Amorim is at pains to rest him when he thinks he can get away with it.",
      "MORE MAN UTD FROM F365\n🔴 Amorim ecstatic to be proved wrong by one player after incredible Manchester United first\n⚪ Ferdinand slams Carragher over ‘disrespect’ of Man Utd star \n⚫ Gary Neville reveals next ‘big job’ for Ruben Amorim after his ‘best week’ at Man Utd",
      "Casemiro has started all but two of the games for which he has been available – the two missed: a derby humping and Grimsby-gate – and is now one of the first names on Amorim’s team-sheet, a fact all the more remarkable in the wake of the manager’s admission on Saturday.",
      "“In the beginning, he was behind every midfielder, even Toby Collyer,” who is currently struggling for starts at West Brom. “But he fought and he worked, and now he’s back in the national team. He’s so important for us.”",
      "No doubt it helps that Amorim has now got Casemiro surrounded by team-mates willing to run and carry out the manager’s game plan. The front three, especially Bryan Mbuemo and Matheus Cunha, can be trusted to fill the holes at the top of United’s midfield, and the centre-backs appear to be learning how and when to step in around Casemiro and Fernandes to make a trio when required.",
      "Such a framework, woefully absent for much of Casemiro’s career at Old Trafford, facilitates the kind of performance that saw Casemiro outshine Carlos Baleba, the £100million man the Red Devils were supposedly so keen on. It is said that they now have ‘serious doubts’ about him, but the hunt for a midfielder will become considerably more urgent next summer when Casemiro’s contract is up.",
      "Of course, United would only trigger the option they have to extend Casemiro’s massive contract for another year over Ratcliffe’s cold, dead body. Should he go free, then he might follow Carragher’s advice to ‘go to the MLS or Saudi’, taking ‘the football’ and a restored reputation with him.",
      "Kyle Walker forced Pep Guardiola into doing something he never had as a boss with a decision he ‘didn’t like’, but Burnley are better for his ‘selfish’ call.",
      "Beto. Oh Beto. Nobody is worse than Beto in the Premier League but he is in good company with a £100m footballer.",
      "Eden Hazard has been inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame. Would football have a place for him and his massive arse now?",
      "There are very real and very important updates on Marc Guehi’s transfer status from a top source, among the rest of the usual Mediawatch nonsense.",
      "We could see Brendan Rodgers at West Ham, but where’s the fun in that? For his sake and ours, it’s time to take the Brendan Show to the international stage.",

      "Manchester United are not back *yet*, but they are on track as they are making the right steps regarding their next marquee signing…",
      "It has been a pretty great couple of weeks for Man Utd, with the first back-to-back Premier League wins under Ruben Amorim becoming three straight victories over the weekend.",
      "Credit should go to Amorim as he has made slight tweaks to his approach to make his system more effective and this has borne fruit against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton.",
      "Amorim is far from out of the woods, but for the first time in his tenure, it feels like the Red Devils are on an upward curve and can mount a sustained push for Champions League qualification this term.",
      "This is largely down to Man Utd bucking a long-term trend by having a very successful transfer window with a near-perfect hit rate.",
      "READ: Premier League winners and losers: Sunderland, Nuno, Arsenal, Wolves, Brentford, Liverpool and more",
      "Summer signings Senne Lammens, Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha have forced a U-turn on the transfer debate as winners Man Utd actually had a better window than losers Liverpool.",
      "All four players have settled nicely in recent weeks and have made a great impact on their winning run, while Man Utd also did a good job at offloading unwanted talents on their terms.",
      "Still, Man Utd’s summer transfer window was not perfect as they failed to sign a quality No.6.",
      "The Red Devils did try to sign one as they pursued an audacious deal for Brighton’s Carlos Baleba, though they opted against signing an alternative after being priced out of a £100m-plus transfer.",
      "Without Baleba or another No.6, Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro have started together in most of Man Utd’s games and although the Brazilian’s revival has been outstanding, Amorim’s side remain far too easy to play through even in the games they have won.",
      "So if Man Utd are to truly be back under Amorim, an upgrade on Casemiro needs to be their next marquee signing, and this looks increasingly likely to be the case.",
      "But this does not mean necessarily mean Baleba.",
      "A report from journalist Dean Jones for our pals at TEAMtalk claims Man Utd have ‘serious doubts’ about a ‘record’ deal for Baleba as he is ‘not yet worth breaking the bank for’.",
      "And these concerns are justified as Baleba is far from the final product and there are issues surrounding his mentality; his performances have clearly been impacted by transfer speculation this season.",
      "The report claims Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are ’emerging as names of interest’ and these two would be cheaper than Baleba, while also potentially being better fits for the No.6 role at Old Trafford.",
      "And a contract ‘decision’ is another positive sign for Man Utd, with Football Insider claiming they ‘are not planning to trigger the extension option’ in Casemiro’s deal to extend his deal to 2027 on the same terms.",
      "Although Casemiro’s performances this season have been stronger than in 2024/25, he remains a weak link in Man Utd’s side and his reported £375,000-a-week contract cannot be justified at this stage of his career.",
      "Casemiro could stay at Man Utd by accepting a sizable pay cut, but this feels pretty unlikely with Saudi Pro League sides ‘tracking’ the veteran midfielder. Signing Wharton or Anderson to replace him will be a necessary upgrade in a key department to take the club to the next level under Amorim.",
      "Who could have foreseen Casemiro outshining Carlos Beleba while reasserting himself as one of Man Utd’s most important players? Not Carragher or Ratcliffe…",

      "Rio Ferdinand has hit out at Jamie Carragher over his ‘disrespect’ of a Manchester United star who’s proven him wrong under Ruben Amorim this season.",
      "Having looked destined for the sack after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford a month ago, three Premier League wins on the bounce has given Amorim some breathing space at Old Trafford with United now fifth in the table.",
      "And with praise being readily afforded to summer signing Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Senne Lammens in recent weeks, Ferdinand hailed Casemiro for his rejuvenation this term.",
      "“Casemiro’s game is not about chasing high up the pitch constantly,” the former United defender said on Rio Ferdinand Presents.",
      "“He built a stellar career on the back of being the glue, the person that knitted the back line and the midfield together and just plug the gaps. He wasn’t asked to run all over the place or be a creator. He was asked to get it and give it to the people that can create.",
      "“He might have scored the odd goal here and there when he went a bit loose, but he was the one who was mopping up and doing all the dirty work and being able to stay in an area and marshal that area.",
      "“Recently, this is what we’ve seen. He’s looked something like the old Casemiro.”",
      "Casemiro impressed in his first season for United after making his £70m move from Real Madrid, but two poor seasons followed for the Brazilian, who has been heavily linked with the Old Trafford exit throughout that inauspicious spell.",
      "And Carragher urged Casemiro to “call it day” after a particularly poor display in a 4-0 defeat against Crystal Palace in May 2024.",
      "“Leave the football, before the football leaves you,” he said. “The football has left him at this top level. He has to call it a day at this level of football and move.”",
      "But of the 16 goals United have conceded this season, just three of them have come with Casemiro on the pitch, and Ferdinand has used this evidence of his revival to aim a jab at Carragher.",
      "“It takes me back to what was said by Jamie Carragher about, ‘leave the football’,” Ferdinand continued.",
      "“I said at the time, I thought it was highly disrespectful when you’re talking about a five-time Champions League winner who’s going through a change in approach to football, going through a time where he looked out of sorts.",
      "“Players lose confidence, they lose form, sometimes players’ legs go, but I think the call was too early and I thought it was highly disrespectful for someone who’s achieved so much in the game.",
      "“Sometimes you’ve got to look beyond just trying to find an individual. We’re very fond of finding a scapegoat. Sometimes you got to look at the way a team is playing and work out is that impacting a player negatively or is it actually the player who’s gone?",
      "“I think by looking at the way that the system’s changed a little bit and been tweaked, you’re seeing the benefits for someone like Casemiro.",
      "“Amorim spoke glowingly about him, about his character, his resilience. You don’t win five Champions Leagues without those two aspects in your makeup.",
      "“Now he’s the reference point for any player that’s going through a hard time at this football club.”",

      "Vinicius Junior muttered “I’m leaving the team” having failed to hide his frustration at being substituted in El Clasico and reports on Monday suggest he is ‘seriously considering’ an exit owing the lack of ‘respect’ afforded to him by manager Xabi Alonso. But where could he go? There’s just one option.",
      "Vinicius has helped Madrid win 14 trophies since his arrival in 2018, including three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues, playing a starring role in many of those triumphs. But the 2024 Ballon d’Or runner-up’s frustrations – which have been bubbling under the surface for weeks at the Bernabeu – came to the surface as he stormed off the pitch on Sunday.",
      "After starting on the bench for Madrid’s previous league clash with Getafe, Vinicius was recalled to Alonso’s XI as goals from Kylian Mbappe and Jude Bellingham sealed Madrid a 2-1 win over their bitter rivals, but was withdrawn in the 72nd minute by Alonso and made it abundantly clear what he thought of his manager’s decision.",
      "“Me? Me? Mister, mister! Me?” Vinicius was heard shouting at Alonso as his No.7 appeared on the fourth official’s board.",
      "The 25-year-old has played the full 90 minutes in just three of Madrid’s 12 games in all competitions this season and before making his way straight down the tunnel, he’s alleged to have muttered: “Always me! I’m Leaving the team! I’m leaving, I’d better go!”",
      "And according to AS, ‘the option of leaving’ is now ‘being seriously considered’ by Vinicius, who believes Alonso ‘doesn’t like him’ and that his ‘status isn’t respected’ by the Spaniard, with the growing rift between the pair a ‘massive problem’ for the club.",
      "Alonso looked to pacify the situation after the game, saying: “I’m taking away many positive things from Vini’s game and I don’t want to lose focus on what’s important.",
      "“He contributed a lot. It’s an important victory, a deserved one. Regaining the feeling of a competitive team in big games is important. All coaches know there are different personalities.",
      "“Now we’ll enjoy it, and when the time comes we’ll talk about these things in the changing room, of course.”",
      "The report adds that the Madrid hierarchy are prepared to back any decision Alonso makes with regard to Vinicius’ future having been far from impressed by the winger’s reaction to being subbed.",
      "And with it suggested last month that Vinicius may seek a January exit having been benched for Madrid’s Champions League opener, we can only assume his resolve to seek pastures new has gathered strength after this latest perceived snub.",
      "But the question Vinicius and his representatives must now be asking is which clubs in world football could offer the £150m likely required to sign him, at least match his £350,000-per-week wages and be comfortable with the reality of him having to be the man at their club for fear of him throwing a hissy fit if that’s not the case. And there’s nowhere to go for him but Saudi Arabia.",
      "Paris Saint-Germain used to be a landing spot for the star misfits of other European giants, but they’ve become a serious football team of late.",
      "Liverpool made several Galactico signings in the summer, but to their cost so far this season, and we can’t see Arne Slot welcoming such a character into his dressing room.",

      "If anyone could get a handle on Vinicius, it might just be Pep Guardiola, but Manchester City haven’t typically chased players of such repute, other than Erling Haaland, who joined for the relatively meagre prices they’re used to paying for their recruits.",
      "Arsenal may still be after a left-wing upgrade, but much as we would enjoy his clash with Arteta, theirs is a boat that doesn’t need rocking.",
      "Manchester United aren’t in a position to attract a player of Vinicius’ quality even if they wanted to, and we can’t imagine they do at a point where Ruben Amorim looks finally to have his squad pulling together as one.",
      "There’s very little chance of Chelsea paying that much for a player who is on the brink of being too old for them anyway at 25, and even less chance of Vinicius joining a club where the chances of the most major trophies look slim in the short-term.",
      "And given there is no European club other than PSG outside the Premier League with the wherewithal to pay Real Madrid and Vinicius what’s required to sign him, even assuming they had the desire, if we were his advisors, and weren’t the money-grabbing so-and-sos we suspect they are, we would urge him to mend bridges which are currently singed at a club from which he has no better, or even remotely comparable, place to go, before he burns them beyond repair.",

      "That does require some erasure of that stoppage-time feint to leave Ayden Heaven’s pass to run through to Mbeumo but it still shows that Manchester United are becoming less cripplingly dependent on their best player.",
      "Mbeumo stepped up. Matheus Cunha, too, with his wonderful opener. And Benjamin Sesko, whose glorious touch, turn and pass set Mbeumo free for his first.",
      "With Casemiro and Luke Shaw chipping in too it was strange to watch a Manchester United side thrive and combine in attack without desperately trying to shift the ball to Fernandes as quickly as possible.",
      "It took until his 300th appearance for the club for others to shoulder more of that responsibility but it’s better late than never. And for his entire Old Trafford career before last weekend it really did feel as though ‘never’ was the far likelier option.",
      "Keane was right when he said “talent is not enough” back in March, and that attitude and application are at least as important in the equation for making the most optimal teams and individuals. But Fernandes always felt like a strange subject to centre that argument around considering the effort he has expended each week for almost six years.",
      "Manchester United have needed more Brunos, more characters, more leaders for far too long. Amorim might finally have got his wish.",
      "Kyle Walker forced Pep Guardiola into doing something he never had as a boss with a decision he ‘didn’t like’, but Burnley are better for his ‘selfish’ call.",
      "In a career where you can fail upwards, we’ve taken our best guess at where every Premier League boss will be come 2030.",
      "Beto. Oh Beto. Nobody is worse than Beto in the Premier League but he is in good company with a £100m footballer.",
      "Eden Hazard has been inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame. Would football have a place for him and his massive arse now?",
      "There are very real and very important updates on Marc Guehi’s transfer status from a top source, among the rest of the usual Mediawatch nonsense.",
      "We could see Brendan Rodgers at West Ham, but where’s the fun in that? For his sake and ours, it’s time to take the Brendan Show to the international stage."

      "By Danyal Khan and Rob Dorsett",
      "Tuesday 28 October 2025 14:51, UK",
      "Manchester United bosses are quietly satisfied with their progress after securing three straight wins for the first time in 18 months - but know there is still much to do before the men's team can compete regularly at the top of the table.",
      "The team's recent run of impressive results has not been met with overt celebrations in the executive offices at the Carrington training ground. Rather, it has reassured the club hierarchy that the tough decisions taken are starting to have an impact on the pitch and strengthened their resolve to continue with the long-term plan.",
      "Ruben Amorim has targeted a place in Europe for next season, and certainly chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox would be satisfied with a top-six finish. As Amorim continues to develop his squad, no one at the club is getting too high when the team are on a positive run, or too low when results are disappointing.",
      "Crucially, while there is abundant noise outside Old Trafford calling for some heavy investment in the squad in January, among the executives there is a determination to stick to the plan. United are not expected to spend big in the New Year.",
      "A new defensive midfield player is the priority to strengthen the squad, after last summer's focus on attacking areas. But because a No 6 is likely to mean a significant level of investment - with Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba all under consideration - it is much more likely to be addressed in the summer, as part of a broader review of the squad and the overall wage bill.",
      "The strategy was successful in the summer in terms of reducing a bloated and expensive squad, moving on many of the big-earning players who weren't part of Amorim's plans. But there is also an awareness that the futures of a number of Manchester United's highest-profile players are still up in the air.",
      "However determined Marcus Rashford is to pursue his career away from Manchester, he still has two-and-a-half years remaining on his United contract. Harry Maguire and Casemiro are both out of contract in the summer, and so any decision to let either move on would free up a significant chunk in the squad salary budget. Rasmus Hojlund's substantive move to Napoli is only guaranteed should Antonio Conte's side make the Champions League.",
      "All of those considerations will impact what incoming transfer business United can do, but there is a determination to avoid some of the recruitment mistakes of the past, which saw too many big names on big salaries sitting in the big Old Trafford stands.",
      "The summer focus on strengthening the attack seems to be paying dividends. Manchester United's xG has actually been lower over the last three matches compared to the first six games of the season - but the statistics make it clear United are being much more clinical in front of goal, with a very impressive 20 per cent of their shots producing goals this month, compared to just 7.4 per cent previously.",
      "The style of play has been tweaked, too, with United going more direct. Over the last three matches, they've averaged less than 44 per cent possession compared with over 53 per cent for the rest of the season. And with Senne Lammens between the posts, he has kicked long for almost 85 per cent of the time, compared to 43 per cent and 56 per cent under Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir, respectively.",
      "United had no plans to change goalkeeper in the summer, despite their long-term interest in Lammens. But Onana's dip in form, and Jadon Sancho's wages being removed from the overall bill, meant a deal could be done for the 23-year-old.",
      "The stats suggest he has made a difference on the pitch. A 78.6 per cent save rate is more than 11 per cent better than Onana's, and more than 25 per cent ahead of Bayindir.",
      "It is also significant that the focus on Amorim's chosen formation of three central defenders has waned.",
      "But there have been signs in the last few games that the Portuguese coach has adopted a more flexible approach to his team structure. Even though Manchester United line up with three at the back, that sometimes becomes a four when they are defending, with one or both of the wing-backs dropping deeper.",
      "An increasingly positive mood is becoming obvious to those inside Carrington. After the defeat to Brentford last month, it would have been characteristic of the recent United past for stories to start leaking out about certain players being unhappy, or others losing faith in the head coach. There were no such stories this time, which suggests there is greater unity in the squad than has been seen for a while, and a widespread buy-in to the coaching methods.",
      "United's bosses know they are still in the early stages of their revolution. And they expect some rocky roads ahead as they search for stability and, ultimately, silverware.",
      "But, for the time being at least, all is quiet at Carrington, as the club's power brokers feel things are moving in the right direction.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Analysing some of the biggest talking points from the latest round of Premier League matches, including a new wave of set-piece creativity, Man City's lack of identity and Man Utd's recent momentum after three wins on the spin",
      "Monday 27 October 2025 14:28, UK",
      "Before Super Sunday, Everton were the only team yet to concede from a set-piece in the Premier League. Given the prolificacy of set-piece goals this season that fact is impressive. What followed in a 3-0 defeat to Thomas Frank's Tottenham, though, was Micky van de Ven tucking away twice from corners.",
      "It would seem no team is immune to the set-piece phenomenon sweeping through the league.",
      "This is not a radically new idea. And it's a matter of personal preference as to whether this development is having a positive or negative effect on entertainment value. Fashion isn't always about aesthetics. Sometimes it's about practicality. If the best wearing pair of jeans only look good on the hanger, then really they serve no purpose at all.",
      "Nineteen per cent of all English top-flight goals this season have come via corners (45/241), the highest proportion ever in a Premier League campaign. Arsenal are the masters of this art. Gabriel is so effective, in fact, Jamie Carragher has called him the \"most influential player in the league\" right now.",
      "It's true that Mikel Arteta has got his team delivering machine-like efficiency. Arsenal have scored 11 goals via set-pieces this season, two more than any other side (Chelsea are second on nine). 69 per cent of goals scored in 2025/26, in fact, have come via set-pieces (11/16). Arteta's squad has been assembled with physicality and power purposefully to operate in such a way. But they are not the only ones.",
      "Brentford have made the long throw their party piece, scoring eight times via that method since the season began. Michael Kayode catapults the ball into the mixer and asks a team-mate to make first contact. That bit is fundamental. And then it's about who reacts quickest. At the weekend it was Dango Ouattara to spark a 3-2 victory over reigning champions Liverpool. Every side are susceptible to this type of threat if it's choreographed well enough.",
      "If only Tony Pulis' Stoke side were alive and kicking to relish in this era.",
      "Romanticists might call this evolution boring, but it's actually initiating a levelling out of the league. Bournemouth, who have used set-piece threat to good effect five times this season, are second in the table. Spurs, boasting the same success rate from dead-ball situations, are third.",
      "Frank has long been an advocate of the benefits of set-piece ability because it offers realistic marginal gains. It's a product of dedicated training ground practice. When pass-heavy football was all the rage it was less transferable because far fewer players, often costing huge sums, have the specialist talent to play that way. They were ring-fenced for the top clubs.",
      "The formula is equally true of both ends of the table. Those teams who concede from set-pieces most regularly - Nottingham Forest and West Ham, both 10 - are 18th and 19th respectively. There is little point in resisting or ignoring the shift. \"If you're not doing it, you look like a bit of a dinosaur as a coach,\" said Jamie Redknapp on Super Sunday.",
      "This new, or perhaps just elevated, manuscript is here to stay. And if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.",
      "When Manchester City were the Premier League's most potent emerging force in the early 2010s, before Pep Guardiola, managers at the very top of the game criticised City's lack of clear identity. Carlo Ancelotti, when at Chelsea, once said City had \"skill and ability\" but were \"not a team\".",
      "Not once has that ever been said of a side under Guardiola's charge - not in any part of Europe. Not at Barcelona, not at Bayern Munich and never previously at Manchester City - until now. The scars from last year's well-documented meltdown are having a lasting effect on Pep's newly-shaped squad. And it's unclear exactly what they stand for.",
      "City's most recent defeat to Aston Villa - their third of the season - was indicative of a side caught between the style change that has glorified set-pieces over pretty passing patterns. Pep has publicly professed to want to embrace what he calls \"modern football\" but a lot of the ideas go against the fibres of what made him so famously successful at every club he's managed. He was the ultimate philosophy coach.",
      "Gary Neville has been critical of this recent erosion. \"Man City aren't even good to watch any more,\" he said on this week's podcast. \"They look like they can be beat in any game of football. The play is like a hybrid between direct, old Pep in terms of passing, a bit scruffy - I'm not quite sure what it is.\"",
      "This period of flux is evidently difficult to control for a perfectionist manager. Guardiola is not going to be enlisting the long throw any time soon. City are actually the only Premier League side yet to score from a set-piece this season, which gives an indication of just how seriously, or not, Pep has welcomed these new rules of engagement.",
      "Their latest downfall was engineered by a brilliantly worked Matty Cash strike, and it came from a corner.",
      "It was City's first loss since August, and just the second time they've failed to score all season, but their repeated predictability has meant falling short far more times than is necessary to seriously challenge for the Premier League crown.",
      "Guardiola blamed \"the last action\", needing \"to shoot better or to cross better,\" but really it was a lack of ideas that cost. And if City aren't strangulating teams in possession like they once were - keeping the ball in such a methodical way that opposition sides got fed up of chasing - then what exactly are they doing?",
      "Being more direct with fast wingers is ok if you have got the physicality to cope when play breaks down and City without the lesser-seen Rodri, arguably, do not. They won just 42 per cent of ground duels at Villa Park. Not for the first time, Unai Emery got his tactical setup spot on.",
      "Back to the drawing board for Pep, then. City need a new plan B.",
      "In case you didn't hear over the weekend, and you would have to live under a rock not to, Manchester United have won three consecutive Premier League games in the same season for the first time since February 2024. Ruben Amorim is nothing if not persistent, and his will has finally been rewarded.",
      "As he himself noted in the press room at Old Trafford after making a comfortable win over Brighton look difficult, though, a sense of \"suffering\" seems to surround Man Utd before any positive outcome is reached.",
      "Only they can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. How can a performance so assured coincide with one so fraught with nervousness? Perhaps we will never know. This seems to be Amorim's brand and for now it's working.",
      "What is clear and admirable about this version of Man Utd, which is all the more tangible when you watch from the terraces of Old Trafford, is how devoted the players are to the manager's cause. \"The players really like Amorim,\" Neville said over the weekend. \"He's authentic and honest. The players want to do well for him.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes in a sacrificial midfield role, Amad at wing-back, and Luke Shaw's willingness to slot into a back three are all evidence of the buy-in. The stars of this latest triumph, however, were undoubtedly Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo - recruited to fit a style that is starting to show promise.",
      "While Pep's might be lost in the post, Amorim has got the modern football memo. This is not a side who are going to dazzle with intricate build-up, but can clearly sustain threat with fast, direct play that puts Cunha and Mbeumo at the heart of each attacking phase.",
      "Cunha's opener was also evidence of his maverick quality, which is helpful too. Since the start of last season no player has scored more times from outside the box than him (seven).",
      "\"We feel like we can solve anything,\" Amorim said with a smile on Saturday, later revealing he enjoyed the performance against Brighton better than beating Liverpool the week prior. \"It was more complete,\" he added. Some semblance of coherence is certainly building but Amorim was right to caveat his excitement with realism. He cannot afford to get complacent.",
      "Trips to Nottingham Forest and Tottenham in consecutive weeks will stress-test just how much progress has really been made."

It's an art.",

      "Manchester United capitalised on recent momentum by beating Brighton at Old Trafford as Matheus Cunha scored his first club goal in a frantic and somewhat controversial 4-2 win.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side seem to be one of contrasting fortunes as a torrid start to this season has made way for a particularly productive recent period, with three wins on the spin propelling them, temporarily at least, into the top four.",
      "Man Utd had lost six of their last seven league games against Brighton and rode their luck at times in the first half, needing some wasteful finishing from Danny Welbeck to pave the way for two goals in 10 minutes, scored by Cunha and Casemiro. The opener was sumptuous, the second via a harsh deflection much more fortunate.",
      "Bruno Fernandes should have made it three before Bryan Mbeumo did, driving a devilishly clever strike through Lewis Dunk's legs, despite an obvious foul by Luke Shaw on Georginio Rutter in the phase before. And that was not the only decision under scrutiny on the night.",
      "Man Utd have led by 2+ goals at half time in three consecutive Premier League games at Old Trafford for the first time since November 2008.",
      "Neither referee Anthony Taylor nor VAR awarded Amad a penalty when he was upended by Maxim De Cuyper in the first half, because the defender supposedly \"played the ball\", while Patrick Dorgu only received a yellow for a last-ditch foul on Yankuba Minteh - albeit the forward had probably lost control of possession when the whistle finally went.",
      "The drama did not stop there. Welbeck latterly made his presence felt when guiding a belting free-kick beyond Senne Lammens to rid him of a second consecutive clean sheet, before Charalampos Kostoulas arrived from the bench to force what looked to be a needlessly tense end.",
      "Mbeumo had other ideas, though, finding the net in the 96th minute with an emphatic finish to round off a frenzied finale, with Gary Neville praising Amorim for his \"best and most important week in the job\".",
      "\"The narrative coming into this game was that Manchester United couldn't take a step back after what happened at Anfield last week and the win today was absolutely crucial.",
      "\"I think it has been Ruben Amorim's best and most important week in the job. It gives him a bit of time.",
      "\"I am not saying he's off the hook but Manchester United are up there towards the top of the league and it certainly takes a lot of pressure off him.\"",
      "Only Manchester United can comprehensively beat a team while simultaneously seeming like they survived a major scare. This was definitely a banana skin moment. United's recent record against Brighton is woeful and it's a fixture that always throws up drama. This latest instalment trended similarly.",
      "Just when United draw you in, Old Trafford bouncing with unbridled glee at being 2-0 up, they drop you like a sack of bricks. It was easy to be charmed by the first-half performance but the second proved this fragile side are far from flawless. How can they make things look so easy and so hard all at the same time? It's an art.",
      "Until Bryan Mbeumo slammed home a fourth in stoppage time there was a sense of foreboding seeping into the terraces. You could tangibly feel the atmosphere shift. Of the four big chances the hosts created, three were missed. And yet they still scored four times.",
      "That's what Ruben Amorim means when he emphasised in his press conference that this year's squad contains players who \"fit the style\". He's talking about the quality of Cunha and Mbeumo. A new brand of Manchester United matchwinner.",
      "Without them, this is still an average side very much trying to find its way.",
      "Man Utd: Lammens (6), Yoro (6), De Ligt (7), Shaw (6), Amad (7), Casemiro (7), Fernandes (6), Dalot (6), Mbeumo (8), Cunha (7), Sesko (6).\n\n\nSubs: Heaven (7), Dorgu (6), Mainoo (6), Ugarte (n/a), Zirkzee (n/a). \n\n\nBrighton: Verbruggen (6), De Cuyper (6), Dunk (5), Van Hecke (5), Wieffer (6), Ayari (6), Baleba (5), Minteh (6), Rutter (6), Kadioglu (6), Welbeck (7).\n\n\nSubs: Watson (6), Milner (6), Gomez (6), Kostoulas (6), Tzimas (n/a).\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"The performance was important. We played different games in different moments. It would not be Manchester United without suffering a bit.",
      "\"The best game we did [this season] was against Arsenal, but when you have a different spirit, we are a bit more free playing the game. We have a different confidence.",
      "\"I never had that feeling of embarrassment of not winning games, I felt [Sir] Jim [Ratcliffe] always believed, but to face the fans was difficult in that moment. It's so hard in football, everything can change in one minute.",
      "\"We are improving in the bad moments, and [learning to] respond in a different way. You can feel it with the team. Let's enjoy, but that urgency of this can change must be there.",
      "\"The team play so much better compared to last season. We have players more suited to this type of style. I like more today than last week [beating Liverpool], it was more complete.\"",
      "Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler:",
      "\"It's easy to summarise. Too many easy mistakes. We gave the balls away too easy, like this you can't win the game. We had control and good actions, always created a danger, but in the end it's easy mistakes. [The goals are] like four presents.",
      "\"United pressed well but we have to do the small margins right. We weren't on the highest level and then we make mistakes. When we were in a structure we didn't give away many chances, but it was just the mistakes. We decided the game ended in a negative way. The execution was not good enough.\"",
      "Speaking about the difference in threat of Manchester United from last year to now, Hurzeler said: \"Much more intense, compact, and defending forward. Even more individual quality - money was well invested.\"",
      "Commenting on the officiating performance, he added: \"I will never make the referee responsible for our losses. We have to make it better. We can't lose the ball that easily.\""

      "\"I think where we've all been with it, I wouldn't have been surprised if we talked about him losing his job. I was thinking he was under massive pressure after going into the international break in October. I felt as though that change could be imminent.",
      "\"But the victory at Anfield shows you how things can turn around and then obviously this was so important today.",
      "\"He's not out of the woods yet and it's certainly not time to get carried away but I think Manchester United are now where they thought they probably would be.",
      "\"They'll slip down a couple of places after the rest of the teams play and they'll end up in sixth or seventh but that's where I think everyone thought they would be.",
      "\"So, look, this has been a very important week for the manager and for the club and you can see the celebration at the end there was more than just a little bit of relief that, yeah, we needed this badly.",
      "\"A few weeks ago I was a little bit worried that the players didn't believe in Ruben Amorim's system, that maybe there was an element of them not winning matches and starting to question it, listening to the noise that all of us, including myself, had added to that.",
      "\"However, one thing that's been absolutely not in doubt when you speak to people in and around the club is that the players really like him as a person and that does count for a lot.",
      "\"Because I think there's no doubt he's not lost the dressing room in terms of spirit and energy and how they feel towards him. They want to play for him, they're desperate to win and you've seen that coming together a little bit in the last week.",
      "\"I mean, winning at Anfield in any season is special but for Ruben Amorim to win at Anfield when it was so unexpected, that has given them such a big lift.",
      "\"We'll look forward to the game next week against Nottingham Forest, Tottenham away the week after. There's still a big job to do in this month but I felt as though it was a month of reckoning. If it had started badly last week at Liverpool, it could have gone a different way.",
      "\"It feels very different, it feels like the momentum's with them a little bit and the spirit's good.\"",
      "Neville pointed to Mbeumo and Cunha's encouraging form when asked what he still wants to see to be convinced by United.",
      "\"I suppose consistency. It's been a team and a club that you can't really rely on for so long.",
      "\"The idea of winning two or three matches doesn't take that away. You can't build that trust back in an instant. That's still not there but I think that there's something happening there.",
      "\"With Mbeumo and Cunha the risk was removed from those signings in the sense that they've been in the Premier League before and they've got that hunger to deliver at a different level.",
      "\"There was a lot of things about those signings that you felt more comfortable with and when I look at United now and Mbeumo looks like he belongs, he looks hungry, he looks like he wants to score goals.",
      "\"It wasn't quite happening for him and Cunha in the first maybe four or five matches when they were getting into the positions they always wanted the ball but they weren't maybe taking their chances.",
      "\"But Manchester United have got something to build on. Those two will win a lot of football matches for this club.",
      "\"If you can keep that back five compact and among them there's some decent defenders, half-decent defenders, that back five can just stay solid and the midfield in front, let them two up front go and do what they do.",
      "\"I think it could be sort of a recipe for Manchester United to have a decent season to get into the top six.\"",
      "The third member of United's attacking triumvirate has not made such a big impression just yet. Benjamin Sesko came back into the team after being benched for the win at Liverpool but did not get among the goals.",
      "\"There are question marks over Sesko,\" said Neville. \"He obviously was a bigger risk of a signing and a lot more of an unknown. He doesn't quite look like he's settled in yet.",
      "\"It's more than the goals. It's the inclusion within the actual combinations that you see from the others. You see Bruno Fernandes and [Mason] Mount, who wasn't playing today, but you see those two linking very successfully with Mbeumo and Cunha.",
      "\"You don't quite see Sesko being part of that mix yet. He's not got up to speed in the pace of it, of how quickly they're playing with each other. He needs to get his game up to speed.",
      "\"That'll only come through time and obviously he's still quite young. But he just does need to get there because it's a big signing still, he's £80m. If they can become a front three, then obviously that'll be huge.. At the moment it feels to me like a two with another guy stood up there occupying space.",
