      "Saudi boxing supremo Turki Alalshikh did not mince his words after hearing of Ruben Amorim's brutal sacking.",
      "United said in a statement issued on Monday morning that the Portuguese, who took charge in November 2024, had left the role, with the club’s leadership having “reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change”. The club added in the statement: “This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.”",
      "Many have been left shocked by the decision, and it has not taken long for Alalshikh to offer his verdict. Rather than sharing a few words about the departed boss, the 44-year-old instead opted to throw a cheeky verbal jab at the Glazers. Taking to social media, he wrote: \"Praise be to God … finally … may the Glazer [family] follow soon.\"",

      "Alalshikh has become a prominent figure in the world of boxing, bringing several world class fights to Saudi Arabia, but has a glittering CV across other sports. He owned Spanish football club Almeria from 2019 until earlier this year, as well as owning Egyptian club Pyramids FC between 2018 and 2019.",
      "Back in September, reports emerged that he was reportedly preparing a bid to buy Championship side Bristol City. Alalshikh has grabbed the headlines over the last few months, but not because of his escapades in the world of boxing. In October, the 44-year-old sent United fans into frenzy after claiming a takeover for the club was at an advanced stage.",
      "Posting on his X account, he declared: \"The best news I heard today is that Manchester United is now in an advanced stage of completing a deal to sell to a new investor. I hope he's better than the previous owners.\" The post emerged merely hours after an interview with United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe was published, in which he offered no hint of plans to surrender control at Old Trafford.",

      "Tyson Fury gave up watching Manchester United during Ruben Amorim's leadership after admitting that the Premier League giants were 's***.'",
      "The former two-time heavyweight world champion grew up watching the Red Devils triumph across all competitions, and has visited Old Trafford countless times. However, since Sir Alex Ferguson's departure in 2013, the club have endured a tough period.",
      "United have only picked up five major titles since Ferguson left the club, but have failed to pick up a league title in over a decade. The top outfit showed signs of a potential resurgence under Dutchman Erik ten Hag after the Red Devils scored a stunning 2-1 FA Cup final victory over noisy neighbours Manchester City in May 2024 - despite their torrid league finish.",
      "However, the club failed to push on. Five months later, Ten Hag was out of the job, and was quickly replaced by Amorim. The ex-Sporting Lisbon manager was highly-rated by many across teams in Europe, but failed to became a fan-favourite at Old Trafford. The club finished 15th in the table last season, as well as suffering an agonising defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "All Out Fighting is your one-stop shop for all things boxing and MMA, two of the world’s most popular sports - from exclusive interviews, to insight from the biggest world title fights and the most bizarre influencer bouts. Visit www.alloutfighting.com for more!",
      "Amid their downfall, Fury has well and truly given up on the Red Devils altogether due to Amorim’s stuttering tenure. Instead, the 'Gypsy King's' loyalties now lie with horse racing. The 37-year-old much favours a day at the races as opposed to watching his football team suffer.",
      "Back in August, the Morecambe brawler spent Bank Holiday Monday at Cartmel, where two of his horses were running. At the time of speaking, United were 16th in the league table after a torrid start to the new Premier League campaign. \"I'm not a supporter of football really,\" he admitted. \"I used to support United but because they're in the s*** now I'm no supporter of any football teams anymore. I used to support England as well but when they lost to Iceland in the Euros in 2016 that was me and football completely done with. Now I'm into horse racing, get up!\"",
      "Since the interview, though, things have started to get slightly better for the Manchester giants. The club currently sit sixth in the league, just three points behind fourth placed Liverpool. Not only that, Fury may now decide to give up horse racing and switch his allegiances to football once again after the Red Devils confirmed the sacking of Amorim on Monday morning.",
      "Following the club's 1-1 draw with Leeds on Sunday, Amorim sent a rather blunt message to the board in his post-match press conference, and has since been dismissed. Former United midfielder Darren Fletcher - who currently manages the under-18s - is expected to take charge of the first time side for their game against Burnley on Wednesday night.",
      "The decision has been made by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox. The Athletic reports that the Manchester outfit could leave Fletcher in charge as interim manager until the end of the current campaign, before appointing a full-time replacement. A statement from United read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish. The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "When asked on Sunday whether he had confidence from the United board, Amorim sensationally hit back, replying: \"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" he said.",
      "\"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me. I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on.",
      "\"That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach. If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticises of everything, we need to change the club. No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has been sacked, and Manchester United are back in the market for a new manager. Just hours after stating that he will not walk away from his role, Amorim has been handed his marching orders.",

      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" Amorim told reporters. \"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United.",

      "The former Manchester United midfielder will be in charge against Burnley, stepping up from his role with the club's academy. It's not impossible to think that Fletcher could take on the job until the end of the season if he does well.",
      "Another former Manchester United midfielder, and crucially, he is available. The 44-year-old departed Middlesbrough last year and has since been working with UEFA, but perhaps could provide a fast option to lead the club on a temporary basis.",
      "Carrick has filled in as caretaker manager before, has a stature that demands respect, and knows the club better than most.",
      "The former England boss' name is bound to crop up with United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe being a fan. Sporting director Jason Wilcox is also said to respect the work of Southgate, but United did go in another direction in appointing Amorim in the first place.",
      "Southgate, of course, is currently available but has not managed in club football for more than 16 years.",
      "Perhaps an unlikely option given his connection to Manchester City, but a newly available figure who has previously coached rather than managed. The Italian is said to have been discontent with the control exerted over him at Stamford Bridge before his exit, so the details would have to be fine-tuned, however.",
      "The Bournemouth coach is only under contract until the summer and has completed an impressive job on the south coast. Iraola has dealt with a squad that has seen plenty of change occur outside of his control and still ensured the Cherries remain competitive.",
      "Another coach whose contract is dwindling. Glasner guided Crystal Palace to their first trophy last term, but ultimately ended up frustrated with their efforts in the transfer market.",
      "The Austrian, like Iraola, could provide a solid option with Premier League experience if United can hang on until the end of the season to make their move.",

      "Ruben Amorim has left Manchester United following his forthright comments after the stalemate with Leeds United on Sunday. The Portuguese manager's comments cast doubt over his position, and this time United's higher-ups decided enough was enough.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,\" United said in a statement. \"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.",
      "\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "While results have been underwhelming at times, Amorim's comments have also attracted plenty of scrutiny. Things came to a head after the 1-1 draw at Elland Road, in what would prove to be his final post-match outburst as the man in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" Amorim told reporters.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "We've seen before that a tirade from the boss hasn't always sparked action from up high, including early on when significant pressure surrounded Amorim during his debut season as he made a slow start after succeeding Erik ten Hag. \"I know that if we don't win, regardless if they pay the buyout or not, every manager is in danger,\" he acknowledged in December 2024.",
      "The subsequent month, whilst not explicitly suggesting resignation, he recognised the decline since taking over from Erik ten Hag in the technical area. \"In ten games in the Premier League, we won two,\" he acknowledged following a loss to Brighton.",
      "\"Imagine what this is for a fan of Manchester United. Imagine what this is for me. We are getting a new coach that is losing more than the last coach. I have full knowledge of that.",
      "\"We are being the worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United. I know that you want headlines, but I'm saying that because we have to acknowledge that and to change that. Here you go, your headlines.\"",
      "A solid Europa League run took United within 90 minutes of a trophy in Amorim's first season, and victory in the final could have compensated for domestic woes. However, when United were defeated by Spurs in Bilbao, the manager said he was willing to walk away the very next day if that's what the board desired.",
      "\"In this moment, I am not going to be here defending myself, [it] is not my style,\" he said. \"I cannot do it, is really hard for me. So I have nothing to show to the fans to say I am going to improve because of this, I had these problems, I will not do nothing.",
      "\"In this moment, it's a little bit of faith. So let's see. Like I said before, coming here before in the flash, I am always open. If the board and fans feel that I'm not the right guy, I will go the next day without any conversation about compensation.",
      "\"But I will not quit again. I am really confident in my job and, as you can see, I will not change nothing in the way I do things.\"",
      "United splashed out over the summer, spending more than £200m on Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Senne Lammens. However, just weeks into the new season, he was once again hinting at a change in the United dugout after a dismal Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town.",
      "\"We played badly for 30 minutes against Fulham. And then that kind of performance, I was really disappointed with everything,\" Amorim said. \"But now it's a new game and I'm focused on the next one.",
      "\"If you are in one way, if you have this kind of behaviour, you have to understand that you have things that is good on that type of behaviour, that you have the other side of the coin. So I understand that.",
      "\"And again, sometimes I want to quit, sometimes I want to be here for 20 years, sometimes I love to be with my players, sometimes I don't want to be with them. So, again, I need to improve on that. It's going to be hard. But now I'm good with the next one.\"",
      "He made no apologies for his feelings, stating: \"I'm going to say that sometimes I hate my players, sometimes I love my players, sometimes I want to defend my players.",
      "\"I think this is my way of doing things and I'm going to be like that. And I felt that in that moment I was so frustrated and [annoyed]. And I know, again, that you have a lot of experienced people talking about the way I should perform with the media, to be more constant, to be more calm. I'm not going to be like that.",
      "\"So I'm trying to accept that and I'm going to be who I am. That's why I have the passion that I have.\"",
      "Amorim's recent remarks have elicited a reaction from Gary Neville, who has observed a shift in the Portuguese manager's attitude of late. \"Something has happened in the last week which means that Amorim is starting to unleash a little bit,\" the former United captain said on the Gary Neville podcast.",
      "\"It looks to me that he is not happy with something in the hierarchy. Obviously something is annoying him - he's obviously not feeling the support. He's obviously letting go.",
      "\"When you say that you came to the club as a manager, I thought he was appointed as the head coach and quite clearly appointed to coach the team.\"",
      "It was clear during Amorim's brief tenure that he was not afraid to risk his position. However, the post-Leeds comments proved to be one challenge too many.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Amorim was appointed as Erik ten Hag's permanent replacement at United in November 2024 after Ruud van Nistelrooy enjoyed a successful four-game reign as interim head coach.",
      "The former Sporting CP boss signed a two-and-a-half year deal at Old Trafford and made a fast start to life at the Red Devils, winning two of his opening three matches in charge.",
      "However, United's form ebbed and flowed from that point on, with the Red Devils progressing in the Europa League but faltering in the Premier League. Indeed, Amorim's side dropped into the bottom half in the top flight and ended up finishing 15th - their lowest-ever finish in 50 years.",
      "But, after United reached the Europa League final, Amorim kept his job and was backed in the summer with the club's board spending more than £200million on new players. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko were the three high-profile players that arrived through the doors.",
      "Although United's Premier League form has improved this season, winning eight and drawing seven of their 20 top-flight fixtures, it hasn't been enough for Amorim to keep his position.",

      "Manchester United have reportedly dismissed Ruben Amorim from his role as manager. The Portuguese coach has departed Old Trafford after a difficult 14 months in charge, with his final game ending in a 1-1 draw away at Leeds United on Sunday. United currently sit sixth in the Premier League, having finished last season in 15th place and suffered defeat in the Europa League final.",
      "According to The Athletic, the decision to part ways with Amorim was made by the club’s leadership team, including chief executive Omar Berada and director of football Jason Wilcox, following a breakdown in relations behind the scenes. Former United midfielder and current Under-18s coach Darren Fletcher will step in as interim manager. Fletcher is expected to take charge for Wednesday night’s away match at Burnley, with a permanent appointment not anticipated until the summer.",
      "Tensions reportedly escalated after the draw at Elland Road, when Amorim delivered an unusual rant, insisting he saw himself as the “manager” of United rather than just the “head coach.” “It’s going to be like this for 18 months or until the board decide to change,” Amorim said. “That was my point, I want to finish with that. I’m not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy comes here to replace me.”",
      "The bookies have moved quickly with this and already former Scottish international Fletcher has been earmarked as the favourite for the permanent role at Old Trafford. Bookies BetVictor have put him in at 6/4 favourites with current Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner at 4/1 along with Enzo Maresca and Michael Carrick.",
      "The next half of the season will see huge build up as to who will take over at Old Trafford as they look to bring back consistent success to Sir Matt Busby Way and it is possible Glasner may well consider his options. The Palace head coach guided the club to FA Cup victory last year and enjoying a season campaign with European football for the first time in the club's history.",
      "However, there has been doubt over his long-term future at Selhurst Park and has been linked with the United job in the past. It is thought that he will leave the club when his contract ends this summer meaning United have the chance to bring in a successful manager in England for free.",

      "Ruben Amorim has been sacked as the Manchester United head coach after just over 13 months in the role after relationships with the club's bosses reached boiling point.",
      "His final match was Sunday's 1-1 draw with Leeds at Elland Road, where he fired shots at some of his superiors in the post-match press conference. Amorim claimed that he wanted more power - taking aim at his head coach title - and also suggested he was ready to leave when his contract expired in 18 months.",
      "The club have since acted and the Athletic claims that Darren Fletcher is set to take over on an interim basis. Ineos sacked Erik ten Hag early last year and pursued the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss, but already his tenure has come to an end.",
      "Amorim has been criticised for his refusal to veer from his philosophy but last year lost in the Europa League final whilst he presided over their worst ever Premier League finish - ending in 15th.",
      "We'll keep you up to date across this massive breaking story.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co came in to take charge of the club's football operations sometime ago, but a number of their decisions have not paid off.",
      "In short, they are not proving themselves capable of managing the big calls.",
      "They backed Erik ten Hag with a new contract, gave him some serious cash, sacked him soon after.",
      "They hired Ruben Amorim, backed him, gave him cash, and have now sacked.",
      "If ever they needed to get their next appoint right - it is now.",
      "The Telegraph claims that the Old Trafford hierarchy sacked Amorim partly because they have not seen enough signs of evolution or progress to warrant keeping the Portuguese coach in his role.",
      "They have played down the idea of power struggles within the four walls, although that didn't appear to be the case when Amorim let rip in his press conference yesterday.",
      "Well these comments haven't aged well - only in October did Sir Jim Ratcliffe claim that Amorim needs three years to prove he is a \"great\" coach",
      "He told the Times' The Business podcast: \"He has not had the best of seasons. Ruben needs to demonstrate he is a great coach over three years. That's where I would be.\"",
      "Ratcliffe also claimed: \"The press, sometimes I don't understand. They want overnight success. They think it's a light switch. You know, you flick a switch and it's all going to be roses tomorrow. You can't run a club like Manchester United on knee-jerk reactions to some journalist who goes off on one every week.\"",

      "Some pundits believe Amorim has been looking for a way out of the club.",
      "When you say this, do you leave the club much of an option?",
      "Amorim claimed: \"I know that my name is not Tuchel, is not Conte, is not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change. That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until other guy is coming here to replace me.",

      "Read the full transcript here.",
      "I mean its not great reading is it.",
      "He was in charge for 63 games. Amorim won 24, drew 18 and lost 21. A win percentage of 38 is not up to par for a Man Utd manager.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.",
      "\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "Another manager axed, another interim. Darren Fletcher is the man to lead the club going forward and it seems as though he could be there for a while.",
      "Reports claim that the club will wait until THE SUMMER to appoint a permanent replacement. That is a long time to hand the reigns to someone who never planned to lead one of the biggest clubs in the world.",
      "Well yes and no. On the face of it his record is that of a manager who would get the chop.",
      "But Man Utd had looked to back their head coach. They could've sacked him last season but stuck by him and there had been green shoots.",
      "Yet here we are again, the Man Utd bosses have chosen to sack a second manager in less than 15 months. Ultimately his press conference yesterday almost gave the club no choice.",
      "Massive news to begin the week - Man Utd have sacked Amorim.",
      "We kn ew that things weren't well after yesterday's press conference, but this is a huge move."

      "And the final straw came on Sunday after Amorim took aim the hierarchy amid mounting tension over the direction of the club. The Red Devils have now confirmed his departure with a statement released.",

      "United did reach the Europa League final - where they were beaten by Tottenham - but also registered their worst ever Premier League finish, ending the season in 15th.",
      "The Red Devils then spent big in the summer, completely revamping their forward line with the arrivals of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha costing more than £200million.",
      "But United have still been inconsistent in the Premier League this term, winning eight times, drawing seven and losing five of their 20 matches. That included a run of just one victory in their last five matches, culminating in a 1-1 draw with Leeds at Elland Road on Sunday.",
      "It was following that clash that Amorim took aim at the club's hierarchy and hinted at his dissatisfaction at the current situation. He said: \"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, is not [Antonio] Conte, is not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United,\" he ranted. \"It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change.

      "Manchester United have taken the shock decision to SACK Ruben Amorim after his extraordinary rant following the draw at Leeds. Amorim sent a blunt message to the United board in his post-match press conference and has been dismissed the following day.",
      "United have taken immediate action after the 1-1 draw at Elland Road, sacking Amorim after 14 months in charge. Former United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who is currently the under-18s coach, will take charge of the team for their Premier League game against Burnley on Wednesday night.",
      "The decision has been made by chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox. The Athletic reports that United could leave Fletcher in charge as interim manager until the end of the season, before appointing a full-time replacement.",

      "Asked if he had confidence from the United board on Sunday, Amorim went on a remarkable rant. \"Guys, to stop with that, and I noticed that you received selective information about everything. I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear,\" he said.",

No, no guys, I would say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. Every department, the scouting department, the sport director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on. Thank you, guys.\"",
      "Amorim was appointed to replace Erik ten Hag as United manager in November 2024. He oversaw a miserable debut campaign with United finishing a lowly 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final to Tottenham.",
      "The club currently sits sixth in the Premier League following back-to-back 1-1 draws against Wolves and Leeds. Amorim leaves having won just 24 of his 63 matches in charge after arriving from Sporting Lisbon 14 months ago.",
      "Tensions have boiled over his recent weeks due to frustration from Amorim over his involvement in the club's transfer policy. The United boss has previously hinted at a disagreement with the club hierarchy over plans for the January transfer window.",
      "\"I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and need time,\" he said on Christmas Eve. \"I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt.\"",
      "Amorim has been hampered by a raft of injuries, including to club captain Bruno Fernandes, while Bryan Mbeumo, Amad and Noussair Mazraoui are away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations. United have won just three of their last 11 league games, with the Premier League their only focus after they failed to qualify for Europe and were knocked out of the Carabao Cup in humiliating fashion by Grimsby at the start of the season.",

      "Consequently, one of Mbeumo or Mazraoui could potentially be available for the FA Cup clash against Brighton and Hove Albion on 11 January, though the Manchester derby against Manchester City on January 17 seems more realistic. Mbeumo has found form elusive at this winter's Afcon.",
      "Despite providing an assist against Gabon during the group stages, the 26-year-old hasn't contributed to any goals since. Prior to a group stage match against Mozambique, Cameroon boss David Pagou suggested Mbeumo might be placing excessive pressure on himself to perform.",
      "\"He's putting too much pressure on himself, but I think he will manage that,\" Pagou said. \"He's a great footballer, a great player, even for this country.",
      "\"He loves this team and really wants to commit to being ‌as effective as possible. So today, again, in our little chat with him, the desire is there to be present, to ⁠step up, and to do great things.\"",

      "United's head coach Amorim has also raised questions about his long-term future at the club, suggesting he may depart when his contract runs out in 18 months.

      "Matheus Cunha has told Joshua Zirkzee that he needs to forget about leaving Manchester United and knuckle down to help the team. Zirkzee has been strongly linked with a move to Roma in the January transfer window but has made two telling contributions for United in recent weeks.",
      "The 24-year-old forward has struggled since joining United for £36.5million from Bologna in 2024. He has failed to hold down a place in Ruben Amorim's starting line-up and has agreed to join Roma in January, according to reports in Italy.",
      "However, he started and scored in the 1-1 draw against Wolves last week and came off the bench to set up Cunha's equaliser in the draw at Leeds on Sunday. With Bryan Mbeumo and Amad away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Zirkzee has become more important for United, throwing his potential exit into doubt.",
      "The Dutchman has reportedly met with Roma's sporting director Ricky Massara and has been assured by manager Gian Piero Gasparini that he will fit into their system. But Cunha has pleaded with his team-mate to stay put, swallow his pride and help United during this difficult spell.",
      "\"Josh is a pleasure,\" he told Match of the Day. \"I feel like he has a lot of quality. Of course, his situation is not easy, but he has everything to change the situation. We need him. He needs to understand this and then everyone can count on him.",
      "\"But yeah, we are here to push him. And I think after the goal last week and the assist today, I think it will give him confidence to be more with us and then understand more his role in the team.\"",
      "Amorim's view of Zirkzee was evident in the starting line-up he named at Elland Road on Sunday, with the forward left on the bench alongside a whole host of academy players. However, Zirkzee made a huge difference when he came off the bench for Leny Yoro in the second half and produced a moment of quality to play in Cunha for the equaliser.",
      "His performance earned praise from his manager post-match. \"It's really important,\" Amorim said. \"I think Ben [Sesko] improved in the connection today. Josh, the 20 minutes that he played, he was active.",
      "\"He was creating chances, creating spaces for us. It's important. Also, Manu [Ugarte] played better today and helped the team also to create chances. So it was better than last week.\"",
      "Zirkzee has started just four Premier League games this season following the £200m arrivals of Sesko, Cunha and Mbeumo in the summer transfer window. He has contributed just nine goals and four assists in 63 appearances for United altogether and under different circumstances may have been shown the exit this month.",

      "The Portuguese's issues with Wilcox made it clear there was tension and a battle with one of the club's most influential figures has ended badly for the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss.",
      "talkSPORT reports that one of Amorim's frustrations stem from Wilcox urging him to show some pragmatism tactically. Previously he had stuck defiantly to his 3-4-3 formation, despite its lack of success. In more recent weeks he did go to a back four, but reverted back to type at the weekend.",

      "The United boss has previously hinted at a disagreement with the club hierarchy over plans for the January transfer window. \"I have the feeling that if we have to play a perfect 3-4-3 we need to spend a lot of money and need time,\" he said on Christmas Eve. \"I’m starting to understand that is not going to happen so maybe I have to adapt.\"",
      "Amorim refused to be drawn on the meaning behind those comments in the run-up to United's 1-1 draw against Leeds. But his true feelings came pouring out after the game in remarkable fashion after the game and he was brutally sacked on Monday morning, with United putting Darren Fletcher in charge as interim boss.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, is not [Antonio] Conte, is not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United,\" Amorim ranted on Sunday. \"It's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decided to change.

      "Former United striker Rooney was shocked by Amorim's comments and warned the Portuguese that he is over-playing his hand. His words proved to be spot-on, as the 41-year-old was dismissed hours later.",
      "Asked what he made of Amorim's comments, Rooney said on the Wayne Rooney Show: \"It's strange, interesting. I think his choice of words are decisive, confusing. I think he speaks with a confidence and an authority that he knows he's going to be there as manager (for the next 18 months) and he's going to remain the manager.",
      "\"And that's the only reason I can assume that he speaks with that belief because the last two games haven't been very good. It's quite confusing.\"",
      "He added: \"I don't think he'll have 18 more months if it carries on, I think that's fair to say. I think you need to earn the right to be able to dictate exactly what happens at a football club, especially a football club like Manchester United.",
      "\"If [Pep] Guardiola comes into United for instance, I don't think anyone would question what players he wants to bring in, or the system. I feel for him (Amorim) a little bit because the squad is not good enough, the players he's got on the bench are young academy kids - it's great to see them on the bench, but are they ready at this moment in time? It's very difficult to put young players onto a football pitch when the team is not very good, so I feel for him a little bit.",
      "\"But he's not Pep Guardiola or Jurgen Klopp - he hasn't got that history or that background, so I don't think he should be speaking with that authority in what he is and I just think the words he's saying are very confusing to me.\"",

      "Manchester United could be disappointed in their search for a Ruben Amorim successor if they go after Zinedine Zidane. That's after the World Cup-winner already gave a damning answer concerning a potential contract at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim, 40, has been sacked as United boss after disappointing 1-1 draw away to Leeds on Sunday. In the aftermath, he suggested he'll leave when his contract expires in 18 months, insisting he came to United \"to be the manager, not the coach,\" and took aim at certain board members to focus on their jobs. However, his departure has come much earlier, with the decision made on Monday morning.",
      "United haven't budged from sixth in the Premier League, but there are only four points between them and Crystal Palace in 14th. The campaign is reminiscent of the 2021/22 campaign that saw them finish sixth before Erik ten Hag took over that summer.",
      "It was around the same time Zidane, who has been a free agent since leaving Real Madrid in 2021, gave a direct hint at his prospects of taking over in Manchester. And despite being highly desirable candidate for the position, he nodded to one key impasse that could stop any chance of the switch.",
      "Speaking to L'Equipe at the time, he gave a nine-word response when addressing United rumours specifically, which may suggest he'll never work in the Premier League: \"I understand English, but I don't fully master it.\"",
      "He continued: \"I know that there are coaches who go to clubs without speaking the language, but I work in a different way. Many elements come into play in order to win, it is a global context. I know what I need to win.\"",
      "From that, one might assume Zidane wouldn't be comfortable taking a job in England unless he was fluent in the language. The Frenchman spent the last five years of his playing career at Real before joining the club's advisory board and then climbing the coaching ranks.",
      "It resulted in one of the most prolific managerial spells in history, claiming three Champions League titles, two league wins and two FIFA Club World Cups in only four-and-a-half seasons. United could only dream of such success in their current mould, though their issues run far deeper than coaching selection alone.",
      "Zidane's former France team-mate and fellow 1998 World Cup-winner Emmanuel Petit has since revealed his old colleague has spent time learning English. Speaking to DAZN Bet in 2023, Petit suggested this means Zidane has \"changed his mind about managing a team in England,\" though there's nothing concrete to suggest as much.",
      "There's also the major barrier of a certain vacancy soon to open up at the France helm. Didier Deschamps' highly successful run as boss of Les Bleus will end after the 2026 World Cup, and it's widely believed Zidane is being lined up as his heir.",
      "One can understand why taking control of his national side is a far more attractive prospect than attempting to resuscitate United. However, it may work in Amorim's favour if arguably the best free-agent coaching option on the market doesn't want his job.",
      "From a United perspective, the club needs captain Fernandes back as soon as possible, which Amorim has hinted could be this month. The next obstacle is a trip to Turf Moor to face Burnley on Wednesday, where anything but three points would only encourage speculation Amorim is bound for the exit.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher hammered Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim, saying the Portuguese head coach is a 'barely competent' top-flight manager just hours before his axing. The comments come after the United boss dropped an explosive post-match press conference following the draw with Leeds United, hitting out at United's sporting director, Jason Wilcox, and former defender Gary Neville.",
      "Amorim said he wanted to be the manager of the team, not a head coach, wanting control of every department, including scouting. He then namedropped Gary Neville and called on Wilcox to do his job, while Amorim did his own.",
      "However, that proved to be his downfall as the Portuguese boss was ruthlessly axed by United, who confirmed the news in a statement on Monday morning.",
      "It read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.",
      "\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "\"It started to look like maybe he was getting somewhere moving to a back four, he went back to five at the back against Wolves and it brought possibly one of the worst performances of the season from a team. No matter what it is, I don't think he is in any position whatsoever to be questioning the people who appointed him.",
      "\"He's not good enough. He's not good enough to be Manchester United's manager. He's barely competent enough to be a Premier League manager right now. That's not me being disrespectful to Amorim.",
      "\"He's been there well over 12 months now and I think almost all managers in the Premier League who are managing different clubs at different ends of the table would look at Manchester United and think 'I'd get more points than that.' This is a guy who said at one stage this is possibly the worst Manchester United team in history. He's managing it.\"",
      "Responding to the idea that Amorim had not been backed, Carragher said: \"He's been more than backed. He couldn't have had too many complaints if the club parted company with him in the summer, with how poor it was last season.",
      "\"They then went into the market and spent a lot of money. I'm sure he was heavily involved in that. He's playing a system that is not in the traditions of Man United, so there was no way they could go out and recruit all the attacking players, and the wing backs and perhaps the centre backs.",
      "\"It was going to be a long term plan in terms of windows. He can't be complaining now about the funds in January. Manchester United spent a huge amount in the summer. Don't forget, they had no Champions League football, no European football and a lot of that was down to him.",
      "\"Let's not forget, when he was brought in, the idea was to get them back to Champions League football. They were four points off the Champions League when he came in. They finished 15th. So when you talk about the lack of funds, that was down to him and the team, and there's no way he's going to get everything he wants in one window.\"",
      "He continued: \"Of course they need need better players but it can't come in one window. He - or the club - decided to go with attacking players, they could have maybe gone with one midfielder, one attacking player, one wing-back but they didn't and maybe they'll come in future windows.",
      "\"But the people he seems to be having a go at - (chief executive) Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox - they're the ones who brought him in and were probably the ones who were fighting in the summer to keep him in a job. I'm sure Jim Ratcliffe is looking at the situation and thinking you've brought in a guy, he doesn't play the way Manchester United have in the past and the results are horrendous.\"",
      "Carragher compared Amorim's comments to Enzo Maresca's recent outburst at Chelsea and subsequent departure from Stamford Bridge. He said: \"This could be over very quickly. But Maresca was in a much stronger position to challenge his board and the owner than Amorim.",
      "\"He won the Club World Cup. He got the team into the Champions League. He did everything he was asked to do last season. I still didn't think it was acceptable to challenge the people above him.",
      "\"Amorim is in no position whatsoever to speak like that. As I said, he's a barely competent Premier League manager so far on what he has shown.\"",
      "United will now working to hire a new permanent manager with Oliver Glasner one of the early leading contenders.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Gary Neville has waded in on Ruben Amorim's \"bizarre\" post-match press conference comments after the Manchester United boss seemed to hint that the club and he would go their own ways when his contract expires.",
      "The United boss cast doubt over his future at Old Trafford following the 1-1 draw at Leeds United on Sunday. Amorim had hinted at issues behind the scenes in his press conference on Friday before escalating the issue at Elland Road.",
      "\"Guys, to stop with that, I noticed that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said. \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. And that is clear. I know that my name is not Tuchel, it's not Conte, it's not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United.",

      "Amorim also repeated that everyone would move on when his contract expires in 18 months. He also suggested that he had been promised more power to reshape the club, while also name-checking Neville in the process.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach,\" he said. \"And I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal.",

I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.\"",
      "Following Amorim's rant, Neville was asked about his thoughts on the matter on the Gary Neville podcast from the Etihad Stadium. \"Some bizarre comments around, 'I'm a manager, not a head coach'. I just said about Maresca, once you start this game-playing in your press conferences, something is obviously annoying him, he's not feeling the support and he's letting go,\" he said.",
      "\"To say that you've come to the club as a manager, I thought he was appointed head coach of the football club and appointed to coach the team. Manager is a title that we don't see anymore. I don't know what Pep Guardiola is at Manchester City.",
      "\"Manager suggests that he's saying that he wants to manage more than just the training ground performance. He wants to overlook other parts of the club. They have a greater say on other parts of the club, like recruitment, academy, style of play and how the club go about their pre-season friendlies.",
      "\"He's suggesting, maybe, that he needs to be given the ability to manage more departments of the club. I've not seen the press conference at all, they've just been sent to me by the staff producer, but [he said] about other people doing their job in their department.",
      "\"Again, that would suggest that he's not happy with something. Something's happened there in the last week with the quotes that are coming out, that mean that Ruben Amorim is now starting to unleash and as Maresca did.",
      "\"It's not quite that, but it's something similar in a way that it's not explicit what it means, but everyone's having to read inbetween the lines. It looks to me that he's not happy about something in the hierarchy.",
      "\"He's mentioned my name in it as well, apparently. That's the sort of thing that managers tend to do towards difficult periods, they have a go at pundits. No problem with that whatsoever. I've actually been quite supported of Manchester United's performances against Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Newcastle.",
      "\"I thought they were very good. I couldn't be supportive the other night against Wolves, if that's what he's referring to. It wasn't right the other night and you have to say that. It wasn't right against 10-men Everton.",
      "\"I am going to call out when I see things that aren't right because that's my job. That aside, the bigger problem isn't about what he said about me, matter of fact, it's not a problem at all, it's more the problem of what he's saying is happening behind the scenes.\"",

      "\"We controlled more the possession, the connection, the position of the players. I think they were in the better positions to play, and that can show in the way we played. We had more chances than the opponent to score, but we need to not to think about the next one.\"",
      "\"It's really important. I think Ben improved in the connection today. Josh, the 20 minutes that he played, he was active. He was creating chances, creating spaces for us. It's important. Also, Manu [Ugarte] played better today and helped the team also to create chances. So it was better than last week.\"",
      "\"First of all, to miss the chances that he's missing he's always there, and that is the first step. He's really aggressive when the ball goes to the side. He's really aggressive when he has to fight for the first ball. Of course, when you look at the game of a striker, if you miss chances, they will say that the player did everything wrong. I don't agree. I think the right position. He just need to score one and then all the weight that he has on top of him is going to disappear and he's going to be better.\"",
      "\"Josh needs to be prepared to play in every game. All the players need to be ready. If you play 20 minutes, you need to play 20 minutes to help the team. He does that. He's a player from our team. That's it.\"",

      "Leeds have confirmed that a supporter tragically died at Elland Road on Sunday ahead of their game against Manchester United. The two teams met for a Premier League match which ended in a 1-1 draw.",
      "In a statement released three hours after full-time, the Yorkshire club said: \"Leeds United are devastated to confirm that a supporter sadly passed away ahead of our Premier League fixture with Manchester United at Elland Road, following a medical emergency in the ground before kick-off.",
      "\"The thoughts of everyone at Leeds United are with the family and friends of the supporter at this exceptionally difficult time.\"",
      "No further details about the person who died or the circumstances of their passing have been released.",
      "Leeds took the lead shortly after the hour mark, as Brenden Aaronson opened the scoring. Matheus Cunha replied for the visitors three minutes later and nothing could separate the sides before the final whistle.",
      "The result moved Leeds six points clear of the relegation zone and continued their good run of form. Man United, meanwhile, remained fifth in the table.",
      "\"First of all, I have to say I am proud of my lads because it was, of course, a tricky circumstance for us,\" Leeds manager Daniel Farke commented. \"We had to go over the line two and a half days ago, away at Liverpool to earn a hard-fought clean sheet, then several key players out and not available for today.",
      "\"Everyone tells you how big this game is. Lots of expectations and to go into this game is then tricky. So for that, I am very proud of the mentality of my players to show resilience again.\"",
      "Man United boss Amorim reflected: \"I think we played well. I think we had more control in this game than we showed against Wolves, that is also important when you prepare [for] the next week, you can run with a different message than we showed in the last game.",
      "\"I think we controlled Leeds quite well, a team that is really strong on set-pieces and with second balls, they are really quick in front and I think we controlled it well. We had our opportunities to win the game, of course, but we are losing games in the details. With the goal of Leeds, we are controlling the game and in one kick with the ball in transition.",
      "\"But we managed to get back into the game, last year it would be completely different. This year we are in control of the games more often than last year, so [it] was a good game, but of course, a little bit frustrated for us not to win.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

The decision to dispense with the services of Amorim was taken by United's leadership team, including Wilcox and chief excecutive Omar Berrada.",

      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. And I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.",

      "Manchester United insist Ruben Amorim was sacked due to a lack of progress on the pitch and have denied there was a power struggle going on at Old Trafford, despite Amorim bringing those tensions into the open over the last week.",
      "Amorim was sacked on Monday morning, less than 19 hours after a remarkable press conference at Elland Road in which he demanded more power and told director of football Jason Wilcox to \"do his job\". Tensions between Amorim and members of the football leadership team, including Wilcox and director of recruitment Christopher Vivell, have become public in recent weeks and Amorim laid them bare at Elland Road.",
      "His stunning remarks left nobody in any doubt that were issues behind the scenes at Old Trafford. Amorim's job came under immediate scrutiny and after what was essentially a 'back me or sack me' plea, his 63-game reign was brought to an end on Monday.",
      "But United sources insist that the decision was made solely on results and denied there had been any power struggles or that Amorim had laid down an ultimatum demanding more power. They insist the 40-year-old maintained the 'unwavering support' of everyone within the club but there hadn't been enough progress for him to continue in the role.",
      "Amorim had been frustrated at being told there was no money to spend in January and was keen to add a midfielder to his squad, with United initially showing interest in attacker Antoine Semenyo before tightening the purse strings.",
      "The decision was made to sign three attacking players last summer, in Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, as well as goalkeeper Senne Lammens, and United insist Amorim was on board with that recruitment plan and happy with the decision to strengthen the attack over the midfield.",
      "In his press conference after the Leeds draw, Amorim had demanded to be the manager at United rather than the coach, even though his job title since his appointment in November 2024 was head coach. United have no plans to change that structure and their next appointment is likely to have to accept the same job title.",
      "United sources point out that the £250million spent since Amorim's arrival made the club one of the highest spenders in the Premier League in that time. Although the team have shown signs of improvement this season and sit sixth in the Premier League, the decision has been made to axe Amorim to give the squad a better chance of qualifying for the Champions League next season.",

      "United secured a 1-1 draw at Elland Road thanks to a second-half Matheus Cunha equaliser, but the end of Amorim's press conference overshadowed the performance in West Yorkshire. The club statement confirming Amorim's departure said: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as head coach of Manchester United.",

      "The structure of Manchester United's hierarchy has been reiterated following Ruben Amorim's sacking. United announced Amorim had been sacked on Monday, a day after he appeared to suggest Jason Wilcox and Christopher Vivell should focus on their own jobs at the club.",
      "Last weekend, a report from the Daily Mail claimed director of football Wilcox, and director of recruitment Vivell, had concerns over Amorim's system and his unwavering stance on tactics. Speaking after the Leeds draw, Amorim said: \"In every department - the scouting department, the sporting director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months, and then we move on.”",
      "United confirmed Amorim had departed within 24 hours of those comments. Club sources insist there have been no power struggles, but Amorim's comments contradict that claim.",
      "Amorim was widely considered to be calling out key decision-makers at Old Trafford. The 40-year-old has now been axed, and club sources have reiterated that the board come above the remit of a head coach.",
      "United insist they have developed an 'expert leadership team' that allows the club to operate at the highest levels. Sources have said that although a head coach is seen as key, they do not sit above, due to a collaborative approach and structure being seen as imperative to achieve success.",
      "Omar Berrada was appointed as CEO following Sir Jim Ratcliffe's acquisition of a minority stake at United in 2024, and the appointments of Wilcox (director of football) and Vivell (director of recruitment) followed.",
      "Ratcliffe has spoken about his desire to employ the \"best-in-class\", but United suffered their worst season for 51 years in 2024/2025 and have made a mixed start to the current campaign. Berrada oversaw the appointment of Amorim and Wilcox has overseen recruitment.",

      "Dan Ashworth would have known the end was coming at Manchester United when he was marched through the press conference room soon after the defeat to Nottingham Forest in December 2024. This was a public sacking for a figure who had gone from hero to zero in five months in the eyes of Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "Ashworth was the man Ratcliffe called \"one of the best sporting directors in the world\" during protracted negotiations with Newcastle to lure him to Old Trafford. However, within months, relations had soured. It reflected poorly on Ratcliffe at the time and now, with the dismissal of Ruben Amorim, the manager over whom Ashworth had so many reservations, even worse.",
      "Ratcliffe could have picked up the phone to anyone in the game and been told Ashworth was a structures guy, not the kind of sporting director who would hand over a list of the five most highly rated 30-something coaches in Europe. He was a sensible appointment for a club that needed reshaping. But his caution over the appointment of Amorim ultimately did for him.",
      "Ashworth could see the problems coming of parachuting in a head coach mid-season who had a distinctive playing style. This wasn't a squad built for Amorim's 3-4-2-1 and neither did United have the cash to transform it.",
      "It was a sensible, pragmatic, common-sense approach, but didn't fit with the bravado and excitement of everyone else involved. Amorim was the shiny new toy, the up-and-coming coach who had built an excellent reputation at Sporting and when he guided his old club to a 4-1 win against Manchester City in November 2024, Old Trafford had fallen head over heels.",
      "In hindsight, now that the Portuguese has been unceremoniously sent packing after just 14 months at the helm, the concerns Ashworth highlighted were correct. Amorim might still be an excellent coach (or manager), and with the right players, his system might be a success somewhere. But these weren't conditions he was ever likely to encounter at United and it's been proven.",
      "Instead, he played his system without the tools to do and his team became too predictable as a result. Most of the best managers in the game have a fairly distinctive style of play, but it is often unstoppable because they have the players to execute it. Not at Old Trafford. Not for Amorim.",
      "When his bosses were telling him to change the system and that there was no money, it was hard to see how he would ever survive and create a successful team. That chance is now gone.",
      "Director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada are damaged by the episode, their reputations at the club linked to Amorim's appointment. This was their big call and it has gone horribly wrong.",
      "It will take some explaining away when there was at least one senior figure in the building sounding the alarm bells. They ignored that warning and pressed ahead anyway. The surprise is the nature of the unravelling. less than 14 months on, not that it happened.",
      "So now, does Ratcliffe trust Wilcox and Berrada to get the next appointment right? Ratcliffe himself has hitched himself to the success of a head coach he likes.",
      "The 73-year-old was desperate for his first appointment to be the right one, but that has not happened. Now, the past 14 months feel like a waste. United are no further on than when Erik ten Hag was sacked - and the Dutchman won trophies, in fairness to him.",
      "Ashworth might have advocated an appointment considered safer, maybe even a little more boring. He would have been panned for pushing Gareth Southgate's credentials and Thomas Frank has struggled with the step up from Brentford to Tottenham. But in pointing out the pitfalls of going for Amorim, he could see what was likely to happen.",

      "Brenden Aaronson opened the scoring in the 62nd minute after sloppy play from United, but Ruben Amorim introduced Joshua Zirkzee and the change immediately paid off.",
      "Zirkzee provided an assist for Cunha, whose goal ensured the points were shared. Here are the moments you might have missed:",
      "Amorim outburst",
      "\"We are losing because of the second balls,\" said Amorim last month, so it wasn't a surprise to see the 40-year-old lash out on the touchline when United failed to win a second ball against Leeds. Benjamin Sesko lost the initial aerial duel for the header, despite his height advantage, and Patrick Dorgu didn't react quickly enough to pounce on the second ball.",
      "Amorim responded by lashing out. He aggressively waved his arms in frustration, which suggested he felt Sesko and Dorgu had to do better in that moment. Dorgu was not in the correct starting position to win the ball because he is not used to playing as a right-side No.10. Amorim was frustrated, but he decided to play the defender out of position.",
      "Sesko had no excuses, however, as he should be winning most headers at 6ft 4in. The Slovenia international didn't offer much off the ball and must improve in that area, especially when he's not scoring.",
      "Hands on their heads",
      "And the reaction from Sesko's teammates when he missed a chance from close range with 15 minutes remaining was telling. Cunha, Luke Shaw and Casemiro had their hands on their heads.",
      "Zirkzee played the ball into the box after a clever pass from Cunha, but the 22-year-old volleyed wide and squandered the type of chance that top Premier League strikers put away.",
      "Premier League games are decided by fine margins. The standard in the top-flight has increased - the table is tighter than ever - and it's crucial to capitalise on chances when they are presented.",
      "United would have returned to Manchester with a 2-1 victory if Sesko had buried it.",
      "Zirkzee's reaction",
      "It was noticeable that the only two senior outfield substitutes, Joshua Zirkzee and Tyrell Malacia, wore their long winter coats during the warm-up, while the remainder of the substitutes (who were all players from the academy) kicked the ball around wearing just their sweatshirts.",
      "It was a freezing cold day in West Yorkshire, the type of weather that would make any senior professional who is hardly playing question their future. As it happens, Zirkzee already wants to leave, and he might have been thinking about a return to Italy while he warmed up with academy players.",
      "Amorim preferred to play Dorgu, a defender, over Zirkzee at Elland Road, just a week after hooking Zirkzee at half-time to give Jack Fletcher his third appearance for the first team.",
      "Zirkzee would have felt demoralised by the team selection, but he channelled his frustration in the right way when he came on from the bench, immediately providing an excellent assist. The pass into the box to Cunha was perfectly-weighted, and Zirkzee's contribution didn't go unnoticed as the Brazilian celebrated because Lisandro Martinez sprinted to embrace him.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox spotted",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson was spotted sitting behind Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox at Elland Road. Amorim has previously spoken about his warm relationship with the Ineos' decision-makers, but there was a hint of tension when the United boss spoke at his press conference ahead of facing Leeds.",
      "Amorim appeared to be concerned that conversations had not taken place about new signings in the January window, and he was unusually spiky for a pre-match press conference. Berrada and Wilcox oversaw the appointment of Amorim, and it will reflect badly on the pair if he is sacked. Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants United to be 'best in class' - but they couldn't even claim a win against Leeds.",
      "'Biggest game of the season'",
      "Leeds-United is a historic rivalry. Of course, United fans are always desperate to beat Leeds, but this is the game of the season for Leeds fans, a point that was was proved by a comment from a Leeds fan sitting next to the press box.",
      "\"But it's our biggest game of the season,\" the fan said when a steward asked him to take his seat instead of standing up. The Elland Road stadium announcer introduced United as the 'red side' before kick-off, and every United player was booed as their names were out. Vitriol poured out from every stand in the ground, with Leeds fans chanting \"scum, scum, scum\" and \"get into them, f*** them up\". That was followed by \"stand up if you hate Man U\".",
      "The raucous atmosphere only lasted for 15 minutes, though. United managed the game intelligently in the first half, and you could have heard a pin drop when half-time arrived.",

      "Rio Ferdinand has given his verdict on Manchester United's decision to sack Ruben Amorim, explaining how a recent training ground visit sparked feelings that it was the beginning of the end of his tenure. The club announced on Monday morning that they had made the decision to part ways with the 40-year-old, despite improved performances at Old Trafford.",
      "A statement from the club read: \"Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United. Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",
      "\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.",
      "The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future. Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against Burnley on Wednesday.\"",
      "Reacting to the news, Reds legend Ferdinand explained how he is surprised by the decision. Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents YouTube channel, the former centre-half said: \"They have sacked him, they have sacked him!\"",
      "He added: \"I didn’t anticipate this when I woke up this morning that Ruben Amorim would be getting the sack. He was not in the four or five managers I thought would be getting the sack next.",
      "\"I am surprised but when you look at his record, in black and white, I’m not surprised. I think that has been definitive and the reason it’s been so sharp overnight [speaking out]. Two managers have spoken out against the hierarchy now and been sacked immediately. But his record is the worst of any United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson.”",
      "However, Ferdinand also added that a training ground visit sparked concerns that it was the beginning of the end for Amorim at Manchester United. He added: \"I saw his last two press conferences and was thinking something isn’t right here.",
      "\"This guy’s best trait and one of the most likeable things about him has been his ability to be quite punchy and upbeat in his press conferences. He had quite a jovial way about himself. The last two he did looked depressing. I didn’t say it because I get the ability to go into the training ground and see people and whatnot at times.",
      "\"The last time I went there to interview Bruno [Fernandes], I saw the manager and we had a little chat for five or 10 minutes. He’s [usually] warm, he spends time with you, he’s an open book. When I went there the last time, I noticed immediately that there was a coldness about him. There was a real difference to what I’d seen before.",
      "\"Now I look back with hindsight, things were starting to cook before Christmas. This isn’t just an overnight thing, I don’t think, in terms of his dialogue with the hierarchy and the way he’s been feeling about things. I felt this coldness that we’ve seen in the last two press conferences. I saw it in him.",
      "\"The training ground felt good and the vibe around the players. But he just felt a little bit distant. When I saw him last time he was a very different human being. I was thinking it was the wear and tear of a long, hard season and the pressure was getting to him a little bit, maybe he’d woken up on the wrong side of the bed. But now, looking back, this has been cooking before Christmas. One hundred per cent.\"",
      "It comes as United currently sit sixth in the Premier League standings with eight wins, seven draws and five losses to show for their efforts - a major improvement on their 15th-place finish for 2024/25.",
      "However, the Portuguese tactician has faced scrutiny for comments this season, the latest coming in the wake of a 1-1 draw with Leeds United on Sunday. Speaking after the trip to Elland Road, Amorim said: \"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. That is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United. And it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "In the wake of Amorim's exit, Fletcher will take the reins of the first-team for Wednesday's Premier League clash with Burnley.",
      "Whether the club will opt to continue with the U18s head coach for the rest of the season, or if they will appoint a more experienced top flight manager remains to be seen at present.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "For five minutes, Ruben Amorim's post-match press conference at Elland Road had been mundane. He had defended Benjamin Sesko and hailed an improved performance. Then, in less than 90 seconds of answers, he pulled the pin on the grenade and started a civil war at Manchester United.",
      "The question now is, where does he go from here? Amorim insisted he wouldn't quit. His comments had a back me or sack me vibe and three wins since October would make the former a surprise. The 40-year-old has begun a power struggle and calling out director of scouting Christopher Vivell and director of football Jason Wilcox made clear where the manager believes the fault lines lie.",
      "There had been talk of a rupture in the corridors of power for a few weeks and now Amorim has laid it all out in the open. He began his explosive comments by telling the media that we \"receive selective information about everything.\"",
      "So what was he talking about? It would be a safe bet to say that he had been riled by a story in the Daily Mail over the weekend that exposed concerns from Vivell and Wilcox about the playing style and Amorim's back three system. His brief flirtation with a back four in December has been shelved but where it came from in the first place is a bit of a mystery.",
      "Amorim had been so steadfast in his refusal to ever move away from a system he had used throughout his managerial career that his volte-face came as a surprise. It is telling that he has abandoned it as quickly as he rolled it out. Wilcox is concerned about United's predictability in Amorim's set-up, and it is clear that opposition teams find it easy to prepare for.",
      "If Amorim was considering meeting Wilcox halfway, then he has clearly changed his mind. Being told there would be no money in January has been the final straw. United were prepared to spend £65million on Antoine Semenyo and despite seeing the 25-year-old opt for Manchester City, they have made it clear he wasn't being signed to play left wing-back.",
      "Having missed out on Semenyo, that cash has now been put back in the safe. Amorim's grumbles on transfer business have been building for a couple of weeks. Before the Wolves game, he was asked about recruitment, and in hindsight, his comments hint at the division that was brewing behind the scenes.",
      "\"I have one idea, Jason and the board have another idea, but every decision we make, we need to reach a common ground,\" he said. \"That is really important because you don't need to make everything for the manager because the manager can change, and then you need to change everything.",
      "\"But you also need to understand that the manager understands the way of playing. If you don't reach common ground, the player would not come, so we just try to do that.\"",
      "With everything that has happened since, that line about the manager understanding the way of playing looks like the first of many messages delivered to his bosses in the last week or so.",
      "He raised the stakes on Friday with his refusal to answer why he had come to the conclusion that he wouldn't get the time or money to play a \"perfect 3-4-3\"; however, his response to his questioner, \"You are a smart guy,\" was a clear hint that the conclusion was obvious.",
      "And for those left in any doubt, Amorim shredded it all on Sunday. He was appointed as head coach in November 2024, but has now decided that the job title isn't good enough for him. He wants the power afforded to Thomas Tuchel, Antonio Conte and Jose Mourinho, despite not having the CV to match.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United. And that is clear,\" he said. \"I know that my name is not Tuchel, it's not Conte, it's not Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United.",
      "\"And it's going to be like this for 18 months, or when the board decides to change. So that was my point, I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until the other guy is coming here to replace me.",
      "\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. And I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.",
      "\"If people cannot handle the Gary Neville and the criticism of everything, we need to change the club. No, guys, I just want to say that I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach. And every department, the scouting department, the sports director needs to do their job. I will do mine for 18 months and then we move on.\"",
      "This clearly isn't someone angling for a new contract. Amorim will see out his 18 months, but it seems he is saying that if this structure remains, he will leave then.",
      "He is unlikely to last another 18 months, however. Wilcox is right to have doubts over Amorim's tactical approach, but the uncomfortable reality for this United structure under Sir Jim Ratcliffe is that they have bet the house on the Portuguese. If he fails, where does it leave them?",
      "In a way, Wilcox, Vivell, Amorim and even chief executive Omar Berrada will now look to Ratcliffe for the next move. The minority owner hasn't been to a game since the 4-1 win against Wolves on December 8 and things have clearly changed since then.",
      "Ratcliffe can be unpredictable. He likes Amorim and admires his straight-talking approach, but there is shooting from the hip and then there is this. It was unfriendly fire.",
      "The 73-year-old billionaire showed his ruthless streak when getting rid of Dan Ashworth after just five months. That was put down to a personality clash, but Ratcliffe was frustrated that Ashworth was raising concerns about the appointment of Amorim. There is more than a degree of irony to that now.",
      "So what will Ratcliffe do next? He was talking of giving Amorim three years in October, but that now looks impossible. It's hard to see how Wilcox and Amorim can continue to coexist for much longer. It wouldn't be out of character for Ratcliffe to look to end this one way or another this week.",
      "Perhaps results will dictate what happens next, at least to a degree. Amorim will face the media at Carrington on Tuesday, and it feels inconceivable that he won't have met Wilcox for showdown talks before then. Can they come up with a New Year's truce? If they don't, then Amorim will badly need a win at Burnley.",
      "His hand isn't exactly strong at the moment, but then he has never been one to bite his tongue either.",

A poor game came to life when Leeds took the lead out of nowhere. Some slack United defending allowed Brenden Aaronson to latch on to a Pascal Struijk clearance and finish past Senne Lammens.",
      "United were unfortunate to be behind on the balance of play and found an equaliser within three minutes. Joshua Zirkzee's pass sent Matheus Cunha away and he finished smartly.",
      "Here are how the players rated at Elland Road:",
      "Senne Lammens: Could possibly have done better for the goal but two smart second-half saves from Gudmundsson and Okafor and his distribution was sound under pressure. 6",
      "Leny Yoro: Couple of nervy moments as we have come to expect. Can be too easy to get in behind down the right side at the moment. 6",
      "Ayden Heaven: One well-timed tackle in the box when at first it had looked a reckless move. Good in possession but caught napping for the goal. 6",
      "Lisandro Martinez: Passing was good and showed plenty of aggression when defending. Back on the left of the back three and clearly more suited to that role. 7",
      "Diogo Dalot: Some slack moments in possession and too casual in giving it away for the first goal. Right flank exposed at times. 6",
      "Manuel Ugarte: One of his best games of the season, with conditions to suit. Didn't do loads in possession but was good without the ball and set a really combative tone. 7",
      "Casemiro: Better on the ball than Ugarte and also competed well. Midfield looked like a potential weakness for United but it didn't really work out that way. 7",
      "Luke Shaw: Corners were dangerous and made one excellent defensive header. Back in a position he hasn't played for several years but put up a good showing. 7",
      "Patrick Dorgu: Being moved about all over the place at the moment and not helping him. Screwed one first-half chance just wide. 6",
      "Matheus Cunha: United's best player. Carried the fight in the first and clearly the best player on the pitch. Deserved his goal and looked lively. 8",
      "Benjamin Sesko: Amorim on his case over hold-up play early on. Involved in the goal but poor centre-forward play to be offside for a bad header and then missed a good chance to win it. 5",
      "Substitutes",
      "Joshua Zirkzee: A rare Amorim sub that showed intent and it paid off. Good ball to set up Cunha for the equalising goal and had some good moments as a No.10. 7",
      "Subs not used: Bayindir, Fredricson, Kukonki, Malacia, Mantato, J. Fletcher, T. Fletcher, Lacey.",

      "The year ended with a whimper for Manchester United. A 1-1 draw with Wolves on Tuesday night continued a dire recent run at Old Trafford and set alarm bells ringing again about the progress of this team under Ruben Amorim.",
      "Dropping points against a side with 16 defeats and two draws from their first 18 games wasn't a good look. Amorim refused to use the absence of key players to injuries and international call-ups as an excuse, and any team United put out should be capable of beating this Wolves team.",
      "However, it is true that Amorim's resources are currently stretched. The damage done was also eased by other results. Chelsea dropped points at home to Bournemouth, just as United did in December, and then sacked head coach Enzo Maresca on New Year's Day.",
      "Elsewhere on the first day of 2026, Liverpool lumbered to a goalless draw with Leeds at Anfield. Arne Slot's side have picked up better results recently, but they still aren't playing well and are having to grind out results every week.",
      "With the top three of Arsenal, Manchester City and Aston Villa edging clear, it might be that two from three of United, Chelsea and Liverpool will qualify for the Champions League, presuming the Premier League can land that fifth spot once again for next season.",
      "There will be honourable mentions for Sunderland and Everton, who have had excellent first halves of the season, while the league is so congested that only five points separate Chelsea in fifth from Brighton in 14th. A good run of form could propel any number of clubs into the mix.",
      "For United, they would probably have taken this at the halfway stage of the campaign. They are sixth, behind Chelsea only on goal difference and three points shy of Liverpool. Qualification for the Champions League is attainable this season.",
      "The concern is that a woeful run at home might look costly come the end of the season. They have taken three points from home games against Everton, West Ham, Bournemouth and Wolves. The first of those played with 10 men for the best part of 80 minutes and the other three were - and still are - in poor form.",
      "United will have to improve to make the top five, but possibly not by much. Liverpool still look like a flawed team, and Chelsea are unpredictable. The departure of Maresca might change things, but a young and inexperienced squad will be tested in the second half of the campaign.",
      "Amorim's side haven't taken advantage of a kinder fixture list recently and now face Manchester City and Arsenal in January, but having put themselves in a position to achieve what was the primary objective this season, they should consider rolling the dice this month.",
      "Interest in Antoine Semenyo waned when it became clear he wanted to move to Manchester City, but United's willingness to do a deal suggests there is money available to improve the squad. The conditions for a January deal are that the focus remains on long-term targets and adding real quality this month can be difficult to do.",
      "Beefing up numbers to compensate for the lack of depth is also an issue that should ease as the month progresses. Kobbie Mainoo, Mason Mount and Bruno Fernandes should all be back fit soon and Noussair Mazraoui, Amad and Bryan Mbeumo will be back from the Africa Cup of Nations by January 19 at the latest.",
      "But United should be and are alert to opportunities in midfield, with question marks over the futures of several key players. There is also uncertainty as to whether Mainoo will push for a loan move if his chances of first-team football don't improve over the next couple of weeks.",
      "Joshua Zirkzee is also eyeing up a move to Roma. His departure could leave Amorim short of attacking opportunities, with Benjamin Sesko the only natural centre-forward in the squad. Finding a permanent replacement might not be easy, but adding a striker to the squad to offer support and cover for Sesko could be beneficial.",
      "These kinds of January deals might only move the needle ever so slightly; they might only be worth a point or two come the final calculations, but in what is shaping up to be a tight race for places in the top five, that might be all it takes to make them value for money.",
      "At the halfway stage, United have put themselves in the conversation. Now they need to do all they can to finish the job.",

      "Toby Collyer is set to be fit before the end of January, but the midfielder could remain at Manchester United for the rest of the season, rather than being loaned out again. The 21-year-old was officially recalled from his loan with Championship side West Brom on New Year's Day, but he has been at Carrington since the end of November after suffering a calf injury with the Baggies.",
      "Collyer struggled for game time before suffering his injury setback, starting just three Championship games and making 12 appearances in total. After sustaining his injury, he has been undergoing rehabilitation with his parent club. He could have returned to the Hawthorns when fit, but United have made the decision to recall him from a planned season-long loan due to concerns over his playing time in the Midlands, as well as his injury issue.",
      "The former Brighton youngster is expected to be fit again by the end of this month, having not featured competitively since sustaining a calf injury during West Brom’s 1-1 draw with Birmingham City in late November.",
      "Collyer will be monitored now that he is back at United and could stay at the club for the remainder of the season if Ruben Amorim decides to keep him as part of the first-team squad.",
      "The midfielder has made 13 appearances for United, 10 of which came under Amorim last season. Although United will have a light schedule in the second half of the season, there is uncertainty over the futures of Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo in the January transfer window, with both attracting loan interest.",
      "If Collyer plays for United this month, it would prohibit another loan move, as players can only play for two clubs during a season. If he doesn't feature, then another loan switch to play first-team football remains an option.",
      "United face an injury crisis in midfield at the moment, but Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes are expected to be fit this month.",

      "Manchester United have a proud history of integrating academy stars into their first-team early, often when rivals would have chosen to be more cautious. The Class of '92 are the poster boys for this movement and have shaped the United philosophy in the years which have followed.",
      "Even as we exit 2025 and enter 2026, United are still seen as a club who give youth a chance. We only have to look back to last January and see how Ayden Heaven chose to leave Arsenal because the opportunities were readily available in the north west, to prove this theory.",
      "However, while it may be inadvertent, Ruben Amorim seems to have forged a war with the academy players which is leading to an awkward succession line. Alejandro Garnacho was a recent academy graduate who failed to see eye-to-eye with the manager and it feels a similar situation is starting to brew with Kobbie Mainoo - albeit it is nowhere near the same level yet.",
      "But even further down the pecking order, there is some worrying signs of a disconnect between the two levels. Earlier this month, Amorim felt the need to call out Harry Amass, currently at Sheffield Wednesday, and Chido Obi for sending subtle messages to him on Instagram.",
      "\"Sometimes strong words is not bad words, sometimes difficult moments is not the bad things for the kids,\" Amorim told a largely stunned press conference. \"We don't need to be always with accolades in everything in every situation, we are not helping.",
      "\"That's why when you guys talk about a lot of players nowadays that they go against the clubs and everything happened because they feel entitlement. I think it's something in our club, and we talk about the players sometimes forget about what it means to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"We as a club sometimes forget who we are and that's that's the feeling that I have. I understand everything is the environment, is the moment of the players, the kids they feel entitled. They feel free to respond to the manager with a picture, my office is open, nobody is coming to talk to me.\"",
      "Since then, Amorim has needed to rely on the youngsters just to fill his squad. Obi made the bench alongside Shea Lacey, Tyler Fletcher, and his twin Jack, Tyler Fredricson and Bendito Mantato. Only Jack Fletcher and Mantato were brought on to face the Premier League's worst club Wolves.",
      "Fletcher and Fredricson's place as unused substitutes made sense considering they are a midfielder and defender respectively. But the decision to overlook Obi and Lacey was surprising.",
      "It left many wondering why the duo were picked on the bench if they were going to be ignored when the team needs a goal, despite being attackers. Perhaps sensing a backlash, Amorim went on the offensive post-match.",
      "\"It's completely different and you know that when there is a lot of new people in different positions and you put one young kid, he will struggle,\" the United manager said assuredly. \"It's completely different when you have a base, everything is working well and you can give minutes to a young kid.",
      "\"You look at the game and you understand clearly and you see our team and you know that you are going to struggle in certain aspects and I think that was what happened during the game.\" The way Amorim suggested things would go from bad to worse if he had thrown in more young players, should grate the academy stars' nerves.",
      "They should be feeling hard done by because, regardless of the lack of options, they were first-team players on Tuesday night and when the game needed attackers, they were overlooked. That should fuel something in them now to prove Amorim wrong.",
      "Like the United boss said in the middle of this month, this does not mean Obi and Lacey should take to Instagram to send subtle but immature messages to the manager. Instead, the objective should be to knuckle down and prove to Amorim he has misjudged their talents and they can actually be brought on to make a difference.",
      "While United have so many players out, Amorim will need to continue using academy players on his bench. Eventually, there will come a time when the Reds' boss bites the bullet and gives them a chance to impress and just like Fletcher has done, they need to take it.",

      "While RB Leipzig will be keen to keep hold of their young talent, it's been hinted that a big offer could tempt the German club into cashing-in on his signature.",
      "In an interview with German outlet Welt, Mintzlaff said: \"We want to ensure that we don't just develop players for one year. But that we can also retain top talents for longer.",
      "\"We still see ourselves as a top club in the Bundesliga. And for young players like (Assan) Ouedraogo or Diomande, it would be good to take the next steps with us and consistently perform at a high level.",
      "\"However, it will remain the case in the future that we will occasionally have to let our players go. We still need to generate transfer fees and have players in our squad who are attractive to absolute top clubs.",
      "\"Generally speaking, you should never rule anything out in football. If there's an exorbitant offer far above market value, and we are convinced that it's a unique opportunity for a significant profit, then we have to be honest with ourselves, discuss it, and keep a cool head.\"",
      "The 19-year-old is currently on Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) duty with the Ivory Coast. So far this season, he has scored six times and provided a further three assists in 14 Bundesliga games.",

      "It's reported that United are not certain to pursue an alternative to Semenyo in the upcoming window, but could potentially accelerate their interest if other clubs do.",
      "Instead, that might in turn be one for future windows, with eyes also on midfield targets. The position has been identified as a priority for United with names such as Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Brighton's Carlos Baleba all being linked.",

      "Rasmus Hojlund's permanent transfer from Manchester United to Napoli is all but confirmed, according to a top official at the Italian club. The striker was loaned to the Serie A giants for the season and has made an immediate impact.",
      "Napoli have the option to make the move permanent for €50m (£43.6m) at the end of the loan spell, which will become mandatory if they secure a Champions League spot this season. However, all the signs point towards Hojlund making a permanent switch regardless.",
      "Giovanni Manna, Napoli's director, has stated that both the club and Hojlund view the transfer as essentially finalised, reports the Mirror.",
      "“We did everything we could to sign him. There were more storied clubs interested, but his will was crucial, and we are proud of it,” Manna said in an interview with Italian outlet Corriere dello Sport.",
      "“We had no doubts. Rasmus is decisive in terms of numbers, but also in how he understands the coach’s input. This makes a difference.",
      "“There’s an option to buy and an obligation to buy if we qualify for the Champions League. The player considers himself a Napoli player, and the same goes for us. This is extremely important.”",
      "When quizzed about whether a permanent move for Hojlund was likely, Manna responded: “As of today, I think so.”",
      "These remarks from Manna follow reports in Italy suggesting that Napoli are already preparing the terms of Hojlund's contract as a full-time player. Reports suggest the striker will have a €85m (£74.2m) release clause included in his contract in Naples - with that clause becoming active in the summer of 2027. Hojlund has netted seven goals in 19 appearances for the Serie A outfit this campaign.",
      "“Hojlund is a player who is very young, he’s still only 22 years old, and can improve a great deal,” Napoli boss Antonio Conte said about Hojlund’s form recently.",
      "“Since he first joined us, he has already progressed to become a dominant player in that role, because he’s starting to understand the right positions to take, how to defend the ball, when to come towards it or back off.\"",
      "The Italian added: “He is really well connected with the team. In my style of football, the strikers have a very important and special role in the overall approach, and he has huge margin for further improvement.”",
      "Hojlund signed for United from Atalanta in 2023, bagging 16 goals during his first campaign at Old Trafford before adding another ten in his second season, with only four of those coming in the Premier League.",

      "Ruben Amorim went back to his favoured back three system for Manchester United's Premier League clash with Wolves to try and counter the approach from the Premier League's basement boys. Amorim finally moved to a back four against Newcastle on Boxing Day and saw his side win 1-0, with a much more fluent attacking performance in the first half. But with winless Wolves at Old Trafford, he opted for a safety-first approach and sought to match Wolves' system.",
      "United were missing eight players through injuries or international call-ups, but produced a flat performance against a team that had taken just two points from their first 18 Premier League games of the season. Joshua Zirkzee's deflected shot gave them the lead, but Ladislav Krejci equalised before half-time and the visitors came closest to winning the game.",
      "Amorim admitted his change in system was based on his evaluation of Wolves and that he moved Patrick Dorgu back to wing-back to try and take advantage of that.",
      "\"We knew that they will play with a five, use the width, today was to do that and sometimes build up with him [Dorgu] open or close with Luke doing the opposite, we try to arrange the right situations,\" said Amorim.",
      "It didn't work and although United were missing key players in Harry Maguire, Matthijs de Ligt, Noussair Mazraoui, Amad, Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo, Amorim refused to use those absences as an excuse, but admitted he knew why his side had struggled.",
      "\"That is normal but we didn't use that excuse against Newcastle, we are not going to use it today,\" he said. \"But of course if you see the game I understand why we play the way we play today.",
      "\"The lack of fluidity, lack of one against one. We knew that would be a completely different game compared to Newcastle because in Newcastle we have more space to play. We didn't have to work the plays so much and today we have.\"",

      "\"We need to do what the game was asking,\" was the beginning of Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim's staunch defence of his decision to take Joshua Zirkzee off at half time during the draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers. For a man who was once cheered off the pitch by United supporters, it is now fitting for Zirkzee that his exit on Tuesday baffled everyone.",
      "But Zirkzee was not injured and Amorim was keen to defend his decision to bring on Jack Fletcher and solidify the midfield further. \"They put a lot of men in the middle of the park and with Jack we balanced that,\" Amorim continued.",
      "\"I think we recovered the ball faster in the second half. In the first half we struggled a little bit to recover the ball so I'm just looking not for their age and experience and in this moment I just look at what I can do to win the game.\"",
      "Sadly for Amorim, his excuse for hauling Zirkzee off was flimsy at best. While the Dutchman may have been fortunate to score the opener, he was at least providing a threat for United. At that stage of the match, with United still needing a goal, taking off a forward for a midfielder was not the option. The optics were terrible and while Fletcher did well when he was introduced into the game, Benjamin Sesko, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha did not muster up nearly enough going forward to win the match for the Reds.",
      "Ultimately, substituting Zirkzee at half time is a clear sign of what the future holds for United heading into the January transfer window. Amorim seems destined to allow the Dutchman to depart next month and there seems very little the 24-year-old can do to change his mind.",
      "Since the Reds invested in the attack during the summer transfer window, Zirkzee has been on borrowed time. Rasmus Hojlund was perhaps wise to jump at the opportunity to leave for Napoli upon the arrival of Sesko.",
      "Like Hojlund, Zirkzee is not a player who Amorim sees fitting the system. The glimmer of hope for the forward's United career was him being able to gain more chances while there was absentees.",
      "What Tuesday night proved is that this route is not available to Zirkzee either. It is understood AS Roma have a keen interest in bringing Zirkzee back to Serie A and a return to Italy is the best option for him, especially if he wants to make a late bid for the Netherlands national team in a World Cup year.",
      "As for Amorim and United, the pressure is on. If Zirkzee is to leave in January, they must look to replace him with a recognised striker. The United boss has spoken at length about his desire to sign players who can benefit the club in the future, not just the present. But how many of those centre-forwards are available and fit the bill in January?",
      "All the pressure is on the powers that be at Old Trafford now because if the substitution against Wolves is a sign of Zirkzee's impending exit, they will be expected to adequately replace him. Waiting for the summer is simply not an option for the Reds when the attack is wafer thin already.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",

      "And the Red Devils later confirmed Amorim had left the club in a statement, which read: ‘Ruben Amorim has departed his role as Head Coach of Manchester United.",
      "‘Ruben was appointed in November 2024 and led the team to a UEFA Europa League Final in Bilbao in May.",
      "‘With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change. This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.",

      "“Man Utd have not been good enough since he’s come in – he made the club worse.",
      "“He came about with all this spiel about how he wanted to play and his philosophy and where he wanted to take the club, changing the culture. When you come in, you’ve got to prove you’re a good enough manager – and he’s proven he isn’t.”",
      "“Manchester United wanted stability and structure when they appointed him, which he brought in the early part of his reign, but a refusal to adapt and evolve his system led to the breakdown in confidence in the head coach.",
      "“Amorim had a scheduled meeting with director of football Jason Wilcox on Friday, where the team’s tactical approach was discussed in detail.",
      "“This was not a sacking based around Amorim’s preference for 3-4-3. Rather, it was on the basis of what United saw as the head coach’s refusal to adapt his tactics to differing circumstances and the evolution of the team.",
      "“It was not the result of differences in opinion over the January transfer window, although the two sides didn’t see eye to eye on whether to strengthen now.",
      "“Sources point out that club has spent approximately £250m on new signings since Amorim arrived, and he knew the plan was always to strengthen the central midfield in the summer. The attempt to sign Antoine Semenyo was opportunistic, because he has been a long term target of the club, but that would never be allowed to jeopardise the summer plans.",
      "“United’s bosses feel the team are still well-placed to secure a European place, and so because of the negativity of the head coach, particularly with repeated emotional statements in the media, they felt his position had become untenable. The overriding feeling was that, whilst the bosses believe in this group of players, they didn’t feel the head coach shared their optimism.",
      "“The agreement when Amorim joined was to have a plan for stability and then evolve the team and tactics, but United feel he failed to implement that.",
      "“After a poor run of results, the heated meeting with Jason Wilcox, and Amorim’s repeatedly negative comments to the media, change was inevitable.",

      "United missed their chance back in summer 2024 when Chelsea cruelly discarded him, but any second thoughts United might have on that bit of decision-making are for now pretty much futile, with Pochettino having taken the USA job. That surely puts him out of contention for anything else until after the summer and a (mostly) home World Cup.",

      "Whispers of Fulham being unhappy in their marriage were as fleeting as they were ridiculous. Silva would likely be a decent Manchester United manager, but we struggle with the optics of this one. United fancy themselves to be rather above Silva.",

      "You can’t be going 10 games without a win when This Is Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "",
      "He has somehow made Aston Villa the third best Premier League team of 2025 while battling PSR issues. He probably deserves another crack at a massive club, if he can be arsed with the pressure.",

      "The former Barcelona coach has been out of work since leaving Barcelona at the end of the 23/24 season, when it was reported that he was eyeing an ‘interesting’ club in the Premier League. And the one thing you can guarantee with United is ‘interesting’.",
      "",
      "Very strongly linked with the Manchester United job last summer after somehow taking England to another European final. He would not be a popular appointment, but the good news for United fans is that it won’t happen.",

A thoughtful player – most notably of course for Man United themselves, which always helps – and now a thoughtful pundit.

      "When David Moyes said Manchester United “must improve in a number of areas”, he listed three facets of their game. Or, well, the entire sport: “Passing, creating chances and defending.”",
      "He did not cite whipping balls into the box. Little wonder, as exactly two months later his team was breaking the record for the most crosses attempted by a team in a single Premier League game.",
      "Rene Meulensteen called the Manchester United approach “quite straightforward” and “easy to defend against”. Dan Burn had “never headed that many balls since the Conference” and was “happy for them to play like that”. Darren Bent “knew that was going to happen” and was also “happy for them to play like that,” having had as many touches in his own box as the opposition’s despite scoring a last-minute equaliser.",
      "And Moyes admitted it was “as bad as it gets”, with his P45 ultimately swung in 72 days after those 81 crosses epitomised his reign.",
      "This was worse. This was weeks of steadily building progress completely squandered, and Ruben Amorim’s most damaging proclivities coming to the fore again.",
      "It was Moyes securing his first ever Premier League win as a visiting manager at Old Trafford in 18 attempts dating back to 2002, Manchester United suffering their first ever Premier League home defeat after seeing the opposition have a player sent off, and Everton not failing to have a single shot after their goal, but instead rather sagely identifying the distinct lack of any need to try.",
      "They had Idrissa Gueye dismissed for a baffling moment of self-destruction in the 13th minute but produced a performance of determined grit and organised obduracy which had both managers praising the infighting post-match.",
      "MORE ON THE MANCHESTER UNITED MESS FROM F365\n👉 Neville slammed for ‘thinking he’s second coming of Guardiola’ with verdict of ‘ambling’ star\n👉 Amorim ‘furious’ with two stars for ‘completely disregarding instructions’ vs Everton\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘asking for’ sack with Manchester United tactics v 10-man Everton",
      "“I quite like when my players have a fight,” said Moyes, resisting the obvious temptation to say only that the situation would be handled internally. “I don’t want them to accept someone not doing well enough.”",
      "“I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other,” Amorim added.",
      "But when the Portuguese also describes it as “my fault” that said players “didn’t understand the moments of the game during the 90 minutes,” and that he needs to better “explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game,” it is difficult to see how Casemiro scrapping with Matthijs de Ligt over a misplaced pass would help.",
      "At least Jose Mourinho controlled the “brain” if not the body of only Luke Shaw, the manager “making every decision” for a player who “cannot play with my understanding of the game”.",
      "Amorim has taken on that responsibility for an entire team which apparently cannot think for itself even when confronted by an opponent with one win in four games, reduced to ten men for 77 minutes and without a win of any kind at that stadium since December 2013, during the mess of the Moyes season when it felt like a team would record their first win at Old Trafford in decades every other week.",
      "If this group needs a coach to issue reminders about the need to raise their intensity and diversify their course of attack somewhat against a team down one player then it is yet again difficult to envisage quite how this arrangement ultimately works.",
      "Manchester United put in 38 crosses against Everton, bringing into question Amorim’s claim about having spent the international break watching what opposition managers do before coming to the conclusion that James Tarkowski and Michael Keane might struggle under an aerial assault.",
      "That is not even close to touching those absurd numbers posted against Fulham but still nine more than their previous season high across 120 minutes on that miserable evening at Grimsby, and their most in a Premier League game since October 2018.",
      "That was when Mourinho was to be sacked regardless of the result delivered against Newcastle, only for Alexis Sanchez to grant him a stay of execution with a last-minute winner in a wretched game.",
      "Mourinho was finally shown the door 73 days later, lasting about 24 hours longer than Moyes after he bore those 81 crosses.",
      "Perhaps that represents a harbinger of doom for Amorim, whose rollercoaster would finally end on February 5 going by that timeline. Manchester United’s last match before that execution date being at home to Fulham is almost too narratively satisfying.",
      "This was every bit as desperate as those displays under patently doomed managers, every inch as uninspiring a gameplan and reaction. That it was so thoroughly exposed by Moyes, long but no longer the poster boy for Manchester United’s era of sustained failure post-Ferguson, was most damning of all.",
      "The list of things Manchester United must improve remains painfully long more than a decade later; despite that slight recent upturn, the manager is still towards the top of it after all these years.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘sacked’ Ruben Amorim, who has been ‘informed of the decision’ following the draw against Leeds United.",

      "“I just want to say that I’m going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job, not to be a coach.”",

Darren Fletcher to take interim charge. As revealed last night, tension over a lack of alignment in the market and a breakdown between Amorim and Jason Wilcox.’",

      "Before news of Amorim’s sacking, Man Utd legend Rooney reacted to his rant and insisted that the Portuguese boss shouldn’t “be speaking with that authority” when he hasn’t achieved anything at Old Trafford.",
      "When asked about Amorim’s comments, Rooney responded on his BBC Sport show: “It’s strange, interesting. I think his choice of words are decisive, confusing. I think he speaks with a confidence and an authority that he knows he’s going to be there as manager (for the next 18 months) and he’s going to remain the manager.",
      "“And that’s the only reason I can assume that he speaks with that belief because the last two games haven’t been very good. It’s quite confusing.",
      "“I don’t think he’ll have 18 more months if it carries on, I think that’s fair to say. I think you need to earn the right to be able to dictate exactly what happens at a football club, especially a football club like Manchester United.",
      "“If [Pep] Guardiola comes into United for instance, I don’t think anyone would question what players he wants to bring in, or the system.",
      "“I feel for him (Amorim) a little bit because the squad is not good enough, the players he’s got on the bench are young academy kids – it’s great to see them on the bench, but are they ready at this moment in time? It’s very difficult to put young players onto a football pitch when the team is not very good, so I feel for him a little bit.”",
      "“But he’s not Pep Guardiola or Jurgen Klopp – he hasn’t got that history or that background, so I don’t think he should be speaking with that authority in what he is and I just think the words he’s saying are very confusing to me.”",

      "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has become the first Premier League manager ever to be sacked directly following a game against Daniel Farke.",
      "The following is a rundown of the clubs a Premier League coach faced last before losing their job, and the respective managers who were in charge of them. Sackings, resignations and mutual consents are all considered, provided there was one clear result which proved to be the tipping point. And it had to happen during the season, not in the summer.",
      "On the rare occasion a manager left his post after winning, we will take into account their most recent defeat; we only want results so damaging that the manager in question had to go soon after. To use Frank Lampard’s 2021 Chelsea exit as an example, his final match was an FA Cup win over Luton so the previous game, a 2-0 defeat to Leicester, will be used. Same for Daniel Farke, who left Norwich after beating Brentford in November of that year, with the loss to Leeds in his penultimate match cited as key.",
      "",
      "From Ron Atkinson, who induced the first managerial sacking in Premier League history when Chelsea axed Ian Porterfield after a 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa in February 1993, to Daniel Farke, who helped force Manchester United’s hand when Amorim finally spoke himself out of a job in January 2026, 60 different coaches have proven to be the last straw for one Premier League manager.",
      "Others include Tim Sherwood (Gus Poyet, Sunderland), Russell Slade (Ossie Ardiles, Tottenham) and Knut Torum (Jose Mourinho, Chelsea).",

      "The Manchester United job is a poisoned chalice. They have tried their hand at former players, iconic managers and one of Sir Alex Ferguson’s mates since the Scot retired, with Ruben Amorim the latest to fail miserably.",
      "It has ended in tears for every single one. With that in mind, we have ranked all seven permanent managers since Fergie left Man Utd after winning the Premier League in 2013.",
      "",
      "Virtually from start to finish, Amorim‘s reign at Man Utd has been shambolic, dragging the fallen Premier League giants to an embarrassing new low last season.",
      "The 15th-place finish in 2024/25 is the main reason for Amorim landing in this position, with performances and results never worse post-Ferguson than during the Portuguese head coach’s ill-fated 14 months at Old Trafford.",
      "Co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Man Utd’s recruitment team also have serious questions to answer, but Amorim has not helped himself in the slightest by naively sticking with his failing system, despite it being proven in recent weeks that his squad operates better in another formation.",
      "Amorim’s refusal to change has seen him die on his sword at Man Utd, with his berating of his players and pundits doing nothing to help his situation, especially with such little evidence of progress during his tenure.",
      "He should not have lasted this long, but four reasons behind his overdue demise leave his successor with an extremely low bar to overcome.",
      "READ: Who will be the next Man Utd manager?",
      "",
      "On one hand, you can say Moyes was always destined to fail given the monumental challenge of replacing Ferguson, but he still inherited a Premier League-winning squad and turned them into a group of players incapable of challenging for Champions League qualification.",
      "The Man Utd board put a lot of faith in the appointment of Ferguson’s fellow Scot and managerial friend, handing him a whopping six-year contract having been recommended the appointment by Fergie himself. He lasted a grand total of 10 months after a silly amount of defeats and the Red Devils finished seventh in the Premier League.",
      "At least he managed to beat Wigan Athletic in the Community Shield. Every cloud.",
      "",
      "Man Utd brought in gegenpressing extraordinaire Rangnick to help steady the ship following the sacking of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021/22. His appointment was made with the view of him stepping into a role behind the scenes, where he appeared to be better suited. Ten Hag had other ideas, though, and did not give the thought of working with Rangnick the time of day when he arrived from Ajax in May 2022.",
      "Rangnick’s time at Old Trafford epitomised the colossal mess at the club. He only took the manager job to become a consultant months later, which he probably would have been excellent at, only for him to leave before getting the chance, swiftly becoming Austria manager after entering free agency.",
      "The German spoke well – almost too well at times – saying the sort of thing the Manchester United hierarchy did not want to hear. His “open-heart surgery” claim had a brutal truth to it and did not go down well.",
      "On the pitch, results did not improve following Rangnick’s arrival and United ended up finishing sixth in the league, 13 points off fourth.",
      "",
      "Ten Hag should have been sacked at the end of last season after the club’s worst finish in Premier League history. An unlikely FA Cup final win over Manchester City saved him and after speaking to a few managers, Sir Jim Ratcliffe decided to extend the Dutchman’s contract after he and his minions swallowed his mitigation around injuries.",
      "It proved to be the silly decision we all knew it was at the time. The summer transfer window was filled with promise but none of the new faces have impressed and the football did not improve. In fact, you could say it somehow got worse. That home defeat to Tottenham turned every Man Utd fan’s stomach.",
      "Ten Hag won the Carabao Cup in his first campaign, which went along nicely with a top-three finish in the league and an FA Cup final, which his side lost to Man City. His second season was a direct contrast: beating Pep Guardiola’s side at Wembley after shambling their way to eighth in the Premier League.",
      "The 2023/24 Champions League campaign was truly awful, finishing bottom of a group when it seemed harder than finishing first. Their Carabao Cup defence ended painfully when the Red Devils were hammered Newcastle United – the team they beat in the previous season’s final – at home, and results in the Premier League were mind-bogglingly inconsistent.",
      "Still, on paper, two trophies in two seasons is a fine return. On grass, it was a different story. Ten Hag’s dismissal was inevitable and a sign that Ratcliffe might not be as clued up as Man Utd fans had hoped.",
      "",
      "Van Gaal benefits from leaving Man Utd at the right time. What a character he was, though. From his rants in press conferences to throwing himself on the ground in remonstration to the fourth official after an alleged Alexis Sanchez dive, Van Gaal brought light to Our League and for that, we will forever be grateful.",
      "While the experienced Dutch manager entertained the masses with his antics, his football – which does have an element of importance – left a lot to be desired. He was very pragmatic and adopted the patient, possession-based approach that has served him well throughout his career. That is the nice way of putting it. More bluntly, it was dull as f***.",
      "Said style did bring an FA Cup to Old Trafford, the first trophy post-Fergie. And the club’s hierarchy were so thankful to Van Gaal that they decided to sack him straight after the Wembley triumph.",
      "",
      "Say what you want about the man. Take into account all of the semi-final defeats. Do whatever you want, mate. We don’t care. Man Utd played their best football post-Fergie under Solskjaer, who was sacked in November 2021 after a hammering at Watford.",
      "The club legend got the job full-time after a mightily impressive spell as caretaker boss that included an iconic Champions League comeback away to Paris Saint-Germain, to which Rio Ferdinand reacted in a completely normal manner, saying on BT Sport after the result:",
      "Man United might not thank me, but get the contract out, put it on the table, let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there – given what he’s done since he’s come in – and let him sign the contract and go. Ole’s at the wheel, man – he’s doing his thing. Man United are back!",
      "In fairness, we all egged Man Utd on. He was at the wheel during his caretaker stint but Ole eventually crashed and burned.",
      "Solskjaer did bring the best out of Bruno Fernandes, giving him the freedom to express himself and the Portuguese thrived as a result. He even made Anthony Martial look like a competent footballer. The comeback wins, counter-attacking football, and incredible 20-minute spurts in games when United would kill the opposition were the highlights of a fun time with the Norwegian at the helm.",
      "",
      "The Special One got the job after Van Gaal’s sacking and has been the most successful boss since Ferguson retired in 2013. Again, his football was far from incredible to watch but it provided results and this is a results business.",
      "His first season saw Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic shine as the Red Devils won the Carabao Cup, the Europa League and finished sixth in the Premier League, which was insignificant as Europa glory brought the club Champions League football anyway.",
      "The following season brought two-time Champions League-winning manager Mourinho the “greatest achievement of his career”: finishing second in the Premier League, 19 points behind centurions Manchester City.",
      "As it usually does, things went sour in Mourinho’s third season in charge, losing his job in December 2018, which saw Solskjaer take charge.",

      "Manchester United already reportedly have a ‘contingency plan’ if they part ways with Ruben Amorim, with ‘two options’ in the frame to replace him.",
      "Amorim has been under pressure for most of his time at Man Utd, though he fuelled exit speculation by dropping a remarkable outburst following his side’s 1-1 draw against Leeds United on Sunday.",
      "He said: “I just want to say that I’m going to be the manager of this team, not the just the coach, and I was really clear on that.",
      "“That is going to finish in 18 months and then everyone is going to move on. That is the deal, that is my job, not to be a coach.",
      "“If people cannot handle the Gary Nevilles and the criticisms of everything, we need to change the club.”",
      "Amorim is fortunate to still have a job after last season, and he is arguably holding Man Utd back with his failing 3-4-3 system, as he continues to stick to it naively.",
      "READ: Man Utd don’t lose at Leeds and that’s just fine for negative Ruben Amorim",
      "There have been suggestions that the Red Devils hierarchy have butted heads with Amorim over his system, with it looking increasingly likely that the relationship between the head coach and the board may be beyond repair.",
      "Now, a report from journalist Graeme Bailey for our pals at TEAMtalk has shed light on Man Utd’s ‘contingency plan’, with it claimed that they have ‘two options’ to replace Amorim",
      "He explained: ‘One of those, who would likely be a short-term option, is Michael Carrick. The former Middlesbrough man has previously served in the coaching set-up and is held in huge regard by the club. We are told that the club would like him to be involved again at some point in the future.",
      "‘There is also Sir Gareth Southgate, who is someone that Ratcliffe remains a huge fan of. Wilcox too is believed to have huge respect for the former England boss, and he is currently available.’",

      "The report adds: ‘Amorim’s fractured relationship with director of football Jason Wilcox is viewed by sources close to United as making his long-term position uncertain.’",
      "One the key frustrations for Amorim is over recruitment and the Man Utd boss ‘feels promises he would be allowed to his squad in this transfer window have been broken, with United now planning a quiet January’.",
      "Even in the summer, Amorim had his issues and ‘would have preferred to have signed Premier League proven Ollie Watkins over Benjamin Sesko’.",

      "“It looks to me that he is not happy with something in the hierarchy.”",
      "Responding to Amorim’s comments, Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher added: “I don’t think he is in any position whatsoever to be questioning the people who appointed him. Because he’s not good enough. He’s not good enough to be Manchester United’s manager. He’s barely competent enough to be a Premier League manager right now.”",
      "Pressed on what might be the cause of Amorim’s gripes, Carragher suggested: “It can only be two things. It can either be about the January transfer market, that he’s not being backed. Or the people above him are questioning that he’s flip-flopping between systems.",
      "“It started to look like he was getting somewhere with a back four, he went back to a five at the back against Wolves and it was possibly the worst performance from a team we’ve seen against Wolves this season.”",
      "Former Man Utd defender Neville insists that “there’s no real need for a fire right now but there’s a fire being created” at Old Trafford.",
      "Neville continued: “Obviously, something is annoying him, he’s obviously not feeling the support. He’s obviously letting go. When you say that you came to the club as a manager, I thought he was appointed as the head coach and quite clearly appointed to coach the team.",
      "“Manager is a title that we don’t see anymore. Manager suggests that he’s saying he wants to manage more than just the training ground performance, he wants to oversee other parts of the club.",
      "“I played under a manager and they basically have a greater say in what would be other parts of the club including recruitment, academy, style of play, pre-season friendlies and other things.",
      "“I think he’s suggesting that he needs to be given the ability to manage more departments of the club.",
      "“I actually thought against Leeds, defensively United were very strong. I thought they were very solid in the game I thought they handled the atmosphere well. I thought they fully deserved the point out of the game that’s why I was surprised at the end to hear of Ruben Amorim’s comments because I thought you’ve got a point away from home.",
      "“You’ve just had a disastrous result against Wolves at home but there’s Burnley to go in three days, there’s no real need for a fire right now but there’s a fire being created.",
      "“He’s always been authentic, he’s always had integrity in his press conferences. He’s always said what he believes and he thinks and he should do, he should carry on as he was but it does look like he’s now starting to point upwards which ordinarily does bring pressure with it.”",
      "Ruben Amorim has turned another corner and ended up down a blind alley. Could he really be done for at Man United? And if so, who’s next?",

      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",

All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",

Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has insisted that he will be a “manager, not coach” at Old Trafford as promised on his arrival at Old Trafford.",
      "The Red Devils continued their inconsistent form on Sunday with a 1-1 draw against Leeds United at Elland Road.",
      "A clinical Matheus Cunha finish got Man Utd back on level terms on 65 minutes, just three minutes after Leeds attacker Brenden Aaronson took advantage of an Ayden Heaven mistake to give the Yorkshire side the lead.",
      "The nature of division means that the Red Devils are likely to finish the day only a few points from the bottom half of the Premier League.",
      "Amid reports of tension between Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox, the Man Utd boss gave a clear warning to the board.",
      "READ: Man Utd don’t lose at Leeds and that’s just fine for negative Ruben Amorim",
      "Speaking in his post-match press conference, Amorim said: “I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the head coach. I know my name is not Conte, Tuchel, Mourinho but I’m the manager of Manchester United.",
      "“It’s going to be like this for 18 months or until the board decide to change. I’m not going to quit. I’ll do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.”",
      "Reacting to his side’s performance against Leeds, the Man Utd boss said: “In the Premier League, it is hard to find a game you are satisfied with a draw, that is why it is an amazing league.",
      "“Overall, if you see the game we had more control. We created more chances, we controlled well, so if you look at the game you feel the frustration that we had the chance to win. It is a tough match in tough conditions.",
      "“The game plan was to understand what we did wrong against Wolves. We improved a lot because we were in the right positions. We improved from the last game.",
      "“It’s strange because they started a little bit better in the second half. When we are in control, we need to be focused in every detail. We know against West Ham, we are in control then one disconnection, there was a goal. We need to be connected all the time.",
      "“We managed to control our emotions and to score the next goal, and we had a big chance. I think we deserved a little better, but it’s okay.”",
      "“We had our opportunities to win the game. We are losing games on the details – the Leeds goal, we are controlling the game and then one kick of the ball in transition but we managed to get back into the game. Last year it would be completely different. This year we are more in control of the games than we were last year but we are frustrated not to win.”",
      "On the Leeds goal, the Man Utd boss continued: “Ayden and Leny are really young but it is not because of that. If you play so well during 90m minutes and you have a mistake that can happen. If you look at the game we had chances to score the second one and nobody would be talking about the goal of Leeds.”",
      "On goalscorer Cunha, he said: “Not just him but Josh [Zirkzee] played well in the 20 minutes he had, Ben [Sesko] linked the play well today, Ugarte is showing that he has more to give, and I am really pleased. If these guys play well we always have the chance to win the game.”",
      "When asked about the January transfer window, he replied: “United is one of the best clubs in the world. If you are here and focusing on a different club then something is wrong with you. Just focus on the game and prepare with the players that we have. We have more too, I expect more minutes for Fernandes and Mount, so we have more players that can help us.”",
      "Ruben Amorim managed Manchester United for 14 months and spent a ludicrous amount of money to leave them exactly where he found them.",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim made the Red Devils “worse” during his time at Old Trafford, according to former Tottenham midfielder Jamie O’Hara.",
      "Ruben Amorim has become the latest in a long line of managers to find out the Manchester United job is literally impossible. Who’ll be the next?",
      "For David Moyes and Jose Mourinho, resorting to aimless crosses marked the beginning of their ends at Manchester United. Ruben Amorim is repeating history.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs has revealed that Ruben Amorim was sacked on Monday by Man Utd for two main reasons as Wayne Rooney hits out at the Portuguese coach.",
      "Here is our ranking of all six permanent managers since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. Ruben Amorim has set the bar even lower for his replacement…"

      "Manchester United have only drawn 0-0 once since Ruben Amorim’s arrival. For an hour against Leeds United, it appeared they were heading for another, a result Amorim’s team selection suggested he would have accepted before kick-off.",
      "There was plenty of criticism of Amorim’s starting XI at Elland Road as he lined up with eight defensive players in his adored 3-4-2-1 formation. Patrick Dorgu, a wing-back, was part of a front three alongside Matheus Cunha and an out-of-form Benjamin Sesko, whose poor touches, finishing and hold-up play epitomised his difficult acclimatisation from the Bundesliga to the Premier League. To be fair to him, he’s not alone.",
      "Amorim knows Leeds don’t have incredible quality on the ball or the ability to freely play through teams, so selecting more defensive players makes a certain amount of sense. It does, however, make for an awfully dull game of football and points to a mentality problem: ‘don’t lose’ rather than ‘let’s win’. Against a newly promoted team, albeit one in good form, that feels wrong.",
      "That team selection did allow Manchester United greater control, with the back three rarely tested against Premier League form striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose first real sniff at goal came from a free header that hit the post and had half of Elland Road convinced it was in. Leny Yoro ought to have been tighter to the England hopeful and also should have put the visitors 1-0 up with a header of his own, which would have done his confidence the world of good. He needs it.",
      "There wasn’t much to report until Brenden Aaronson’s opening goal in the 62nd minute. Amorim’s XI was a contributing factor, but so too was the kick-off time, something we completely understand given the job West Yorkshire Police would have on their hands if Leeds vs Manchester United were an 8pm fixture.",
      "It was all just a bit flat. Scheduling this fixture as early as possible is understandable, but it was also a bit boring. We are not condoning drunk and disorderly behaviour by any means, but we want these two great rivals to meet in the best atmosphere possible.",
      "MORE F365 SAYS…\n* Arsenal take ‘the next step’ as Arteta pinpoints one player’s ‘personality and presence’ in huge win\n* Nuno sack sealed but West Ham have already given 47 million reasons why he must stay for relegation\n* Thomas Frank doesn’t ‘understand’ Spurs and Brentford stalemate suggests he never will",
      "Elland Road did erupt when Aaronson slotted past Senne Lammens, but the home fans were instantly silenced when Matheus Cunha equalised.",
      "Young Ayden Heaven won’t look back fondly on the American’s goal when it’s analysed on Monday morning, especially after such a solid, composed performance up to that point. Perhaps it was that very composure and confidence that caught him out, as Aaronson bore down on the lackadaisical defender, burst through on goal and finished with his left foot.",
      "Amorim’s reaction was immediate. Joshua Zirkzee came on and provided the assist for Cunha’s finish. When United needed to attack, they scored a brilliant goal and looked good value for a winner. Why couldn’t they have just done this from the start? Everyone’s day would have been far more entertaining.",
      "Zirkzee was one of United’s better players despite only playing 31 minutes, but Cunha was also impressive and scored the decisive equaliser. He was trying to make things happen from the first minute and also struck an exquisite volley that was ruled out for offside against Sesko.",
      "Aaronson’s opener could have sparked the game into life, but Cunha’s swift equaliser burst that bubble. The second half was a better spectacle and became hectic in injury time, but we were still left wanting more from Amorim’s side. A draw ultimately felt like a fair result.",
      "Leeds are now on their best unbeaten run in the Premier League since 2001, extending it to seven games.",
      "United have still only drawn 0-0 once under Amorim, against Manchester City on April 6 at Old Trafford, and 15 of their Premier League games in 2025/26 have seen both teams score. Leeds sit fourth in that particular table. Both delivered with goals at Elland Road, but it wasn’t the game we were hoping for.",

      "It was hoped that Ugarte could return to form following his reunion with Ruben Amorim at Man Utd after they worked together at Sporting Lisbon, but this is not how it has panned out.",
      "Ugarte is not good enough to be Casemiro’s long-term replacement as he is very limited in possession and has fallen behind the Brazil international in the pecking order this season.",
      "This has fuelled reports linking the Uruguay international with an exit in January or next summer, while Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are also linked with moves elsewhere.",
      "Despite this, Amorim has claimed this week that there are “not” going to be any changes to Man Utd’s squad this month.",
      "“The transfer window is not going to change,” Amorim said.",
      "READ: Arsenal to sign Isak to replace Gyokeres after winning PL; ChatGPT picks better Man Utd XI than Amorim",
      "“We have no conversations at this moment to have any change in the squad. There’s a process, there’s an idea that is going to continue.",
      "“We are near the places of the Champions League, but we are also near like eight teams behind us. So let’s focus on the next game, just that. Our focus is to win the next game.”",
      "Therefore, it is hardly surprising that a report from journalist Graeme Bailey for our pals at TEAMtalk claims ‘United have rebuffed advances from intermediaries working to take Ugarte to Turkish giants Galatasaray’.",
      "The report explains:",
      "‘Gala’s plan had been to take Ugarte on loan with an option to buy, and they were prepared to pay a hefty loan fee of around £15million (€17.5m, $20m). But with Kobbie Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee, both keen to secure exits in January, Ugarte has been told that it will not happen.",
      "‘There is, however, a belief that if Gala came back with an offer that would see United pocket close to the original £45million they paid PSG in August 2024 for him, then they might have a chance of landing him this month.’",
      "Regarding Amorim’s comments, Fabrizio Romano has claimed that a “message has been communicated” to INEOS regarding transfers.",
      "“Today Ruben Amorim was very clear in his press conference. He said that as of now, no player has come to his office asking to leave the club,” Romano said on his YouTube channel.",
      "“The manager’s position is very simple. If any player leaves Manchester United in the January transfer window, there must be a replacement. No one will leave without a replacement coming in.",
      "“This message has been communicated publicly and privately.",
      "“With the AFCON ongoing, it is very difficult for United to let players go, and this is why targets like Kobbie Mainoo or Joshua Zirkzee are not expected to move unless solutions are found.”",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed the latest on Rodrygo’s future amid rumours Arsenal have made an offer for the Brazil international.",

      "Chelsea are chief among them but plenty of other sides are indulging in the practice. These are the upcoming transfers sorted for future windows involving Premier League clubs.",
      "",
      "Manchester United were not thrilled to see an obvious target move elsewhere, Ruben Amorim and one of his roaming Sporting wing-backs having been linked for months with a reunion at Old Trafford.",
      "But Chelsea stole in to sort a deal out to bestow upon whoever they appoint as manager in summer 2026 a shiny new signing.",
      "Their willingness to let Quenda stay in Portugal for another season helped Chelsea beat a number of clubs and also negotiate a lower fee, which will still make him a mightily expensive teenager by the time he eventually joins. But not the most expensive in Premier League or even Chelsea history.",

      "Once the Dutchman recovers from injury, he will hope to add to his four goals in six games this season before heading to Stamford Bridge.",

      "",
      "It is a record sale for the Kazakh Premier League and a relatively modest five-year deal with a 12-month option at the end. But such is the nature of the transfer, that will actually take Satpaev to summer 2032 if he sees it out alongside an increasingly disgruntled Cole Palmer.",
      "Fabrizio Romano says Chelsea believe Satpaev to have “special skills” but it is weird that their solution to not having a consistently reliable elite centre-forward in 2025 is to keep signing ones who might be ready in 2030 if everything goes perfectly.",

      "",
      "“I can’t even believe you will be playing at sort of that level with pressure on you at 15,” said Gary Neville, who also implored the world to “definitely just let him breathe, let him enjoy himself” and not “put too much pressure on him”.",

      "Ruben Amorim's sacking was inevitable and predictable.",
      "There was an awful lot of optimism when he first joined - both from the Manchester United bosses and from supporters.",
      "But in truth, he never seemed comfortable in the job.",
      "The United hierarchy were desperate to give him a full season in charge before judging him - partly because of the cost of sacking him, which will now be £12m, but also because of the recurring instability that inevitably happens if you regularly change the man at the top.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left in 2013, Amorim was the 10th manager to be appointed. But results were so poor, they never afforded the club's bosses, or Amorim, the luxury of time.",
      "Despite spending over £200m on attacking talent in the summer, despite the Portuguese coach having a full pre-season to get his message across, despite many of the statistics pointing to improved performance levels from the team, despite the man himself coping well with the media scrutiny and being well-liked across the board at the club…the results were awful.",
      "Amorim is a decent, honest, hard-working guy. But he had to go.Rob Dorsett",
      "Stubbornness forms the very basis of where many fans will feel Amorim got it wrong. But could the Portuguese head coach's downfall be pinned on a specific decision? Bruno Fernandes' importance to Manchester United goes without saying.",
      "His 100 goals for the club tell a story of the level of consistency and performance he's displayed since arriving at Old Trafford nearly six years ago.",
      "Ask anyone who United's best player is and the majority will reply with Fernandes. However, in the summer, there was an opportunity to move away from him.",
      "Rightly or wrongly, representative of an era at United, Fernandes had an offer to move to Saudi Arabia, which would have seen United potentially make £100m from his departure. That money could have been reinvested to plug United's overstated midfield holes.",
      "Instead, the player became a symbol of Amorim's hard-headed approach. Amorim's insistence on deploying him as one of his two midfielders has hampered United.",
      "As captain, Fernandes is Amorim's go-to in midfield and for the former Sporting coach, he contended for the position with Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "That's a scenario that has seen the England international and a favourite among fans find minutes hard to come by, which hasn't helped Amorim's case with the Old Trafford faithful.",
      "Stubborn by nature, Amorim would tell you he'd make the same decision to keep Fernandes, knowing what would ultimately be his fate. However, it is now clear that Fernandes was the catalyst for Amorim's United demise.William Bitibiri",
      "Amorim has had an uphill task since day one - and that is down to Manchester United's dithering over Erik ten Hag.",
      "The Dutchman looked set to leave after salvaging an FA Cup win at the end of a disappointing 2023/24 season. It was a chance for him to leave on a high and for the club to move on. But instead, after sounding out various alternatives, United decided they could find no better option, so handed Ten Hag a contract extension - and a heap of money in the transfer window.",
      "He was also given a say on who to bring in. \"He did have a voice, which is why there were one or two Dutch players,\" Sir Jim Ratcliffe memorably said. Players Ten Hag had coached at former clubs were also added to the squad.",
      "In summer 2024, Man Utd signed Netherlands internationals Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee, along with Leny Yoro, Noussair Mazraoui - who played for Erik ten Hag at Ajax - and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "Nine games into the new 2024/25 season, the United decision-makers changed their mind again and sacked him before installing Amorim.",
      "A new manager in a new league, trying to implement a new system with players signed for a different manager… what could go wrong?",
      "It now looks like folly not to have given Amorim a full pre-season and transfer window in the summer of 2024 to shift the style of play and approach at the club. The good feeling from the FA Cup win could have provided a welcome launch pad.",
      "\"It was the wrong decision,\" Ratcliffe concluded about the whole Ten Hag mess.",
      "Prior to Amorim's appointment, there were reports he would have preferred to have waited until the end of the season before leaving Sporting for United. If he had been given a full run-in to his first campaign, the transition could have been a whole lot smoother and successful.Peter Smith",
      "Manchester United scored just 44 league goals in 2024/25 - their lowest recorded total since 1973/74, when they were relegated from the First Division - so this summer was about putting a new forward line and in came Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko.",
      "An impressive triple capture, and one that cost £207.2m. It represented a huge outlay for a club without European football, but illustrated just how keen they are to ensure the absence from Europe lasted one season and one season only.",
      "But how costly was it that the midfield was, on the face of it, not treated with the same urgency? Amorim did not sign a single midfielder during his time in charge.",
      "Fernandes is one of the first names on the team sheet, and rightly so, but the options for partners are limited.",
      "It is a similar story in goal. Andre Onana played only three of the last seven league games last year before being loaned out to Trabzonspor. Amorim initially persisted with Altay Bayindir despite the £18.2m arrival of Senne Lammens. Eyebrows were raised with the signing of Lammens, with just 54 league appearances to his name, but he has been United's No 1 since October.",
      "One problem area has been remedied, but a lack of similar work elsewhere has played its part.Dan Long",
      "Amorim, INEOS, the Manchester United squad - nobody comes out of this mess looking good. But spare a thought for 3-4-3.",
      "The mere mention of the formation is likely to induce cold sweats among United fans. The depths their side have plumbed in a bid to get to grips with the system have been so low that some pundits have insisted it can never work in the Premier League.",
      "But that isn't true. Chelsea won the Premier League in 2017 playing 3-4-3. Crystal Palace have enjoyed remarkable success under Oliver Glasner with the system. And let's not forget Amorim's exploits at Sporting using 3-4-3 earned him the Old Trafford job.",
      "The issue was not the system - it was the United squad's inability to perform within it, and Amorim's bizarre refusal to adapt that doomed his reign.",
      "As Adam Bate pointed out here, data analysis suggested 3-4-3 was a long way down the list of formations that suited the squad Amorim inherited. The system requires athletic wing-backs who can contribute in both boxes, versatile No 10s and an effective No 9.",
      "The squad that Amorim took over barely had any of those, yet he ploughed on. Mainoo up front? Fernandes as a No 6? Mason Mount at wing-back? All in service to the system.",
      "Should United's players have done a better job adapting to their head coach's demands? Certainly. Should INEOS have foreseen Amorim's incompatibility with the squad he was being handed? No doubt. And Amorim's refusal to change had long since passed the stage of being self-defeating.",
      "But the 3-4-3 formation has worked before and will work again - just don't expect to see United using it any time soon.Joe Shread",
      "Amorim now joins an ever-growing list of names who have tried - and failed - to drag Manchester United back to their former heights.",
      "David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick, Ten Hag and now Amorim.",
      "A list compiled of names with differing levels of experience and success but there is a common theme from their time at Old Trafford. It ultimately did not work.",
      "Rangnick spoke of the \"open heart surgery\" United needed during his time at the club from December 2021 to May 2022 - but what else can be done?",
      "The ownership structure has changed, new head coaches arrived with their own ideas and fresh investment was inserted across all areas of the squad over the years. But the same issues persisted.",
      "At some point, you have to question whether it is possible to replicate Sir Alex Ferguson's success in Manchester almost 13 years ago.",
      "Their former glory, although historic and woven into English football history forever, casts an immediate shadow on those who fill the hot seat and the expectations that come with it, albeit outdated, set them up for failure regardless of formation, signings and results.Patrick Rowe"

      "In this week's edition of The Debrief, Adam Bate looks at Benjamin Sesko's issues in front of goal for Manchester United. Plus: John McGinn's touches in the box for Aston Villa, Jhon Arias' reinvention at Wolves and Max Kilman losing aerial duels for West Ham",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 09:12, UK",
      "Benjamin Sesko delayed his shot in the first half and saw it blocked. He badly mistimed a header from an offside position early in the second half, then side-footed the ball the wrong side of the post from close range. It was a difficult day for the striker at Leeds.",
      "Statistically, he finished the 1-1 draw at Elland Road as the player with the game's best chances but once again failed to find the net. It is perhaps the story of his Manchester United career so far, one that has not yet ignited since his big-money move from Leipzig.",
      "Having started each of the last four games, this is his joint-longest run in the side and Sesko can expect to make it five in a row at Burnley on Wednesday evening. But Ruben Amorim needs more from the 22-year-old forward in the absence of other key players.",
      "International commitments have robbed United of Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo in this busy period, but the fixture list was inviting for Sesko. Instead, they have won only one of the last four. Had they beaten Wolves at home and won at Leeds they would now be fourth.",
      "Sesko has had 12 shots in these matches without scoring. The other four men to have had this many shots in the Premier League during this period have each scored at least twice. In terms of non-penalty expected goals, of the top dozen he is the only one not to score.",
      "All of which suggests that Sesko is getting service. There were six attempts on goal against Wolves without seriously testing the goalkeeper. He ranks in the top 12 for non-penalty expected goals per 90 minutes in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "Of the top 20, only three players have underperformed in front of goal by a wider margin than the Manchester United man. Whether that poor return from the chances that he has had is an encouraging sign or a reason for concern is a matter of perspective.",
      "These expected goals numbers are in line with his two seasons in the Bundesliga. In that sense, United are getting what they bought, it is just that those shots have not been going in as often as they did in Leipzig, where his conversion was impressive. That can change.",
      "Perhaps the worry for United is that they hoped for more not less. An investment in potential, Sesko's size and speed meant that he was seen as someone on an upward trajectory who could build on hauls of 14 and 13 in those two seasons as a Bundesliga player.",
      "Instead, as with the admittedly older Viktor Gyokeres at Arsenal, the Premier League has exposed some limitations. Sesko has time on his side and the underlying numbers too. But if this winter was an opportunity for him to step up, it has not yet been seized.",
      "John McGinn is a beloved figure at Aston Villa and at 31 there are not many tricks for him still to be taught. Unai Emery trusts his captain. But that does not mean that the Villa manager cannot demand more. Those demands won the game against Nottingham Forest.",
      "In truth, McGinn did not need to venture into the Forest box to score the points-sealing third goal, finishing from long distance when John Victor went walkabout. But he still had to make the run - just as he did for his first goal, that one coming from inside the penalty area.",
      "McGinn had five touches in the opposition box during the game. That is more than in any other Premier League appearance this season, beating his high of four registered against Brentford back in August. He had settled into a rhythm of staying a little deeper.",
      "What a response. McGinn had not scored twice in a game in the Premier League before, achieving the feat in an Aston Villa shirt for only the second time in all competitions - the other also coming against Forest back in the Championship almost seven years ago.",
      "Emery's reputation for improving players is well established and that ability to coax more from his squad has been a feature of Villa's success under him. McGinn, 311 games into his career with the club, still adding new elements to his game only underlines the point.",
      "Mateus Mane has been the star performer for Wolves of late, the catalyst for their improved performance levels as they picked up their first win of the Premier League season against West Ham. But the recall of his new midfield partner Jhon Arias has been key too.",
      "Arias was an unused substitute in the game prior to Rob Edwards' arrival but has featured in every game under him. He came in to start the draw at Manchester United and then scoring the opening goal - his first in a Wolves shirt - in the defeat of the Hammers at Molineux.",
      "His improved form has come in a new role. Having been signed as a winger, he struggled playing with his back to goal, unable to adapt to the intensity of the Premier League. But injuries and suspensions forced Edwards to look for a new solution at Old Trafford.",
      "Deployed centrally alongside Mane, with Joao Gomes providing protection behind, Arias has been able to find much more space when getting on the ball in deeper areas rather than being restricted to the flank. It has helped him to show more of what he can do.",
      "It has helped Wolves too. The Brazilian duo of Gomes and Andre have Premier League class but as a pair they are not attack-minded enough to threaten the opposition centrally. Neither has scored this season. Arias and Mane, as twin eights, both managed it in one half.",
      "Speaking to Edwards in the press conference after the game, he confessed to having had a sleepless night wondering whether to recall the available again Andre. He opted to stick with Arias and was rewarded. Now he is wondering if he has hit upon something.",
      "\"Potentially,\" acknowledged Edwards. \"I mean, his last two performances have been really good in that more of an eight role, in that deeper role. I think he covers the ground really well. And obviously, he has got a real calmness in possession with the ball.\"",
      "Few expect Arias to stay at Wolves long term and, unlike Mane, it may be that his name will remain synonymous with the club's failings this season. But this belated reinvention is a reminder of his quality. How Wolves will wish they had been able to unlock it sooner.",
      "Nuno Espirito Santo said afterwards that he could not remember a worse day on a football pitch in his long career. Maximilian Kilman might well agree. The West Ham defender endured a miserable game on his return to Molineux, booed by his own team's supporters.",
      "The catalyst was the second Wolves goal. Kilman's clearance was an ugly one, contorting his body into a strange position in failing to deal with the ball into the box. It led to West Ham conceding a penalty from which there proved to be no way back for his team.",
      "But the dissatisfaction with Kilman runs deep. A £40m signing in the summer of 2024, his seven-year contract is now seen as emblematic of West Ham's flawed recruitment strategy. Now 28 years of age, the hope was that Kilman would be a dominant figure at the back.",
      "On Saturday, he was outmuscled by Wolves striker Tolu Arokodare. Kilman lost eight aerial duels to the Nigerian, the most that he has ever lost in a Premier League game for West Ham - although his three worst displays in this regard have all come this season.",
      "At his best, Kilman can be calm and competent in possession but he has never been the most demonstrative of defenders. A popular figure in a mid-table Wolves side, the expectations were rather different when he was a bargain buy from Maidenhead United.",
      "At West Ham, he has become a lightning rod for fan frustration, unable to convince with his body language, sparking accusations of timidity. If Kilman is ever to win over those supporters, he will need to win far more of his aerial duels than he did at Molineux.",

      "Monday 5 January 2026 06:12, UK",
      "",
      "The balance of Arne Slot's Liverpool side was an important talking point after the Reds' 2-2 draw at Fulham.",
      "The Dutchman moved to add extra security to his side to halt their dismal run of results in October and November. Mohamed Salah was benched, Dominik Szoboszlai deployed on the right and an extra midfielder was incorporated into the line-up to stop a streak of nine defeats in 12 games.",
      "It is an approach that has largely worked in terms of stopping the opposition - Slot noted Fulham scored with their first chance on Sunday and Harrison Reed's screamer would not go down as a big chance. But has he sacrificed too much of Liverpool's attacking impetus?",
      "They were lacking in cutting edge in the first half at Fulham on the back of the 0-0 at home to Leeds. But Slot believes the issue of chance creation is a separate one.",
      "\"I'd like to create five times as much chances as we do now,\" he said. \"But I do know in the period of time when we were playing more open, I don't think we created more chances but we conceded much more.\"",
      "With Alexander Isak injured and Hugo Ekitike nursing a hamstring issue, the requirement is for the likes of Cody Gakpo and Florian Wirtz to step up. Both scored at the Cottage and both will need to be sharp again when Liverpool go to Arsenal on Thursday if Liverpool are to achieve the levels they want to at both ends of the pitch.Peter Smith",
      "Matheus Cunha performed poorly in Manchester United's 1-1 draw with his former club Wolves on Tuesday but his display against Leeds on Sunday was much more like it from the 26-year-old.",
      "He looked determined to give a better account of himself right from the start and finished the game as its outstanding player.",
      "His goal, slotted past Lucas Perri after being played in by Joshua Zirkzee, means he has scored or assisted in four of his last six appearances. He is showing his value after a slow start to life at the club and was inches away from adding a winner on Sunday when his curling shot bounced off the post.",
      "At a difficult ground, Manchester United needed him to step up on Sunday. They were once again heavily depleted in attack, still without the injured Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount as well as AFCON absentees Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "For much of the game, Cunha had to make things happen on his own, with Benjamin Sesko struggling again. But Zirkzee's introduction gave him a better foil and he was energetic throughout, relishing the physical battle and giving his team an outlet.",
      "\"We tried to do everything to win,\" he said after the game. That was particularly true of man-of-the-match Cunha himself.Nick Wright",
      "Manchester City and Pep Guardiola took a major risk in the summer by not recruiting a specialist left-back and that gamble has not paid off.",
      "Against Chelsea, that decision was stress-tested and ultimately exposed as a huge moment swung the title picture firmly in Arsenal's favour. Malo Gusto was just too quick for a tiring Nico O'Reilly and his cross led to the equalising goal.",
      "O'Reilly has found himself learning on the job this season. A polished midfielder by trade but a left-back by necessity. City can usually protect that kind of compromise with structure and possession. This time, they could not in a decisive moment. O'Reilly got isolated, squared up and beaten by Gusto. That is not an indictment of the player, it is a reminder of how much full-back defending is an art.",
      "Guardiola has always believed that collective organisation can mask individual weaknesses. Most of the time, he is right. But the Premier League is such an unforgiving beast and opposition teams have noticed where City are vulnerable. Chelsea took full advantage.Lewis Jones",
      "You could have easily been lured into thinking this would be the perfect time to play Chelsea. No manager, form on the blink, having dropped 15 points from winning positions so far this season. But the reality at the Eithad was far from what pre-game narratives supposed.",
      "This was not a contest flush with high quality chances but Chelsea made it as difficult as they could before getting the break of luck their determined display deserved. It was a performance stand-in coach Calum McFarlane could be proud of.",
      "Had Enzo Maresca - dismissed three days prior - still been in the hotseat, no doubt he would have echoed similar sentiment post match. McFarlane admitted to being surprised by City's structure in the first half but found the answers in the second, with the introduction of Andrey Santos at half-time adding stability, and latterly Liam Delap for physicality up top. The hustle worked.",
      "Chelsea ended the game with nearly twice the xG value of their hosts and generated three big chances, limiting City to zero of their own. Pep Guardiola said afterwards that none of that surprised him as he considers Maresca to be one of the \"best build-up coaches\" in England. Perhaps that's why he's been linked with eventually succeeding Guardiola at City.",
      "Whatever the case, Chelsea's young squad showed they can be resistant in trying times, a quality that will stand them in good stead for the next chapter of this unpredictable and erratic era.Laura Hunter",
      "\"I think it was definitely possible to win this game.\" Those were Daniel Farke's words after the 1-1 draw with Manchester United. A game that before they met Man City in November, the German may not have been sure he would see.",
      "Such was the scrutiny on his future at the club. But, that second-half performance at the Etihad gave him a lifeline that he took with both hands.",
      "The point in the Roses derby sees Leeds pull eight points clear of the relegation zone thanks to a seven-game unbeaten run that has included a win over Chelsea and two draws against Liverpool.",
      "A derby is always the sort of game where anything can happen. Which set of players is more up for it can often end up being the difference. But, Leeds didn't let the passion get the better of them. It was a calculated performance with intensity and cool heads.",
      "They restricted their visitors from creating much of note from open play, and aside from the goals, the best chances fell at their feet.",
      "For a team that seemed destined for relegation two months ago to be frustrated by not beating a team challenging for the top four, even if United's form has been topsy turvy at best, shows how far Leeds have come.Callum Bishop",
      "\"It speaks about our mentality, our identity.\"",
      "Fulham's sixth point from a losing position to deservedly draw 2-2 with Liverpool is nothing remarkable compared to their Premier League colleagues, but the resilience Marco Silva talks about runs deeper.",
      "Since losing Alex Iwobi, Samuel Chukwueze and Calvin Bassey to AFCON - a trio who have racked up a higher proportion of goal contributions than any other club's African absentees - Fulham are unbeaten and have picked up eight points from four games.",
      "Not long ago, Marco Silva's side were just four points above the drop but even then he spoke of record points tallies.",
      "Now the Cottagers are six points off the top four with their international players to return but also a number of injuries - including Ryan Sessegnon and Rodrigo Muniz, who would both certainly compete to be first-choice selections.",
      "Silva's sides have always been about character but there has been spark at Fulham in recent years and though that has slightly dimmed this season there were moments against Liverpool.",
      "The one frustration for Silva and Fulham fans remains the feeling that with a little added investment, his squad could be capable of even more.",
      "Silva himself chooses to run with a small squad but when injuries strike and back-up choices are limited, it leaves them and their manager facing an uphill struggle.",
      "It's one they are managing remarkably well so far. And with Chelsea visiting Craven Cottage amid the transition of a regime change on Wednesday, Fulham will have no doubts they can take full advantage.Ron Walker",
      "Brentford have this very strange phenomenon - the more you take away from them, the stronger they get.",
      "Selling Bryan Mbeumo and Yoane Wissa for a combined £125m was meant to derail them, many thought it would limit them to relegation candidates.",
      "But not only does Thiago now have twice as many Premier League goals (14), than Mbeumo and Wissa combined, but Andrews is threatening to go one better than Thomas Frank and qualify this team for Europe.",
      "Still, Brentford are not at full strength. Dango Ouattara is away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Jordan Henderson cannot play every game and the likes of Fabio Carvalho and Antoni Milambo are out for the season - but still Andrews finds a way.",
      "Jensen was placed in an unorthodox right-wing role at Everton and it brought the best out of Mikkel Damsgaard, benched for the last four games but the second-best player on the park. Damsgaard being able to play quick passes released more space for Brentford - and Thiago benefitted.",
      "It earned Brentford just their third away win of the season - and if they manage to get an away run to partner their Gtech threat, then maybe they - not Sunderland, who they face on Wednesday - will be the surprise package of the season.",
      "And perhaps, having never been a head coach before last summer, let alone a Premier League one, Andrews could be a real contender for manager of the season.Sam Blitz",
      "\"The game meant a lot,\" said David Moyes, searching for the consistency that would allow Everton fans to dream of a European push this season. But it was one bridge too far for Everton.",
      "The Toffees currently look like a stretched team lacking in resources. Iliman Ndiaye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall are big misses and as for their back-ups Tyler Dibling and Dwight McNeil, their half-time withdrawals were indications they cannot be relied on just yet.",
      "Jake O'Brien summed it up at the end of the game, describing the performance as \"tired\". There were slack passes like James Tarkowski's mistake for the opener, while Igor Thiago could have had three more goals than the treble he got.",
      "Everton ultimately need bodies in the transfer market if they want to push for the top half. With mistakes all round the pitch, they need more than the returning Dewsbury-Hall, Ndiaye and Idrissa Gueye if they want to be ambitious.Sam Blitz",
      "New year, same old soundtrack at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as the final whistle in Spurs' 1-1 draw against Sunderland was once again greeted by boos.",
      "Last year saw Spurs suffer 11 league home defeats - a club record in a calendar year - and although this was not a loss, the home fans left dissatisfied again.",
      "A bright first half had Spurs supporters smiling, with a shot-laden display that saw a surprise goal scorer in Ben Davies.",
      "His first Spurs goal in three years on his first Premier League start of the season brought about fun-filled chants, making the mood feel different at half-time in north London.",
      "But it proved a false dawn, as Sunderland came out a different side in the second half to deservedly peg Spurs back and maintain the ill-feeling in N17.",
      "Spurs boss Thomas Frank once again heard jeers at the final whistle as he continues his battle against an unhappy fanbase.",
      "And when it rains, it pours, as Mohammed Kudus suffered a first-half injury just two days after Brennan Johnson's £35m Crystal Palace exit, leaving Spurs short in attacking options.",
      "The January transfer window's significance has become even more important now for Frank if he is to come through this Spurs storm.Declan Olley",
      "Newcastle were the better side against Crystal Palace but the game could have easily gone against them.",
      "After seeing two goals ruled out for offside in the first half, nerves and tension were high amongst the crowd. Then their captain, Bruno Guimaraes, stepped up.",
      "\"Bruno is a very special player, a special person and a special character. Today he played a captain's role,\" said Howe after the game.",
      "\"That game was always going to be decided by key moments and he's come up with a big one for us, he's done it countless times.\"",
      "The midfielder didn't win the game singlehandedly for the Magpies but he inspired the victory.",
      "He has now moved level with Nick Woltemade as their joint-top goalscorer in the Premier League and is now on course to have his best season in a Newcastle shirt.",
      "A constant and reliable option for his team, whose importance stretches far wider than just game-winning goals, such as on Sunday.",
      "There are few midfielders as well-rounded as he is. One of the best in the league.Patrick Rowe",
      "Oliver Glasner seemed defeated in his post-match press conference.",
      "With a sigh in almost every breath, he admitted he had \"failed\" the team currently, as he struggles to find a solution to their set-piece woes.",
      "Palace were worthy of at least a draw in this game but walked away empty-handed after becoming undone by two set pieces from Newcastle.",
      "Glasner pointed out that this is now a common theme plaguing his side, stating that five of their last six defeats are solely down to set pieces.",
      "He's right. Fifty-two per cent of the goals they have conceded in the Premier League have been from set pieces, the highest proportion of any team in the top-flight.",
      "Their winless streak across all competitions now sits at seven games and unless they solve the growing issue in the squad, that will continue to worsen week by week as teams begin to target their clear weakness.",

      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has said he is a manager and not a head coach after being questioned on his ability to manage the club; Amorim hinted at frustrations regarding the club's transfer plans prior to the 1-1 draw with Leeds United",
      "Monday 5 January 2026 07:27, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim has sensationally claimed that he joined Manchester United to be their manager, not their head coach, and suggested that he will leave the club at the end of his contract.",
      "Asked whether he still feels he has the backing of the club's board during his press conference following Sunday's 1-1 draw at Leeds, Amorim was keen to clarify his role at the club having recently hinted at friction behind the scenes over transfers and tactics.",
      "The former Sporting boss was unveiled as head coach when he was appointed at Old Trafford in November 2024 on a two-and-a-half-year contract which is due to expire in June 2027, but, in an apparent message to the hierarchy, he has said he sees himself as manager.",
      "\"I notice that you receive selective information about everything,\" he said in an explosive finish to his press conference at Elland Road.",

      "Amorim subsequently fielded a back four for the first time in Manchester United's win over Newcastle on Boxing Day, but reverted to a back three against Wolves.",
      "He then gave an uncharacteristically downbeat press conference before the Leeds game on Friday which featured more cryptic comments.",
      "\"There was a clear shift in Amorim's mood at his Friday press conference and it didn't improve this afternoon. He seemed quite similar and made it clear repeatedly that he is the Manchester United manager, and that that is what he came to do.",

      "\"One thing that cannot be argued, though, is that there has been a clear shift in Amorim's mood in the last week or so. We felt that on Friday at his news conference ahead of this game, and it hasn't improved whatsoever after the 1-1 draw.\"",

      "Match report as Manchester United are held to a 1-1 draw by Leeds; Brenden Aaronson scored the opener for Leeds but Matheus Cunha levelled shortly afterwards; Ruben Amorim's side have only one win from last five games; Leeds now unbeaten in seven",
      "Sunday 4 January 2026 16:22, UK",
      "Manchester United were held to a 1-1 draw at Elland Road as bitter rivals Leeds extended their unbeaten run to seven games.",
      "Ruben Amorin's side, held by the same scoreline against Wolves on Tuesday, had to come from behind on this occasion after Brenden Aaronson put Leeds ahead when he outpaced Ayden Heaven to beat Senne Lammens in the second half.",
      "The visitors hit back quickly, however, with Matheus Cunha finishing smartly on the angle just 174 seconds after the opening goal, having been played through by substitute Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "In an apparent message to the Man Utd hierarchy, Ruben Amorim insisted he sees himself as a manager rather than a head coach after the game.",
      "The equaliser set up a frantic finale which featured chances for both sides. Cunha went closest for Manchester United when he struck the outside of the post from the edge of the box, while Benjamin Sesko fired wastefully wide from Zirkzee's cut-back.",
      "Leeds: Perri (7), Justin (7), Bornauw (7), Bijol (7), Struijk (7), Gudmundsson (7), Gruev (6), Stach (7), Aaronson (8), Okafor (6), Calvert-Lewin (6)\n\n\nSubs: Nmecha (6), Tanaka (6), Gnonto (6), Piroe (n/a)\n\n\nMan Utd: Lammens (7), Yoro (7), Heaven (7), Martinez (7), Dalot (6), Ugarte (6), Casemiro (7), Shaw (7), Dorgu (7), Cunha (8), Sesko (5)\n\n\nSubs: Zirkzee (7)\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Matheus Cunha",
      "Joel Piroe then came close to a winner at the other end when he fired narrowly over with his first touch after coming off the bench.",
      "Leeds also struck the post from Dominic Calvert-Lewin's glancing header in the first half, while Noah Okafor had an overhead kick superbly saved at full stretch by Lammens.",
      "Amorim's side had other scoring opportunities too, the best of which saw Leeds goalkeeper Lucas Perri make a fine reflex stop from Leny Yoro's close-range header.",
      "Manchester United showed some improvement from the Wolves draw, after which they were booed off at Old Trafford, but the result leaves them with one win from their last five Premier League games.",
      "For Leeds, impressive again having drawn with Liverpool on New Year's Day, it is another step towards safety, a seventh game without loss which puts them eight points clear of the drop zone.",
      "\"It was not our best game, it was a bit scruffy at times and you could feel that a few key players were out and we were a bit tired.",
      "\"We found a way to force an opener and would've taken all three points so I'm a bit disappointed, but if I calm down it's probably a fair result.",
      "\"It was important to play aggressively but not lose our nerves and find a good balance. It wasn't our best game but it was another valuable point.\"",
      "In an explosive end to his post-match press conference, Ruben Amorim insisted he sees himself as a manager rather than a head coach.",
      "\"I came here to be the manager of Manchester United, not to be the coach of Manchester United,\" he said. \"That is clear.",
      "\"I know that my name is not [Thomas] Tuchel, it's not [Antonio] Conte, it's not [Jose] Mourinho, but I'm the manager of Manchester United and it's going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decides to change.",
      "\"That was my point. I want to finish with that. I'm not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.\"",
      "\"I think we had more control in this game than we showed against Wolves. That is important when you prepare for the next week as you can learn from the mistakes you made in the last game.",
      "\"We controlled Leeds quite well. A team that is quite strong on set-pieces and second balls and really quick up front. We had our opportunities to win the game, of course. We are losing games in the details. For Leeds' goal, we are controlling the game and one kick in transition [undoes us].",
      "\"We managed to get back into the game. Last year, it would be completely different. This year we are in control of the games more often than last year. We are little bit frustrated not to win.\"",
      "Cunha performed poorly in the draw with his former club Wolves but this was much more like it from the 26-year-old. He looked determined to give a better account of himself right from the start and finished the game as its outstanding player.",
      "His goal, slotted past Perri after being played in by Zirkzee, means he has scored or assisted in four of his last six appearances. He was inches away from adding a winner when his curling shot bounced off the outside of the post in the closing stages.",
      "At a difficult ground, Manchester United needed him to step up. They were once again heavily depleted in attack, still without the injured Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount as well as AFCON absentees Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "For much of the game, Cunha had to make things happen on his own, with Sesko struggling again. But Zirkzee's introduction gave him a better foil and he was energetic throughout, relishing the physical battle and giving his team an outlet.",
      "\"We tried to do everything to win,\" he said after the game. That was particularly true of man-of-the-match Cunha himself.",

      "Manchester United's transfer priority in 2026 is one or two top central midfielders; Brighton want to keep Carlos Baleba until the summer when there is expected increased interest; Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Joao Gomes are also among Man Utd's top targets",
      "By Vik Varange, Lyall Thomas, Dan Khan, Adrian Kajumba",
      "Saturday 3 January 2026 20:24, UK",
      "However, a deal is not expected to progress any further this month, with Brighton keen to keep him until at least the summer, when there is expected to be a market for central midfielders.",
      "And Brighton deputy chairman Paul Barber has insisted there are no immediate plans to sell 22-year-old Baleba, telling talkSPORT: \"We have no plans or desire to sell Carlos in this window or any future window. We know he's a talented player and he's got a lot of options ahead of him in the future.\"",
      "It is understood Man Utd's priority in 2026 is signing at least one - maybe two - top central midfielders.",
      "Baleba is on a list of top targets that also includes Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson, Crystal Palace's Adam Wharton and Wolves' Joao Gomes.",
      "The club are also continuing to assess forward options, with Antoine Semenyo seemingly destined for Manchester City, and are monitoring the situations of Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta and RB Leipzig winger Yan Diomande.",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has suggested there are no ongoing discussions about transfers at Old Trafford, despite the January window being open.",
      "United travel to Leeds on Sunday with a threadbare squad, with up to eight players expected to miss the game.",
      "Mason Mount, Bruno Fernandes, Matthijs de Ligt, Harry Maguire and Kobbie Mainoo are not expected to return from injury, while Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai are away on Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) duty.",
      "Asked if the club are working on reinforcing the squad this window to help move up the table, Amorim said: \"The transfer window is not going to change. We have no conversation in this moment to have any change in the squad.",
      "\"There's the process. There's an idea that is going to continue. We are near the places of Champions League, but we are also near eight teams behind us. So let's focus on the next game.\"",
      "United forward Joshua Zirkzee has been heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Prodded further as to whether players had come to him to ask to leave the club this window, Amorim added: \"No. None of them. I don't expect them to come to me to ask for anything.\"",
      "\"It's an ambition [of mine] to be the best midfielder in the world. I just want to work hard, to take some advice, to take something from the midfielders. Not just in the Premier League, because I learned a lot from here,\" he said.",
      "\"Rodri and others, but I try to take [lessons from] outside of the Premier League. Like Ligue 1, Vitinha or Joao Neves.",
      "\"In LaLiga, Xavi, [Andres] Iniesta, [Sergio] Busquets. I try to learn every day. I'm watching them on YouTube.\"",
      "Baleba took his love for the game to France from Douala, Cameroon, with Lille beckoning. After rising through the ranks in France, a move to Brighton and the Premier League soon followed. He made the move to the Amex in August 2023 but it was his performances in the 2024/25 season that made everyone take note.",
      "Under the guidance of Fabian Hurzeler, Baleba emerged as one of the league's finest midfield prospects. But after a whirlwind summer, it's been a slower start to this campaign. The spotlight was always an ambition for Baleba but he didn't expect the speed at which his reputation would rise.",
      "\"When I see my name everywhere, I'm happy,\" he says. \"When I was a kid, it was a wish for my dad and my mum. It's a wish for me.",
      "\"I'm happy with it all. But it was overwhelming because I've done everything so fast. I've done things that some players at my age, they don't do the things like I did. But I'm really happy.\"",
