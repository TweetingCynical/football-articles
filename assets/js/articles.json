      "Ruben Amorim has been handed a double boost ahead of the crucial match against Sunderland on Saturday. Amorim is fighting to keep his job as Manchester United boss after the dreadful defeat by Brentford last weekend and knows another loss could spell the end of his tenure.",
      "United sit 14th in the Premier League before hosting Sunderland at Old Trafford, having won just two of their six matches so far. Having also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby, Amorim knows that he is running out of time to turn things around.",
      "Defeat against the newly-promoted Black Cats heading into a two-week international break could trigger owners Ineos to change direction and relieve Amorim of his duties after less than a year in the job. He’s won just 18 of his 49 games in all competitions and desperately needs to find some consistency.",
      "The returns of Casemiro and Amad could be key for the Portuguese boss, with both back in training on Wednesday. Casemiro missed the Brentford game through suspension, following a red card in the 2-1 win over Chelsea the previous weekend, while Amad was granted compassionate leave after a death in the family.",
      "Meanwhile, Wednesday also saw Tyrell Malacia welcomed back into first-team training. Malacia was part of the so-called bomb squad over the summer, but was the only one of the five players not to find a new club.",
      "The 26-year-old defender saw proposed moves collapse and, with his contract set to expire at the end of June, is in limbo at United. He had been relegated to train with the under-21s, but has been promoted back to the first team after impressing with his professionalism.",
      "The Dutchman has not played for United since January 30 and has made just 47 appearances since joining for £13million from Feyenoord in the summer of 2022. He needed two rounds of surgery on a knee injury which left him on the sidelines for 17 months and is now fighting to get back into the team.",
      "Malacia is behind both Patrick Dorgu and Luke Shaw in the pecking order, but the team’s poor form means Amorim could be tempted to give him an opportunity. He spent the second half of last season on loan with PSV Eindhoven, where he made 12 appearances across all competitions, but is sorely matching match fitness, meaning any involvement could be viewed as a gamble.",
      "However, Amad and Casemiro are likely to return to the starting line-up against Sunderland. Amad had started five of United’s opening six games of the season on the right wing, while Casemiro appears to be the favoured holding midfielder alongside captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Robin van Persie is happy to see Aston Villa's resurgence since calling time on his Premier League career. The Feyenoord boss last encountered Villa in December 2014, roughly a year-and-a-half before the Midlands outfit tumbled into the Championship.",
      "Van Persie had previously netted a memorable hat-trick against Villa in April 2013, featuring a spectacular volley at Old Trafford, as Manchester United clinched the Premier League crown under Sir Alex Ferguson that campaign.",
      "In recent times, Villa have experienced an extraordinary revival.",
      "Supported by V Sports ownership and, crucially, under Unai Emery's stewardship, the club has achieved three successive European qualifying campaigns, re-establishing themselves amongst England's elite.",
      "\"Aston Villa is obviously a fantastic team with a fantastic manager,\" Van Persie said in his pre-match press conference. \"That's beyond doubt. They're super fit and play very structured. I think we are too. Based on that, it won't be a chaotic match.",
      "\"I think it could be a very good match at first glance. In my opinion, they're definitely the favourites. That's logical when you're talking about a top team in the Premier League.",
      "\"Many players are further along their journey to becoming top footballers or are already there. But that's no reason why we won't do everything we can to win. It's certainly no less important than the Eredivisie.\"",
      "Van Persie added: \"I scored a hat-trick against Villa in 2013! I also like Aston Villa – they have a beautiful stadium and they had been suffering for so many years.",
      "\"It has been great how they have improved and then got into the Champions League. They are playing in the strongest league. I am curious and I want to measure where we are at this point.\"",
      "After a shaky start to the season, Villa managed to turn their fortunes around last week, securing victories over Bologna and Fulham.",
      "\"The standard of the Premier League is so high,\" Van Persie commented when asked about Villa's form. \"It is just so difficult to win. Some games are tactically really good, but most games are just a battle.",
      "\"Every player is fighting for every single metre. That makes it really hard to win. Villa have a really good structure and a clear way of attacking. They have patterns, but then they can lose on a set piece or a free kick. You have to be demanding in every aspect of the game.\"",
      "Van Persie also hailed Villa striker Ollie Watkins ahead of Thursday's meeting.",
      "The England international, who had failed to score in his previous seven Premier League appearances, opened his account for the season against Fulham on Sunday.",
      "When asked what he admires most about Watkins’ game, Van Persie said: “I think his runs, the way he moves. He is really direct as a striker and has a really good feel for space.",
      "“He is fast, technical, and in the box is where his qualities lay. He will be a big threat against us tomorrow.",
      "“He is definitely one of their threats. We had a meeting about Aston Villa this morning. He was in it quite a bit.”",

      "Former England boss Gareth Southgate would reject an approach from Manchester United if Ruben Amorim is sacked. The ex-Three Lions chief was a leading contender to become United boss back in March 2024, when the club's top brass considered axing Erik ten Hag.",
      "However, Southgate wouldn't let anything come between his focus on that summer's European Championships, where he led England to the final. United were keen on talking to Southgate, but he refused all advances. Ten Hag stayed, won the FA Cup and was handed a reprieve, only to be sacked last November, with Amorim taking the helm.",
      "After England's Euros display in Germany, Southgate elected to stand down and has since taken a break from the game. He has not returned to football since, instead focusing on speaking engagements and motivational work. Interestingly, he has also secured a job hosting a show for the BBC.",
      "It's understood that Southgate is NOT in any rush to return to football. However, he is keeping his options open - both within the game and outside.",
      "He's been seen at numerous matches, as well as other sporting events, in recent months, and remains close with a number of his former FA colleagues.",
      "However, Southgate is also close friends with Dan Ashworth, who had a long term plan to appoint Southgate when he worked at United. Ashworth lasted just five months in his role as sporting director.",
      "Current United boss Amorim is coming under increasing pressure following his team's shambolic start to the season. The Red Devils have won just two of seven games in all competitions and crashed out of the Carabao Cup at the hands of minnows Grimsby Town.",
      "United bosses insist Amorim still has their full support and that, as it stands, there are no plans are in place to sack him. United have also distanced themselves from claims the club has made direct contact with Southgate.",
      "They host high-flying Sunderland this weekend before the international break, after which Amorim's men face a daunting trip to bitter rivals Liverpool.",
      "If the Portuguese doesn't pick up a win in either of these games, Ratcliffe might be left with no choice but to consider getting rid - despite that face that sacking Amorim and his backroom staff would cost United in the region of £15m in compensation.",

    "body": [
      "Premier League referee Craig Pawson remains a \"big fan\" of VAR but supports new technological changes that help give fans a better picture of what is going on. He recognises that the wider acceptance of video assistant referees has been a challenge in several countries, not just England, with some fans left frustrated by the speed of decisions, regardless of their other feelings about the technology.",
      "Pawson has been involved in his share of contentious decisions, as will inevitably be the case with any official of his experience. He has taken charge of more than 250 Premier League matches—the first of those more than a decade ago—as well as games in the Champions League, Europa League, and World Cup qualifying.",
      "Indeed, his most recent league game has got people talking, with the main topic of debate not being his decision to award Manchester United a penalty against Brentford, but rather the call to hand Nathan Collins a yellow and not a red card for conceding the kick. Whatever your opinion on the decision and contentious calls involving other officials, such as in Arsenal's dramatic win over Newcastle the very next day, the 46-year-old is still coming out to bat for VAR for a simple reason.",
      "“With the introduction of VAR and the fact that now we're having stadium announcements, I think that's really good, because for the simple reason that obviously, I'm a big fan of VAR,” Pawson said at Genius Sports’ Intelligent Sports Summit in London. “I think it's a good thing because, as a referee, the last thing I want to do is make a mistake that impacts the game.",
      "\"Clearly, for the spectators in the stadium, though, they're often sometimes the last to know why my decision has been changed, and I think that could be quite frustrating. So I think that when we're now starting to explain the reasons behind it, I think we've massively improved.”",
      "He recognised it’s a balancing act, though, adding: “It's always a challenge as well, though, with technology, you don't want to reduce the speed of the game as well, and that's sometimes a bit of a frustration with the technology. So it's how do we get that balance that means that we get a better product, but not obviously, kind of changing the game too much, so the spectators are disappointed.”",
      "There have been a number of ways in which technology has found its way into the game—in some cases alongside VAR and in others separate from it. Semi-automated offsides will (if all goes to plan) speed up what has previously been a time-consuming process and minimise stoppages, while ref-cam and in-stadium announcements are designed to give different benefits to match-going fans and those watching at home.",
      "“I think the more we can share with the public and make them understand what it's like being on the field, and the fact that actually, the view you have as a referee is very different to what you see at home,” Pawson said. “Because I've done it myself, sometimes you sit at home, and think, gosh...",
      "\"It's obvious when you've got a camera from behind the goal or when you're chasing after players through six, seven, eight, nine players, you can't always see, you can't guess. So sometimes it's very challenging, and I think the more we can educate, the more we can make people aware of the challenges on the field. I think that's a real positive.”",
      "Pawson also acknowledged there has been a level of pushback from some quarters. “Obviously, the acceptance of VAR, I think it's been quite a challenge in certain countries, particularly here [in England],” he added. “So I think wherever we can introduce technology that can improve the fan experience and make the decisions more understandable, those are real positives.”",
      "Pawson says things have evolved a long way since he first took charge of a Premier League match back in 2013. This applies to referees’ preparations as well as what goes on behind the scenes. He and his colleagues are still subject to scrutiny, both in a professional capacity and from those simply watching games in the pub on a Saturday or Sunday, and every decision—right, wrong, or up for debate—comes after significant preparation.",
      "“As the teams have evolved, there's a lot more analysis now on tactics and... the data behind things,” he said. “We study the teams, we study their tactics, clearly we're a little bit in the hands of the team, because what they do we have to react to in the situations that happen in the game.",
      "“You can try and prepare as well as you possibly can for how a team plays, what they do on set plays, what they do on long throw-ins, what their tactics are on corners, but teams try to surprise each other as well. Clearly, if you try the same tactics week in, week out, you wouldn't be very successful.",
      "“So you're trying to make sure that you're very well-prepared, but then also you're just ready to adapt in-game to evolve, trying to make sure you're obviously in the best physical condition, because the game is getting faster and faster every year, and the expectation, particularly in the Premier League, is that it is a very fast product.",
      "“That's what people like about it, they like the passion, they like the speed of how the game is played. So it's important that we embody that, but we're refereeing and while we're taking control of the match, we obviously give the product that people want to see.",
      "“In terms of how we're assessed, we make hundreds, thousands of decisions during the game, but primarily we're assessed on the big decisions. Red cards, penalties, key match decisions, we all like to describe them as.",
      "“And we're assessed partly on a multitude of different avenues, really, because we've got officials in terms of delegates who are a former player or manager. They're in-stadium.",
      "\"We also have a key match incident panel, which is basically a group of ex-players and managers to look at our individual decisions and decide if they're right or wrong. Media, fans, the public, it goes on and on and on, so you're assessed by everyone, I suppose, to some extent.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim may have one more month to improve results at Manchester United and avoid being sacked. It was previously reported that the Red Devils may delay letting Amorim go due to the substantial compensation package he would receive.",
      "The Portuguese boss was signed from Sporting for £9.2million, and receives £6.5m annually as part of a two-and-a-half-year deal. As per the Daily Mail, United would need to hand over £12m if they sack the 40-year-old before he reaches 12 months of service.",
      "Given that he joined on November 1 last year, this could well be the timeline that Amorim has to prove his worth or face the axe - as his compensation package would drop in value if the hierarchy were to sack him after this date.",
      "The Black Cats might have looked like an easy fixture at the start of the season. But they've lost just one game out of six so far, with victories against Brentford, West Ham United and Nottingham Forest under their belts.",
      "A daunting trip to Anfield comes after the international break on October 19, with the league leaders winning five and losing one game domestically this season. While they have had some recent disappointment against Palace and then Galatasaray in the Champions League, United fans won't be confident in heading to Merseyside so early on in the season.",
      "Brighton come calling next, and this may be the one game Amorim could have some confidence heading into. The Seaguls have an even record in the Premier League and sit in 10th place, drawing with Tottenham and losing to Bournemouth in September.",
      "A 3-1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, albeit against 10 men, could be a worrying sign of their potential away form, but Amorim will hope the crowd is behind him heading into that one. After that are two away trips, one at Nottingham Forest and the other to Tottenham, which may well be the final rodeo for the United boss.",
      "When asked if he can still turn things around in Manchester after a 3-1 defeat to Brentford, Amorim said: \"It’s like ups and downs. When you win, you feel that everything, the momentum is there. When you lose, you go back to the same place and you fight again for one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "\"Guys, I'm always doing my job. If I win, I'm in a different state of mind. That is normal. I'm always confident because I know what to do.\"",

Malacia, 26, has been welcomed back into the senior setup by the Red Devils gaffer after a summer where he was labelled part of United's 'bomb squad' alongside Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Antony.",
      "Whilst the other four stars managed to secure permanent and loan switches away from Old Trafford, the left-back stayed put after a proposed switch to Spanish outfit Elche fell through on deadline day.",
      "After Malacia's transfer collapsed, he was registered in United's Premier League squad, with Amorim stating: \"He is returning with contact with the ball with the Under-21s, then we will see.\"",
      "Following more than 12 months on the sidelines with a severe knee problem, it was in November 2024 that he made his eagerly-anticipated return when he started for United's Under-21s in their EFL Trophy encounter with Huddersfield Town.",
      "Despite the Red Devils suffering a 4-1 loss, Malacia's footballing comeback was closely monitored by the Portuguese captain who used social media to mark his colleague's return.",
      "Fernandes showed his support for Malacia, posting a picture of him in action on Instagram with the caption: \"Happy to see you back.\" The 31-year-old midfielder has been vocal about his admiration for the Dutch defender, having praised him publicly multiple times.",
      "Fernandes' praise came after United's 2-1 triumph over Viktoria Plzen in last year's Europa League, where Malacia impressed by winning all of his duels and tackles during his 60-minute stint on the pitch.",
      "The United star once again took to social media to commend Malacia, writing: \"Getting better and better my guy.\" Despite being loaned out to PSV by Amorim last February, where he made only 12 appearances, Fernandes continued to show his support from afar.",

After Malacia posted a photo of himself in action against the Italian team with the caption: \"Massive team effort, last 16 bound,\" Fernandes responded with a love heart emoji.",

      "Ruben Amorim's days at Manchester United could be numbered and Zinedine Zidane may be waiting in the wings. The Portuguese coach is clinging to his job following Saturday’s 3-1 defeat at Brentford, which left United in 14th place.",
      "Amorim has struggled to implement his ideas amidst a rigid adherence to a 4-3-3 system that he can't seem to get right at Old Trafford. Last season saw the 40-year-old guide United to a 15th place in the league and defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final.",
      "Amorim is said to still have the backing of United's board. However, the club has a decent relationship with Real Madrid icon Zidane, who has also been linked with United over the years. It's thought that Zidane would no doubt emerge as a candidate again should United pull the trigger on their current manager's tenure.",
      "Zidane has an impeccable CV, winning three Champions League titles and La Liga during a two-and-a-half year stint with Real Madrid between 2016 and 2018.",
      "He returned to the club less than one year after his departure and won another La Liga title before stepping away from the role once again. There's no doubt that United fans would be happy to see the French legend in the Old Trafford dugout.",
      "In signs that could point to one that day that being a reality, Zidane appears to have a solid relationship with United. The Frenchman acquiesced to the idea of selling Raphael Varane to United when he was in charge of Los Blancos.",
      "The Red Devils were linked with the centre-back for some time, with then-United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer a big fan. While Real could have kicked up a fuss, with Varane in the last year of his deal, Zidane reportedly smoothed over negotiations so the French World Cup winner could make a seamless move to United.",
      "Zidane was linked with the United manager's job towards the end of Jose Mourinho's tenure in 2018. However, his agent, Alain Migliaccio, previously claimed: \"It does not really attract him\", when discussing the prospect of Zidane managing in the Premier League.",
      "He added: \"I do not think that he will manage in England. It is much less his style. I have discussed it with him.\" However, with Zidane still out of work since leaving Real in 2021 there is the possibility his stance has softened when it comes to taking a job in the Premier League.",
      "There was also the intriguing factor that Zidane was even learning English around 2021, that was according to ex-Arsenal star Emmanuel Petit. However, Petit also had his reservations on Zidane making a switch to the UK.",
      "\"If you are a manager of a football club you need to speak different languages, \" he told Bookmakers.co.uk. \"Communication is very important, so if you do not speak the language when you arrive at a club like Manchester United, that could be a big problem.",
      "\"I’ve been told that he has been learning English recently, so I think he knows it’s important for his career, but Zinedine being linked with Manchester United – I don’t believe it, to be honest. Of course, he’s a big name but he never played in the Premier League and has very little connection with it, so as I said, I don’t believe it.\"",

      "Gareth Southgate has been backed to replace Ruben Amorim at Manchester United because he'd be cheaper than other candidates and break the status quo. Amorim is currently under significant pressure following United's 3-1 defeat away to Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday, marking his 17th league loss in just 33 games in charge.",
      "Southgate has emerged as a potential successor following claims by talkSPORT that United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has already made direct contact with the former England boss. However, the BBC reports that the Red Devils' hierarchy remain in full support of Amorim.",
      "Nevertheless, ex-United goalkeeper Ben Foster reckons Southgate would be the ideal choice if the club does choose to remove the Portuguese head coach from his post. The former Wrexham stopper, speaking on his Fozcast podcast, pointed to the fact that the 55-year-old would be a cheaper alternative to the likes of Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner and Bournemouth boss Andoni Iraola.",
      "Foster made his comments after suggesting Amorim's players have lost faith in his rigid style of play and that his days in the United hot seat are numbered.",
      "\"Amorim is right on the brink now,\" he said. \"If they lose another one or two in the next couple of weeks then he's gone. Honestly, if he makes it through the international break, it's 50/50.",
      "\"The predictable nature of it is just that's what's killing Man United, because everybody knows what to expect. Everybody knows what's coming, so this is how we're going to counteract it.",
      "\"Man United’s history is built on having wingers getting wide, taking players on and getting balls into the box. When they've got a system now that isn't that way, and it's not working, I can't blame Man United fans for not being happy.\"",
      "Foster added: \"If you watch the game, it's like they're good players, but there's no real system. There's no real flair, there's no real attacking intent. I just think the belief is completely gone from Manchester United. The manager could really be under pressure come the next international break.\"",
      "Although United defeated Chelsea 2-1 at Old Trafford just 11 days ago, they failed to carry that form forward to Brentford at the weekend. The match saw Benjamin Sesko net his debut goal for the away team, while Bruno Fernandes squandered a penalty after a controversial call that allowed Brentford’s Nathan Collins to stay on the pitch.",
      "Outlining his reasons for preferring Southgate to other potential managerial candidates, Foster said: \"If they're trying to get Iraola or Glasner, it's going to cost an awful lot of money. I know Glasner's contract is up in the summer, but he's going to want £250,000 a week for himself as a wage. They're going to want compensation to some point.",
      "\"I just think with Gareth Southgate, it's so different to what they've ever done, and what they're doing isn't working. You look at the past four or five managers now since Fergie went and they're not working. It's as simple as that.",
      "\"I just think that with how hard it is to play for Man United and the pressure involved in pulling that shirt on, sometimes you might need a bit of a different approach.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim could soon be sacked as Manchester United manager, but there is no chance of Jurgen Klopp ever replacing him in the Old Trafford hotseat. The Portuguese coach is clinging to his job following Saturday’s 3-1 defeat at Brentford, which left United down in 14th place.",
      "Following last season’s lowly 15th-placed finish and defeat in the Europa League final, Amorim desperately needed a strong start. But despite heavy spending over the summer, United don’t appear to have improved. Failure to beat high-flying Sunderland on Saturday could be the final straw for the United hierarchy. Thoughts have already shifted to who could replace him, with several high-profile candidates being linked to the job.",
      "There is zero possibility of Klopp taking the helm, despite suggestions from some pundits that he would be the ideal candidate to turn things around. For one, after stepping down as Liverpool boss, he stated that he would never manage another Premier League side.",
      "The German, now Red Bull's head of global soccer, also has no desire to return to frontline management at present. Speaking in March, he said: “The last thing I am thinking about actually is to be a manager again. I’m in a happy place.”",
      "Despite the club’s travails, United remain an attractive proposition for many managers. Here are five of the leading candidates to replace Amorim if Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the head of football operations, finally runs out of patience…",
      "The Austrian’s stock just keeps soaring after leading Crystal Palace to within three points of the Premier League summit following Saturday’s last-gasp win over Liverpool.",
      "Having secured the FA Cup, Community Shield and European football, how much further can he realistically take Palace? Eagles fans will insist the sky is the limit and ask why Glasner would swap a high-flying side for one seemingly in a perpetual state of chaos.",
      "Glasner is in a strong position, with just 12 months remaining on his Palace contract. The 51-year-old gave little away when asked about being linked with United and other clubs.",
      "He told Kicker: “I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is - neutrally and completely relaxed. Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.”",
      "The former England boss is known to be admired by Ineos and has been linked with the job in the past. Despite his success with the Three Lions - two Euros finals and World Cup semi-final - he isn’t everyone’s cup of tea due to his pragmatic approach. His appointment would have the potential to divide United’s fanbase, although a few wins would surely get his doubters onside.",
      "Like Glasner, some are questioning how much further the highly respected Spandiard can take Villa, who have been hamstrung by the game’s financial rules.",
      "There is no shortage of cash - quite the opposite - but the club has been forced to sell in order to remain within profit and sustainability limits. Missing out on Champions League football was a big blow to the club and Emery, who may be getting itchy feet after three years at the helm.",
      "The Spanish legend is ready to return to management after taking a year’s sabbatical following his Barcelona departure at the end of the 2023/24 campaign.",
      "According to Fabrizio Romano, Xavi would jump at the United job and has been following the Premier League closely in preparation for his next role. Following a successful stint managing in Qatar, his record at Barca was good rather than great, with one La Liga title and a Spanish Super Cup on his CV. But following such an illustrious career, he should be able to handle the pressure of managing United.",
      "Despite his success with Real Madrid, where he won three Champions League titles, Zidane has become a man of managerial mystery, with little known about his plans.",
      "There is speculation that he is interested in taking over as France manager, a position that will become available after next year’s World Cup, when long-serving boss and former international team-mate Didier Deschamps will step down.",
      "According to reports in France, Zidane would prioritise that over United, a job he has been linked with on numerous occasions. Still, stranger things have happened. Zidane+United would be blockbuster viewing, however it pans out.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United can rule out Jurgen Klopp as a potential replacement for Ruben Amorim should they pull the trigger on sacking the Portuguese boss. The 40-year-old has had a dire start to the season with the Red Devils, leading them to just two wins in their first six Premier League games.",
      "Their latest loss, a 3-1 defeat against Brentford, marked Amorim's 17th league defeat in just 33 games. With United sitting a lowly 14th in October, the position of the United boss is under intense scrutiny.",
      "Rumours have linked Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner to the United job following the Eagles' stellar start to the season. The south Londoners remain the only unbeaten team in the top-flight after their weekend victory over Liverpool.",
      "One manager who the United hierarchy can rule out as a possible successor for Amorim is the former Liverpool boss. Klopp, 58, left Anfield at the end of the 2023/24 season and only returned to work in January earlier this year as the Head of Global Soccer at Red Bull.",
      "While the German has returned to football, he previously poured doubt on his future in the dugout while categorically refusing to ever manage another football club in England, other than Liverpool.",
      "\"The last thing I am thinking about actually is to be a manager again,\" Klopp revealed earlier this summer during his appearance at the 10-year anniversary of Hout Bay United Football Community [quotes via Kick Off].",
      "\"I coached 1,081 games. I lost absolutely each final available. Some of them I won as well.\" In a telling further six-word comment, Klopp added: \"And, no, I'm in a happy place.\" It was after his announcement in January 2024 when he revealed he'd be leaving Liverpool at the end of the season that he said: \"If you ask me, ‘Will you ever work as a manager again?’ I would say now no.",
      "\"But I don’t know obviously how that will feel because I never had the situation. What I know definitely – I will never, ever manage a different club in England than Liverpool, 100 per cent. That’s not possible.",
      "\"My love for this club, my respect for the people is too big. I couldn’t. I couldn’t for a second think about it. There’s no chance. This is part of my life, we are part of the family, we feel home here. There’s no chance to do that. But all the rest, will I ever work again? Of course, I know myself, I cannot just sit around.",
      "\"I will find something else maybe to do. But I will not manage a club or a country at least for a year, that’s not possible, I cannot do that and I don’t want to. That’s all.",
      "\"It’s such a strange situation because I have to explain that I don’t have energy anymore, but now I’m sitting here and I have energy and I’m buzzing for everything that’s happening here.\"",
      "Klopp reiterated his comments in a new interview earlier this week where he admitted he has no desire to work as a coach again. Speaking to The Athletic, he revealed what he spent time doing during his break from the sport as he said: \"I played sports.",
      "\"We enjoyed life, spent time with the grandkids, completely normal stuff, knowing I will work again. But knowing as well, that I don't want to work as a coach anymore.",
      "\"That's what I think,\" Klopp answered when asked to double down on never returning to management again. \"But you don’t know. I'm 58. If I started again at 65, everybody will say, 'You said you'll never do it again' Er, sorry, I thought 100 per cent (when I said it)! That is what I think now. I don't miss anything.\"",
      "In what could be a key game deciding Amorim's future in Manchester, his side host Sunderland on Saturday who sit fifth in the league after an impressive start to life in their return to the top-flight.",

      "United have won just two of seven games in all competitions this season, and suffered a humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town. The pressure is mounting on Amorim, who has made no impact since replacing Erik ten Hag as manager 11 months ago. But Mbeumo reckons it is down to the players to perform much better, and deal with the pressure that comes with being at a club the size of United.",
      "Mbeumo, who joined United from Brentford in a £71m deal this summer, said: \"I think everyone in the team needs to take responsibility.",
      "\"When you play in a club this big, everyone needs to know what to do. As a team, we need to do better.\"",
      "United have come in for some fierce criticism in recent weeks, with record goalscorer Wayne Rooney accusing Amorim's flops of not being fit to wear the famous shirt.",

      "“I am not seeing anything which is giving me any confidence. There needs to be big changes in my opinion. Manager, players, whatever that is. Whatever it takes to get Manchester United back.”",
      "But Mbeumo has urged the squad to block out all the noise, not go on social media and focus on doing their jobs. He said: \"The only thing we want to be focused on is ourselves, we just try to listen to what's going on inside.",

However, his days at the club were numbered after falling out of favour under Amorim and he was frozen out alongside Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia as part of a five-man 'bomb squad' that trained alone over the summer.",

      "It's uncertain what lies ahead for Malacia and whether he'll get another shot at Premier League action, with a match against Sunderland looming this weekend. Amorim opted for Patrick Dorgu in the left-wing-back position during last weekend's Premier League defeat to Brentford, while Luke Shaw has frequently been deployed as a left-sided centre-back.",
      "Diogo Dalot is back in the matchday squad, potentially playing at right-wing-back, leaving it uncertain where Amorim might use Malacia if the defender is brought back into the squad for the Sunderland clash. Kobbie Mainoo is another player whose market value has taken a hit under Amorim's management.",
      "The midfielder's worth has reportedly dropped from £48m to £43.6m. Luke Shaw's value has also seen a dip, falling from £24.4m to £10.5m since last year, and it's a similar tale for Mason Mount, whose value has also decreased from £24.4m to £10.5m.",
      "Three summer 2024 signings have also witnessed a drop in their values. Matthijs de Ligt (£48m to £33m), Manuel Ugarte (£43.6m to £39.3m) and Joshua Zirkzee (£36.7m to £26.2m) have all experienced a fall in their market values since Amorim took the reins.",
      "The total of these valuation changes, along with Malacia, amounts to £63million. It comes as Amorim has failed to turn the tide since taking over from Erik ten Hag. The 40-year-old could only guide the club to a 15th-place finish in the Premier League standings last term, albeit largely with an inherited squad which didn't suit his system.",
      "But after receiving the full backing of the board this summer and being afforded a full pre-season, Amorim will not be able to rely on the same excuse for poor form this term. At present, United sit 14th in the league standings with two wins and three losses from their opening six matches.",
      "The club were also embarrassingly ousted from the Carabao Cup by a League Two Grimsby Town in August on penalties after a dismal showing away from home. While Amorim will certainly be feeling the pressure to succeed, he may not have much time remaining to turn the tide.",
      "And with an in-form Sunderland, defending Premier League champions Liverpool, Brighton, Nottingham Forest and Spurs all to play in United's next five games, things could take a turn for the worse over the course of the next month or so.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim’s Manchester United nightmare could soon come to an end, if recent reports are anything to go by. The Portuguese head coach’s torrid start to the season got even worse last Saturday as United were humbled 3-1 at Brentford.",
      "The result was Amorim’s third Premier League defeat in six games to start the campaign, having also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup by Grimsby Town.",
      "As such, it piled even more pressure on the 40-year-old, who was only appointed 11 months ago, with names such as Andoni Iraola, Xavi, Gareth Southgate and Oliver Glasner emerging as potential replacements.",
      "Despite voicing support for the struggling striker earlier this year, Amorim appears to have finally admitted United made a mistake when it came to signing Joshua Zirkzee a year ago, with the head coach reportedly looking to offload the Dutchman.",
      "Zirkzee, 24, arrived from Bologna in a £36million transfer when Erik ten Hag was still in charge. He disappointed in his first season, scoring just three league goals in 32 appearances, and has struggled to get minutes under Amorim this season with just one start under his belt.",
      "Despite Zirkzee’s contract running until June 2029, he appears to have emerged as a target for Cesc Fabregas’ Como ahead of the January transfer window. According to Italian outlet Corriere Como, the Serie A side, who finished 10th last term and are currently eighth after five games, are looking to reach an agreement with United.",
      "The report claims the former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder is preparing to 'reshape' his team in the upcoming transfer window with the addition of Zirkzee being part of that. And by being prepared to let Zirkzee go, Amorim is confirming he has lost all faith in the forward.",
      "A body language expert claims Amorim is cutting the figure of a man who knows his time is almost up at Old Trafford. The head coach has taken an abysmal 34 points from 33 games since taking charge last November.",
      "He has largely failed to hide his emotions on the touchline, appearing crestfallen and frustrated on a weekly basis. Now, body language expert Darren Stanton has assessed Amorim’s demeanour during the recent Brentford defeat and given his verdict on what it says about his state of mind as he battles to stay in the job.",
      "“So basically, this is the worst that I’ve seen him. Being crouched down with his hands on his head is the personification of dejection, negativity and feeling really, really bad. Straight away, that image tells me that, emotionally, he’s in the worst place he’s been in since he started the role.”",
      "Amorim was also seen with his head bowed down and his hand on the back of his neck. Stanton said: “That’s the ultimate pacifying gesture as well. The fact that he’s dipped his head down… the more space we occupy, when we want to show pride, our shoulders will be back, we’ll be smiling and our head will be up. But with Ruben Amorim, to dip his head down with his hand on the back of his head, again it shows the ultimate dejection and shame.”",
      "Amorim looked even more dejected when sitting in the dugout, with Stanton adding: “With Ruben Amorim sat on his seat, it’s like he’s almost praying. He’s making himself small and I do believe that, within three to five days, I think he’ll be gone. If I was to give you some expressions that someone could demonstrate where they’re at an ultimate low emotionally, this would be it.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "The game saw Mbeumo go to the home of his former club, with the forward leaving Brentford during the summer transfer window to complete a £71million switch to United. The loss was United's third in the Premier League this season and fourth across all competitions.",
      "Fernandes missed a penalty during the defeat to Brentford, having also missed from the spot against Fulham earlier in the season. With results going against United for much of the season, Mbeumo says that he and the rest of the United squad must support their club captain.",

      "United's next match will see them take on Sunderland at Old Trafford in the Premier League at the weekend. Ruben Amorim and Co. will be determined to secure all three points in what will be United;s final match before the October international break.",
      "Part of the challenge that Mbeumo has faced has been playing alongside fellow new signings at United this season. Mbeumo has been joined by Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon in completing moves to Old Trafford this summer, with the Cameroon international believing there will be an upturn in results over time.",
      "\"It's exciting, because we get to learn to play with new players and it's always challenging, but that's what we like as footballers,\" said Mbeumo.",

      "Manchester United co-owners Ineos are said to be concerned that Ruben Amorim will choose to resign before being sacked in a bid to save his managerial reputation. The Portuguese head coach has struggled at Old Trafford since being appointed in November 2024 and scrutiny is growing on him.",
      "Amorim led United to the Europa League final last season but they lost to Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao. They also finished in a woeful 16th to ensure they comfortably finished outside the European places, recording their worst-ever finish of the Premier League era in the process.",
      "The 2025-26 campaign has not started well, either. Despite beating Chelsea prior to Saturday's trip to Brentford, Amorim's men have slumped to three league defeats and were also dumped out of the Carabao Cup by League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "In total, Amorim has led United to just 19 victories out of 49 matches, leading to serious questions over his future. The i Paper though, say Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos are willing to stick by their manager. It is claimed the British billionaire is eager to stick to his long-term outlook on United and they do not want to lunge into another sacking.",
      "However, there are fears around the club that Ineos will have no say in the matter, with the report adding that some insiders believe Amorim will almost definitely walk away from United before he is given the sack by Ratcliffe as he is becoming worn down by the constant criticism following defeats. The United chief is thought to consider these to be 'knee-jerk' reactions and he is shocked by the scrutiny that has grown on him during his reign.",
      "Despite all the speculation around the future of Amorim, there is believed to be no replacement being lined up yet for the Portuguese head coach. No managers are thought to have been contacted by United to replace Amorim although Ratcliffe remains an admirer of Gareth Southgate following his impressive stint with the England national team.",

      "The pressure and scrutiny on Amorim, 40, continues to grow after another disappointing result at the weekend with United falling to a 3-1 defeat away at Brentford. That result has only intensified talk of Amorim's torrid Premier League record since taking over at Old Trafford last November, which has seen him muster just 34 points from 33 games.",
      "Manchester United's top brass are understood to be standing by their man for now. But with Amorim's position looking more perilous by the week, noise over potential replacements continue to grow in the background, including the prospect of an Old Trafford return for Carrick.",
      "The Sun claim that Carrick is among the caretaker options open to United should they decide a change of manageris necessary. The former Middlesbrough manager, 44, took charge of two games for United in late 2021 when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked and spent time on the club's coaching staff following a 12-year stint as a Red Devils player.",
      "The report notes that Carrick is still close to the United set-up as his 16-year-old son, Jacy, is part of the club's academy. He recently worked as a pundit for Amazon Prime's coverage of the Champions League, interviewing Tottenham head coach, Thomas Frank.",
      "Intriguingly, Solskjaer tipped Carrick as a future Manchester United manager during an interview with The Athletic in 2023. “I am 100 per cent sure that Michael will be the manager of Manchester United if he wants to be,” he said. “I cannot see him not being the Manchester United manager.”",
      "Solskjaer added: “He’s a winner, a massive winner, yet he stays in control of his emotions. He knows what he wants and doesn’t lose his rag. He’ll never be emotional and fight with the players.”",
      "While Carrick could be turned to on a caretaker basis, Manchester United have other coaches in the Premier League who they admire and may consider as possible replacements for Amorim, including Oliver Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Fabian Hurzeler.",

      "Under-pressure Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim faces a must-win game at home to Sunderland on Saturday.",
      "After Saturday's abject 3-1 defeat at Brentford, which left United in 14th place with just seven points from 18, Amorim's position as head coach is under serious threat.",
      "United insist Amorim retains the full backing of those in charge and have rejected suggestions they are already looking at potential candidates to replace him.",
      "Despite that apparent support, Amorim knows he must deliver a convincing win at Old Trafford to ease the pressure on him before heading into the international break.",
      "Here are five issues Amorim must address to give himself the best possible chance of securing a win on Saturday and quieten the calls for him to be replaced.",
      "Amorim kept faith with Altay Bayindir for the Brentford defeat, rather than give a debut to deadline day signing Senne Lammens.",
      "For the most part, Bayindir did well and was arguably United's best player. There was little he could do to prevent Brentford's first goal and he then produced two fine saves, before his defence left him exposed again and United conceded a second. What will have concerned Amorim is the way Bayindir was beaten so easily for Brentford's third goal in added time, seemingly diving out of the way of Mathias Jensen's shot, which was neither high nor found one of the corners of the net.",
      "Against that backdrop, the time has come to give Lammens his chance and start him on Saturday. Bayindir has not done enough to warrant keeping his place and Lammens - despite being an unknown quantity to most and so something of a gamble - deserves the opportunity to showcase the talent that saw United pay £18.2million for him.",
      "United's defensive frailties were once again exposed in the defeat at Brentford, with Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw – both of whom were excellent in the hard-earned 2-1 win over Chelsea a week earlier – the main culprits. Both were hauled off well before the end – Maguire with 24 minutes left to go – and can have no complaints if they find themselves starting on the bench on Saturday.",
      "Amorim's go-to back three this season has been Shaw, De Ligt and Leny Yoro. The latter was benched last Saturday, after a poor performance in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester City, but has to start against the Black Cats.",
      "Given Shaw's poor displays against City and Brentford, Amorim should give a chance to Ayden Heaven on the left side of United's three-man central defence, with De Ligt in the middle. In the wing-back roles, Amad missed the Brentford defeat following a family bereavement, but could return on the right side, with Patrick Dorgu set to continue on the left.",
      "Whatever personnel he chooses, Amorim must bring some solidity and confidence to his weak and hesitant backline.",
      "One of the most peculiar aspects of Amorim's first full season in charge has been his unwillingness to trust Kobbie Mainoo from the start in any of United's six Premier League games.",
      "Despite repeatedly stating how much he “believes in” Mainoo as a player, Amorim has not felt sufficiently confident to start him in the league, insisting he is fighting with skipper Bruno Fernandes for a starting place, a battle the England midfielder has no chance of winning, given United's talisman is seemingly undroppable.",
      "When Mainoo came on for Manuel Ugarte at Brentford with 24 minutes left on the clock, he brought more mobility, greater urgency and more attacking guile to United's midfield. Unfortunately for Mainoo, his heavy touch in added time ultimately opened the door for Brentford to launch a counter-attack that saw them plunder a third goal to kill the game.",
      "But Mainoo deserves the chance to start on Saturday and showcase his attacking prowess from midfield, with United needing to start on the front foot and take the game to Sunderland, although Amorim is likely to start with Casemiro – back from suspension – and Fernandes in the midfield.",
      "As Amorim himself so memorably stated, not even the Pope could make him switch from the 3-4-2-1 system to which he is so wedded. Having such conviction in a system and way of playing can be seen as a strength, but the inability to adapt when it is clearly not working, as evidenced by results this season, is ultimately a weakness.",
      "If Amorim were to switch to a 4-2-3-1 system, it would surely bring out the best in the players he has and bring out the best in him. The defenders would be more settled in familiar roles they have played for the majority of their careers, while the change would allow him to play Casemiro and Mainoo in midfield, Fernandes as a No.10, where he is best deployed to help create and score goals, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo either side of their skipper, and fellow summer signing Benjamin Sesko leading the attack.",
      "It won't happen, of course, given Amorim's refusal to change his system, but if that is the hill the United head coach is willing to die on, we may see the last rites given to him and his 11-month tenure this weekend.",
      "After United's derby defeat at local rivals Manchester City, Amorim admitted his £74m summer signing was too isolated throughout the game and the team needed to play closer to him in order for him to play to his strengths.",
      "It was a similar story against Brentford, even though Sesko claimed his first United goal, scoring at the third attempt after his first two efforts were saved. What Amorim and his players must do on Saturday is improve the service to Sesko, who has been starved of it so far, a fact reflected by the fact he has a solitary goal from six Premier League appearances, albeit only three of them starts.",
      "Sesko registered 21 goals for RB Leipzig last season, so has shown he can score consistently at the highest level, but has yet to develop the understanding with his new teammates to allow him to find the net freely.",
      "One feature of Sesko's first half a dozen outings for United has been his willingness to make darting runs off the ball, yet these have not been picked out by his teammates, which is something Amorim and his staff must work on ahead of the Sunderland game.",

      "Amad, who has mainly been deployed as a right wing-back by Amorim, had started five of United's six games this season, but was allowed compassionate leave last week, which meant he missed Saturday's trip to west London.",
      "Explaining the situation ahead of United's trip to Brentford, Amorim said: “Someone in his family passed away, so we are giving all the support to Amad. We understood it was important to him to have his time and we are here for him.”",
      "News of Amad's family bereavement came after he was criticised on social media by some fans for posting a picture of him and former United winger Alejandro Garnacho swapping shirts after the Chelsea game.",
      "Garnacho made an acrimonious exit from United in the summer, joining Chelsea in a £40million deal, and was subjected to sustained abuse by home fans on his return to Old Trafford.",
      "Following the backlash from fans over the pictures he posted of him and Garnacho, Amad deleted all the posts from his Instagram and X accounts.",
      "Asked about the incident, Amorim said: \"I say the same thing to my players - shut down social media. It's like that nowadays. It's a price you have to pay. The important thing is the club and his friends are real life for Amad. We are here for him. \"",
      "The 23-year-old Ivory Coast international is likely to return to the starting line-up against Sunderland in place of Diogo Dalot, who struggled on his return from injury in the loss at the Gtech Community Stadium.",

      "Noussair Mazraoui is still sidelined through injury and will not be available until after the October international break, which begins next week.",

      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe may well be regretting telling Ruben Amorim he sees this season as the start of his head coach's Manchester United tenure.",
      "Amorim revealed as much recently, when asked what was discussed at a meeting between him and United co-owner Ratcliffe ahead of the team's 2-1 win over Chelsea.",
      "“He was explaining that it's a long project,” said Amorim. “He [Ratcliffe] said many times that this is my first season. For me, it's not.”",
      "Amorim's admission that he does not see this as his first season in charge, as if last term's shocking results and performances can just be consigned to the dustbin, flies in the face of Ratcliffe's take on it.",
      "If Ratcliffe does see this season as the start of Amorim's reign and has written off last season's lowest-ever Premier League finish of 15th and the failure to qualify for Europe, why were he and chief executive Omar Berrada so determined to get their Portuguese head coach in position last season?",
      "After all, Amorim has gone on the record as saying he wanted to see out the remainder of last season at Sporting Lisbon, then take over at United, giving him a full pre-season and a summer transfer window with his new club.",
      "Yet Amorim was told by Berrada, back in October, following the sacking of Erik ten Hag that it was “now or never” and that United would look elsewhere for a new head coach if he was unwilling to leave mid-season to make the move to take over at Old Trafford.",
      "Given the calamities that unfolded last season at United under Amorim, the 40-year-old's initial wish to stay on at Sporting until the summer was vindicated, with his side lurching from one crushing defeat to another, culminating in their meek Europa League final defeat to Tottenham in Bilbao, which saw the team miss out on Europe for only the second time in 35 years.",
      "The problem with Ratcliffe choosing to frame this season as Amorim's first in charge is that it is impossible to view this season's results – which have been just as underwhelming as last season – in isolation, given United's players are clearly suffering a hangover - emotionally and psychologically - from last term's embarrassing finish, the club's lowest for half a century.",
      "The failure to qualify for Europe means United have no midweek games this season and no midweek domestic fixtures, following their humiliating EFL Cup exit at League Two Grimsby. That means they have to wait an entire week for the opportunity to atone for a defeat or poor performance, which is again a legacy of last season, one Ratcliffe wants everyone – Amorim included – to forget ever happened.",
      "But Amorim is smarter than that. He knows he is being judged as much on last season as this one and that unless he can oversee a dramatic turnaround in results, starting with Saturday's visit of Sunderland to Old Trafford, Ratcliffe and the United hierarchy may be forced to take action to arrest the team's continued slide.",
      "In that context, last season is proving every bit as damaging as this one for Amorim and cannot simply be airbrushed from memory.",

      "Former England manager Gareth Southgate would turn down an offer from Manchester United if Ruben Amorim were to be dismissed. Back in March 2024, when Erik ten Hag's position was under scrutiny, Southgate was a top candidate for the role at United.",
      "However, Southgate remained committed to his duties with England, leading the team to the final of that summer's European Championships. Despite United's interest, Southgate declined all overtures.",
      "Ten Hag managed to secure the FA Cup and was given a stay of execution before lasting until October, where he was then replaced by Amorim following Ruud van Nistelrooy's short-term interim stint. Following England's impressive performance at the Euros in Germany, Southgate chose to step down and has since taken a hiatus from football.",
      "He has not returned to the sport, instead focusing on public speaking and motivational work. Southgate has also landed a gig hosting a show for the BBC.",
      "It is understood that Southgate is not in any hurry to return to football. However, he is keeping his options open - both within and outside the sport.",
      "He has been spotted at numerous matches and other sporting events in recent months, and maintains close ties with several of his former colleagues at the FA.",
      "Interestingly, Southgate is also good friends with Dan Ashworth, who had a long-term plan to bring Southgate to United during his tenure. Ashworth's stint as sporting director lasted just five months.",
      "The current United manager, Amorim, is facing mounting pressure due to his team's disastrous start to the season. United have only managed two victories in seven matches across all competitions and were embarrassingly knocked out of the Carabao Cup by underdogs Grimsby Town.",
      "But United chiefs maintain that Amorim continues to have their full backing and, at present, there are no plans to dismiss him. The club have also refuted allegations that they have been in direct contact with Southgate.",
      "This weekend, they welcome high-flying Sunderland before the international break, followed by a daunting journey to fierce rivals Liverpool. Should the Portuguese fail to secure a win in either of these fixtures, Ratcliffe may be forced to contemplate a change, despite the fact that terminating Amorim and his coaching staff would cost United around £15m in compensation.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "After training with the academy, Malacia has now been welcomed back to the first-team group, raising the possibility of him being named in a Premier League matchday squad again.",
      "Club sources have stressed that it was always the plan to reintegrate Malacia into the first-team group once the defender had failed to find a new club in the summer transfer window.",
      "Welcoming Malacia back into the fold is not a reaction to results or a suggestion that he will be used to start at wing-back. It remains to be seen whether he will even make the bench for a game.",
      "It would have been unfair for Malacia to continue to train with the academy, and with the benefit of hindsight, it was unfair to categorise him in the 'bomb squad' this summer.",
      "The Dutchman did not work his ticket like Rashford, Garnacho and Sancho. Malacia is simply not good enough for United. Amorim looked at Malacia after the former's arrival from Sporting Lisbon in November and quickly decided he should look for a new club in the January transfer window.",
      "Malacia was shipped out to PSV Eindhoven on loan but made just six starts in all competitions during that stint, which confirmed ahead of the official decision that the Dutch side would not be signing him permanently.",
      "PSV won the Eredivisie last season, so perhaps it was unrealistic for Malacia to break into their side after joining in the middle of the campaign, but his performances since his return from a serious knee injury last season suggest his sights would be lowered for his next move.",
      "Spanish side Elche came close to signing Malacia, but the move collapsed on transfer deadline day. The options were limited when the window closed and it wasn't a particular surprise to see him remain at United.",
      "United have done the right thing by reintegrating Malacia into the first-team. Sources have praised his professionalism in the past, and he hadn't crossed Amorim like the other members of the so called bomb squad.",
      "Amorim saw something he did not like with Rashford when he was dropped for the Manchester derby in December. Garnacho publicly questioned Amorim after the Europa League final. Sancho has been an outcast at United since falling out with Erik ten Hag in September 2023.",
      "There have been no concerns with Malacia's attitude or behaviour during his time in Manchester. In truth, it was easy to refer to that group of players as the 'bomb squad' as two words summed up five players.",
      "Now Malacia still needs to find a new club in January, but it's the right decision to welcome him back.",

      "United suffered a 3-1 defeat to Brentford at the weekend, which means Amorim is still yet to win back-to-back games in the Premier League since his appointment from Sporting Lisbon.",
      "Amorim is understood to retain the backing of the board, despite suffering a further setback at the Gtech Community Stadium, and United have insisted no replacement is being lined up.",
      "That hasn't stopped Amorim's future from dominating headlines. United were forced to clarify that Amorim would not be axed after defeat to Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup last month, and supporters are becoming increasingly impatient with United's failure to string together a run of positive results.",
      "They were all asked to react to the start of the campaign and give their honest thoughts.",
      "Tot Barling, a lifelong United fan and European away regular, said: \"I mean, inevitably you've got to be disappointed [with the start to the season]. I know it took Fergie five years and Klopp five years, but that doesn't happen these days. You have to give time to build, but in the modern game, he's been there long enough. With the summer signings, one was hoping for a good start.",
      "\"It looked ok against Arsenal, albeit the result wasn't good. I was talking to friends after Saturday and I was disappointed with the whole feeling. The players don't look like they're up for it.",
      "\"Amorim has lost his spark, that joyous spark that he had when he first came, and so there's not a lot at the moment to grab hold of in terms of when is it going to get better? How will it get better?",
      "\"I'm disappointed and worried to summarise. For a man who seems to be so tactically aware, he is intransigent. It's clearly not working for whatever reason. Maybe the Premier League does not suit his formation compared to Portugal's top-flight.",
      "\"I can't believe now with the turnover of players that it's because they are not all up to understanding what he wants. Maybe it just doesn't work. I'm not sure that giving him more time will help.",
      "\"I don't know whether getting rid of him is going to help either because I'm not sure what the deep-seated problem is at the club. We've gone through so many managers who haven't been able to turn it around. Although I have one controversial view that if we hadn't brought Ole back, I think he would have done a good job. But that scuppered him.",
      "\"Apart from that, it always ends up in these dressing room conflicts, reports of the manager losing the dressing room, and that's how it appears to be at the moment, because the players don't seem to be responding to what he wants.\"",
      "Barling continued: \"He's an intelligent man, he's principled and knows what he wants, but I was just looking it up. The phrase 'madness is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result' is what he seems to be doing at the moment.",
      "\"You would have thought common sense... The opposition is different each week, so you surely have to change your system, and given that the players at the moment aren't responding, that's another reason to tweak it. His refusal to do that either before or during a game is baffling for somebody with a good understanding of the game. That is what is confusing me.",
      "\"I don't know whether he is actually just not that good at understanding the game, or whether he only knows this way of doing it and he's got nothing else to try. But my view would be, he must know the writing is on the wall with the way things are going, so why not mix it up a bit?",
      "\"Bruno [Fernandes] is being played out of position, in a role he cannot fulfil. Why didn't he take the wrath of the fans, take the £100m and sell Bruno, and say well, he wasn't going to get in the No.10 role because I have Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There are too many inconsistencies. And likewise, I'm not saying he's better or worse, but why sell [Rasmus] Hojlund and bring in [Benjamin] Sesko. They are very similar players, Sesko is untried in the Premier League. Everybody agreed Hojlund wasn't working because he wasn't getting service from the wings or midfield.",
      "\"You go and replace with him with a guy who has scored a few goals in the German league, but who relies on service from the wings and midfield. And you're not giving him that service. All they've done is spend money on a young and unproven striker in the same mould.\"",
      "Matt Pickett, who has a season ticket in the Stretford End, said: \"It's the same s***. We're just getting worse. I was at the Arsenal game and I saw a completely different team. The chances we were creating, the way we were playing. We were unlucky with an individual error costing a goal, and then we should have had a penalty. Even though we lost, I was quite happy.",
      "\"However, if he can't adapt to different systems now, I wouldn't be sad if he were gone tomorrow. I liked him for getting rid of some of the deadwood, wanting to bring back standards and not pandering to some of the bigger names.",
      "\"But the stats don't lie now. At any other serious club he would be gone, regardless of what he's good at saying or doing in a press conference. I don't want him to go because I would like him to stay, but if he did go, then it wouldn't be an issue for me. If anything, it would be more exciting.",
      "\"You can't go that long without winning back-to-back games in the Premier League. It's inexcusable now. Sunderland are above us in the league. The players we have, that shouldn't be the case.",
      "\"I know we had a tough start with the fixtures, but we should have beat Fulham, we shouldn't be getting beat by Brentford, we scraped it against Burnley and only beat Chelsea probably because they had 10 men for a large part of the game.",
      "\"And I was looking at it, the games Amorim has won have been against bad teams. He keeps changing the starting team. He's stubborn and it will cost him the job, but I don't think he cares any more.",
      "\"Fergie was always making little tweaks to his system and evolving. It's obvious to everyone, you're going to have to be able to change how we play. Certainly if it's short-term to depend on who we are playing.",
      "\"The wing backs don't really do anything, Dalot has been poor and Amorim is just digging in more. We're getting into Ten Hag territory now. And why did Yoro not start on Saturday? It's just concerning.",
      "\"As a match-going fan, I'm getting bored, and getting bored of the excuses, bored of getting beaten. It's hard in the work group when I can't even stick out. We have bought decent players.\"",
      "Pickett added: \"If you look at Madrid, Barca, even some of the lower league teams, if it's not working, they make a change. You don't get time now. If you're losing because we're playing so well and someone makes a mistake, you can forgive it, but not when we're getting overrun by Brentford.",
      "\"We don't look like we have the capacity to score against some teams. I was firmly behind Amorim with Garnacho. It was disappointing, but I was behind him. The way he managed that one was good. Even with Rashford. He did nothing for two years and couldn't be a****. When Amorim got rid of him, I thought fair play because you're making hard decisions and putting the club first.",
      "\"Even with the Mainoo thing when he wanted to leave on loan. Just because he wants to play at the World Cup, what if someone got injured and we needed him? He's 20, you play for United.",
      "\"I like his man management, and the decisions he makes like that are refreshing and almost Fergie-esque. But then his ability to actually look at a game and change the system isn't there. He's stubborn.\"",
      "Salford-based Will Cooper said: \"They're incredibly inconsistent, which is annoying. There are moments we do look good, and then there are times when we look like we've never played football before.",
      "\"I thought we could have won 4-0 against Burnley, but we made a meal of it. City game was a disgrace. It looked like the players didn't want to be there against Grimsby, but the system is irrelevant for that game because our players are so much better than their players. It shouldn't have even been a close game.",
      "\"I don't think he should be sacked, though. I can see what he's building towards, but I think the entire system is built around having two great midfielders. You can't play with two in midfield against a three-man midfield without having the players for it. We need someone who can win the ball back, who can carry it.",
      "\"I think he should be given more time. The team selection is sometimes a bit odd, but I still think he's trying to figure out his best team.\"",

      "Alejandro Garnacho described being cast aside by Ruben Amorim as a \"bad moment in life.\"",
      "However, he refused to criticise Manchester United following an improved display in Chelsea's 1-0 triumph over Benfica in the Champions League. Garnacho arrived at United's academy in 2020 aged 16 and swiftly established himself as a favourite at Old Trafford after breaking through to the first team.",
      "Nevertheless, his future at the club became uncertain after losing favour under Amorim, finding himself sidelined alongside Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia as members of a five-man 'bomb squad' that trained in isolation during the summer. The 21-year-old winger ultimately secured a £40million switch to Chelsea in the transfer window to revitalise his career, with his cross leading to the own goal that dampened Jose Mourinho's return with Benfica on Tuesday evening.",
      "\"But I have nothing bad to say about the club, my old club Manchester United. It was just a bad moment in life but now I'm very happy to be here and to play in this competition and to get the three points today.",
      "Garnacho has been gradually introduced to life at Chelsea by Enzo Maresca following the Argentina international's disrupted pre-season preparations. He remained on the bench during his return to Old Trafford a fortnight ago before enduring a challenging debut start for the Blues in their unconvincing League Cup triumph over Lincoln City.",
      "There, he faced jeers from opposition supporters. However, Garnacho looked lively against Benfica and prompted the own goal that settled a closely-fought encounter.",
      "His display earned him special recognition from Maresca after the match, with the Blues boss applauding his overall contribution. He said: \"Alejandro was very good today. Not only on the ball but defensively, he was very good in the way he pressed.",
      "\"In the last third he has freedom to go one-v-one when he decides. To arrive in the box is important because it's from there we score. I was pleased with him.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "It was previously reported that the Red Devils might postpone Amorim's departure due to the substantial severance package he would be entitled to.",
      "Amorim, who was signed from Sporting for £9.2million, earns £6.5m per year as part of a two-and-a-half-year contract. According to the Daily Mail, United would have to pay out £12m if they were to sack the 40-year-old before he completes a year of service.",
      "Considering he joined on November 1 last year, this could potentially be the timeframe Amorim has to demonstrate his value or face being sacked. This is because the Portuguese's compensation package would decrease if the board were to dismiss him after this date.",
      "In the coming weeks, United have two home games at Old Trafford and three away matches against teams currently in the Premier League's top five. The first match is against newly promoted Sunderland, who have been performing exceptionally well since their return to the top flight.",
      "At the beginning of the season, the Black Cats might have seemed like an easy opponent. However, they've only lost one out of six games so far, with wins against Brentford, West Ham United, and Nottingham Forest.",
      "A challenging journey to Anfield awaits after the international break on October 19, with the league leaders having secured five victories and suffered just one defeat domestically this campaign. Despite recent setbacks against Palace and subsequently Galatasaray in the Champions League, United supporters will harbour little optimism about the prospect of travelling to Merseyside so early on.",
      "Brighton come to visit next, and this could represent the solitary fixture Amorim might approach with some assurance. The Seagulls have a balanced record in the Premier League and are in 10th, having drawn with Tottenham and lost to Bournemouth in September.",
      "Their commanding 3-1 triumph over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, albeit against 10 men, might signal concerning signs regarding their potential away performances. However, Amorim will anticipate the supporters rallying behind him for that encounter.",
      "Following that are two away fixtures, one at Nottingham Forest and another to Tottenham, which could very well represent the ultimate test for the United manager. When questioned about whether he can still reverse fortunes in Manchester following a 3-1 loss to Brentford, Amorim said: \"It's like ups and downs.",
      "\"When you win, you feel that everything, the momentum is there. When you lose, you go back to the same place and you fight again for one win that can help you to create the momentum.",

      "Gareth Southgate has been tipped to succeed Ruben Amorim at Manchester United as he would represent a more affordable option whilst marking a significant change in approach.",
      "Amorim finds himself facing mounting scrutiny after United's 3-1 loss at Brentford in the Premier League on Saturday, which was his 17th league defeat across 33 matches at the helm. Southgate has surfaced as a possible replacement after talkSPORT claimed that United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe had already approached the former England manager directly.",
      "The ex-Wrexham shot-stopper, speaking on his Fozcast podcast, highlighted how the 55-year-old would prove a cheaper alternative compared to Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner and Bournemouth chief Andoni Iraola. Foster delivered his verdict after suggesting Amorim's squad has grown disillusioned with his inflexible tactical approach and that his tenure in the United hot seat is approaching its end.",
      "\"Amorim is right on the brink now,\" he said. \"If they lose another one or two in the next couple of weeks then he's gone. Honestly, if he makes it through the international break, it's 50/50.",
      "\"The predictable nature of it is what's killing Man United, because everybody knows what to expect. Everybody knows what's coming, so this is how we're going to counteract it.",
      "\"Man United's history is built on having wingers getting wide, taking players on and getting balls into the box. When they've got a system now that isn't that way, and it's not working, I can't blame Man United fans for not being happy.\"",
      "Foster added: \"If you watch the game, it's like they're good players, but there's no real system. There's no real flair, there's no real attacking intent. I just think the belief is completely gone from Manchester United. The manager could really be under pressure come the next international break.\"",
      "Despite United's 2-1 win over Chelsea at Old Trafford merely 11 days ago, they couldn't maintain that momentum when they travelled to Brentford at the weekend. The fixture saw Benjamin Sesko score his first goal for the visiting side, whilst Bruno Fernandes missed from the penalty spot following a disputed decision that kept Brentford's Nathan Collins on the field.",
      "Explaining his preference for Southgate over alternative managerial options, Foster said: \"If they're trying to get Iraola or Glasner, it's going to cost an awful lot of money. I know Glasner's contract is up in the summer, but he's going to want £250,000 a week for himself as a wage. They're going to want compensation to some point.",
      "\"I just think with Gareth Southgate, it's so different to what they've ever done, and what they're doing isn't working. You look at the past four or five managers now since Fergie went and they're not working. It's as simple as that.",
      "\"I just think that with how hard it is to play for Man United and the pressure involved in pulling that shirt on, sometimes you might need a bit of a different approach.\"",

      "Manchester United fans look away: Jamie Carragher might be right about Ruben Amorim.",
      "United supporters may not pay attention to what Liverpool legend Carragher has to say, but he is one of the best pundits on television, and his theory about why Amorim has not been sacked could be true.",
      "There has been intense discussion about Amorim's future again since the defeat to Brentford last weekend.",
      "Amorim could not take the opportunity to win back-to-back Premier League games for the first time, although United sources have insisted he still retains the backing of the board.",
      "Carragher said: \"I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager.",
      "\"But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.\"",
      "He continued: \"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system.",
      "\"It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is. This is on Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox or Jim Ratcliffe.",
      "\"They brought him in. They knew that when they brought him in. The problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, 'I could do a better job than that.'",
      "\"The only positive for Manchester United is that they have not gone all in on his system. They have gone all in in terms of giving him money to spend but they have not bought lots of centre-backs and lots of wing-backs.",
      "\"The players they have brought in could easily be flipped into a back four with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, Mbeumo on the right wing, Cunha on the left, Sesko up front and I think a competent Manchester United manager could get that team into the European places or certainly be fighting for them.\"",
      "Carragher's argument about United chiefs persevering with Amorim because he was their appointment has merit. It seems likely he would have already been sacked if he'd been hired by a previous regime.",
      "Berrada, the CEO, was responsible for appointing Amoirm. Wilcox, director of football, has been the driving force behind recruitment since Ratcliffe gained control of football operations last year.",
      "Berrada and Wilcox should be scrutinised if the decision is eventually taken to sack Amorim - they are paid handsomely to make the most important decisions and could face consequences.",
      "It would reflect badly on the pair if Amorim were to fail, and all the signs indicate that he must now overcome a mountain to turn the club around after a disappointing start to the season.",
      "You cannot keep a manager in a job to prevent embarrassment in the boardroom. Having said that, it's understandable that Berrada and Wilcox want to give Amorim as much time as possible. They are desperate for him to succeed, for the club and for themselves.",
      "It was fascinating to hear Wilcox speak at a recent event for ex-players at Old Trafford where he said: \"This club is a wonderful club. I just pray we get the opportunity to turn it around.\"",
      "Wilcox is a close Ratcliffe ally. He has been empowered at United since joining from Southampton, but that comment suggested even Wilcox knows his position could be under threat.",
      "Ratcliffe demonstrated his ruthlessness when Dan Ashworth was dismissed. Ashworth oversaw the decision to keep Erik ten Hag after the FA Cup final and paid the price for that decision.",
      "That suggests there could be a further boardroom shake-up if Amorim faces the axe this season.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee appears to have emerged as a potential target for Cesc Fabregas's Como ahead of the January transfer window. The 24-year-old striker, who Manchester United signed from Bologna for £36.5m last year, has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag in the dugout, Zirkzee has struggled to force himself into the starting lineup. So far this season, the Netherlands international has featured just three times in the Premier League, making one start.",
      "Despite having only played 82 minutes across all competitions, Zirkzee has reportedly attracted interest from the Serie A. According to Italian outlet Corriere Como, Como are interested in signing the Dutchman as they push to qualify for the Champions League with claims of an 'agreement' already having been struck.",
      "Fabregas' side, who finished 10th last term, are currently eighth after just five games, with only four points separating them from AC Milan at the top of the table. The report claims that the former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder is preparing to 'reshape' his team in the upcoming transfer window.",
      "It's said that the club want to combine experience with 'young but ready players', and Zirkzee fits the profile. Como have a 'concrete interest' in the United forward, whose contract at Old Trafford runs until June 2029 and has also been linked with Juventus.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "At the start of the year, Amorim expressed his intentions to keep Zirkzee at the club. Speaking to talkSPORT, the Reds boss said: \"I want to keep Josh because he gives everything and he’s trying in training but we don’t know.",
      "\"The window is open and we will see what happens. We just need to focus on training and to take this for the other games. It’s just one point so let’s focus on the performance for the next games.\"",
      "Then, in April, Amorim heaped praise on the Dutchman. He told reporters: \"Yes, he's doing a great job. Also a very important thing was the way the fans react after that incident.",
      "\"So if you see, every time, even if Josh is not playing, every time he gets on the pitch or just warming up, our fans sing the Josh song. So that is massive for the player, so it's 50-50. Fifty per cent part of the fans and 50 per cent of Josh.\"",
      "On helping Zirkzee find his feet, Amorim added: \"I explained the situation because, as a former player, I wanted to hear some explanation sometimes from the coaches and I am really open that.",
      "\"I just want to help the team and then work with him. With all the work that all the staff is doing with him he's improving, and then I put him to play. This is the only way to show confidence to the player.\"",

      "Dwight Yorke has criticised Manchester United for their lack of consistency with Ruben Amorim in charge.",
      "United returned from the September international break to lose against Manchester City, but the players responded by securing a spirited victory against Chelsea the following weekend.",
      "Amorim hoped to win back-to-back league games for the first time since arriving at Old Trafford against Brentford. The bookmakers made United the favourites to claim three points at the Gtech Community Stadium, however, the Bees had a two-goal advantage within 20 minutes and wrapped up the victory with a 3-1 win.",
      "The inquest has begun and Amorim's future is dominating headlines again. United's head coach has won 34 points from a possible 99 in the top-flight since his appointment in November.",
      "In an interview with The National, Yorke was asked about United's awful start to the campaign and said: “[Amorim] has been there nearly a year, you expect things to kind of progress slowly. But it seems like we are making one step forward and two step backwards. There is no consistency there.",
      "\"And I think it's kind of left us all scratching our heads at the moment. Where we are as a football club is not where we expected it to be. It's a very difficult stage for us. We thought after the Sir Alex [Ferguson] era we will go through a phase but did not expect it to be this long.”",
      "Yorke continued: “The players that they brought in are certainly better players than what we already had. So that's always likely to improve the team, but we haven't seen that.",
      "“We expect the start to be a little bit better and now we, again, seem to go back to where we sort of finished last season when we thought we would be progressing this year. And that's a bit of a concern.",
      "“I think at the moment we are fighting for consistency, seeing a pattern of play or something that we can relate to. We're not encouraged, we might be encouraged one week. We make one step forward and two steps backwards.",
      "“The inconsistency is not knowing what to expect. You don't really know how to identify what United are, or you don't know what United is likely to turn up. And I think that's a frustrating part.",
      "\"If people see something a little bit more consistent and see a certain style of play, you can kind of relate to that. But at the minute we just don’t know what's going on. And it's a difficult watch.”",
      "Bruno Fernandes' penalty in the 75th minute against Brentford was saved. Yorke said of the skipper: “A captain is more than just the playing side of it. He's the one that leads the team, he's a talisman.",
      "\"He's the one that everyone looks to rally around the team and if you find your captain is struggling, this season in particular… He has been outstanding, I think, over the last three years or so where he stood up to everything and really brought the team along and kept us where we are.",
      "\"But in reality, when your captain is also struggling, that's going to be a double whammy.”",

      "Amorim spoke for six minutes and 12 seconds during his post-match address to the media. And it's starting to feel like United's head coach is on borrowed time in Manchester.",
      "Amorim praised United's aggression against Chelsea, but that was absent against Brentford, who did not look like the team that had suffered a bad defeat the previous weekend.",
      "The warning signs were there from the first whistle. Brentford found pockets of space to exploit and Amorim did not look pleased, pacing up and down the touchline with his water bottle.",
      "Nathan Collins should have received a red card for bringing Bryan Mbeumo to the ground, but Bruno Fernandes did not convert the penalty. That decision went against United, but they were not good enough.",
      "Amorim chugged water and dropped his bottle to the floor when Mathias Jensen scored Brentford's third goal. He looked like a manager on the brink, although United sources have insisted he retains the backing of the board and no replacement is currently being lined up.",
      "Speaking before Brentford, Amorim said: \"It's normal the fans don't know what is going to happen in the next game. To be honest, I have an idea, but I don't know how it's going to be and I'm the manager.\"",
      "Amorim was not joking when he said he doesn't know which version will turn up, but that is the reason many fans are starting to believe he is not the manager to take United forward.",
      "It's worrying that Amorim still needs to micromanage his players during matches, despite being in charge for 11 months. His behaviour on the touchline hasn't changed from his first game against Ipswich Town.",
      "Every football manager gives instructions from the touchline during matches, but the extent to which Amorim must gesture for players to get into the areas he wants is a red flag.",
      "There have been concerns with the system from the moment Amorim was appointed. Some loyal season ticket holders questioned why a coach who plays a formation that does not align with United's traditional philosophy had been appointed, while others suggested it was time for meaningful change.",
      "Amorim is wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and has joked that even the Pope could not make him change his approach. That stubbornness may prove to be his undoing at Old Trafford.",
      "The outlook for the weeks ahead looked significantly better after a spirited Chelsea victory, but Amorim was unable to win back-to-back league games for the first time. United continue to take one step forward and two steps back, which has made progress impossible.",
      "The underlying data suggest United have improved this season, but a spreadsheet will not save Amorim from the chopping block - securing wins and moving up the league table will.",
      "The three games sandwiched between the September and October international breaks felt huge for Amorim, although it's illogical to decide his future on a game-by-game basis.",
      "What would change if United win against Sunderland before the October break? It feels like a victory would only delay the inevitable, but it's not a surprise that Ineos are dithering.",
      "Amorim was Omar Berrada's appointment. Jason Wilcox has been the driving force behind recruitment since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's investment. It reflects badly on United's chiefs if they decide to sack Amorim.",
      "United spent £215million in the summer transfer window and Amorim has no excuses not to make it work. However, a roaring success story is now required for him to turn it around.",
      "\"The good days are coming,\" promised Amorim on the final day of last season, and a banner with those words has recently been unfurled in the Stretford End to show support for him.",
      "It will be interesting to see whether that banner is raised against Sunderland this weekend.",

      "Manchester United are not currently lining up a replacement for Ruben Amorim, but should Ineos decide to pull the trigger and sack the Portuguese, Crystal Palace's Oliver Glasner will be one of the frontrunners to come in.",
      "Speculation about Amorim's future at Old Trafford has intensified in recent weeks following several disappointing defeats. The Manchester derby defeat two weeks ago was then compounded by another loss at Brentford on Saturday.",
      "On Sunday, it was reported that Glasner, Andoni Iraola and Gareth Southgate were all on their radar. Zinedine Zidane, Fabian Hurzeler and Xavi have all also been mentioned in the following hours.",
      "Glasner is a man in high demand at the moment after his record at Crystal Palace. He guided the Eagles to the FA Cup last season and has started this term in fine form. However, the Austrian is in the final 12 months of his contract, and that has resulted in him being linked with every vacant job.",
      "Recently, he was asked about the rumours linking him with the job at Old Trafford and other 'top clubs' by the Austrian edition of Kicker, and he refused to give much away. \"I follow all the rumours - and that's all there is - neutrally and completely relaxed,\" he said.",
      "\"Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Glasner has been named as the favourite to replace Amorim by many in the fanbase due to his immense success at Palace. He has also deployed a 3-4-2-1 style of play that has reaped the benefits - something United and Amorim have failed to do.",
      "What could be even better for United is what pull he could have in their transfer plans. It's well-known that a new midfielder is one of the priority areas when the window reopens, and Adam Wharton is among the players linked.",
      "Previously, it was understood that Palace valued Wharton at £60million. CIES Football Observatory reckon the former Blackburn Rovers player should be valued more in the region of €32million (£27.7m) to €37m (£32m).",
      "Using a sample of over past 8,000 transfers, the website evaluates prices of players from the five major European top-flights using the statistical technique of multiple linear regression - with fees paid by clubs as an independent variable. Alongside United target Carlos Baleba, Wharton offers defensive security and energy, something that Amorim's current crop has failed to do. The England international has developed into one of the best midfielders in the Premier League, and his arrival is exactly what United should have gone for in the summer. The signings of both Glasner and Wharton may well be the perfect welcoming gift for the new era. Amorim and United, though, will be hoping it doesn't come to that just yet. When the January transfer window opens, United are expected to be in the market for a central midfielder, with or without Amorim. Wharton is one of the most-suitable options with the England international consistently showing his ability for Palace.",

      "David joined the MEN as Chief Manchester United Writer in September 2025.",
      "If Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Manchester United hierarchy are not devising a succession plan for Ruben Amorim, then they are burying their heads in the sand and doing the club a disservice.",
      "In simple terms, the gamble on Amorim has failed spectacularly and the time has come to accept that reality, however uncomfortable and embarrassing, end his ill-fated tenure and appoint a replacement head coach who can steer the club out of their current crisis.",
      "Amorim's nine wins from 33 Premier League games and an equally lamentable haul of 34 points from a possible 99 is indefensible and there are no clear signs that the situation is improving, as evidenced by Saturday's meek 3-1 capitulation at Brentford.",
      "United have seven points from 18 this season and have lost three times already – Erik ten Hag was sacked after four defeats in nine last term, and Amorim is heading the same way.",
      "Amorim has failed to win back-to-back league games after nearly a year in charge, something even the doomed David Moyes managed in his ill-fated spell in charge, and United have regressed under the 40-year-old Portuguese head coach.",
      "Players are starting to lose faith in Amorim and his methods, in particular his intransigence over his controversial 3-4-3 system, even when it is patently clear to see that the personnel he has at his disposal are ill-suited to it and cannot get to grips with it.",
      "Amorim's insistence on playing skipper Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role, rather than in a more advanced attacking position where he is more comfortable and effective, is an act of self-sabotage, with United's talisman having scored just once from open play this season.",
      "The failure to qualify for Europe last season – only the second time in 35 years United have suffered that fate - was framed as a blessing in disguise by Amorim, the free weeks meaning it would give him and his staff more time to work with the players on the system and philosophy.",
      "But that theory has been blown apart by United's miserable start to the season, as has the bold rhetoric from United that a full pre-season under Amorim, coupled with £236million worth of new signings, would make the team stronger from the get-go. United are currently languishing in 14th spot, one place above where they finished last season, with a goal difference of minus four, while their humiliating EFL Cup exit to League Two Grimsby Town means they now have even fewer games in which to address their shortcomings, as well as seeing one route to a trophy closed off.",
      "It is not just the defeats that are doing for Amorim – even their two league wins have been unconvincing. Against Burnley, they should have been out of sight by half-time, but were twice pegged back before needing a 97th-minute penalty to seal a 3-2 win. It was a similar story against 10-man Chelsea, leading 2-0 before Casemiro's dismissal saw them cling on for a narrow 2-1 win.",
      "Amorim's charisma and candour is refreshing, but cannot mask United's clear regression under him. There is a desperation within United for Amorim to turn things around, not least from chief executive Omar Berrada, who put his reputation on the line by personally driving his appointment, but there is no shame in admitting that was a mistake and moving decisively and swiftly to rectify it, in the face of such overwhelming evidence.",
      "United did so with former sporting director Dan Ashworth, jettisoning him after just five months, and must now do the same with Amorim, before the crisis deepens, leaving the team facing an ugly relegation battle – a genuine possibility given their current precarious position.",

      "Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner could have been managing a different Premier League side this season as the Austrian is linked with Manchester United.",
      "Bookmakers have named Glasner as the frontrunner to replace Ruben Amorim, amid growing speculation about Amorim’s future at United following their 3-1 defeat to Brentford last weekend. The Portuguese head coach is believed to still have the backing of the board despite the latest setback at the Gtech Community Stadium, with United maintaining that no replacement is currently being lined up.",
      "Club sources said similar following the humiliating Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby Town and supporters have grown increasingly frustrated with the team's inability to put together a consistent run of positive results. The 2-1 win over Chelsea lifted spirits at Old Trafford, but the performance against Brentford was a setback.",
      "A number of managers have been rumoured as potential replacements, and Glasner, who has won the FA Cup and Community Shield, could have replaced Ange Postecoglou at Tottenham earlier this summer.",
      "Speaking on talkSPORT, former Palace chairman Simon Jordan revealed that he suggested Glasner to ex-Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy during the summer. Spurs were searching for a new manager to replace Postecoglou, but Levy ultimately chose to appoint Thomas Frank from Brentford.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"I like Glasner. With all due respect to the departed, I actually said to Daniel (Levy) about him during the summer, ‘Why not Glasner?’,\" Jordan disclosed. \"He had his own views on it, but I think he's a top, top manager.",
      "\"Do I think he'll be Palace manager at the end of the season? I'll be amazed because he's got nothing left on his contract now. This is his last year. He hasn't been given the support yet. He's working the oracle. They're taking their best players out, repeatedly taking their best players out.",
      "\"Fortunately for Palace, which is the great thing they're not taking them out, these clubs are having to pay for them now. That's the good thing about it. [Eberechi] Eze's gone and for top money, Olise went for decent money and people are having to pay for it. And Guehi, he didn't walk out the door. But again, they're operating at their highest level.",
      "\"It's like Nottingham Forest last year. Their run of form, as a unit, as a team is fabulous. Look at the teams that they're beating, look at the results that they're getting and they've got a European competition. So, we'll see how that plays out with the strength of their squad.\"",
      "The Austrian manager has addressed the rumours linking him to the hot seat at Old Trafford. \"I follow all the rumours – and that's all there is – neutrally and completely relaxed,\" he told Kicker.",
      "\"Focusing on the daily work with my players and coaches, and trying to enjoy it as much as possible.\"",
      "Glasner has become the bookmakers' favourite following an impressive stint at Selhurst Park. Gareth Southgate, who was linked with the United job last year, also remains among the frontrunners.",
      "The Eagles are yet to lose a Premier League game this season. Their dramatic late victory over Liverpool on Saturday propelled them up to third in the table, keeping them unbeaten through their first six matches.",

    "body": [
      "Casemiro made a beeline for Ruud van Nistelrooy in the Old Trafford tunnel on his return with Leicester City in February.",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a fluent Spanish speaker, was the conduit between Casemiro and Erik ten Hag after his Portuguese-speaking assistant Mitchell van der Gaag left. Van Nistelrooy started Casemiro in all four of his matches as caretaker manager. Casemiro lingered as Van Nistelrooy spoke, as attached to him as a comfort blanket.",
      "At that time, Casemiro had not started for United in 39 days. He did not get a kick between December 30, the night of the Newcastle United debacle, and January 30. He emerged on 70 minutes in Bucharest with United 2-0 up. The transfer window was still open but the chances of United shifting Casemiro were, like the Trinity test igniting the atmosphere, near zero.",
      "People at United's Carrington training complex noticed Casemiro's personality never wavered during a trying first half of the season. They have always found him to be a warm presence.",
      "His transformation at United in the past two months has been as unexpected as their 3-0 triumph in Bilbao. This is the midfielder who was dropped for last year's FA Cup final and replaced by Toby Collyer with United 2-0 down to Liverpool at half-time eight months ago. Casemiro’s declaration that he was keen to see out his contract in March was framed as more bad news for the club.",
      "Casemiro used his head before Athletic lost theirs in San Mames. Returning to Spain emboldens Casemiro. In San Sebastián and Bilbao, he has reminded Spanish audiences he can still cut it nearly three years on from leaving their shores. United supporters serenaded Casemiro on Thursday night.",
      "The draw with Real Sociedad in mid-March has marked a late turning point in Casemiro's third season in Manchester. With Manuel Ugarte out injured, Ruben Amorim had little choice but to turn to the older defensive midfielder.",
      "Casemiro has since been a fixture in the United starting XI, his importance highlighted by the early withdrawal at Bournemouth last week to preserve him for Bilbao. Ugarte admitted this week he is copying him.",
      "Within a matter of months, Casemiro has gone from unsellable to undroppable. If or when United reach the Europa League final, Casemiro is a shoo-in in midfield. The 3-4-2-1 system Amorim swears by has closed the yawning gaps that developed between the defence and midfield under Ten Hag and Casemiro has the safety net of a third centre back.",
      "United have adjusted Casemiro’s running and pressing triggers. “I think he has improved a lot also,” Amorim opined. “You can see not the way he plays but the way he runs. You can see it, we have the data to show him where he worked really hard.",
      "“He is a very good example. Even Toby sometimes was playing in front of him and [that] it is hard to take for Casemiro. So it is a lesson for all the players in Manchester United.",
      "“No matter what is the past or the last month, everything can change in one moment. Then we understood that he cannot jump all the time pressing high. We need to let him understand and sometimes it is better to put three defenders and let him be the fourth defender and put the wing-backs pressing high. These are all things we are understanding and trying to cope with all the criticisms of the team. But the credit is for Casemiro.”",
      "Amorim has been impressed by how hard Casemiro has worked to meet his demands to regain his place in the team. He noticed that he never complained during those winter weeks warming the bench.",
      "Selflessness is a natural trait of Casemiro's. It was also his undoing this time last year. With United depleted at centre half, he dropped back and was humiliated in the 4-0 drubbing by Crystal Palace.",
      "With Kobbie Mainoo and Christian Eriksen a flimsy shield and Jonny Evans his creaking partner, Casemiro abandoned his position to engage Michael Olise, overcommitted, lost his balance and Olise scored. Six days later, he trundled out of the United third and played Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli onside to square for Leandro Trossard’s tap-in. Sofyan Amrabat was ushered back in from the cold and played his way into the FA Cup final XI.",
      "Jamie Carragher urged Casemiro to “leave the football before the football leaves you”. Casemiro had been pencilled in to flank Amorim for pre-match press duties against Athletic and he would be a worthy choice at Carrington next week. He is a positive story again and one of the squad’s figureheads. United view Casemiro as a quiet leader, mind.",
      "The 33-year-old shared Raphael Varane’s view that a “disconnect” had developed between the players and Ten Hag. It is not a coincidence that Casemiro scored two goals in the first game after Ten Hag was finally sacked. He was committed enough to claim the last goal of the Ten Hag era at West Ham.",
      "When Casemiro discussed the possibility of joining United, he wanted to know three things: where he would live, where he would train and where the stadium was. During FaceTime conversations, he requested to see the club’s gymnasium at Carrington.",
      "United sources have been struck by how leaner Casemiro is this season. People in Madrid said Casemiro used to be in the club's Valdebebas gym at 8am and he often has gym sessions before and after training at Carrington.",
      "Casemiro has struck up a close rapport with some of the masseurs and his English is now a very good level of conversational. He understood our questions in the mixed zone two years ago, when his handshake grip was as tight as a vice. Casemiro's wife, Anna, and children Sara and Caio, are happy in Manchester amid the prospect of a fourth year in England's north west.",
      "Staff at Carrington regard Casemiro as one of the most respectful players they have encountered and that he is strident in protecting the club's image. Sir Jim Ratcliffe dubbed Casemiro as \"overpaid\" and \"not good enough\" in March. Three days later, Casemiro trumped his first-leg performance against Sociedad in the 4-1 win at Old Trafford.",
      "His steep decline over 18 months - dropped for Amrabat, substituted for Collyer, omitted from the Brazil squad - makes Casemiro’s revival so singular. If United win the Europa League it would be churlish to argue someone who has won three trophies in three seasons has been an unsuccessful signing.",
      "Casemiro drove United to a successful 2022-23 season. Without him, they would not have qualified for the Champions League. Ten Hag dubbed him the “cement between the stones”, essentially the glue in the team. Casemiro was central to the Latino rebranding of the United defence that kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League.",
      "Casemiro has returned to that level of influence he wielded in his first season. In Europe, at least. The concern if United do not triumph in Bilbao again this month is Casemiro could be redundant in a campaign devoid of Champions League midweeks. His recent domestic form has been inoffensive but not stellar and United need a young and dynamic new central midfielder in the summer.",
      "The senior figures made the difference in Bilbao, though. Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, two 30-something Portuguese speakers, are naturally close.",
      "“We've got a lot of senior players who need to step up in their moments,” Harry Maguire explained. “I think Case was brilliant tonight. Bruno as well. So we have senior players who need to handle these moments really well.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy, a champion of Casemiro’s, merits credit for that.",

      "“I have a good relationship with the coach, which gives me enough confidence to tell him what position I prefer on the pitch, but I always, always made it clear to him that I am available to perform anywhere, on any trip and in any match.",
      "“I’ve put my heart and soul into this club and I’ll continue to do so, even if sometimes it’s not enough or I don’t play the way I’d like. I swear on my pride that I’ll never give up and I’ll fight until the end, playing wherever I’m needed.”",
      "Defensa Central adds on a potential transfer to Chelsea: ‘As of today, no one at Real Madrid is considering selling Fede Valverde . He’s the team’s vice-captain and a player who has been undisputed in recent years. It’s always been noticeable when the Uruguayan isn’t on the pitch, as he’s always involved in defense and attack and always keeps an eye on his teammates.",
      "‘The player isn’t considering leaving the club anytime soon either. He’s very happy in Madrid and at the best club in the world. He’s always dreamed of playing a very important role on the team and is very close to fulfilling another of his dreams: being the captain. When Dani Carvajal retires or goes to another club, the Uruguayan will take over the armband whenever he plays.’",

      "Former Manchester United winger Antony believes the club “disrespected” him by pushing him out of the club in the summer transfer window.",
      "Antony will go down as one of the Red Devils’ worst signings ever.",
      "He joined Man Utd from Ajax for around £80million in the 2023 summer transfer window and started well, scoring his debut against Arsenal.",
      "But that was as good as it got for the Brazilian at Old Trafford.",
      "In total, Antony registered 12 goals and five assists in 96 appearances across all competitions for Man Utd, winning the Carabao Cup in 2022/23 and the FA Cup in 2023/24.",
      "What makes the signing of Antony even worse is that he was available for around half the price two months before joining, with Ajax significantly increasing their asking price after losing several star players in the 2023 summer window.",
      "After falling out of favour under Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim, Antony joined Real Betis on loan for the second half of last campaign.",
      "He was very impressive, becoming one of the latest players to leave the Red Devils and shine elsewhere.",
      "After impressing in his six-month spell in Seville, helping Betis reach the final of the Europa Conference League, the La Liga club were desperate to sign him permanently.",
      "Betis felt like the only realistic option for Antony all summer, but Man Utd held out for over £20m, which, coupled with his huge salary, was too expensive.",
      "In the end, Betis spent £20m to land the 25-year-old permanently and he’s played four times this season, scoring one and assisting one, with both goal involvements coming against Nottingham Forest in the Europa League last week.",
      "Antony is settling in nicely after returning to Spain, and has discussed the “tough” summer he endured in Manchester.",

      "“They were very tough months in England, more than 40 days in the hotel, training separately…I feel like they disrespected me, but that’s not the point,” he told Spanish outlet Onda Cero.",
      "“I don’t want to create controversy, that’s life. I’m very grateful for the club. There were bad times, but also good times, with two titles.",
      "“My family travelled to Seville four or five days before the deal was finalised. I had the house rented.”",

      "“I think United are going to drive that player wage bill down to below £250m and he’s going to be a big part of it.”",

      "Mbeumo and Cunha have impressed in flashes, though Man Utd remain just as incohesive in attack as they were last season, with more attention needed to be placed on recruits in supporting areas.",
      "The Red Devils did, however, look to address the goalkeeping department, though they settled on relatively unproven 23-year-0ld Senne Lamhers despite being linked with cut-price moves for Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emiliano Martinez, both of whom would have been clear upgrades on Andre Onana.",
      "READ: Amorim sack ‘inevitable’ as shocking managers who solved his ‘big problem’ at Manchester United revealed",
      "United’s naysayers have rightly argued that they need to target a top-tier goalkeeper with a strong personality, a la Donnarumma or Martinez, to cope with the demands of being a No.1 at Old Trafford, with this sentiment further fuelled by Amorim’s refusal to start Lammens ahead of Alter Bayindir, who is certainly not good enough to be anything more than a No.2 for a big club.",

      "And the feeling that Lammens is a pointless signing would be confirmed if Man Utd sign another goalkeeper in 2026, which they are reportedly planning to do.",

      "At this stage, it would not be surprising if/when Chelsea beat Man Utd to Maignan as they did with Liam Delap, but the reported interest from the Red Devils is alarming, as it poses the question: Why on earth did they sign Lammens?",

      "Ruben Amorim ‘has been a disaster for Manchester United’. But there is a collective need to realise just how bad; this reign would be abysmal for any club.",
      "They have picked up a point more than the north Londoners, who changed managers in the summer after the shame of only beating this Manchester United side 1-0 in the Europa League final.",
      "The two clubs immediately above them in that table – West Ham and Wolves – have also sacked their coaches for underperformance, but on Manchester United plough with a manager who has spent three of his 323 days in charge in the top half.",
      "It is a ludicrous lowering of the bar at a club which before this season had never finished lower than 8th – and for most that alone would have been enough to part ways with Erik ten Hag earlier than they did.",
      "“You’re talking about Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world. Let’s be fair, he’s a lucky, lucky boy still to be in a job,” said Duncan Ferguson.",
      "“I think he’s got a bit of credit on what he did last year, coming to Man United when they were struggling, so he came last year and didn’t really want to come last season. I think they’ve given him a wee bit of credit in the bank there.",
      "“But for a team like Man United…you see the stats, the stats are there for all to see. So he’s very lucky to stay in his job. But hopefully he gets another few games, you always want managers to stay in their jobs and be successful. But that’s not good enough.”",
      "Carragher shifted the responsibility onto the silent executive team at Manchester United who chose Amorim and continue to back him in spite of all available evidence.",
      "“I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another,” he said.",
      "“This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don’t think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "“The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don’t want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.”",
      "And it has “been a disaster for Manchester United”. But perhaps the entire world is guilty of overlooking the degree to which this has gone wrong. This is not just Manchester United bad; this is historically Premier League bad.",

      "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has been ‘speaking volumes’ with his decision to go ahead with a party that wasn’t his party.",
      "He has also been making drastic and dramatic U-turns that are nothing of the sort.",
      "",
      "Mediawatch has written at length about the phrase ‘speaks volumes’ and how it has somehow been given a power beyond its actual meaning (‘If something speaks volumes, it makes an opinion, characteristic, or situation very clear without the use of words’).",
      "It has become ubiquitous in modern football reporting and examples from just the last 24 hours include:",
      "‘Declan Rice’s message to Gabriel Magalhaes after Newcastle United clash speaks volumes’ – Chronicle Live. Nothing to do with Newcastle United, it’s not a ‘message’ and it didn’t ‘speak volumes’. Other than that, all good.",
      "‘Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka decision speaks volumes as Mikel Arteta makes feelings clear’ – football.london. The story: footballer in line to get new contract commensurate with his standing in the Premier League. Does that ‘speak volumes’? At least it fulfills the ‘without the use of words’ criteria. A reluctant tick.",
      "‘Jarrod Bowen message about West Ham ‘buzz’ speaks volumes about Graham Potter’s demise’ – football.london. Nope.",
      "What Ruben Amorim did after Brentford speaks volumes about his current Manchester United mindset",
      "Did he sob? We would hardly blame him. He is apparently ‘lonely’. Did he throw something against a wall? Did he Google the next plane back to Lisbon?",
      "Under-pressure Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim held a team bonding day for players and their families – despite his increasingly precarious position.",
      "Did Ruben Amorim ‘hold a team bonding day for players and their families’? Or did Manchester United arrange – many weeks ago – a family day at Carrington to which players’ and staff families were invited, with lunch and activities provided for around 100 guests? We’re edging towards the latter.",
      "And McDonnell absolute agrees.",
      "The open day for players and their families, attended by Amorim and his family and held at United’s Carrington training ground on Sunday, is understood to have been arranged before the start of the season to allow the squad’s wives, partners and children to see first-hand the £50million upgrade to the facilities at the complex.",
      "So absolutely not ‘held’ by Amorim but instead ‘attended’ by him because – and we are making assumptions here – Amorim is not personally responsible for the £50million upgrade to the facilities at the complex. Though that might explain why he is still in a job.",
      "The fact the open day still went ahead, despite the crushing loss at Brentford, shows that, for Amorim at least, it remains business as usual, despite the pressure mounting on the United boss, who has won just nine of his 33 league games in charge, losing 17 of them.",
      "We cannot stress this enough: This was clearly not Amorim’s decision to make. It was not his party. The fact that it went ahead did not ‘speak volumes about his current Manchester United mindset’. What it does is show that when large companies arrange social events months in advance, they generally go ahead.",
      "",
      "Elsewhere, there’s some absolute nonsense being written about Tyrell Malacia being reintegrated into the Manchester United first-team squad.",
      "We are told by the Mirror that it’s a ‘dramatic U-turn’ and by the Express that it’s a ‘drastic U-turn’.",
      "Sometimes, just sometimes, there are no U-turns and nothing speaks volumes.",
      "",
      "‘NEW MANAGER Nuno Espirito Santo has already impressed West Ham fans by finally deploying a highly-rated young star who is the son of a club assistant,’ says The Sun.",
      "‘Many fans expected the youngster to have a significant role with the first team this season, but he struggled to find minutes under Graham Potter.",
      "‘Hammers supporters didn’t hold back in their praise for the midfielder, nor with their condemnation for Potter’s decision not to use him.’",
      "Pesky fact: Freddie Potts played 45 minutes for West Ham against Chelsea under Graham Potter; he played 31 minutes against Everton under Nuno Espirito Santo. Finally.",
      "Are Man United actually going to be any better this season than last season? They really might not be much better. In which case, Amorim’s in trouble.",
      "Man Utd co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe is weighing up the possibility of hiring Arsenal legend Cesc Fabregas if Ruben Amorim leaves, according to reports.",
      "Only one Liverpool player has appeared in all ten of their games so far this season, but he has been ‘abject’, ‘offers nothing’ and ‘needs to be dropped’.",
      "Liverpool lost a football match last night, so naturally it is now a crisis with silences being broken and cracks deepening as far as the eye can see.",
      "One Liverpool fan wants to set the record straight: their £400m spend was not solely on ‘upgrades’ and Arne Slot is managing ‘a squad in transition’.",

      "Palace and Man Utd are clear of their nearest rivals at the bottom, with 18th-placed Wolves at -1.57, Nottingham Forest at -1.47, Brighton at -1.43 and Newcastle United at -1.18.",

      "And Glasner is aware of this problem, with the head coach admitting ahead of the match against Liverpool that his side has not taken advantage of their chances in various matches this season.",
      "“I’m always positive,” Glasner said before the 2-1 win vs Liverpool.",
      "“I always think that we can score two goals – but against Sunderland we didn’t do it. Against Millwall we didn’t do it. We had the chances.",

      "Another defeat for Manchester United prompted the inevitable handwringing and hilarity over the position a once-great club continues to find itself.",
      "The next obvious move for United would be to change their manager. Again. Given the lack of tangible improvement since he was appointed almost a year ago and the lack of optimism over a swift and dramatic reversal of their current fortunes, Ruben Amorim could have few arguments if he was handed his cards.",
      "Actually, he might gladly receive them. On numerous occasions, Amorim has presented as a manager aching to be put out of his misery, despite the outward defiance while steadfastly, stubbornly refusing to even consider that there may be good reasons why few clubs employ his formation of choice.",
      "Certainly, only United use it while so woefully ill-equipped. Amorim knows, but persists regardless, and so too do his bosses, if the noises coming out of Old Trafford are to be believed.",
      "Apparently, United are not thinking of dispensing with Amorim because Sir Jim Ratcliffe feels it is only fair to judge him after a full season with, as the BBC’s Simon Stone reports, the ‘right team’.",
      "Amorim may get a full season. But not one with the right team.",
      "How can it be when the individuals don’t fit the system? That was a very fair and reasonable excuse for the sh*t that was served through the second half of last season. But even after a full summer transfer window, United have failed to furnish Amorim with the players necessary to make his system work.",
      "We can all spend hours picking apart the components of Amorim’s United team – it’s how many get their kicks – but the flaws that really stand out: the absence of a No.1 goalkeeper, wing-backs of the necessary standard, a midfielder to hold it all together, and the redeployment of their best player in a wholly unsuitable role.",
      "Even if we look beyond the fact that Amorim is putting his devout faith in his system above the immediate needs of the team he is paid handsomely to improve, there are plenty of reasons to target the manager. But Amorim is taking all the bullets, providing cover for those who set him up to fail.",
      "Perhaps the root of many of United’s problems can be found in the layers between the manager and minority owner who remain the faces of the club’s failures. At what point do we look at Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada and Christopher Vivell? And how would anyone ask: what the f*** are you doing, lads?",
      "Wilcox is United’s director of football. No one has really thought to question the power the solid-if-unspectacular ex-winger wields at one of the world’s biggest clubs. Except Dave Tickner, of course. Perhaps we ought to have scrutinised his ascent more rather than simply waving it through, just because it was said for so long that United needed a sporting director, it almost passed the point that it mattered who.",
      "MORE: Jason Wilcox is one of English football’s most powerful figures, in accordance with the prophecy",
      "Wilcox was initially technical director, working alongside Dan Ashworth before it was quickly realised that his face didn’t fit. So Wilcox stepped up – or across; given the lack of definition around these types of roles, it’s often hard to know for sure – to take overall responsibility for football operations at Old Trafford and Carrington.",
      "Wilcox was said to harbour concerns over Amorim’s suitability for the United job when the Red Devils first considered the Portuguese as a replacement for Erik ten Hag in the summer of 2024 prior to a U-turn on their decision to ditch the Dutchman. Before U-turning again less than three months into the season. Wilcox’s concerns: the level of recruitment required to make United 3-4-3 ready in a timely fashion; and the fact it is not a system that has regularly provided a foundation for success in the Premier League.",
      "When perhaps he ought to have trusted his instincts, Wilcox was swayed by Amorim, since it was him who led the process which identified the then-Sporting coach as the best man for the job.",
      "It is unclear how Amorim’s arrival impacted Wilcox’s quest to develop a ‘game model’, a clear and cohesive playing style that should permeate through the ranks at Carrington, but it seems that project has been shelved while United pin everything on a system their director of football never fancied anyway.",
      "If Wilcox did have doubts, then it explains why United were reluctant to fully equip Amorim with the players he needed in the summer. Perhaps Christopher Vivell could explain what happened there.",
      "He after all is United’s director of recruitment, a role he has held since summer 2024. No doubt United fans would relish the opportunity to ask the German why the club signed three forwards – two were needed, no question – but no midfielder in the summer; and why they opted against recruiting an experienced, proven goalkeeper. But the chances many supporters could pick Vivell out of a line-up are as slim as their title hopes.",
      "Few of these execs possess the kind of profile where they might be identified in the street. And there are reasons for that. The modern-day football club structure is still relatively new, evidenced by the fact that whenever a sporting director job comes up, it is always the same few names that are mentioned. With so few proven track records in the candidate pool, you can see the temptation in appointing your brother, son, agent, mate.",
      "New enough too that there is no provable link between visibility and competence. Especially when fighting with coaches, players and occasionally owners for the spotlight on a crowded stage only opens you up to greater scrutiny.",
      "Which highlights the contradiction with these roles: Wilcox, Vivell, Berrada and their peers at other clubs, all appear to wield more power than the managers and coaches – considerably so, in some cases – yet are too often unaccountable to anyone outside their boardroom.",
      "These are football’s cushiest gigs. Just as turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, why would any sporting director or recruitment guru volunteer to go on the record, even just to own their decisions if not to explain them?",
      "Managers must go before the media three times a game. In the Premier League, there is no obligation for those above them to put themselves out even once a season and, given the power they wield, that should change.",
      "Until it does, we are likely to hear scandalously little from Wilcox, Vivell and Berrada while they cower in the shadow of their shield, for now taking the form of a handsome-but-beleaguered Portuguese football coach.",
      "Only one Liverpool player has appeared in all ten of their games so far this season, but he has been ‘abject’, ‘offers nothing’ and ‘needs to be dropped’.",
      "Liverpool lost a football match last night, so naturally it is now a crisis with silences being broken and cracks deepening as far as the eye can see.",

      "Tuesday 30 September 2025 17:00, UK",
      "PGMOL chief Howard Webb says it was \"good use of VAR\" to overturn Arsenal's 'penalty' at Newcastle and explains Nick Pope's challenge on Viktor Gyokeres was \"quite different\" to the foul committed by Chelsea's Robert Sanchez that saw him sent off a week prior.",
      "Magpies goalkeeper Pope eventually avoided conceding a penalty after he came out to challenge Gunners forward Gyokeres in the first half of Arsenal's 2-1 win at St James' Park. Running towards the ball in the Newcastle area, Pope rushed out to challenge Gyokeres, appearing to bring him down in the process.",
      "Referee Jarred Gillett initially gave a penalty for the challenge; however, VAR Darren England recommended an on-field review. After around three minutes, Gillett then announced the decision had been overturned.",
      "Bukayo Saka and Mikel Arteta were critical of the decision after the game. The pair questioned how it was deemed 'clear and obvious' to overturn the decision.",
      "REF: On-field decision is a penalty. Nick Pope, a trip by Nick Pope.",
      "VAR: OK, checking the on-field decision of penalty.",
      "VAR: Got a better angle?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, I've got a better angle from behind here.",
      "VAR: Does he get a touch on the ball, the goalkeeper? I think he gets a touch on the ball. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball here.",
      "Assistant VAR: Yes, he does, yeah.",
      "VAR: Does he? One more time. He actually gets a touch on the ball, doesn't he?",
      "AVAR: Yeah, there's a secondary touch.",
      "VAR: Give me another angle, please. Just make sure that Pope touches the ball, please.",
      "Replay Operator: I've got an SSM (Super Slow Motion), but it's from the other side.",
      "VAR:  He does touch the ball, doesn't he? Touches the ball first, then there's contact afterwards. Therefore, that's not a penalty kick. He touches the ball there.",
      "Replay Operator: This is the best angle.",
      "AVAR: Have you got the behind view?",
      "Replay Operator: Yeah, this is the best angle I've got.",
      "VAR: He does, doesn't he? He touches. OK, let's just check the APP (Attacking Possession Phase) as it goes over as well.",
      "AVAR: It's definitely played by a defender. But check it anyway.",
      "VAR: Jarred, I'm going to recommend an on-field review for possible no penalty. Let me know when you've got the monitor. I am going to check APP as well. Nick Pope gets a touch on the ball.",
      "Replay Operator: I'll go slowly so you can check the APP.",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah. It's his defender, a clear defender, isn't it? It's always clear defender, that's fine. The APP has been checked, the APP is clear as well. I'm going to show you the tight angle first with the ball being touched by Nick Pope. Any contact that happens thereafter, after the contact has been made.",
      "VAR: Nick Pope gets a touch with his right foot, I'll give you another angle on the touch.",
      "REF: Show me a better angle to see that he touches the ball.",
      "VAR: I will do, I'll show you a better angle.",
      "Replay Operator: Do you want the SSM from the other side?",
      "VAR: Yeah, yeah, yeah, super slow. Super slow, coming in now. Gets a touch on the ball there. And then just plants his foot in a normal action.",
      "REF: The attacker plays the ball first. I don't know if the goalkeeper actually plays the ball.",
      "VAR: The attacker plays the ball. Yeah, the attacker plays the ball, and the goalkeeper plays the ball then with his right foot, there.",
      "REF: Just play it at full speed, please.",
      "VAR: Any contact there, any contact after that is normal contact, because the goalkeeper just plays his foot.",
      "REF: Can you play it at full speed?",
      "VAR: Playing at normal speed for you.",
      "REF: So I'm seeing the goalkeeper get a toe to the ball first, prior to making contact.",
      "VAR: Agree.",
      "REF: So after a view, the goalkeeper plays the ball, there's no foul. Final decision, we drop ball.",
      "VAR: Confirmed.",
      "\"At full speed, it looks a penalty, doesn't it? And you can absolutely understand why the referee gave it from what he saw on the field.",
      "\"He gave it for a tripping action by Nick Pope. The VAR checks the penalty. Obviously, it's a reviewable situation, penalties, goals, etc.",
      "\"So he checks the penalty, makes sure that the decision is not clearly wrong. When he does that, he clearly sees that Gyokeres gets to the ball, pokes it a little bit forward, but then, importantly, Nick Pope also gets a very clear touch on the ball as he steps forward with that right foot and deviates the direction that the ball is going.",
      "\"And that hadn't been appreciated on the field by the referee. Pope then plants his foot on the ground. He doesn't drive it forward into Gyokeres.",
      "\"There's a gap, clearly a gap, between the two players after Pope has played the ball, and then the two players come together quite normally. The action by Pope is normal. It's not reckless. It's just a kick out towards the ball. The ball deviates.",
      "\"No contact on the player until the ball has been played away, and then the contact happens fairly normally. So, not a foul, and therefore a good use of the VAR to intervene to show the referee what really happened.",
      "\"The deviation's quite clear. You'll see that touch by Gyokeres, and you'll see Pope's right leg come in. It touches the ball, it moves the ball away in a different direction to the direction it was previously going in.",
      "\"When he then puts his foot on the ground, having made contact with the ball, there's a separation between him and Gyokeres. There's no contact at that point. The contact only happens after Pope has played the ball.",
      "\"So, it's a good challenge by Pope. It's not a foul, and there was an important part around this in that the referee didn't recognise that touch by Pope in real time.",
      "\"Hence the reason that when the VAR saw it, he deemed it to be a clear and obvious error because that touch by Pope hadn't been seen, and therefore the referee could go to the screen to look at that really important aspect and make a judgement for himself, and the judgement was: I've seen the touch, therefore it's not a foul, and I'm going to start with the drop ball.",
      "\"The referee hadn't recognised that touch, that was important, the VAR saw it and deemed it was a clear error. I agree with the VAR's intervention, so the referee can go to the screen, look at the full sequence, see that touch, see that there was a normal playing action by Pope and the penalty was rightly cancelled.\"",
      "A similar scenario happened during Manchester United's 2-1 win over Chelsea. Early on in the game, an onrushing Sanchez hacked down Bryan Mbeumo just outside the area and was subsequently sent off for denying a clear goalscoring opportunity.",
      "Webb's verdict:",
      "\"I know people have compared the two situations. I think they're really quite different, and we'll talk about why.",
      "\"I think the only similarity is that there is a touch on the ball from the goalkeeper in both situations, but the way that touch happens is quite different.",
      "\"Now, in this situation, Sanchez was sent off for denying Mbeumo an obvious goalscoring opportunity. He committed a foul, which prevented Mbeumo from continuing through to try to score.",
      "\"When you see the way that Sanchez comes out to try to play that ball, whereas we saw Pope play the ball low, his foot went straight to ground, and then there was a normal coming together.",
      "\"In this situation, he leads with a raised leg and stud showing, which goes into the leg of Mbeumo. It's at least a reckless action. Some people have talked about it, maybe even being more serious foul play, endangering the safety of the opponent.",
      "\"I think it's reckless, at least. It has to be penalised. There is that small touch on the ball, but that doesn't negate the fact you have to penalise this sort of action.",
      "\"And that touch, by the way, is quite different to the Pope one in that the ball doesn't really deviate, it just continues.",
      "\"It touches the top of the boot of Sanchez, and then continues in the same line with Mbeumo about to run onto it. In Pope's situation, we saw quite a deviation of that ball.",
      "\"So, for all of those reasons, this is absolutely something we have to penalise, primarily, though, because of the nature of the way that Sanchez went in, stood exposed on to the leg of Mbeumo.",
      "\"It has to be a foul. And then, of course, we know that the conditions are there for an obvious goalscoring opportunity.",
      "\"Mbeumo running on to that ball, the defenders are not there to cover. It's obviously a goalscoring opportunity. And therefore, the red card comes out for that reason.\"",

      "“This has to end as quickly as possible,” says Jamie Carragher of Ruben Amorim’s time at Manchester United, labelling it a disaster for both parties. United were beaten 3-1 by Brentford on Saturday as their struggles continue under the Portuguese coach",
      "Monday 29 September 2025 21:16, UK",
      "Jamie Carragher has described Ruben Amorim's time at Manchester United as a disaster for both the club and the manager, urging everyone to shake hands and move on, claiming that another coach could take this group of players into Europe.",
      "Carragher on Amorim...",
      "\"I think he is still in a job because I think the powers that be at Manchester United have made that many mistakes so far with the decisions they have made on and off the pitch that they do not want to admit right now that they have made another.",
      "\"This has been a disaster for Manchester United but also for Ruben Amorim. What he did at Sporting Lisbon was fantastic. He looked like the next big thing as a manager. But bringing a manager like that in with the system he plays I don't think ever suited a club like Manchester United with the traditions at Manchester United.",
      "\"The quicker they make the decision on the manager the better for everybody because like I said it has been a disaster for the club and the manager. We are just waiting for the inevitable, unfortunately, because you don't want people to lose their jobs. But this has to end as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I have never been a big one for saying he has to change his system. A lot of managers speak and say the system might change but my style does not. His baby is his system. It is like asking Jurgen Klopp not to press or Pep Guardiola not to play short passes through the middle of the pitch. This is what he is.",
      "\"This is on Omar Berrada or Jason Wilcox or Jim Ratcliffe. They brought him in. They knew that when they brought him in.",
      "\"The problem for Ruben Amorim is that every other Premier League manager would look at it and say, 'I could do a better job than that.'\"",
      "United brought in £200m worth of attacking talent in the summer in the form of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko, but Carragher believes that the United squad could still be fashioned into a team - under a manager with a different system.",

      "He continued: \"The players they have brought in could easily be flipped into a back four with Bruno Fernandes as a No 10, Mbeumo on the right wing, Cunha on the left, Sesko up front and I think a competent Manchester United manager could get that team into the European places or certainly be fighting for them.",

      "Another defeat for Manchester United, more inevitable and raucous debate about whether Ruben Amorim is the right man for the job.",
      "The noise from outside the club is growing, but within the Old Trafford halls of power, the United bosses remain steadfastly patient with the Portuguese head coach. Albeit with mounting frustration on all sides at the team's inconsistency.",
      "Amorim himself has repeated his assertion that he is not concerned about the possibility of being sacked, but he knows results have to improve significantly - and quickly - if he is to stay in the job.",
      "Despite reports to the contrary, sources are adamant the bosses are not lining up a list of replacements. The club, under its new INEOS stewardship, is determined to take a long-term view in all the decisions it takes - about player recruitment, facilities and the coaching staff - and so will not make any knee-jerk reaction to individual defeats.",
      "The trouble for Amorim is that results have been persistently poor since he took over, and the optimism-inducing win over Chelsea has been followed up with a chastening 3-1 defeat against Brentford. United have taken 34 points from his 33 games in charge, and have yet to muster back-to-back wins in his 11 months at the helm.",
      "United are not actively looking for their next manager. Nevertheless, every football club has contingency plans in place should they lose the head coach, in whatever circumstances, and it would be naive to think United will not have specific targets in mind if, for example, Amorim chose to resign.",
      "He said in August following the Carabao Cup humiliation at the hands of Grimsby Town that \"sometimes I want to quit\". But he also said at the time \"sometimes I want to stay for 20 years\".",
      "At Old Trafford and Carrington, there are no murmurings for managerial change. But ultimately, it comes down to the decision of one man: Sir Jim. And his current levels of patience will not sustain indefinitely.",
      "Meanwhile, the club legends are lining up to voice their dismay - Wayne Rooney says he has \"no faith\" that Amorim can turn things around. Gary Neville says for the first time, he is worried the players are \"really doubting the system\".",
      "Crystal Palace are proving that Amorim's chosen formation can be successful. Oliver Glasner has used a consistent 3-4-2-1 shape, and has delivered the FA Cup and Community Shield already, with this team having just beaten the champions.",
      "Palace's achievements are an example of how it could work for United, but also a reminder of how poorly the team is doing by comparison. Palace are flying high in third spot in the Premier League. United are 14th.",
      "It is still very early in the season, we are only six league matches in. But Amorim desperately needs his system to start paying dividends. And there is growing doubt about some of his decision-making.",
      "Against Brentford when United were chasing the game, the head coach changed his back five, in either personnel or position, six times. Mason Mount only came on in the 81st minute, but he played two different positions in what was left of the match - No 10 and left wing-back - a move that Neville called \"unforgivable\".",
      "No timescale has been set for Amorim to get it right. There is no deadline in terms of games, or set target in terms of wins. And yet there is a growing sense that United's next game - Sunderland at Old Trafford on Saturday - has the feeling of being a must-win for the home side.",
      "With the international break straight afterwards and a two-week gap in club football, if that one were to end badly, then the clamour for Amorim's removal would only grow, and Ratcliffe's determination to stick with his man would be severely tested.",
      "\"The sad thing about it for Man Utd and the supporters right now is it's not really a shock result - you look at Man Utd going to Brentford and I don't think many people would predict Man Utd would go and win. Brentford were fourth from bottom. And that's the sad state of affairs they find themselves in.\"",
      "Amorim's commitment to his 3-4-2-1 system has been a big talking point throughout his tenure.",
      "Carragher doesn't blame the Portuguese for sticking to that formation but asked why Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the United board chose Amorim to take on the job from Erik ten Hag when he didn't play a system typical of United's traditions.",
      "\"We keep talking about the system,\" said Carragher. \"It doesn't suit the players that are there, I totally understand that, but the powers that be that employed the manager knew what system he played and that's what gave him success.",
      "\"If you've had success as a manager, that's what you'll fall back on when things aren't going well. I can understand why he sticks with the system because that's his baby, that's his thing, that's what he does.",
      "\"The people in charge picked a manager who doesn't signify the traditions of that club going back 50, 60, 70 years. It's a big pitch [at Old Trafford], fast wingers... and the system he plays just doesn't employ them at all.",
      "\"It always felt a strange fit in terms of the system from the very start.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim is incredibly honest but also accurate when he reflects on and analyses his Manchester United side before and after games.",
      "So with the lack of European and Carabao Cup football, it is truly puzzling why United aren't able to address those flaws and show consistency with a full week to prepare on the training ground.",
      "Even more so, after they showed such grit and determination to beat Chelsea the weekend before only for it to evaporate at Brentford.",
      "The struggle for momentum pre-dates Amorim. United have not won back-to-back Premier League games in the same season since May 2024.",
      "The mental block in the squad is a problem he has inherited and one he continues to try to address.",
      "He has spoken about how he hoped the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo would alleviate that burden. But, despite some positive moments, it seems those old scars remain.",
      "Amorim has not yet shown the body of work at United that shows the required consistency is on the way. He would be the first to acknowledge that.",
      "Since his appointment, Amorim has picked up only 34 points in 33 Premier League games, a truly staggering statistic that nobody can hide from.",
      "One wonders how long the United leadership will allow this form to continue when you consider Amorim's predecessor, Erik ten Hag, was only given nine games last season before he was sacked.",

      "Gary Neville has delivered a scathing assessment of the current state of Ruben Amorim's Manchester United, declaring it \"ridiculous\" that Mason Mount has been playing wing-back.",
      "Neville has admitted he is worried about United as he raised serious doubts about the club's direction under Amorim.",
      "United suffered a third defeat in six Premier League games this season when they were beaten 3-1 at Brentford on Saturday, with Amorim's side failing to build on the previous week's win over Chelsea. United have still not back-to-back Premier League games under the head coach.",
      "\"I'm very worried,\" he said on The Gary Neville Podcast.",
      "\"The performance that we saw and the result at Brentford means that you feel the Chelsea game was skewed by the sending off. You start to look at the Chelsea win less positively. That's just football.",
      "\"I think there are a lot of United fans coming out of that ground last Saturday, including me, thinking Brentford away, Sunderland at home next week has a real opportunity to get nine points on the board, on the bounce, and then you'll be well up in the top six or eight.",
      "\"But the Brentford game was a really poor performance and a real worry.",
      "\"I felt for the first time, just through instinct, watching it on the television, seeing players' faces and body language, that there might be an element of players really doubting the system and what's going on.",
      "\"There was something that happened in that game that I mentioned on my podcast two or three weeks ago that I said we couldn't see again. I said that Mason Mount ended up at left wing-back.",
      "\"There's sticking to your plan and then there's your coach that's got an idea and making sure that he delivers that idea and not flip flopping with his idea with players, which can sometimes undermine what you're trying to achieve.",
      "\"But then when you're putting Mason Mount at left wing-back - and he's ended up at left wing-back again at Brentford in the last five minutes to the game - it starts to look awful.\"",
      "He added: \"You can't put Mason Mount at left wing-back. I'm sorry, it just can't happen. I can't watch Mason Mount play left wing-back in a football team.",
      "\"I struggled at times to watch him in his natural position, but actually putting him out there on the left wing, is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.\"",
      "United boss Amorim has won nine of his 33 games in the Premier League and is yet to record consecutive victories in the competition 10 months into the job.",
      "\"Amorim has had a pre-season,\" Neville said. \"He's had a week now in between each of his games because Manchester United aren't in Europe. Yet the performances are as poor as ever.",
      "\"The results are catastrophic, really, in Manchester United terms. The money that's been spent has been big and there are some things that I'm seeing that are a massive worry, and some things that can't happen.",
      "\"So I am very concerned, I really am, because the manager's obviously a good coach. He's had a great record in Portugal but it's not clicking at all.",
      "\"You've got to see what happens next Saturday against Sunderland - if that game goes against Manchester United, you're going to start seeing very big questions being asked of the ownership, big questions.",
      "\"They brought a young manager in. He's played a completely different system. They've invested in a completely different system. If they were to be 14th, 15th or 16th in October, it's not a one-off. It becomes what you are.",
      "\"It becomes a pattern and the manager comes under huge pressure. We've seen what's happened with Graham Potter in the last few days. That's why I'm worried because this is not going to go away and it's going to build in this next week or so.",

      "Monday 29 September 2025 10:23, UK",
      "Brentford's Nathan Collins was lucky not to see red against Manchester United, said Dermot Gallagher on Ref Watch, as Jay Bothroyd described the decision not to send him off as \"baffling\".",
      "Read on for Gallagher and Bothroyd's thoughts on the weekend's action...",
      "INCIDENT: The decision was made not to send off Collins after he conceded a penalty. VAR checked the yellow card shown to Collins after a penalty was given, but they agreed with the referee's decision with Bryan Mbuemo deemed to be not in control of the ball.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Nathan got really, really lucky. The VAR would have looked at it and decided Mbeumo wasn't in control of the ball.",
      "\"Nathan panics. He pulls his shirt and if he doesn't do that, Mbeumo, who got a touch to the ball, would have got it. He's got a clear goalscoring opportunity eight yards out.",
      "\"They looked at it, looked at it and looked at it. I have a theory that your gut takes over. You look at a replay and you make up your mind. The more you look at it, the more you doubt yourself.\"",
      "Jay Bothroyd on Ref Watch: \"It baffles me. Mbeumo is not in control of the ball because he's not going to control it.",
      "\"He's going to hit that first time. The pace is on the cross and all he is going to do is redirect the ball towards the corner.",
      "\"He's not going to control that in a million years.\"",
      "INCIDENT: VAR Darren England intervenes after referee Jarred Gillett awarded a penalty to Arsenal after Nick Pope appeared to foul Viktor Gyokeres. The referee changed his mind after looking at the screen and overturned the decision.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"It shows how difficult it was with Gary Neville going from being adamant it was a penalty to being torn when he sees it again.",
      "\"Pope does get a touch on the ball. My immediate instinct was penalty... but Pope does plant his foot so he doesn't follow through with the tackle so that's why it was overturned.",
      "\"This year, they've tried to stick with the on-field decision as much as possible, but once the VAR looks at it, he's decided that Pope has played the ball - that's the key factor.",
      "\"He's sent the referee to the screen but he can still hold his ground. He can still say it's a penalty. Referees take everything into consideration - where the ball is going, the direction of play, would the player have got it?\"",
      "On the similarities with the Robert Sanchez incident from the previous weekend: \"It was different. He touches the ball and follows through with the tackle... with the Pope one, he touches the ball but he plants his foot and does no more.",
      "\"Pope does not go into Gyokeres. He's stopping.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Newcastle's appeals for a penalty for handball against Gabriel were turned down by Gillett. VAR checked the incident but stuck with the on-field decision.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"This is a really interesting decision.",
      "\"The rule is that if the ball strikes your body and flies up onto your arm, it's not going to be given because it is not possible to get out of the way.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Gabriel also escaped punishment after a clash with Newcastle striker Nick Woltemade.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"Gabriel is lucky he doesn't actually strike Woltemade properly.",
      "\"Where he is lucky is the referee hasn't seen it. It's gone to VAR and they don't think it's a red card. I don't think it's a red card.",
      "\"The referee has seen something has happened and what he does well is he calms them down and takes the sting out of the incident.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Trevoh Chalobah was sent off after a VAR review for the denying of a goalscoring opportunity with a foul on Diego Gomez.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I wonder whether Simon Hooper initially thought he caught him with his shoulder, but he's definitely tripped him.",
      "\"Gomez got across the defender and he's in the ascendancy. Once he's got there, the defender clips him and it's a red card.\"",
      "INCIDENT: VAR said no penalty as Malo Gusto's boot looks to have made contact with Yankuba Minteh's head.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I think penalty. Once you raise a foot that high, you run a massive risk. He catches him.",
      "\"VAR looked and said there's no conclusive evidence that he's caught him.\"",
      "INCIDENT: There was a long check on Liverpool's equaliser. Federico Chiesa was the scorer, but VAR looked at whether Mo Salah had handballed it in the process and eventually ruled the goal out.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"I honestly don't know about this one. I usually have a gut reaction when I look at a replay and then I make up my mind.",
      "\"I've looked at this again this morning, I looked yesterday and on Saturday, and I still can't tell if he's handled the ball.",
      "\"In that case, unless you are convinced he's handled the ball, play on.\"",
      "Bothroyd on Ref Watch: \"I think it's handball. I've seen different angles, I've seen it slowed down, and it looks like it has hit his hand.",
      "\"It even looks like it has put off the defender. He's not able to get a full head on the ball and that's how you can tell it has hit his hand. Liverpool got away with one.\"",
      "INCIDENT: Crystal Palace's first goal came from a corner awarded in error - it should have been a goal kick. Why can't VAR intervene?",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"The referee doesn't see it because he's behind the play and he doesn't see it strike (Tyrick) Mitchell, with the assistant on the other side and that's why it's unlucky.",
      "\"This probably happens once a game that something goes the wrong way but it becomes vocal because it leads to a goal.",
      "\"That's the referee's lot. It's not always the decision you make but the consequences of those decisions.\"",
      "INCIDENT: When Fulham were 1-0 up, Josh King went down in the box after contact from Emi Martinez and was booked for diving for a second consecutive week.",
      "DERMOT SAYS: \"This is another tough decision because I don't know why the player pushes it one way and tries to go round the other.",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has won nine of his 33 games in the Premier League and is yet to record consecutive victories in the competition 10 months into the job. The momentum of victory over Chelsea vanished when his side were beaten at Brentford for a third time in four visits",
      "Sunday 28 September 2025 12:34, UK",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Manchester United.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side went to Brentford in search of their first back-to-back league wins under him, which tells you all you need to know about the progress made in the 33 games since he took charge.",
      "Amorim described the game as the club's \"most important in a long time\" but his players failed to translate that urgency onto the pitch as they suffered a deflating 3-1 defeat.",
      "Victory over 10-man Chelsea last week was unable to inspire the consistency that will ultimately be required to keep Amorim in a job and they have sunk back into the bottom half of the table. So where does Amorim go from here?",
      "It was once again so obvious that United's set-up was a massive issue at Brentford.",
      "Forget criticism of playing three at the back, others have shown it is no impediment to success. It is Amorim's insistence on leaving his two-man midfield pivot exposed that comes back to bite him time and again.",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three-at-the-back system, while keeping a midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Bruno Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were overrun by Brentford, who richly deserved the three points.",
      "Amorim did not seem to want to acknowledge those issues after the game. \"It's always the same, when we win it's not the system, when we lose it's the system,\" he said.",
      "So far, we've yet to see Amorim's United dominate a top team in the Premier League that has a full accompaniment of players. After Casemiro's red card last week, Chelsea made United sweat for the win.",
      "Brentford boss Keith Andrews, who was in charge of set pieces in the club's set-up under Thomas Frank last season, explained after the game how his side overloaded United's midfield.",
      "\"It's the natural way you prepare for games,\" said Andrews, when asked if he targeted United's midfield. \"You try and create overloads,\" he added.",
      "\"One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in, then they have a four'. But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through [them], at times, would be on.\"",
      "Andrews, in his first season as a senior head coach, demonstrated the value in adaptability on Saturday, while Amorim finished the game with Mbeumo and Mason Mount as his wing-backs.",
      "Defeat at Brentford means that is exactly where United will start the month after finishing last season 15th in the table despite a spend of more than £200m over the summer on a new strikeforce, who failed to impress on their first outing together at Brentford.",
      "Benjamin Sesko did manage to score his first United goal, though there was little spark between himself, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "\"There's got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager's idea has got to land very quickly with the players,\" Neville, the former United captain, said at the time.",
      "United's decision-makers are behind Amorim, but another defeat when Sunderland go to Old Trafford next week would ramp up the pressure on the head coach over the international break.",
      "However, Amorim, who has reportedly offered his job up on more than one occasion, says fears about potentially being sacked do not enter his mind.",
      "\"I'm always comfortable with the job,\" Amorim told BBC Sport. \"I've proved that already. I'm not concerned, that is not my decision. I will do the best I can in every minute that I'm here. I'm never concerned for my job, I'm not that kind of guy.\"",
      "Amorim got a message of backing after the Manchester derby defeat. You wonder how many more set-backs he can survive before patience runs thin.",
      "Results are the only thing that can save Amorim and he knows that. His record in the league stands at nine victories in 33 games. That is a win percentage of 27.3 per cent, lower than any other to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson by some distance.",
      "United have made a habit of starting games at a fast pace this season, certainly against Arsenal, Fulham, Burnley and Chelsea. Amorim wants his team to get off to a good start because he knows what happens when they don't.",
      "Each league game this season in which United have conceded the first goal, they have lost.",
      "The pressure cooker of Old Trafford has been too much for most players to sign for the club over the last decade and Amorim is trying to find a way to build confidence in the way his team plays.",
      "He has enjoyed some success with this, at least in United's home games, but at Brentford, there was no sign of the electric start that overcame Chelsea. Without the crowd, the players struggle to cope.",
      "This is reflected by their current eight-game winless run away from home in the league. The last one came in March at Leicester, who were relegated a month later.",
      "Before that, it was at Fulham at the end of January. United were hardly convincing in that game either. Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike just got them over the line.",
      "The mental fragility - and inability to cope without the support of Old Trafford - is a huge hindrance to Amorim's bid to bring consistency back to United.",
      "\"It's like ups and downs,\" said Amorim, when asked about this latest setback.",
      "\"When you win, you feel that everything and that the momentum is here. When you lose, you go back to the same place and fight again for the one win that can help you to create the momentum.",
      "\"I cannot tell you more than I say every time I lose the game. Sometimes you see one team that performs really well and you see improvements, and then sometimes you have some games that you don't see the improvement that gives you the confidence to say that Manchester United is going to get back.",
      "\"It's always the same conversation.\"",

      "Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball.\n\n\nIn all other circumstances (e.g. holding, pulling, pushing, no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.",
      "United only have themselves to blame for the result, their third defeat in a four-game winless run at Brentford, that was sealed when Mathias Jensen struck a superb third goal in stoppage-time. All the momentum of the win over Chelsea had vanished.",
      "Brentford were two goals up after 20 minutes thanks to Igor Thaigo's first-half double and, although Benjamin Sesko scored his first goal for the club to halve the deficit six minutes later, United were never convincing in their fight-back.",

      "Amorim disagreed with the decision not to send off Collins but said his team should have done more to manage the game after Fernandes failed to convert his penalty.",
      "\"They told me Bryan was not in control of the ball. I think he was not in control of the ball because he was pulled,\" Amorim said in his post-match press conference.",
      "He added: \"Sometimes the decisions are not in your favour. We have the capacity to calm down the game. We didn't do that today.\"",
      "Former Premier League official Mike Dean, speaking on Soccer Saturday, was in agreement: \"For me, it is a red card.\"",
      "Brentford changed from a back five to a back four against Amorim's three at the back system, but head coach Keith Andrews kept his midfield three of Jordan Henderson, Yehor Yarmoliuk and Mikkel Damsgaard.",
      "Not for the first time this season, United's midfield pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte were outnumbered and overrun by Brentford.",
      "Asked if he felt it was an area to target, Andrews said: \"It's the natural way you prepare for games. You try and create overloads. One of which would be if we have a three-man midfield, they have a two. But you could flip it and say 'if their wide players tuck in then they have a four.",
      "\"But I certainly felt how we tried to entice them onto us and try and play around, or through, at times, would be on. And I felt, going back to it, the players did that with real courage and conviction.\"",
      "On goalscorer Thiago, Andrews added: \"He's getting real rhythm in his game now and confidence in his game. He's shown exactly why the football club brought him here. He's such a powerful player. Very positive individual and very selfless.\"",
      "Winning two in a row used to mean something different at Old Trafford. They came to Brentford in search of the club's first back-to-back league wins under Amorim, but Thiago scored twice in the first 20 minutes before the United players had woken up.",
      "Harry Maguire was culpable for the opener as Jordan Henderson's long ball over the top caught him napping. Thiago was all alone when he hammered in the opener. The whole stadium thought he was offside, only for replays to show Maguire was slow off the mark.",
      "United, losers in every league game in which they have trailed this season, were unable to cope with Brentford, who terrorised their visitors from set-pieces. Altay Bayindir made two fine saves from Henderson and then Collins but was at fault for Thiago's second.",
      "The Brentford striker just had to fire in from close-range after Kevin Schade's cross was spilled by Bayindir in the six-yard box. Thiago needed just six touches to score his two goals, which takes him to five in seven games this season.",
      "This was the first time Amorim had started United's £207m front three of Mbeumo, Sesko and Matheus Cunha but the first impression was not a positive one. Their lack of desire to help in midfield left the pivot of Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte exposed.",
      "Sesko did manage to break his United duck in his fourth start for the club as Patrick Dorgu's hopeful, looping cross eventually found him. It took three goes to beat Kelleher from close-range, the former Liverpool keeper pulling off a couple of fine saves.",
      "Brentford taking their foot off the gas gave United encouragement, though they lacked punch. When the spot-kick was awarded it felt like the piece of luck that Amorim needed to turn his troubled tenure around, but Fernandes let him down.",
      "There was no response from United as Brentford took further encouragement before adding a deserved third in stoppage-time through substitute Jensen. His swerving shot finished centrally to make Bayindir look foolish. He was not the only one.",

      "Manchester United have not won successive games in the Premier League since May 2024; Ruben Amorim, who was appointed in November 2024, recorded his first back-to-back home wins in the Premier League last week; Amorim admits he does not know what to expect from his side",

      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim admits he does not know what he will get from his squad each week.",
      "Amorim's side travel to Brentford in search of his first back-to-back wins in the Premier League since his appointment in November 2024.",
      "United recorded successive home wins in the league for the first time under Amorim with a win against Chelsea at Old Trafford last weekend, following a late victory over Burnley before the international break.",
      "However, lodged in between the two games was a harrowing defeat away at Manchester City as consistency continues to elude Amorim's side. The last time United won in successive games in the same season was in May 2024.",
      "Asked about a feeling of distrust among fans to win two games in succession, Amorim admitted he has a similar view to supporters.",
      "\"It's normal for the fans, they don't know what is going to happen in the next game,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"To be completely honest, I have an idea, but I don't know how it's going to be and I'm the manager of the team.",
      "\"That has to do with the moment that we live for so many months. The best way of dealing with that is that every game is the last one. It's just not thinking about two games.",
      "\"Yes, it's a big deal for Manchester United. The next game is going to be the most important game for a long time for Manchester United.",
      "\"I understand the feeling of the fans. Let's start changing that feeling and present ourselves with that urgency that we need to do on the pitch.\"",
      "Amorim believes his side have played well this season but results have not been reflective of performances. However, building on positive starts could be the key to building on their momentum.",
      "\"I don't say 'playing well' because I think we did that this year,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"It's really important [that Man Utd win back-to-back games], I think that and we spoke about that in the end of the game. It's really important for us to have that sense of urgency that we need to win no matter what, and it's going to be really difficult.",
      "\"Every time we start preparing the game and you watch the next opponent, you think it is going to be really tough. I have that feeling.",
      "\"But for me, we cannot control the result of the game. The most important thing is to start the game the way we start against Chelsea, the way we start against Burnley, the way we start against Arsenal.",
      "\"In these kinds of games, we need to be willing and to have the feeling that we need to win every match.\"",

      "Barcelona are unlikely to discuss a permanent move for Marcus Rashford until next summer; Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford, who, despite still having three years left on his current deal Man Utd, remains unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford",
      "By Rob Dorsett and Lyall Thomas",
      "Wednesday 24 September 2025 11:42, UK",
      "Barcelona are pleased with the progress of loanee Marcus Rashford but they remain unlikely to discuss a permanent move for the England international until next summer.",
      "Despite still having three years left on his current deal with Manchester United, Rashford currently looks unlikely to have any future at Old Trafford and is focused on making the best impact he can at Barcelona - a club he has long dreamed of playing for.",
      "Barca are delighted with the progress of Rashford and are said to be very enthusiastic about how he is settling into the club and the city. They are also pleased with how he has already endeared himself to the players, staff and fans at the Nou Camp, despite a reprimand for being two minutes late for a recent meeting by head coach Hansi Flick.",
      "On the pitch, he is also delivering. The 27-year-old has two goals and two assists in his last three games.",
      "It remains far too early for Barcelona to discuss the potential of signing him on a permanent basis - but there is no gap in valuation with Manchester United over what that would cost, contrary to reports earlier this week.",
      "That is because the loan agreement contains an option to buy him for an agreed fee of £26.2m (€30m) and - with his further progress on and off the field and the club's long-term financial parameters still to consider - triggering that option is not something Barcelona are expected to discuss until the end of the campaign.",
      "Also to consider for Barcelona is the long-term future of striker Robert Lewandowski, who turned 37 last month and sees his current deal expire at the end of the season.",
      "Rashford's ability to play as a No 9 may come into the Barca bosses' thinking when they consider whether to extend Lewandowski's deal or look to sign a new permanent centre-forward instead.",
      "Another key issue is Rashford's wages, which Barca are currently covering entirely - making him one of the highest paid players in Spain.",
      "Barca have had to pull financial levers elsewhere in the club in order to register new signings in recent seasons, so paying the permanent option fee and continuing to pay his salary demands is something that will have to come into their long-term financial planning and be subject to LaLiga's spending cap.",
      "Rashford said last week that he wants to play for Barca for \"as many [seasons] as possible\" and \"we will see\" when it comes to a permanent move. \"I have to focus on trying to do my job and trying to help the team in whichever way I can,\" he added.",
      "It will depend on how Rashford performs for the full course of the season, although he has already made a big impact with his two goals against Newcastle in the Champions League and an assist in the thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He is also yet to feel the full support of the Nou Camp because of delays to ongoing refurbishment work at the stadium.",
      "Flick's reprimand for him being late, which was being dropped to the bench, is standard fare under the German's rules and considered water-under-the-bridge at the club. The likes of Raphinha have also had the same treatment for slack punctuality.",
