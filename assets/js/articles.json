      "The Europa League final is upon us, and it's Tottenham Hotspur versus Manchester United. This Wednesday these two giants of English football will lock horns in a battle that could shape their destinies.",
      "Both clubs have had a season to forget in the league, with performances that would typically have them mired in a fight to avoid relegation. But the Europa League has been their lifeline, their ticket out of mediocrity. However, come Wednesday night, only one will be able to claim their season redeemed.",
      "Lifting a European trophy is an achievement that few can boast of. It's a testament to skill, determination and teamwork.

      "It's all or nothing for Manchester United's season as they bid for a shot at glory ahead of the Europa League final. Ruben Amorim's side will take on Premier League rivals Tottenham hoping to end their disastrous season with silverware after jetting out to Bilbao for Wednesday's showpiece.",
      "Their opponents Spurs aren't in much better form after sinking to 17th after one win in seven, with five defeats in six and it should be a competitive final.",
      "The result could have huge consequences for United's summer of spending knowing that victory will put them in next season's Champions League - allowing them to target a higher calibre of player - while defeat will leave them without Europe entirely.",
      "The first deal United look to have got over the line is Wolves star Matheus Cunha, who wants to join Old Trafford regardless of whether they're playing in the Champions League next season.",
      "Cunha has a £63million release clause in his contract at Molineux and its understood United are close to agreeing a deal to sign the forward.",
      "The Brazilian has scored 15 times in the Premier League and is now attracting interest from some big times - including Liverpool and Arsenal.",
      "But with United now closing in on a move for the player, Neville has talked up his ability up front and said the club were \"desperate\" for someone of his calibre.",
      "\"They need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's [Cunha] a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.\"",
      "Another forward United are being linked with is Jonathan David - and that would be a slightly more straight forward move as he's available on a free transfer.",
      "David is set to leave Lille for nothing this summer after yet another superb season in front of goal. He's netted 25 times in all competitions and has confirmed he will depart at the end of the season.",
      "United will hope to among the frontrunners to sign him as they look to further upgrade their forward line in the wake of Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee's timid displays.",
      "But his Canada national team boss Jesse Marsch has urged the player to pick a club where he will play often and compete for trophies.",
      "\"Knowing Johnny, he is going to want to play,\" Marsch said. \"He’s going to want to go to the best club he can be at. And I think achieve the most in terms of what it would mean to compete for trophies in Europe. But he’s going to want to play as well.",
      "\"And I think that’s important. I think the most important thing for him is, it’s not good if he goes somewhere and then he has to play on the bench a lot and not get minutes to keep himself sharp and fit and ready to go, especially with the World Cup being a year away.",
      "“I don’t even think Johnny really knows quite yet what that is, but I’m sure he’ll make a good decision. We’re hopeful that he can be with us this summer. But more importantly, we want him to be in a good situation, so that the next year that he has under his belt really leads him into the 2026 World Cup in a good way.”",
      "Making up a trio of attacking targets, you could argue that Amorim's dream signing would be his former Sporting Lisbon star Viktor Gyokeres, but this would probably be the most challenging deal to get over the line.",
      "The Sweden international is one of Europe's most sought-after forwards after his ridiculous goalscoring efforts this season, netting 53 goals in 51 games in all competitions and he looks likely to win the European Golden Shoe this season.",
      "Amorim is a big reason for Gyokeres' top performances over the last two seasons with Lisbon and he would certainly take United to the next level if he did join.",
      "But it's understood the player would be desperate to play in the Champions League next season, so his move to Old Trafford would hinge on whether the team can win the Europa League on Wednesday night.",
      "If they are defeated by Tottenham, then Arsenal would likely take the lead in the race for Gyokeres - having earmarked him as their main transfer target this summer."

      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand fears the team could struggle physically against Tottenham in the Europa League final, admitting that Ruben Amorim's men \"can't keep up with any team in the Premier League\". The Red Devils have flown out to Bilbao hoping to finish their awful season with silverware, with Spurs standing in their way.",
      "United will be favourites against Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham due to their far superior record in finals and winning trophies, but both teams have struggled in the Premier League this season, with the teams sitting 16th and 17th in the table respectively.",
      "Spurs might have an upper hand going into the game after beating United three times in the league and cup this season, though everything will go up in the air during a massive European final.",
      "And Ferdinand worries that his old team lack the pace and physicality of their Premier League rivals, arguing that they have performed well in Europe this season because they are yet to come up against an English team.",
      "\"The worrying thing for me from a Man United perspective is that physically we can’t keep up with any team in the Premier League,' he said, speaking to talkSPORT.",
      "\"If they go man-to-man and go toe-to-toe with us we’re at a disadvantage because our profile of our players at Man United are not players that can run as hard and as fast, and as long, and they’re not as powerful as other teams. That’s a big thing in the Premier League. In the Europa, we’re overpowering every team.",
      "\"There’s only one team I’ve watched us play against in the Europa League that we struggled against and thought 'Ooh, that was a bit too close for comfort'. Rangers, who are more akin to a Premier League side, physically. So that’s the concern for me in the final playing against a Premier League team, who have beaten us three times, that physically can, minimum, match us.\"",
      "Ferdinand has a rich history of winning trophies for Manchester United, having lifted six Premier League titles, two League Cups and the Champions League in 2007-08. He played 455 times for the club and will go down as one of their greatest defenders ever.",
      "But with United a much different side in present day under Amorim, Ferdinand insisted he wouldn't be surprised if Spurs beat them in Bilbao, though he said he simply 'couldn't call\" the result.",
      "\"I have to be honest, I can’t call a Man United result,' he told Optus Sport. 'They’re so inconsistent or they have consistently been bad in the Premier League. But the fact that they are playing against Spurs, another consistently bad team in the Premier League. But they have players who can win a match. It makes it such a hard game to call.",
      "\"I don’t think the fans can be too surprised (if Spurs win). They beat us three times already this season, so it’s not going to be a surprise if they beat us a fourth time. I think it’s only going to be stupid people that are going, 'Oh my god, I can’t believe this'.",
      "\"We’re 16th because we’ve lost a lot of games. 18 Premier League games we’ve lost this season. Anyone who’s surprised if we don’t win this game against Spurs is a lunatic in my eyes.\""

      "Victory in Spain would not only hand them silverware but also rubber-stamp the Red Devils’ spot in next season’s Champions League. Fernandes, who would potentially lift the trophy, has been key to United’s run to the final.",
      "The Portuguese playmaker has scored seven goals in the Europa League this season and provided a further five assists. Despite that form, Scholes believes the best course of action in the final against Spurs would be to give him a slightly more defensive role.",
      "\"The best way might be to drop Fernandes back in the central midfield role alongside Casemiro, which has worked well in the past, especially in European games. I think Amorim will start [Rasmus] Hojlund in the final because he hasn’t been too bad in the Europa League.",
      "\"He’s looked like a real threat and scored some important goals, but in the Premier League, he’s been really poor. If Amorim wanted to change things up, he could play Bruno Fernandes as a false nine just like Erik ten Hag did in last season’s FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "\"I know he’s tried Kobbie Mainoo in that position too, but I don’t think he’s suited to it and Fernandes is a bit more mobile. With Fernandes playing as a false centre-forward, you could also start with Casemiro and [Manuel] Ugarte in central midfield.",
      "\"There are plenty of selection dilemmas for Amorim, but I just hope he gets it right. The problem is the manager doesn’t know what he’s going to get from most of his players on the day.\"",
      "Regardless of his position, the final in Bilbao could potentially represent Fernandes’ penultimate appearance as a United player. He has been linked with moves to both Real Madrid and Saudi Arabia - although Amorim has ruled out a sale completely.",
      "Following the final, United have one more game to navigate before the end of the season. They take on Champions League-chasing Aston Villa at Old Trafford on the final day of the Premier League campaign."

If Amorim was feeling the pressure ahead of tonight's £100million all-or-nothing clash in Bilbao, the United boss did not show it and nor did his inspirational captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "When asked why he felt he is not under the same pressure as Postecoglou, despite their sides being just a point and a place apart in the Premier League, the United boss was interrupted by his skipper. “He is!” said a smiling Fernandes, answering on behalf of his boss, who dissolved into laughter at the cheeky response.",
      "“He wants my job!” was Amorim's retort. “He’ll be a very very good coach. But he has to work on his mindset. He doesn’t know how to deal with people!” The light-hearted exchange between Fernandes and Amorim gave an insight into the calm mentality within the United camp ahead of what will be a season-defining game for both clubs.",
      "While Postecoglou is almost certainly on his way this summer, Amorim's job is not under threat, a position the 40-year-old Portuguese coach admitted is hard to explain, given they have had such similarly calamitous domestic seasons.",
      "“I don’t know,” said Amorim. “I know that in this kind of club, also Tottenham, but especially Manchester United, it’s strange because you have some coaches here that lose some games and are sacked. So it’s hard to explain.",
      "“But I think people see what we're trying to do and see I’m about thinking more about the club than myself. People, especially the board, understand that we have a lot of issues that in their context are really hard.",
      "\"I don’t know how to explain how the fans like me in this moment. But the good thing is I never worry about that. That's a part of being a coach and the most important thing is I know what I'm doing and I explained everything before when we started.",
      "“I explained about a storm coming, I explained all the problems we have to the board, so I was so clear and I explained that I will not change my ideas. So they cannot say one thing about what I said to get the job and then I change my mind.",
      "\"It’s the opposite. I think the board can understand that, I think the fans can understand that but we will reach a moment where we have to win - no matter what.”",
      "Despite their abysmal Premier League form this season, which has seen them lose 18 times, United remain unbeaten in the Europa League, with nine wins and five draws. They looked to be heading out when trailing Lyon 4-2 in extra-time in the quarter-finals, but staged an epic late comeback to win 5-4, with Harry Maguire plundering a 121st-minute winner.",
      "That fightback, coupled with a 7-1 aggregate semi-final win over Athletic Bilbao, denying the hosts the chance to reach the final at home, fuelled the narrative that United's name is on the trophy. Fernandes hinted as much when he said: \"Everyone knows about Fergie time here, so we just have to believe that the magic is still present at the club.",
      "\"But a final is a final - it doesn't matter who we're playing. Finals are usually cagey affairs, as both teams are scared to make mistakes. It's two teams who have had a rough season, but who can end it with a European trophy.\""

      "Manchester United’s iconic Old Trafford home appears to be going out on an awful note as mouse droppings were allegedly found in another woeful hygiene review. The Red Devils’ current stadium was hit with a brutal blow in December upon the first review.",
      "United saw their rating fall from four stars all the way down to two. The past few months have been spent attempting to fix the issues identified in that review but it doesn’t appear to have worked.",
      "According to Mail Online, the fresh report has offered a number of concerns. It is suggested that mouse droppings were found across seven areas of Old Trafford including the Ambassador Lounge, the Manchester Suite and under the buffet bar in the Number 7 suite - the latter of which is dubbed as one of the most stylish spaces in the stadium, with prices starting at around £550.",
      "Supporters are also charged around £600 for tickets in the Manchester Suite where a ‘large number of droppings’ were found as per the report. As quoted by The Mail, a United spokesperson said: “Manchester United implements a robust pest-control system throughout Old Trafford.",
      "“Multiple weekly checks are made in all catering areas and stringent measures are taken to ensure levels of hygiene and cleanliness are high wherever food is stored, prepared and served. If incidences of this nature do occur at the stadium, immediate and appropriate action is taken.”",
      "Away from the suites, the report revealed a number dirty areas, with the labelling of certain foods a particular concern. In United’s defence, both of those issues were immediately addressed.",
      "And inspectors noted that ‘it is evident that significant work has taken place to control the mice activity on site’, while they said that the club ‘needs to persevere with the measures being implemented to eradicate activity within food areas.’",
      "The latest Old Trafford report comes just months after plans for a mega-money rebuild of the club was announced. Speaking after the £2bn plans were unveiled, Jim Ratcliffe said: “The north of England has won 10 Champions League medals, London has two. But London has Wembley, Twickenham, Wimbledon and the Olympic Village.",
      "\"The north of England deserves a stadium where England can play football, where we can hold the Champions League final, and one befitting of Manchester United's stature. Our current stadium has served us brilliantly for the past 115 years, but it has fallen behind the best arenas in world sport.\""

      "He told CBS Sports : \"If you win the Europa League in Manchester United, I'm sorry, it is not a big thing. You need to go for Premier League and the Champions League - and we are so far away. That is my feeling. Of course it would be a title, a European title, but it is not enough.\"",
      "Amorim's feeling is not uncommon in Manchester with Harry Maguire, who scored the winner to see off Lyon in the quarter-finals, admitting that a trophy would not make up for the dire season they've had, which has seen them lose 18 times in the league.",
      "He said: \"It wouldn't save the season because I think it's been disappointing. There's been too many games that we've lost, far too inconsistent. It's been a difficult season. It's been a disappointing season but of course football is about memories, it's about creating memories, it's about winning trophies and we have a great opportunity to win a trophy.\"",
      "United are in the midst of their worst run of form all year - without a win in their last seven league games. Victory on Wednesday would see the Red Devils land a spot in the Champions League, but Amorim insists his team are not ready to compete a Europe's top table and in England.",
      "He said: \"We are not ready to play in the Premier League, be competitive, and to be in the Champions League. We know that, but we need to win, and we need to fight to win this competition [Europa League], to give something to our fans, and to go to the Champions League. Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions. So, it is a dilemma, but we want to win, of course.\""

      "\"We haven't won enough, in the Premier League it's not been good enough. The Europa League has been different - we have performed at a high level and we have proven that we can beat anybody. I am sure next season we will improve an awful amount after a full pre-season.",
      "“As players we are all looking forward to that but we have got a big game tomorrow night, and that's first and foremost. It's a special night, a special occasion - we have prepared well the last few days and it's one that we are looking forward to.”"

But it was Fernandes' ability and motivation to play the entire game that really left some of the club's staff stunned. The Portuguese playmaker was subjected to a nasty tackle, hitting his ankle hard.",

The skipper had been in there for two hours, moving from one to the next in a cycle of so-called “contrast bath therapy” as he tried to reduce the swelling and improve his chances of playing.",

Last season United finished eighth, their worst finish in the Premier League era, but currently sit 16th with one game of the campaign remaining.",
      "Fernandes' durability is among his greatest qualities and he's produced one of his best seasons in front of goal. He's closing in on 40 goal involvements with two games of his season remaining. Al-Hilal have made the United man one of their main targets this summer, but Amorim has maintained he's going nowhere.",
      "He said: \"I want Bruno here because we want to win the Premier League again, so we want the best players to continue with us. He's 30, but he's still so young, because he plays 55 games every season. Between assists and goals, he's there for 30 at least, so he's the type of player we want here and he's not going anywhere.\""

      "Ravel Morrison has claimed Wilfried Zaha didn't return to the changing room after the ex-England U21 duo's infamous clash on the pitch. In March 2013, the Young Lions cruised to a 5-0 home victory over Lithuania in what was a routine and otherwise uneventful win.",
      "That was until Morrison and Zaha were suddenly at each other's throats on the pitch, in front of television cameras and stunned spectators. During a brief break in play, Zaha could be seen exchanging words with Morrison as both sets of players looked to get back in position.",
      "After taking exception to something Zaha said, Morrison turned around and pushed his former Manchester United youth team-mate, prompting the ex-Crystal Palace forward to furiously shove him back. Former Southampton winger Nathan Redmond intervened, ensuring the scuffle did not turn into a full-blown fight.",
      "In 2021, Zaha, who now represents the Ivory Coast and plays club football for Charlotte in the MLS, claimed he was angry with what he perceived to be selfish play from his team-mate. Morrison, 32, who now plays for Precision FC in Dubai, hit out at Zaha, claiming their physical exchange has been blown out of proportion by the media and his ex-team-mate.",
      "When asked if it was heated in the changing room, Morrison told Undr The Cosh podcast: \"No. He didn’t come into the changing room after that, but there was no back and forth or anything after that. There was nothing. The conversation was done.",
      "\"It happened on the pitch and it stayed on the pitch. There was nothing in the changing room, there was no awkwardness or anything. You can ask all the U21s that was there. There was nothing in the changing room after. I’ve never understood it really.”",

      "\"I just had enough. I was like, 'What are you doing?' And out of the blue he just pushed me. I'm like, 'Are you dumb?’ So I pushed him back and it was just nonsense on the pitch. Then when you go inside, the man is silent.\"",
      "Morrison responded to Zaha's comments in 2021 by asking him to discuss their exchange on a podcast. Addressing what Zaha said four years ago, Morrison added: \"I think that thing (the scuffle) was blown out of proportion.",
      "\"I think even from his side, he’s come out and done something after it again. It was never that deep. Me and Saido Berahino, we were both on two goals. Obviously, you shouldn’t really do it, but the game had like 15 minutes left.",
      "\"We were talking and saying, 'Who can get the hat-trick?’ We were both trying to get a hat-trick, so I think I hit one outside the area and, from there, it just tipped him over the water. Even in that game, there was no, 'Oh, pass me the ball.’ It was like that one split-second in the game.”",

      "Harry Maguire says Manchester United's players have been “surprised” by the backing of their fans – given how poorly they have played this season. United have endured their worst season of the Premier League era, losing 18 games, and are currently languishing in 16th place with one league game left to play.",
      "But while their league campaign has been a write-off, Ruben Amorim's side can salvage something from the ruins by beating Tottenham to win the Europa League final.",
      "Despite the depths United have plumbed this season, United's fans have continued to back Ruben Amorim and his players, with Maguire admitting their enduring loyalty has surprised them.",
      "“They've been absolutely incredible this season,” said Maguire. “It's surprising us players how much they're backing us. We've disappointed them far too much. We've given them some good times in the Europa League and some great memories in terms of winning the derby at the Etihad, but it’s even surprised me.",
      "“I say they're the greatest fans in the world and I think this year they’ve proved that. It’s been remarkable when we get to play in front of them, even though we're not performing.",
      "“That's why I think they deserve it, and we deserve everything we do to give them the great opportunity to go and win the cup final and give them that day out. It’s only a good day out if we come back and win the tournament.",
      "“We know this season has been nowhere near good enough for this club and for our standards. Next season, I know we'll improve.”",
      "Maguire has had rotten luck with United when it comes to finals – injured for the Europa League final defeat to Villarreal in 2021 and also ruled out of last season's FA Cup final win over Manchester City.",
      "The England defender was also an unused substitute in United's FA Cup final defeat to City in 2023 and only played two minutes when they won the League Cup in the same season, under former boss Erik ten Hag.",
      "“Missing the Villarreal one was a big one for me,” said Maguire. “I was captain of the club at the time and a big part of that team. Maybe the result would have been different if I'd been in the team. That's what I felt. I missed last year as well. I was playing every week under Eric and missed the final, so it hurt.",
      "“But the lads put in a great performance. It makes it a lot better when you win. The Villarreal one hurt a lot more than the cup final, just because of the result.",
      "“At the time of the Villarreal final I was an important part of the team. We had a good team that year and played really well. We had a good defensive record but I had a nasty ankle injury.",
      "“Looking back to that game, I actually think we played pretty well. We were unlucky not to win and it's nice to get another opportunity against Spurs in another final. We'll be ready for it.”",
      "Maguire has enjoyed a revival under Amorim and will start in the centre of defence tonight, capping a remarkable turnaround for the 32-year-old, who nearly left United after having the captaincy taken off him by Ten Hag in the summer of 2023.",
      "But Maguire has shown impressive mental resilience to re-establish himself as automatic pick and scored the 121st-minute winner in United's epic quarter-final comeback against Lyon.",
      "“You want to be in these big games, these big moments, pressure moments,” said Maguire. “You want to play and be part of it. “It’s been a couple of years now and I feel in a good place. I feel really comfortable at this club and my surroundings and the pressure that’s involved in it. It’s an amazing club and I’m really privileged and proud to be a part of it.”"

      "Harry Maguire has credited former England boss Gareth Southgate with helping spark his revival for Manchester United. Maguire endured a difficult spell at United, a sustained spell of poor form resulting in former boss Erik ten Hag taking the captaincy off him in 2023.",
      "Despite losing his United place and seeing team-mate Bruno Fernandes handed the captaincy, Maguire remained a key figure for England under Southgate. Southgate kept faith with Maguire and the defender said the backing of the former Three Lions boss helped him win back his place and form for United.",
      "\"I always believed, because I was always playing for my country in major tournaments,\" said Maguire, who will start Wednesday's Europa League final in Bilbao. \"I went to the World Cup in Qatar and played a big part in reaching a quarter-final, and played and performed really well.",
      "\"Really the belief that came from me, maybe at that time, was playing for my country. Credit to Gareth for showing his faith and trust in me during that period. I must say I felt like I was playing really well for my country, even through negative times at this club.",
      "\"It's nice to be back playing. It's nice to be back helping the team. The most important thing is it's a big cup final, and one I'm looking forward to.\"",
      "\"We know it's not been good enough this season, we take responsibility for that as players. We've had two managers and results haven't been good enough, and that's got to be down to us.",
      "Who'll win the Europa League final - Tottenham or Man Utd? Give us your score prediction in the comments section.",
      "\"To play in a European final for Manchester United is a huge occasion. Our fans deserve it - they've been absolutely incredible this season. I don't know how and why they're sticking with us as much as they are, because we've disappointed them so many times.",
      "\"But they've stuck with us and they deserve something to celebrate. It's going to be a great day for them, but it'll only be a great day if we go and lift that trophy. It's going to be a good game, a tough game, we know that Spurs will be right up for it as well, but it's one I'm looking forward to.\""

      "Ruben Amorim admits he is grateful that he does not have to worry about his future as Manchester United manager ahead of the Europa League final.",
      "United are 16th in the Premier League, having lost 18 games, and have a -12 goal difference with one game remaining. However, they can salvage their season in the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday night in Bilbao.",
      "Spurs are 17th in the league and this is widely expected to be coach Ange Postecoglou's final week in charge after two seasons at the club. Amorim is set to remain in charge at United for the start of next season as the club prepares for another squad overhaul in the summer.",
      "United appointed Amorim in November and they have won six out of his 26 league games in charge. The Europa League campaign has safeguarded the Portuguese's position but he is certain to be under pressure to oversee clear improvement at the start of next season.",
      "When it was suggested to Amorim that he was not in a similar situation to Postecoglou, United captain Bruno Fernandes, sitting to his right, quipped, \"He is.\"",
      "\"He wants my job,\" Amorim laughed. \"He will be a very, very good coach but he has to work on his mindset because he doesn’t know how to deal with people.",
      "\"I don’t know, I know in this kind of club, also Tottenham, especially Manchester United it’s strange because you have some coaches here who lose some games and they are sacked. It’s hard to explain.",
      "\"I think people see what we are trying to do, I think people see that sometimes I’m thinking more in the club than myself, people understand, especially the board understands, we have a lot of issues that in the context is really hard.",
      "\"So I don’t know how to explain, I don’t know how to explain how the fans like me in this moment, so it’s hard to explain. I will try to prove myself to the fans, to the board, but I don’t have an explanation for you.",
      "\"But again, it’s a good thing for me. I never worry about that. That is a part of being a coach. And the most important thing [is] I know what I am doing. I explain everything before when we start, I explain about the storm, I explain all the problems that we have to the board, so I was so clear.",
      "\"I explained I would not change my idea, they cannot say one thing that I said to get the job and then I changed my mind, was the opposite. I think the board can understand that, the fans can understand that, but we will reach a moment that we have to win, no matter what. So I don’t have an explanation for that.",
      "\"A new future for me I think is not the case but is going to help us to finish the season. People will look at our team in a different way because winning a European title is really important.",
      "\"But again, nothing is going to change our season. Players know, everybody knows the stuff, the fans know. But winning a European title can help us to have that feeling that can help us to build a future.\"",
      "Amorim reiterated that winning the Europa League would not mask United's issues. The club is expected to complete deals for Wolves playmaker Matheus Cunha and Ipswich Town striker Liam Delap but any other incomings are likely to be dependent on sales.",
      "United want to gut a squad that is certain to record their worst top flight finish since the team was relegated in 1974 but several players are on long contracts and high salaries.",
      "\"I think it’s hard to speak about that in this moment because we need to be excited and confident,\" Amorim added, \"but we already know the problems.",
      "\"There are a lot of things we need to change in our club, the way we do everything during the week in Carrington, the recruitment, the academy I think we need to improve. It’s hard to point at one thing. And that will not be solved by winning a cup.",
      "\"For me, we have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top but tomorrow will be important for us and for our fans because winning can help us to have that strength to do every job we have to do.",

      "Thomas' house is like United heaven and he travelled to Bilbao on Monday afternoon to attend the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur, along with his son and grandson.",
      "The dedicated Red had been to every cup final, including Europeans, until recently when a friend who was responsible for sorting their tickets made an error, but Thomas will be present at the Estadio de San Mames on Wednesday night and he can't wait to take his seat in the stadium.",
      "\"My other grandson is going with his mates and they're flying via Tenerife,\" Thomas laughed. \"He's been to the quarter-finals and semi-finals away in Lyon and Bilbao, and he booked his flights for the final early.",
      "\"The Lyon match at Old Trafford was crazy. We had to make a dash to the toilet and the equaliser was scored, so we darted back in at the bottom and we were right where Maguire scored.",

      "Thomas continued: \"They're the only unbeaten team in Europe, so I fancy them with how we've been. It's been a ride when you compare it to the Premier League, which has been terrible.",

      "Manchester United will be targeting Europa League glory when they face Tottenham Hotspur in the final at the San Mames Stadium in Bilbao tonight.",
      "United have made it all the way to their third Europa League final in nine seasons boasting an impressive unbeaten run in the competition, winning nine and drawing five of their first 14 games, meaning they will be determined to jump the final hurdle and return to Manchester with silverware.",
      "Just like Spurs, United have endured a wretched Premier League campaign, meaning the opportunity to win the Europa League and secure Champions League qualification for next term would salvage something from their campaign.",
      "Regarding the team news, United head coach Ruben Amorim has taken a 26-man squad to Bilbao with him, which includes Diogo Dalot, Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee, all of whom have recovered from injury issues to be involved.",
      "Below, our writers have had their say on how they would like to see United line up in the final:",
      "United have some genuine dilemmas. Yoro's availability is significant and Noussair Mazraoui merits a start. It should be a point of principle not to start Luke Shaw when he has lined up four times within three weeks on the eve of a final.",
      "Ideally, United would not play Rasmus Hojlund. We know he will start but he shouldn't. United won a trophy last season because Hojlund was taken out of the team for the FA Cup final and Bruno Fernandes would be an upgrade.",
      "You can play Fernandes anywhere and he will have an impact. United need to balance pragmatism with proactivism and not have the starting XI overloaded with defensive players.",
      "The big unknown here is the fitness of the three players who have returned to training this week. Well, two of them really, Zirkzee surely won't be fit to start.",
      "Yoro seems the most likely to get the nod from the beginning. As a centre-back his workload is smaller and he has only really missed a week of training. That means Lindelof can drop to the bench and Yoro can line up alongside Shaw and Maguire.",
      "Dalot is a valuable option off the bench but after a month out with a hamstring injury, I wouldn't risk starting him. He can influence the game as a sub, so Mazraoui plays on the right and Dorgu on the left. Playing Mazraoui is balanced by Fernandes dropping into a deeper midfield role alongside Casemiro, with Ugarte the unfortunate fall guy.",
      "Moving Fernandes back will allow Amad and Mount to fill those No. 10 roles, with Garnacho primed for a role off the bench. Hojlund has to start as the striker.",
      "The biggest game of United's season is finally here - the talking has ended and it is time for the players to deliver on the pitch. Amorim named a 26-man travelling squad for the game, but three players are guaranteed to miss out, and perhaps that's evidence of him playing mind games with Ange Postecoglou.",
      "I'd start with Mazraoui, Maguire and Yoro in the back three, who should be able to limit Tottenham's threat. It also makes sense to start Dalot and Dorgu at wing-back.",
      "Amad must start and I prefer him in the No.10 position for now, which means Dalot gets the nod at right wing-back in my team and Fernandes is dropped back into midfield alongside Casemiro.",
      "Tottenham will have prepared to face an out-of-form Hojlund in the Europa League final, so starting Zirkzee would provide some unpredictability and give United a slight advantage.",
      "Amorim has some tough calls to make in just about every position. Yoro's availability means he must start somewhere in the back-three, but there will be some debate about exactly where.",
      "I would start him on the left, as that was where he was flourishing prior to his recent injury. Maguire should start in the middle and Mazraoui is a logical candidate to start on the right amid Dalot's return.",
      "Dalot, if his fitness allows, should start at right wing-back and Dorgu is an obvious pick on the opposite flank. Casemiro and Ugarte have developed a good midfield bond in the Europa League and ought to start together in the engine room.",
      "Amad has to start after the season he has had, meaning he should operate in the right-sided No.10 role. Hojlund has struggled for goals all season and United, despite not testing the water recently, would be better off allowing Fernandes to lead the attack as a false-nine.",
      "As Samuel has already said, Fernandes has the ability to make something happen from just about anywhere on the pitch."

      "The biggest surprise was they were joined by Joshua Zirkzee. The Dutchman has been out of action since the defeat to Newcastle on April 13 and even though he recently claimed it would not be \"impossible\" for him to recover in time for the final, it seemed very unlikely after Amorim had previously ruled him out for the season.",
      "The United head coach said of the trio: \"They recovered quite well. They pushed. Of course we respect the feeling of the player, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to be part of the team and that is a very, very good sign.",
      "\"And it's very good for us. Of course they are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "There wasn't such good news on Matthijs de Ligt. The defeneder has travelled to Bilbao with his teammates but will play no part in tonight's game, meaning the Dutchman and Lisandro Martinez are the only two United players to miss out through injury.",
      "While United will be missing just two players tonight, Spurs have bigger problems.",
      "Dejan Kulusevski picked up a knee injury against Crystal Palace recently and will miss the final having undergone surgery, with James Maddison also set to miss out. The latter has travelled with the squad, sparking talk that he could make a return from injury having been ruled out for the season. However, Ange Postecoglou confirmed Spurs' injury situation hasn't changed and so Maddison remains out of action.",

I think people see that sometimes I am thinking more about the club than myself. We have a lot of issues that in the context is really hard. I don't know how to explain how the fans like me in this moment. I try to prove myself to the fans, to the board.\"",
      "\"I think it is hard to speak about that in this moment because you need to be excited and confident. We know that we need to change a lot of things in our club. The recruitment, the academy, we need to improve. That will not be solved by winning a cup. We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow, that winning of feeling will give us every strength to do every job that we have to do.\"",

I have gone up front in latter minutes of games. Tomorrow night, I hope not to be going up front and chasing a league. I am more than happy playing in my favourite position.\"",
      "\"Every game that you have a chance to win a trophy is very big. Apart from that, every game at this club is massive. This club is so big that one week you can be the hero, the next week you can be the villain. We just want to get our hands on a trophy. It won't change the past, but what it can affect is the future. Winning a competition gives you a lot of things; in this case you get a place in the Champions League and revenue in the club.\"",
      "\"It is amazing to be back in the team and playing regularly. This season, I have played a lot football. I don't take too much notice of the plaudits from the media. I try and stay as level as I can and go into every game trying to do my best, and that is all you can do.\"",

We have not been good enough in the Premier League. It has been different in the Europa League. We have proven this season we can beat anyone. We can improve next season. But we have an important game tomorrow night. We have prepared well and we are looking forward to it.\"",
      "\"Our system is a normal system that can change the characteristics. It is a system like any other. It doesn't matter what happened in the last final because it was a different team, a different competition and a different context. I just focus on Tottenham and the way that they play.\"",
      "\"It is very important. The manager has been very clear with that. We want to be at the top of everything. Everything we are involved in. We know it is not always possible to be in finals and win trophies. But our aim is to be at the end of comeptitions and fighting to win trophies. We have a big game, a big final, and a big opportunity.\"",
      "\"The advantage, I don't know. You have to see the context. I don't know the context of Tottenham. We rested some players after Bilbao because we were afraid of some injuries. Five days before the final, I thought the best thing to prepare the final was to give the players the chance to play. It was really clear that we need to compete. I felt that against Chelsea. When we are focused and play our game, we can control any game in any place.\"",
      "\"We talk about the Europa League. The Europa League is everything on our mind and we can be successful in this competition. Our aim is to get to the end of each competition and win trophies. I am not here thinking I can be one of the captains to win a European trophy. The main thing is that we can bring to the trophy back to Manchester.\"",
      "\"Again, I don't think that is the case. We are doing things that we need to do. Our club can have revenues without Champions League. It is a big brand. I am always playing for more than myself. I am coaching for my players, my staff and especially our fans.\"",
      "\"A new future for me, I think, is not the case. People will look at our team in a different way, as winning a European title is really important. Nothing is going to change our season, but winning a European title can help us have that feeling to build a future.\"",
      "\"Me neither [didn't expect Joshua Zirkzee to be fit]! They recovered quite well. They pushed. Of course, we respect the feeling of the player but we pushed a little bit. They can help us win the game. De Ligt is out.\"",

      "Amorim is expected to issue an update on the injury front when he speaks to the media shortly, but the fact Leny Yoro, Diogo Dalot and Joshua Zirkzee have all been included in the travelling squad is a massively encouraging sign.",
      "Of course, we don't know yet if the aforementioned trio will be fit enough to start, but if they are, Amorim has some tough calls to make.",
      "Yoro was in great form prior to his injury and would strengthen United's back-three if deemed fit enough to start the game. Meanwhile, Dalot was virtually an ever-present prior to his recent injury and could be an option at right wing-back.",
      "Amorim will no doubt be greateful of the options he has.",
      "United's pre-match press conference is due to start at the San Mames Stadium at 6.30pm.",
      "Head coach Ruben Amorim will speak to the media to look ahead to the game, as will Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire.",
      "Following the conclusion of the press conference earlier, Spurs' players have been training on the San Mames Stadium pitch ahead of tomorrow night's game.",
      "They arrived in the Basque Country yesterday, whereas United's players only left Manchester this afternoon. Ruben Amorim and his players trained in front of the media at Carrington this morning.",
      "United are the bigger club but the Tottenham manager has sorted out tomorrow's back page splashes.",
      "Ange Postecoglou is an eminently quotable coach and we got more than we bargained for with his pre-match address in San Mames. The piece he took umbrage with was not merely a mischievous piece of sub-editing, either. The word 'clown' appeared in the copy, which was bold of the reporter (who was one of the first to ask Postecoglou a question).",
      "Sources say Postecoglou has expected this to be his last season at Tottenham for a couple of months, so he can afford to let off some steam every now and then. He was not as cantankerous as some of the quotes suggest in black and white.",
      "Postecoglou provided some relaxed answers and it was a press conference tinge with poignancy as he reflected on his Greek roots and late father. Wherever he goes, the press corps will be onto a winner.",
      "That concludes Ange Postecoglou's pre-match press conference. He got a little bit spiky with his responses to a couple of questions.",
      "Ruben Amorim, Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire will be along later on for United to preview tomorrow night's game.",
      "\"I won't be the first person who has changed jobs, mate; we all change jobs. My future is assured. I have got a beautiful family, a great life. I will keep on winning trophies until I finish. Don't worry about my future.\""

      "Some may feel it is a travesty that Athletic have been denied a final in their own city. Yes, United are 16th and, domestically, have not been this bad since the year The Godfather Part 2 was released. Yet they did vanquish Athletic 7-1 on aggregate. They have earned their one-shot at salvation.",

Noussair Mazraoui was escorted to our pen on the Stretford End concourse at 1542. Amad turned up at 5pm. With the United press department spread so thin, the chief communications officer was conspicuous by his absence.",

      "It has not been an eternity since Spurs last reached a European final. Merely six years. Son is the sole survivor from that all-English non-event against Liverpool.",
      "Both clubs made it to Madrid through inconceivable comebacks. The difference for Liverpool after their recovery against Barcelona was they had been there, done that. Tottenham hadn't. So their players savoured Lucas Moura's kick past Andre Onana for as long as their delirious supporters were locked inside the Amsterdam Arena.",
      "Danny Rose clutched a bottle of beer. You knew then, 24 days before the final, that Spurs did not have a prayer. The gulf in mentality between the clubs made a sixth European Cup for Liverpool a fait accompli.",
      "Many of a United persuasion are banking on their pedigree. United's worst team in decades last season salvaged it with their greatest performance of the post-Ferguson era. The current lot are doubly worse, 16th to last season's eighth, yet plundered 19 goals in six European knockout ties.",
      "Spurs have the edge on United in goal, at centre back, full back, up front and have arguably more technically rounded midfielders. The caveat is United have the matchwinners. Amad was a one-man band in attack until injury and Bruno Fernandes picked up the baton.",
      "Leny Yoro and Matthijs de Ligt would be genuine losses and Amorim would be well-advised to pick a back three featuring one centre back. But United's centre-back losses are not as considerable as those of James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, two of Tottenham's most influential footballers.",
      "Amad and Fernandes are game-deciding players, which offsets the blunt instrument Rasmus Hojlund. United regimes past and present have recruited two 20-year-old Denmark internationals for inflated fees, deemed them to be good enough to start and neither are. Yet Hojlund and Patrick Dorgu will start in Bilbao.",

      "After a stunning maiden season in the Premier League, Casemiro was in decline for a good 18 months.

      "For the 2023/24 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.8m per position. Sheffield United were awarded as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Manchester City receiving £56.4m. It basically helped pay for 95.6% of Omar Marmoush.",

Their UK facility fee payment of £20.2m was the seventh highest in the league alongside Newcastle, and higher than fourth-placed Aston Villa’s (£19.4m).",

      "Manchester United will reportedly ‘accelerate to try to sign’ Arsenal-linked Sporting striker Viktor Gyokeres after Wednesday’s Europa League final.",
      "Gyokeres has been strongly linked with a transfer to Arsenal this summer, but could be tempted by a move to Man United, where his former Sporting boss, Ruben Amorim, is now in charge.",
      "There were links to a move to Old Trafford in January, but the Red Devils were unable to afford the Swedish international, having made wing-back Patrick Dorgu their priority at the time.",
      "Amorim’s side face Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final on Wednesday, with a place in next season’s Champions League and around £100million on the line.",
      "That income would help United rebuild their squad to suit Amorim’s style of play, with defeat expected to hit them hard and possibly result in the exit of one or two young stars such as Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "F365 SAYS: Gyokeres too old, too big, too striker-ish for Arsenal? The nonsense debunked",
      "United downed tools in the Premier League some time ago and currently sit 16th, so their season will essentially end on Wednesday night in Bilbao, with summer transfer business immediately taking centre stage.",
      "According to French outlet L’Equipe, the Manchester giants have ‘a clear idea of the avenues to explore for each targeted position’ in the summer window and ‘have already completed the signing of’ Matheus Cunha. Reports suggest the Wolves forward will cost United £67million.",
      "Another attacker is expected to join Amorim’s ranks and ‘the trail leading to Viktor Gyokeres remains very active’.",
      "The report claims that United will ‘accelerate to try to sign the Swedish striker’ after Wednesday’s final, as Amorim ‘knows the player perfectly having coached him at Sporting’.",
      "French champions Paris Saint-Germain have previously been linked with Gyokeres, but the report says they ‘no longer seem to be in the race’. Luis Enrique apparently does not want to sign a new striker, ‘and even less so an expensive player’, it’s said.",
      "Arsenal get a mention but barely, as L’Equipe refer to ‘the English press mentioning an offensive’ by Mikel Arteta’s side.",
      "Gunners sporting director Andrea Berta is reportedly a huge fan of £60m-rated Gyokeres and has made him the club’s top summer target.",
      "Despite apparent interest from United, the Londoners remain in pole position for the 26-year-old’s signature, and transfer journalist Graeme Bailey has discussed their interest this week.",
      "Bailey says Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak is an unrealistic target and that Gyokeres “is getting all the attention at the Emirates now”.",
      "“In terms of Alexander Isak, I’m told that if he leaves Newcastle, Liverpool are leading the race for him — I think Arsenal have been fairly accepting of that for the last few months,” he said (quotes via Now Arsenal).",
      "“Arsenal sources have told me this week that Viktor Gyokeres is getting all the attention at the Emirates now.",
      "“Essentially if something comes up they will assess it, but the focus is on Gyokeres at the moment, Andrea Berta feels like he is the one — Arsenal aren’t going out there and saying it but it does feel like that.”",
      "Bailey adds that RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko is also someone Arsenal ‘have done a lot of work on’, though there is also interest from London rivals Chelsea.",
      "Meanwhile, Liam Delap has been tipped to join Manchester United from Ipswich Town.",
      "“I’m told that Benjamin Sesko’s people are having conversations with other clubs, which they are more than entitled to do,” Bailey continued.",
      "“We know that Arsenal have done a lot of work on him, but keep an eye on Chelsea when it comes to Sesko.",
      "“All the striker dominoes we’ve been talking about, we sort of know how it is mapping out now.",
      "“I do believe that Gyokeres will end up at Arsenal, most likely and Liam Delap could go to Man Utd.",
      "“Liverpool and Chelsea will be interesting, Chelsea are open to a project type striker like Sesko. But Liverpool want the finished product, a bit like Arsenal.”",
      "Premier League side Arsenal are set to seal a deal for Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres next week after a long-running saga, according to reports.",

      "It is understood that ‘the option that has gained traction is to finalise a swap deal in which Ronald Araujo would be the other player, although he is not in the plans.’",
      "Whether in a swap deal for Rashford or not, the Uruguay international’s ‘departure is all but confirmed when the transfer window opens’.",
      "The report adds that Premier League giants Man Utd ‘still appears to be interested in taking him on, as they did in the past, when they even submitted a formal offer.’",
      "Earlier this month, Barcelona sporting director Deco admitted that the Catalan giants were missing strength in the wide areas of their side, something which Rashford could provide.",

      "Eddie Howe is in the market for another striker, with Callum Wilson expected to leave and the demands of European football next season placing added pressure on leading scorer Alexander Isak.",

      "Delap is believed to prefer staying in the north west, having joined Man City as a teenager and spent the last few years based in the region.",
      "But speaking on talkSPORT, former England striker Darren Bent summed up one potential concern at Old Trafford. “Double Hojlund, yeah?” he said, referencing the potential similarities between the youngster Delap and the Danish forward who has struggled at times to lead the line alone.",
      "United fan Andy Goldstein was even more direct. “I think he’s a really good player, I don’t think he’s the finished article just yet,” he said. “And we’ve got a Liam Delap [in Hojlund], and it’s not working at the minute. We’ve got a Liam Delap. I think two of them is not the answer.”",
      "The comments echoed Jamie Carragher’s warning earlier this week, when he suggested Delap would be better served taking an intermediate step, such as Everton, before joining a top-six club.",
      "Jamie Carragher has warned a Premier League striker to steer clear of a move to Man Utd, naming Everton as a more suitable destination.",
      "Liam Delap would rather join Man United than Chelsea, or he would rather join Chelsea than Man United. It all depends whether you believe The Sun or… The Sun.",
      "Liam Delap to Manchester United is “very close” despite interest from Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Newcastle United, according to reports.",

      "Man Utd have received a major boost ahead of the Europa League final after Joshua Zirkzee was among three returning stars pictured in training on Tuesday.",
      "The striker was initially ruled out for the remainder of the season with a hamstring injury suffered during last month’s 4-1 defeat to Newcastle. Ruben Amorim had confirmed at the time that Zirkzee would not feature again this term, telling reporters: “He will not play again this season. Let’s prepare him for the next one.”",
      "However, Zirkzee was involved in full team training at Carrington on Tuesday morning, on the day the squad flies to Spain for Wednesday’s final against Tottenham in Bilbao.",
      "It marks a surprise turnaround for the Dutch forward, who had looked visibly upset when he left the pitch at St James’ Park and was widely expected to focus on recovering ahead of pre-season.",
      "His return provides a timely lift for Man Utd, who have been forced to protect Rasmus Hojlund, the only striker available for the final, in recent weeks.",
      "Zirkzee’s availability offers a new option in the final third and could influence the manager’s tactical approach against a Spurs side Utd have failed to beat in three meetings this season.",
      "Zirkzee has scored six goals and provided four assists in all competitions since arriving last summer, and his blend of physicality and link-up play has been missed in recent weeks.",
      "Amorim’s side has managed just five goals in their last eight domestic matches, with Bruno Fernandes still tasked with carrying the bulk of the attacking threat.",
      "There was further good news for Utd in their final training session before the flight to Bilbao. Both Diogo Dalot and Leny Yoro took part after recent fitness concerns, while Jonny Evans was also involved in the main portion of training.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt was absent, casting doubt over his chances of making the matchday squad. With Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Luke Shaw starting in the recent 1-0 defeat to Chelsea, Yoro’s return may see him replace Shaw if deemed fit enough to start.",
      "Dalot’s return also gives Amorim the option to push Noussair Mazraoui into the back three, with the Portuguese defender and Patrick Dorgu providing the width in more advanced wing-back roles.",
      "Despite sitting 16th in the Premier League and enduring a dismal domestic season, United are one win away from lifting silverware and qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "Victory in Bilbao would also complete an unbeaten Europa League campaign, a feat achieved by only three other clubs in the competition’s modern era.",
      "Zirkzee’s return will now be assessed by the coaching staff, with a decision to be made on whether he features from the start or is held in reserve. Either way, his presence provides a significant boost on the eve of Utd’s biggest match of the season.",
      "Ruben Amorim has an atrocious Premier League record which cannot be entirely masked or excused by Manchester United reaching the Europa League final.",

      "Tottenham haven’t won a major trophy in 17 years. They’ve lost five of their last six finals and stumbled into this one off the back of 21 Premier League defeats and a stack of injuries. Ange Postecoglou’s second-season promise might yet come true, but the end of his first has been nothing short of chaotic.",
      "Still, Spurs came through AZ Alkmaar, Eintracht Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt in the knockouts and have beaten United three times already this season, including a 4-3 thriller in the League Cup and a 3-0 win at Old Trafford. Dominic Solanke has led the charge, with five goals and four assists in Europe.",
      "United’s league form has been no better, but in Europe, they’ve been ruthless. Ruben Amorim’s team are unbeaten in 14 matches, scoring 35 goals and eliminating the likes of Lyon and Athletic Bilbao. Fernandes leads the way with seven goals and four assists.",

      "Matheus Cunha “loves Man Utd”. That’s the quote fed to the media, presumably by his agent. So we fully expect Matheus Cunha to join Manchester United this summer, which would be something of a coup. And would inevitably befuddle the minds of the easily confused.",
      "Others will say he has ‘only joined Manchester United for the money’ and post images of falling wads of cash on social media, ignoring any and all evidence that United are offering no greater wage than any other Big Six club.",
      "But check Cunha’s age – he’s 25 – and clock that he turned 10 the summer after United had won their third consecutive Premier League title, reached the Champions League final and had a fella called Cristiano Ronaldo on their team. Of course he “loves Man Utd”.",
      "When Manchester United wheeled out Sir Alex Ferguson and Bryan Robson (who had last played for United a decade before he was born) in 2020, the “this is Manchester United Football Club we are talking about” charm offensive fell flat on Jude Bellingham, who turned 10 just as David Moyes was replacing Ferguson and the Banter Era was kicking off.",
      "But Cunha? He will absolutely believe United are one of the biggest clubs in the world – not measured by market share or ‘reach’, but because he has grown up watching one of the actual best football teams in the world. As a child in north-eastern Brazil, he would have dreamed of one day playing at Old Trafford and wearing red; as a 25-year-old in the Midlands, he will still hold the glowing remnants of that dream. It’s human nature.",
      "Manchester United do still have that lure. But perhaps only to players like Cunha, who are old enough to have grown up thinking that they are the pinnacle of success. How long does that sheen last? The red wasn’t shiny enough for Bellingham, who wisely chose Borussia Dortmund as the likeliest route to Real Madrid. Surely Cunha belongs to the very last generation of players who look at Old Trafford and see the Theatre of Dreams and not a crumbling circus.",
      "Modern Premier League clubs/businesses tend to focus almost exclusively on young talent with both potential and sell-on value but United’s short-term quest to re-join the elite based on something other than heritage might well lie with those players who still see them as something extraordinary.",
      "For now, Cunha is as close to a no-brainer – he fits the system, he has creativity and personality in abundance – as a signing for Manchester United this summer, but United are far from a no-brainer for a footballer who can have his pick of top-half clubs.",
      "Now it’s his job – along with his likely new teammates – to make Manchester United more than a museum tour.",

      "The big stuff has already been settled this season. We’ve known for months now – long before mathematical confirmation belatedly rolled in as it so often does – who was winning the league and who was being sent packing back to the Championship.",
      "But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing left to sort out in these closing days of the 2025/26 season. Here are literally 10 things of varying levels of importance that are still to be decided.",
      "",
      "Some of next year’s Champions League qualifiers\nSure, Liverpool have got the league wrapped up. And yes, Arsenal are going to be in the Champions League having successfully now (barring mathematical absurdities) avoided the ‘third in a two-horse race’ whimsy.",
      "But the rest? Up in the air.",
      "We do know the top five will all qualify for the Champions League this year, but which three of Newcastle, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Man City and Nottingham Forest make it alongside Liverpool and Arsenal remains very much TBC.",
      "And if Man City don’t beat Bournemouth tonight then we have the very delicious prospect of the five teams scrapping over third to seventh going into the final day separated by a single point.",
      "It’s a better climax to the season than we thought we were getting a few weeks ago, anyway.",
      "",
      "Some of next year’s Europa League qualifiers\nAnd if we don’t know who all the Champions League qualifiers are, then we obviously can’t know the Europa League qualifiers either, can we? One of those who misses out on the Big Cup are joining FA Cup winners Crystal Palace in the Europa League, which is so easy to win even Spurs or Man United can do it.",
      "Crystal Palace London-bussing their way to a second trophy so soon after their first is a fun prospect, and there’s a very plausible chance that they too could do so in a London-Manchester final to match this year’s, against the team they’ve just beaten at Wembley. Wouldn’t that be fun?",
      "",
      "Next year’s Conference League qualifier\nOr even if there’s going to be one at all. It’s possible England won’t even have a team in next year’s Conference. We don’t pretend to understand the science of it but if Chelsea finish sixth and Newcastle don’t finish seventh and then Chelsea win the Conference League then we end up with six English teams in the Champions League and three in the Europa League! And none at all in the Conference! Because reasons!",
      "",
      "Golden Glove: Raya v Sels\nAlexander Isak’s untimely injury has denied us the chance to pretend the Golden Boot is still up for grabs this season, with a malfunctioning Erling Haaland needing seven goals in two games to pull level with long-time clear leader Mo Salah atop the charts. It’s not happening, is it?",
      "But Isak’s absence against Arsenal may well have helped gives us a neck-and-neck Golden Glove fight, because David Raya’s hard-won clean sheet against Newcastle – one that required him to make five saves in the first 20 minutes as Newcastle started much the brighter – allowed him to pull level on 13 clean sheets with Matz Sels.",
      "Sels looked like moving to 14 for most of Sunday afternoon’s game at the London Stadium, but while Jarrod Bowen’s late goal proved to be nothing more than consolation nerve-jangler for the result, it has left this fight going down to the wire neck and neck.",
      "And if you were a betting man you’d have to now favour Raya, with Arsenal up against Southampton on the final day and Sels facing the altogether trickier task of keeping out Chelsea.",
      "",
      "The match that will determine once and for all which club is the greatest on earth: Tottenham or Manchester United\nWe know England will have six teams in next season’s Champions League. We know who two of them are. We know the other three will be some flavour of competent. And then there’s the piss-boiling sixth, which is going to be one of the two stupidest teams in the league at this time because one of them is going to win the Europa League.",
      "A lot of people are unhappy about this. Arsene Wenger is so cross about it all that he’s briefly stopped trying to destroy football entirely with his batsh*t non-solution to toenail offsides. People who have absolutely no problem with the team that finishes fifth in the Premier League being in the Champions League are foaming at the mouth at the very idea of Spurs being there, people presumably in for the shock of their lives when they find out how Spurs qualified for the Europa League in the first place.",
      "We have a strong inkling about how Wednesday night will pan out based on years of evidence that tells us two things: one, Manchester United can always pinch a trophy no matter how abject they appear to be, but more importantly two, the joke is and always must be on Spurs.",
      "‘Only Spurs’ is an overused expression in these pages but there really is no other club quite like them and it really does feel like Only Spurs could carve out a situation where this season is either a) their best season in 41 years or b) their worst season in 48 years, with there being absolutely no middle ground and the whole thing settled by one game in Bilbao.",
      "And again, recent history tells you one of those options instinctively feels far more likely. But at the same time United are simply so bad that even the apparent formality of beating Spurs in a final cannot be taken for granted.",
      "What we do know for absolute certain is that by 11pm on Wednesday night X-formerly-Twitter will be awash with cry-laughing emojis and people saying ‘Can’t believe these are in the Champions League’. The loser is going to get absolutely cooked and the winner is going to boil more p*ss than has ever been boiled before.",
      "Honestly, we can’t wait.",
      "",
      "Can Antony win two European titles in one season?\nThe Europa League final is the most obvious example of how no matter what happens everyone wins yet also somehow everyone loses, but let’s not forget the humble Europa Conference League final because that is not without its charms.",
      "If Chelsea have been kind enough to finish seventh in the Premier League, then them winning it as everyone has just assumed all season long is what will happen means that England will have 10 teams in Europe next season and that’s just plain nutty.",
      "But if Real Betis win it on the back of a Man United win in the Europa League then Antony will have won more European trophies in one season than Arsenal have in their entire existence, and you have to say that’s magnificent.",
      "",
      "The race for eighth\nThis is the kind of thing we should all be able to get behind: a final-day barney for one place that probably won’t matter. And even if Chelsea do the necessary on the final day to make eighth potentially matter, it won’t be until three days later and the Conference final that we actually know for sure.",
      "This is Barclays heritage. Brighton are in pole position now after beating unapologetically beach-based flip-flop-sporting cigar-puffing Liverpool on Monday night, knowing that a final-day victory at Tottenham – who are either going to be too happy or too sad to care, surely – will be enough even if Bournemouth win both their remaining games.",
      "Brentford are still in the mix as well, but that Brighton win over Liverpool has taken Fulham out of the equation.",
      "",
      "The race for 17th\nWest Ham, bless them, have managed to stay involved in this dignity-shedding contest despite not having the excuse of a Europa League final to possibly get them out of jail, but they face Ipswich on the final day and thus this surely will come down to a fight between the stoppable force of Manchester United and the movable object of Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "Sure, it’s perhaps not the most significant contest between the two that remains to be played out this season but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t all just stop and take a moment to marvel at what we’re actually saying here. Spurs. Man United. Seventeenth place.",
      "One way or another we can’t imagine either of them getting anything out of Sunday’s final game after what will for both teams whatever happens be the season-defining emotional extreme of Wednesday night.",
      "And in any case both find themselves up against demonstrably superior teams who actually have something to play for in the league, a quaint concept Spurs and United abandoned months ago. United play Villa, still in the Champions League hunt, while Spurs host a Brighton side in pole position for the uncomfortably Chelsea-dependent but nevertheless potentially significant eighth place.",
      "If we’re being very greedy indeed, we do want whoever wins the Europa League to finish 17th because it is slightly funnier than a Champions League qualifier finishing 16th even though that is already very funny indeed.",
      "",
      "Crystal Palace’s maiden half-century\nSome might argue that Crystal Palace have already achieved the biggest thing they’ll do this season having won the FA Cup and thus the first major title of their entire history. To that we say tish and fipsy because that will pale into rank insignificance if they can secure a 50th point for the first time ever in any Premier League season.",
      "They are currently on 49 points with two games to go, the second of which is now set to be a rare old occasion at Anfield in which everyone is just having a big old party as Liverpool collect their Premier League trophy and Palace revel in their new-found status as trophy winners.",
      "It’s one of the games we’re most looking forward to on the final day purely because such a vibe is so rare in your toxic, tribal, online modern football warfare. A game where everyone in the stadium will just be having a lovely old time celebrating a successful season. ‘Snice.",
      "We’re thinking double guards of honour. We’re thinking both teams cavorting about with their trophies. We’re thinking everyone celebrating a late Eberechi Eze equaliser that takes Palace to the promised land of 50 points. We want to go to there.",
      "",
      "The sacrificial play-off winner\nWe did genuinely almost forget this one, which is slightly embarrassing but also revealing of how the land now lies for teams promoted from the Championship.",
      "But in terms of formalising things we don’t yet know about this season, we do need to stop and consider that we don’t yet in fact know the full line-up for next season’s Premier League until it is confirmed which poor sods are setting themselves up for a season of Derby-bothering ritual humiliation.",
      "It’s going to be Sheffield United or Sunderland, so it’s going to be a big club that in days gone by you would absolutely think had every chance of giving survival a red-hot crack. Now you assume they’re doomed unless they decide to just break all the rules and accept a points penalty in their second season is probably worth the risk if they’ve already managed to stay up at the expense of, oh, let’s say, West Ham.",
      "More likely, though: the winner of Football’s Richest Game instead condemns themselves to a season of being patronised very nearly as much as we’ve just done here while desperately scrambling to cobble 20 points together before dropping back down to the second tier to try and do it all again."

      "* It’s weird, really. The more you allow yourself to dream that it might happen, the less likely it seems that it will actually happen. So you start playing down your chances, but the more you talk up your opposition the more you wonder if maybe, just maybe, there’s a chance.",
      "* As with their previous trip to the FA Cup Final, Crystal Palace were led by a very self-confident manager. The difference is that this time, when Oliver Glasner reacted to losing 5-2 to Manchester City by telling Pep Guardiola that if he used that system again, he would get beaten, you believed him.",
      "Taking Palace to the FA Cup Final and high self-confidence are where the comparisons between Glasner and one of his predecessors, Alan Pardew, begin and end. It was nice to see that Palace had invited some former managers along to Wembley: we’re all a bit better for seeing Steve Coppell, Alan Smith and Roy Hodgson on good form, and in its own way, it was telling that there was no sign of Pardew.",
      "* The other big difference between 2016 and 2025 was Palace’s form heading into the game. In 2016, between their win in the third round and defeat in the final, they took just 11 points (two wins, five draws) from 19 games – half a season! In hindsight it’s clear to see Pardew spent the day before the game negotiating a new contract, protecting himself from a justifiable sacking, instead of focussing on the most important matter.",
      "In contrast, Glasner’s 2025 side played 16 league games between the third round and the final, taking 28 points (eight wins, four draws) in that time. Just as well they had a terrible start to the season to give everyone else a chance because 1.75 points per game over the course of an entire season would put them in the European places.",
      "* This year’s Final did not take very long to establish its pattern: Manchester City dominating possession, Crystal Palace camped on the edge of their own penalty area. City had an early chance but couldn’t take it, and then the moment of magic happened. Palace gained possession and scored what has been one of their trademark goals this season. A long ball from Chris Richards on the byline found Jean-Philippe Mateta, who held the ball up on half way and exchanged passes with a midfielder (in this case Daichi Kamada) and released Daniel Muñoz down the right, where he crossed for Eberechi Eze to fire home following a Frank Lampard-esque late run.",
      "* It’s been a comparatively tough season for City, and at times Guardiola has looked a little exposed. City’s struggles for form were attributed to Rodri’s absence, and while any team would miss a player that good and that important to their system, it wasn’t the best look for Guardiola’s standing as a tactical mastermind that he had neither an alternative to Rodri in that role, nor an alternative system to compensate for their absent star. On Saturday, they huffed and puffed but largely played in the same pattern for the entire game, and paid the price for their predictability.",
      "The hardest part to understand is why, knowing how dangerous Palace are down their right, City still insisted on moving their left-back into the midfield, giving Muñoz lots of space behind to run into. What were we saying earlier about managers coming undone by overconfidence?",
      "* One time they did try something a bit different led to the most controversial moment of the game. A long ball over the top saw Erling Haaland one on one with Dean Henderson, and the Palace keeper appeared to handle the ball outside his area. I don’t think it was a red card offence, despite the doublespeak of virtually every pundit asked about it (“Haaland hasn’t scored in five games at Wembley/of course it’s a goal scoring opportunity, it’s Haaland”), because there are two levels of mitigation. First, there is a defender racing back towards the goal who can get into position to make a block while Haaland is going round Henderson. Second, Henderson’s feet are well inside his area when he reaches across the line and handles the ball – in no way was it a cynical play but it was a breach of the rules. Had the officials decide to show Henderson a yellow card in real time and award City a free kick, I don’t think there would have been many complaints from either side.",
      "* That said, reducing Palace to 10 men would not have changed the game much, because they would have still been camped on the edge of their area. And while we’re dealing with hypotheticals, there was more than a suspicion of evening up about the penalty awarded to City. The ball was running out of play, Tyrick Mitchell appeared to get a toe on it and Bernardo Silva was clearly looking for contact, but nonetheless, a penalty was awarded and then saved.",
      "Haaland held the ball while the referee was sorting out the other players, before handing it over to Omar Marmoush to take the kick. This is something that teams do so that any mind games or abuse are absorbed by a fall guy rather than the taker, and yet, not a single Palace player went anywhere near either of the City forwards. Once again, City didn’t adapt their scripted plan to what the opposition were doing, and suffered for it. It wasn’t a particularly great penalty, but Henderson made a superb double save from it and the rebound, for the sort of moment where Palace fans dare to start believing.",
      "* The penalty itself was one of seven fouls committed all game by Glasner’s team, the same number as City conceded, but it’s a testament to the Palace team’s discipline that the only yellow card any of them collected was when Henderson was cautioned for time wasting in stoppage time. In contrast, City’s frustrations got the better of them when they picked up five yellow cards. Defending that intensely for that long is incredibly tough, but to a man they performed their job admirably, it was a masterclass in how to protect a lead.",
      "* The oldest person in the world will turn 116 years old this year. They were born four years after Crystal Palace were formed and, like us, just witnessed them winning a major trophy for the first time. All the generations of Palace fans who lived and died without seeing this, all those gone too soon. This is for them as much as it is for us. There is a deep connection between club and community, the players know how much it all means to the fans, and the fans celebrate each other. The tifo before the game, of the two boys and their father (who subsequently passed away) celebrating Darren Ambrose’s goal against Manchester United in 2009, a beautiful image summing up just how much it all means.",

In no way am I comparing the status of winning the two, but just the pressure on a team to win. A Europa win is the difference between getting a Gyokeres or Mateta, 100 million or 0 million, back in the elite or a has-been club. It’s as do or die as it can be, and honestly, I don’t see us winning it.",

We are unable to score, unable to defend & unable to pass the ball. In all likelihood, this will be a one sided Spurs trashing. Unless Spurs forget to show up, I cannot see any way United win this. I am hoping & praying that we somehow get our sh*t together, but every match I watch makes it more painfully obvious that we are nowhere near the elite level. But winning the Europa changes everything. it would be close to a 3 year leap we take in our growth. It’s the biggest and best shortcut we have, it’s a jackpot, an undeserved jackpot. Here is to hoping against all logic that United & Amorim can pull off a masterclass in the finals.",
      "On the other hand, I am glad the opponents are Spurs. If there is one team I don’t mind winning this trophy, it’s poor Spurs. They really need to win something in life, and this could be a good booster for them and also cement their place as the 2nd biggest London club AFTER Crystal Palace for the 24/25 season only.

      "However, sacking ANOTHER manager will not magically wave away the club’s fundamental issues. It certainly won’t patch up the financial issues that have arisen from years of poor transfer and wage decisions, which led to hundreds of redundancies from arguably the last set of employees who deserve to be let go. It definitely won’t create the atmosphere of clarity you suggest it will, a new set of ideas, a new range of tactics, and so on.",
      "The “good player” trap is one that many United fans and people working in the media either keep falling for or ignore the true context of the situation to push a narrative. Antony and Rashford always showed potential to perform at the levels they have after leaving on loan, but how often did they show that level before leaving? Yes, anyone would probably present an upgrade to Hojlund at this moment, but the team underperformed with them there, and sometimes their body language made it seem like it was everyone’s fault but theirs.",

We need to take a deep breath, allow the current manager to sign at least 5 players and see what the performances and results are like then.",

      "It was Verbruggen’s awful pass that gifted Alex Iwobi the opening goal on a chilly Thursday night in December; Igor Julio’s pass back to the Dutchman was terrible, but Verbruggen still had plenty of time to play a risky – but much less risky – pass back to Igor or simply launch it up the pitch and out of harm’s way. Instead, he tried to be cute and failed to find Carlos Baleba – and even if he had, the Brighton midfielder was completely swarmed.",
      "Every team wants to play out from the back these days, and that’s absolutely fine (and not woke), but come on – sometimes you just need to get the ball away from your goal. When in doubt, kick it out.",

      "In one of only five 10/10s on WhoScored this season, Cole Palmer smashed four past the Netherlands No. 1 in the first half of Chelsea’s convincing win over Fabian Hurzeler’s Brighton.",
      "If Robert Sanchez’s performance (4.86 rating) was shocking, then Verbruggen’s was…well, something far worse. Yes, Palmer was outstanding, but he’ll forever be thankful for the opposition goalkeeper’s generosity on the day he became the first Premier League player to score four times in the first half of a match.",
      "",
      "8) Harry Clarke (Brentford 4-3 Ipswich) – 4.50\nOn his first ever Premier League start, no less, Harry Clarke put in a performance Jonathan Woodgate would have been proud of. The Arsenal academy graduate was given the nod at right-back up against Keane Lewis-Potter and ended up conceding a penalty four minutes into the second half, getting booked in the process, and then being sent off for a second yellow card in the 69th minute.",
      "He started three more times between that October defeat and his January departure for Sheffield United. He’s only on loan at Bramall Lane, and the fact he has six appearances, just 473 minutes played, and three yellow cards for the third-best team in the Championship probably hammers home the fact that he’s not quite Premier League level.",

      "He committed an error leading to a goal, made four fouls, picked up a yellow card, conceded four goals, misplaced five passes, lost five of six duels, lost possession six times and won it only once, and made zero interceptions, clearances, or tackles. Newcastle were brilliant and ruthless, but Hughes and Palace were weirdly toothless.",

      "Well…we’re not entirely convinced that was even his objective. Brighton’s second came after Onana decided to retreat rather than deal with a cross he should’ve at least punched clear.

We’re still not sure how. Chris Wood’s strike to make it 3-1 didn’t officially go down as an error, but it really should have. It was a collective mess at the back post with Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez, and Onana all looking like deer caught in the headlights.",

      "Away to West Ham, Leno clearly had some sympathy for the opposition and did his best to give them their first win under Graham Potter. Carlos Soler’s opener came from a calamitous pass by Andreas Pereira, but we all know Leno shouldn’t have given him the ball under such a high press. Go long, man!",
      "The German should’ve done better with Tomas Soucek’s goal to make it 2-0, and for the third… just wow. Caught lacking, Danny Ings’ press proved too much and his blocked pass fell straight to Lucas Paqueta. Leno knew he’d messed up, too. His half-hearted arm flap was more telling than his facial expression.",

      "In the battle of the two bald Dutchmen, Liverpool boss Arne Slot comfortably beat Erik ten Hag, who would soon lose his job. Slot had some Casemiro mishaps to thank for the emphatic victory, with the Real Madrid legend earning the worst match rating for an outfielder this season.",

      "He attempted an eye-of-the-needle pass for Liverpool’s opener, only for Ryan Gravenberch to intercept and lay it off to Mohamed Salah, who found Luis Díiz at the back post. For the Reds’ second, Casemiro had his pocket picked by Diaz, and a quick transition ended with the Colombian sweeping home past Onana.",
      "Clearly giving up, Casemiro sat on his knees and watched Liverpool storm forward for a solid three seconds before getting up and trotting back. He should’ve taken Jamie Carragher’s advice and just ‘left the football’.",
      "",
      "2) Bart Verbruggen (Nottingham Forest 7-0 Brighton) – 3.95\nThis surely marked the final straw for Fabian Hurzeler, who may well have dished out a Homer-style “Why you little…” strangle after the eldest Simpson child’s namesake turned in a third disastrous performance of the season – on his 22nd Premier League appearance of 2024/25.",
      "Conceding seven will obviously obliterate a goalkeeper’s match rating, but the cherry was plopped on top of the cake of sh*t when Verbruggen passed the ball straight to Jota Silva and was promptly nutmegged by the shot to seal a tight and nervy 7-0 win for Nuno Espirito Santo’s men.",
      "",
      "1) Arijanet Muric (Man City 4-1 Ipswich) – 3.29\nThe worst rating ever dished out to a Premier League player – Arijanet Muric had an absolute mare against his former club on matchday two.",
      "After finishing the previous season relatively well in goal for Burnley, Muric was snapped up by Ipswich to be their new No.1. He missed the opening match against Liverpool, but Kieran McKenna brought him in for the trip to the Etihad – and what followed was a complete disaster.",
      "Two errors leading to goals, zero saves, four goals conceded, 10 misplaced passes, and 11 instances of lost possession…that’s apparently what it takes to earn the worst Premier League match rating of all time, if you were wondering.",

      "It promises to be a carnival atmosphere, and you’d hope that only fuels the fire for Oliver Glasner’s side to put on a show for a fanbase still floating somewhere above south London. With European football already secured, and the pressure off, Palace can play with complete freedom – and that’s a terrifying prospect for any opponent.",
      "Wolves have nothing left to play for beyond the moral victory of finishing above Manchester United and Spurs – which, let’s be honest, would be a laugh but hardly season-defining. They’ve also lost two on the bounce without scoring, and this might not be the occasion to turn things around.",
      "Momentum has the potential to be everything and Palace are absolutely riding the wave",
      "",
      "Manager to watch: Pep Guardiola\nSo, Pep Guardiola overthought another final. Of course he did. As a result, Manchester City have finished FA Cup runners-up two years in a row. Now that a trophyless season is confirmed, attention turns back to the Premier League – where City have a big job to do.",
      "Bournemouth come to the Etihad to face what you’d assume will be a motivated City side, hell-bent on righting their Wembley wrongs with an emphatic performance. A win would at least help secure Champions League qualification, which is still not a done deal.",
      "On the same weekend they lost to Crystal Palace, all of their top-five rivals – except Newcastle United – won. And it was Arsenal who beat them, ensuring City now need a miraculous goal swing and for the Gunners to lose to actual Southampton on the final day to sneak second place.",
      "That particular target – and the hilarious prospect of Arsenal finishing third in a two-horse race behind City again – can be forgotten. The focus for Guardiola now is to get a reaction.",
      "Expect changes. To what extent, who knows? Matheus Nunes at right-back wouldn’t be a surprise. Ilkay Gundogan or Nico Gonzalez could come in to add some midfield steel, and Kevin De Bruyne will surely keep his place after being the only City player to show up at Wembley.",
      "Guardiola looked rattled after being out-tacticed by Oliver Glasner, though he did take time to congratulate Palace on their first major trophy in 119 years. But a Dean Henderson masterclass, plus a slice of luck, clearly p**sed Pep off – and honestly, who could blame him after the Palace goalkeeper got away with a red card?",
      "That’s history now. The only priority is preparing his side for a must-win game. Fail to beat Bournemouth, and suddenly that final-day trip to Fulham starts to look a lot more sticky.",
      "",
      "Player to watch: Heung-min Son\nSeveral Spurs players have the chance to win their first major trophy on Wednesday – and Heung-min Son is one of them. That might come as a surprise, considering his world-class ability over much of the last decade, but it makes perfect sense: he’s spent 11 years at Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "And no, we’re not counting the Asian Games he won with South Korea’s Under-23s at the age of 26. He got military exemption for that – and that’s plenty, Clive.",
      "It’s remarkable that a player of Son’s calibre has won diddly squat in his club career, and even more so that he’s stayed at Spurs for so long. But a win against Manchester United would make that loyalty worth it.",
      "Son needs this – to justify his decision to stay, and to give his CV something it badly lacks. But right now, Spurs need him more than ever. In a season full of underwhelming performances, Postecoglou is without his two main playmakers in Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison, meaning much of the creative burden now falls on the South Korean.",
      "It’s been a disappointing campaign for both player and club – but there’s hope that Son’s superstar quality could finally shine through to deliver Spurs’ first major trophy since 2008.",
      "READ NEXT: Premier League winners and losers: Everton, West Ham, Vardy, Newcastle without Isak, Arsenal…",
      "Premier League side Man City have set their summer transfer budget as they prepare to ‘sacrifice’ one of their players, according to reports.",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank the top-flight stoppers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 15 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves or Southampton.",
      "",
      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.5\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remained in sniffing distance of a European place. He remains an excellent signing by the Cherries on loan.",
      "",
      "",
      "4) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 74.2% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, leaving him level with David Raya for the Golden Gloves award.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.7\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with three clean sheets in his last five games. And then he was brilliant in the FA Cup final.",
      "",
      "6) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.3\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "7) Alisson (Liverpool): +2.2\nPulled himself into the black in recent weeks as Liverpool have been tested a little more. Remarkably, he made nine saves v Brighton as a sloppy Liverpool lost 3-2.",
      "",
      "8) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +1.7\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich but was then excellent in a crucial win over Chelsea.",
      "",
      "9) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "10) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",
      "",
      "11) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.0\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled. Not at fault as Man Utd lost to Chelsea before the Europa League final.",
      "",
      "12) David Raya (Arsenal): +0.9\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted. But he under-conceded v Liverpool and made five saves in the 1-0 win over Newcastle to draw him level with Sels for the Golden Gloves.",
      "",
      "13) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +0.1\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",
      "",
      "14) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): +0.1\nThree consecutive clean sheets when it matters have rescued a below-par season for the Argentine.",
      "",
      "15) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",
      "16) Aaron Ramsdale (Southampton): -1.8\nWas supposed to make a big difference to Southampton; has apparently not made a big difference to Southampton.",
      "",
      "17) Alphonse Areola (West Ham): -2.6\nWest Ham are now so bad that Areola remarkably under-conceded in the 3-2 defeat to Brighton.",
      "",
      "18) Bernd Leno (Fulham): -3.5\nA really poor season compared to his usual standards. Only Liverpool and Arsenal should actually have conceded more than Fulham this season.",
      "",
      "19) Jose Sa (Wolves): -4.1\nSaved a penalty v Leicester City to keep his seventh clean sheet of the season.",

      "Spurs' poor Premier League campaign, which has seen them slump to 17th place on 38 points, having lost a club-record 21 games, has led to suggestions that he could leave even if he guides them to their first trophy in 17 years in the Europa League.",
      "But Postecoglou insisted his future is not a distraction and urged his team to seize their chance to make history by winning a trophy which would also earn Spurs a Champions League spot.",
      "\"I'll tell you one thing, irrespective of tomorrow, I'm not a clown and I never will be, mate,\" he told a reporter in reference to the article relating to his Spurs legacy.",

      "Postecoglou said the injured Lucas Bergvall is not available to play against Manchester United despite having travelled with the squad to Bilbao. Pape Sarr is fit, however, despite having been taken off with back pain during Friday's 2-0 loss to Aston Villa.\n\n\nJames Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also missing due to injury but like Bergvall, have travelled with the squad to Bilbao to support their team-mates.",

      "Manchester United have been given a boost with Diogo Dalot, Joshua Zirkzee and Leny Yoro all available to feature having recovered from injury.\n\n\n\"They recovered quite well,\" said Amorim. \"Of course, we respect the feelings of the players, but we pushed a little bit because they wanted to part of the team and that is a very good sign.\n\n\n\"They are limited in the minutes for the game, but they can help us to win the game.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of things we need to change in our club; the way we do everything in the week at Carrington, the recruitment, the academy. I think we need to improve.",
      "\"It's hard to point at one thing and that will not be solved by winning a cup.",
      "\"We have bigger things to deal with to put this club back to the top. Tomorrow will be important for us, for our fans. That feeling of winning can help us have strength to do every job we have to do.",
      "\"But nothing is going to change our season. We have a lot to do at our club, not just winning tomorrow. But winning a European title can help us to have that feeling that can help us to build the future.\"",
      "Defender Harry Maguire insisted Manchester United have shown their quality in the Europa League, despite their domestic struggles.",
      "\"When you play for this club, you want to win every football match and this season we've been far too inconsistent, we haven't won enough in the Premier League. It's not been good enough, we know that.",
      "\"The Europa League has been different. We've performed at a high level and we have proven again this season we can beat anybody.",
      "\"I'm sure, next season, we will improve an awful amount, with a full pre-season and, as players, we're all looking forward to that, but we've got a big game tomorrow night, first and foremost.",
      "\"It's a special night, a special occasion. We've prepared well and it's one we're looking forward to.\"",
      "Maguire has earned plaudits for some of his attacking contributions during United's run to the final, including scoring the winner in their comeback win over Lyon in the quarters, but hopes he won't be needed up front on Wednesday night.",
      "\"The manager has me dribbling every day in training, running up and down the wing,\" he joked.",
      "\"I found myself on the wing against Bilbao, managed to put a good cross in and Casemiro scored the goal.",
      "\"I've gone up front in the later minutes of games; hopefully tomorrow night I'm not going up front.",
      "\"I don't want to go up front chasing a game, I want to be defending a lead from my position in defence.",
      "\"I'm always there to help, always there to do my best, but I'm more than happy playing in my favoured position.\""

      "\"Every game has its history…\"",
      "Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim said these words when asked about the prospect of playing Tottenham in the Europa League final - a team that has beaten the Red Devils three times already this season.",
      "But the question is, will their recent history matter when it comes to who wins the trophy - and that crucial Champions League place?",
      "Perhaps the performance Spurs will take the most encouragement from is their first of the season against United, an utterly dominant 3-0 win at Old Trafford in September to put even more pressure on United's former manager Erik ten Hag.",
      "The game is evidence of why Ange Postecoglou is wrapping Micky van de Ven in cotton wool ahead of the final.",
      "Van de Ven was not just defensively impressive in this game, as he typically is, he also carried the ball over half the length of the Old Trafford pitch to set up Brennan Johnson for their opening goal in the third minute.",
      "The game then was seemingly over at the end of the first half when Bruno Fernandes was sent off - a red card that was later overturned through appeal.",
      "But this is a different United side. Although you cannot suggest their position in the Premier League of 16th is evidence they have moved forward under Ruben Amorim, they do look better defensively, they concede fewer chances, and have shown in these big European nights that they can be a threat going forward, more so anyway, then under Ten Hag.",
      "The second time these two sides met was in the Carabao Cup quarter finals in December - a fun encounter that Postecoglou's Spurs won once again, this time 4-3, with Amorim having taken over from Ten Hag.",
      "But when you look at lessons both sides could take to the final, it is challenging when you consider the context around it.",
      "First of all you look at the make-up of both sides. Spurs had Archie Gray and Radu Dragusin making up their centre-back partnership, with Fraser Forster in goal. Spurs' main three at the back of goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario and defenders Van de Ven and Cristian Romero were all injured.",
      "For United, again, a side that will be much changed for the final with Altay Bayindir starting in goal, Lisandro Martinez, who is out for the remainder of the season, as well as Antony, who is now starring for Real Betis in Spain, also featured.",
      "On this occasion, although Spurs were injury-hit and did well to progress, Amorim also took a calculated risk to heavily rotate many of his first-team players. It did not work out as they lost their next three games in the Premier League as well.",
      "February was the last time these two sides met and Spurs won 1-0 but I don't think Amorim will look back at this game too closely.",
      "That's partly because the goal United conceded was a poor one. Andre Onana should have done much better to palm away a Lucas Bergvall shot, which ended up leaving James Maddison with a comfortable finish right in front of goal.",
      "Amorim had very limited opportunities to change the game when you look at the squad he had to pick from at that moment. It was an injury-ravaged United side. Victor Lindelof was the only substitute who had any sort of Premier League experience.",
      "Spurs had injuries too, with Kevin Danso and Ben Davies their centre-back pairing, two players who again are not likely to start in the final, while Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski also started but will play no part on Wednesday due to injury.",
      "Not much, really!",
      "Spurs will take confidence despite the circumstances. When they have taken on Untied this season, they have been able to pull out performances and perhaps more importantly, results.",
      "Dominic Solanke has three goals in three meetings against United too, which may give him that extra edge against their opponents in the final.",
      "Asked about facing a side who have beaten United three times, Amorim said: \"If you look at the odds, we are closer to winning than losing. Both teams will play like all or nothing.\"",
      "Those last three words perfectly describe Manchester United in Europe this season: all or nothing.",
      "United looked like they'd be out of the competition when they were 4-2 down at Old Trafford against Lyon in the quarter-finals but they miraculously came back.",
      "In the semi-finals, as I travelled to Bilbao for their tie against Athletic Club, most pundits and fans alike would have thought a draw away to a team who had lost just once in LaLiga since August at home would have been sufficient",
      "Man Utd won 3-0 in San Mames and 7-1 on aggregate.",
      "We also have to consider the tactical tweaks Amorim has made since the two sides last met in February.",
      "In the most important games, he has now settled on a midfield duo of Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.",
      "The Brazilian especially has become revitalised under Amorim in recent months.",
      "Amorim told me this has been mainly down to Casemiro working on his own fitness as well as the United boss tweaking the way they press, more so with their wing-backs going high, enabling Casemiro to stay in front of the defence and not be caught out on transition.",
      "Amorim and the players have spoken about how the physicality levels of European opponents are more suited to the players, which does pose the question of how they will deal with a physical Spurs side who will look to impose themselves as they have done in this season's previous meetings.",
      "But United have been illogical and unpredictable when it comes to the Europa League this season. When you consider all of the circumstances of their previous meetings with Spurs, it is clear that they won't have much relevance.",
      "Wednesday's game is a different proposition for both sides."

      "Matheus Cunha is set to join Manchester United after the season ends this weekend.",
      "United are expected to trigger the £62.5m release clause in his contract.",
      "The club are aware of the conditions for that clause to be met.",
      "There has been no direct contact yet between United and Wolves but those formalities are anticipated once the season has closed.",
      "Cunha thinks United are one of the biggest clubs in the world and their current Premier League position - they are currently currently two places beneath Wolves in 16th - would not put him off a potential move to Old Trafford.",
      "Five Premier League clubs, including United, wanted to sign Cunha this summer.",
      "Arsenal and Aston Villa were among the clubs that have held exploratory talks about signing the Brazil international this year. Saudi Pro League clubs were also now willing to trigger his release clause.",
      "The forward, signed from Atletico Madrid in 2022 for a fee of around £34m, has registered 27 goals and 13 assists in 63 Premier League games.",
      "\"Man Utd are desperate in that position. You think of what Manchester United are playing now, they've let Jadon Sancho go, they've let (Marcus) Rashford go, they've let Antony go, so three players who are natural players who travel with the ball.",
      "\"They're playing with (Alejandro) Garnacho at the moment but then they're lopsided. On the other side, sometimes it's (Joshua) Zirkzee when he was fit, or they've got Bruno Fernandes stepping up in moments. Mason Mount's come in there but they need someone who can beat players, they need someone who's equally as good running through the middle with the ball and travelling with the ball, and go out wide and support the wing-back.",
      "\"So he's a type of player that you could see Manchester United being interested in, that would suit this system that Ruben Amorim wants to play.",
      "\"They've lost three players who play in that type of position so they need to fulfil that, they'll need to fill those roles definitely or else they're going to struggle.",
      "\"They need to score goals. Ruben Amorim said at the weekend we're just struggling to score goals, so you need players who can take risks, good in the final third, and Cunha's got a lot of ability.\"",
      "On concerns about Cunha's character: \"No. To be honest, I quite like [it]. If I were playing against him, I wouldn't like a player with a bit of spirit and a bit of fight.",
      "\"I used to play with some unbelievable players, some of the very best in the world at their time, and they had the right spike to them - you think about Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Eric Cantona and Mark Hughes and how tough and sometimes spirited they were in games.",
      "\"Sometimes they did the unpredictable, sometimes they lost their discipline, but they were amazing players. At the time that they get sent off, they know they've let the team down, but what they give you in return is something special and I love a player with character.\"",
      "Speaking to Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about the recent Manchester derby being \"boring\" and the subsequent reports linking United with a move for the Brazilian forward, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer targets of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level, Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already plays there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £64m release fee offers clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turns 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure."

      "Tuesday 20 May 2025 12:07, UK",
      "Our betting expert Jones Knows previews the Europa League final and outlines where the value lies as Spurs and Manchester United look to save their seasons.",
      "This is a beautifully grotesque final. Both teams are balancing on the highwire with no safety net below them.",
      "We can get carried away with overdramatising the outcomes of football matches but this one truly is huge, especially for Tottenham, who have one game to decide whether it's been their best or worst season for many years. It's a ridiculous situation, really.",
      "Manchester United are slight favourites with Sky Bet at 4/5 to lift the trophy with Spurs at 10/11. The 90-minute odds have United at 7/4 and Spurs at 29/20.",
      "It's a 50-50 spin of the Roulette wheel. White or red. Heads or tails.",
      "I'm very confused about this game from a betting perspective.",
      "These two teams have been completely different in the Europa League compared to their Premier League form. And usually you'd put more weight in the domestic form to gauge a true ability of a team, especially in this spot as this is an all-Premier League final. But I'm very torn.",
      "United can't score in the Premier League, averaging just 1.14 goals per 90 minutes and have scored just five goals in their last eight games. But look at their Europa League form.",
      "They have averaged 2.5 goals per game this season, scoring a whopping 19 goals in their six games with Real Sociedad, Lyon and Athletic Club in the knockouts.",
      "And then we have Spurs, who are equally as confusing to analyse. As they are a completely different team to their overall form of this Premier League season when their first-choice back five plays under Ange Postecoglou. The difference is simply huge.",
      "When Guglielmo Vicario, Pedro Porro, Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero and Destiny Udogie all play under Postecoglou, they have won 18 of those 30 games, losing just six times.",
      "If you were converting that to points per game - that's two per game. If you translate that over the course of a Premier League season of 38 games, you get 76 points, which would be enough to finish a clear second in the Premier League this season. There is a really good side lurking there.",
      "It's a game where backing teams both not to win is actually quite attractive, so the draw in 90 minutes at 23/10 with Sky Bet is the way to play the outright market.",
      "Three of the last four Europa League finals have ended in a stalemate. It's a result which is always a runner in finals of this nature where two big clubs meet with lots on the line.",
      "Much better opportunities are found in the props market for Wednesday's clash in Bilbao, notably in the fouls markets.",
      "The Europa League final has a rich tradition of being a foul-heavy occasion - it makes sense with such riches on the line.",
      "The last 15 Europa League finals have averaged 31.2 fouls per 90 minutes.",
      "That's a huge number.",
      "For context, Premier League matches have averaged 22.5 fouls per 90 this season, so the added jeopardy of a final using those numbers, there could be almost 10 more fouls in this type of game that a run-of-the-mill Premier League game. And when you throw in so much being on the line for these clubs and how evenly matched they are in the betting, I think this game could be very foul-heavy and potentially go way above the number the market is expecting.",
      "Sky Bet has the line set at 24+ match fouls at 5/6 which looks a great starting point for those looking to exploit these total fouls angles. I'd advise laddering the prices on offer with Sky Bet right up to the 10/1 on offer for 32+ match fouls, which has a chance of landing based on the historic averages.",
      "And it's worth noting that Spurs are a foul-heavy team under Postecoglou - he likes to play expansive and man-for-man which creates lots of one-on-one situations in space that therefore lend itself to fouls being made. Since he was appointed, no team in the Premier League has seen more fouls in their matches than Tottenham - that average is 24.5 fouls per 90 over a 75-game sample size in the Premier League.",
      "On the biggest stage, with so much on the line, I'd expect this Spurs game to hit those foul averages so those odds look very generous to me."

      "Monday 19 May 2025 08:42, UK",
      "Crueller observers might speculate that 'tough to watch' is a fitting preview of the forthcoming final between two of Berbatov's former clubs, Manchester United and Tottenham. Both have endured particularly miserable Premier League seasons.",
      "Incredibly, since the two teams met in London in mid-February, neither has managed to beat an opponent that will be competing in next season's Premier League - their only victories coming against the relegated trio. In Bilbao, it will be 16th against 17th.",
      "\"Some will say maybe it is not fair when one of them wins and goes to the Champions because they did not earn it or qualify in the proper way. But it is what it is and it is going to be an interesting game now because their backs are against the wall,\" says Berbatov.",
      "\"Finals are about concentration, about not making silly mistakes, because you could be punished and there is no rematch. Maybe we will be surprised and it will be an open game but I expect caution, nobody wanting to take risks. Their seasons are on the line.",
      "\"The only thing that can justify either season now is lifting that trophy. Who needs it more? That is the question. United have been going backwards while others gone forwards. Spurs have not won a trophy in 17 years. So in a way, both managers need it.",
      "\"Ange Postecoglou, he can say, 'I told you, I always win something in my second season. Now shut up.' Or Ruben Amorim can say, 'Trust me, this is the system that we are going to play and now we can build for United's next season with that trophy'.\"",
      "It was Berbatov himself who scored the goal when Tottenham won the 2008 League Cup final - their last piece of silverware. They came from behind that day at Wembley to beat a strong Chelsea side. \"We were the underdogs, we had nothing to lose,\" he remembers.",
      "\"That was the Chelsea of Didier Drogba, John Terry, Frank Lampard and Petr Cech, some great players. But we knew that we would have our chances to score because we scored a lot of goals, that team, especially up front with me and Keano (Robbie Keane).",
      "\"Everybody expected Chelsea to win. Drogba scored a great free-kick but we kept going.\" Berbatov equalised from the penalty spot and Jonathan Woodgate won the cup in extra-time. \"Sometimes that is all you need, a penalty or a corner kick or whatever.\"",
      "Berbatov has had his own frustrations in finals, of course. In the 2002 Champions League final, his Bayer Leverkusen team were edged out by Real Madrid's superstars in an even game at Hampden Park. A moment of magic from Zinedine Zidane decided it.",
      "\"It was probably the greatest ever goal in a Champions League final. There was nothing you could do. The ball just landed at the feet of the one player you do not want the ball to land to. In football, sometimes even your best is not good enough. It is a cruel game.\"",
      "It was cruel in 2011 too. Despite being the joint-top scorer in the Premier League that season, sharing the Golden Boot with Carlos Tevez, Berbatov was surprisingly omitted not just from the United team for the Champions League final but the entire squad.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson has since apologised for the move - he started Javier Hernandez, with Michael Owen preferred on the bench. Does Berbatov understand the call yet? \"Not personally but Sir Alex obviously admitted that he probably made a mistake,\" he says.",
      "\"My confidence was sky high. You are king of the world or that is how I felt. In every game, you think you are going to score. But even if I did play, I do not know if it would have made any difference because at that time Barcelona had prime Lionel Messi!\"",
      "Berbatov left United for Fulham at the end of the following season, with Ferguson calling time on his long reign at Old Trafford just one year after that. The Scottish legend bowed out with yet another Premier League title but United have been in decline ever since.",
      "\"United remain massive around the world, but it is a long time since that last Premier League and that way of thinking, that mentality of going to win every game, it has faded away,\" says Berbatov, speaking in his role as a LiveScore European brand ambassador.",
      "\"United have been struggling for years and that is painful, of course. Everybody knows that - the fans, the management, the coaches and the players as well. That is why this game is so important, so they can say, 'Look, we are struggling but we still won a trophy'.",
      "\"In the past few years, it has always been about how next season is going to be ours - and the next season. Again, we are in that position where next season, let us hope that the new manager can do it. As cliched as it sounds, you always have to keep the faith.",
      "\"Keep that faith and hope Ruben, with a pre-season behind him, will not start over, but maybe bring in the players he wants because he is not going to change, he loves that system. So you need players specifically to fit that system and hope the results come.\"",
      "Is there a suspicion that United just seem to find a way? Berbatov talks of them having \"a DNA that they need to win trophies\" while Spurs' wait goes on. But he is conflicted. \"I do not think it is that Spurs do not have belief. It is a tough question to answer,\" he says.",
      "\"On the one hand, there is the DNA of the club, the history, everything you have won before, and you know that the expectation from everybody is that you will win in the end. On the other hand, maybe if you are not expected to win then there is nothing to lose.",
      "\"Sometimes football can be a cruel game and there is just no explanation for it. You just go out there with your best intentions, you are fully concentrated, you are all ready to go, all your first-team players are ready and they play and then it just does not happen.\"",
      "Either way, Berbatov will be watching. Just do not ask him who he wants to win. \"I will sympathise with the loser because I have been there, winning finals and losing finals. Football will remind me again that there is so much joy but so much pain as well.\"",

      "When he left Botafogo in 2023, the Brazilian club were seven points clear at the top of the table and he finished that calendar year as the coach with the most wins in world football over the past 12 months - there were 51 of them, four clear of Pep Guardiola.",
      "All of which is a rather long-winded way of saying that, for all this, Castro knows by now the first question that is coming his way. That is because his most recent appointment was in Saudi Arabia with Al Nassr. So, what exactly is it like coaching Cristiano Ronaldo?",
      "Al Nassr won the Arab Club Champions Cup under Castro, the victory coming after extra-time courtesy of two goals by you know who. In total, Ronaldo scored 55 goals in 55 games under his management. \"We shared some great moments together.\"",
      "Does Castro have any special insight into how it is that Ronaldo continues to pummel goals for club and country even after turning 40? \"What set his apart is what happens before and after training - the so called 'invisible training' that he does,\" he explains.",
      "\"His behavior is all tailored towards sports performance - his diet, his sleep, and his recovery. He is a person deeply concerned with eating well, sleeping well and preparing his body properly. In my opinion, this is clearly where Cristiano's longevity comes from.\"",
      "Did it inspire others? \"Of course,\" he replies. \"Every positive example helps us grow. Our parents, our friends.\" Did he learn from Ronaldo as well? \"Coaches learn from players. Anyone who thinks they know everything becomes stuck. It is a very limiting mindset.\"",
      "Given that Erik ten Hag saw no role for Ronaldo at Manchester United, in part because of the player's inability or unwillingness to press from the front, one wonders what exactly he makes of that decision. \"We look at each player and we adjust things,\" he explains.",
      "\"We adjust according to their identity. That is exactly what I do - with Cristiano and with everyone else. That is my duty as a leader, as a coach. Our job means we have to look at the group of players and get the most out of them as a team. I have no doubt about that.",
      "\"That is why we need to find a system that enhances the players that we have. I cannot stick rigidly to a tactical system and refuse to change. I cannot just go to the end with my idea, no matter what, because that would lead to failure and disaster.\"",
      "It is interesting to hear a coach of such experience talk about the need to adapt his ideas. At the age of 63, Castro is still making those adjustments - because the game demands it. \"Football has evolved and not only the tactical systems,\" he acknowledges.",
      "\"Science has become intertwined with the game. The media are much more active. Player representation has changed. Coaching staffs have increased significantly in number and their areas of expertise. We all have to adapt to match this evolution.",
      "\"The intensity has increased, which has forced us to change our training methodologies and focus more on player recovery. We had to evolve in the tools we use and become much more comprehensive and knowledgeable about everything that surrounds us.",
      "\"A coach must be much more strategic now. In the past, coaches could be known for their tactical system. Today, I have to give my team the versatility to understand multiple systems, to make faster decisions because there is less and less room for hesitation.",
      "\"Today, it is about reading the game, solving situations. We create exercises to address these tactical changes and respond to the tactical shifts during a game, to overcome those challenges posed by the opponent and to put the opposition in difficulty too.\"",
      "In Castro's view, this represents a major change in how coaches need to approach football. \"Training sessions are much richer now. There has been a radical shift in how we look at training and how we prepare players for the various phases of a game.\"",
      "Some developments he is not so fond of. He has spoken of how youngsters are more focused on the individual than the team, but he stops short of suggesting it is a problem. \"It does require constant reminders about what teamwork should be,\" he says.",
      "\"But through good communication, the players always end up understanding and following the team path. We, as coaches, also need to recognise that the individualistic players remain assets. It is the job of the coach to connect them to the team.\"",
      "The appetite remains - Castro describes doing that as \"fantastic\" - and Portuguese coaches are proving better at it than most. There are three of them working in the Premier League at present - Ruben Amorim, Nuno Espirito Santo, and Marco Silva.",
      "\"The Premier League is the biggest showcase in world football. It is the best league in the world and has the best professionals working in it so I have no doubt that if they are there, it is because they are of excellent quality, taking a successful path to get there.",
      "\"I do not really like distinguishing coaches by nationality as quality has no nationality. But I can speak about our coaching school because it has managed to combine scientific knowledge, academic background, and the other experiences of football perfectly.",
      "\"Many of us Portuguese coaches worked in academies, which helped us to understand younger players - development programs, methodologies, and all the factors that shape a player's identity. It is about how we put individual talent into the service of the team.\"",
      "A lesson that Luis Castro learned with Cristiano Ronaldo."

      "Man Utd lost their 18th league game of the season in a 1-0 loss at Chelsea; Roy Keane thinks defeat in the Europa League final would destroy the club's pulling power; Keane: \"I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Man Utd. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club\"",
      "Saturday 17 May 2025 14:13, UK",
      "Roy Keane believes the days of everyone wanting to join Manchester United have ended after the club suffered an 18th defeat of the season at Chelsea, which he felt proved they \"aren't really good at anything\".",
      "United lost 1-0 thanks to Marc Cucurella's second-half winner to leave them on 39 points with one game - at home to Champions League-chasing Aston Villa - remaining.",
      "The 18th league loss of the season is their most in half a century, while they have picked up just two points since the start of April - the lowest out of any side in the Premier League.",
      "Ruben Amorim's side can get Champions League football by winning the Europa League, but they go into that final without a league win in eight matches.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team?\" said former United captain Keane.",
      "\"You sit up and watch certain teams, and you hang your hat on something. You say they're really technically very good, they're fit, they're brilliant, they're good at set-pieces. You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.",
      "\"If they don't win [the Europa League final] next week, I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone. I don't think there'll be players looking to sign for Manchester United. That's gone, that bit of excitement with the club.",
      "\"The fans, even here tonight, I don't think the United fans are angry anymore. It's just an acceptance. Even the manager's interview there, he's accepting where they are.",
      "\"Now, obviously, you have to be realistic, but you still want to show emotion and a bit of anger. I think United fans will be going back up the motorway to Manchester tonight going: 'Oh, that's what we thought would probably happen.' And that's a sad thing to do.",
      "\"And I don't think the manager [Amorim] did. And more importantly, I don't think the players believed they could come and win tonight.",
      "\"And even the Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca], he's patronising them by saying: 'Oh, they played well, they pressed us, they were 1v1. They're dangerous. We watched them a few times.'",
      "\"They beat them 1-0. And United had one shot on target. One shot on target. He's just like, what they're doing to United, they're patting them on the head going saying, 'off you go, back up to Manchester'.",
      "\"That's what United used to do to teams years ago. Now they're getting it. And they've got to respond to that. Don't accept that nonsense.\"",
      "Keane was asked how many Manchester United players the club could keep this summer - naming Bruno Fernandes as the only player after the game on Friday night, but accepted Amorim will likely have to keep some players around.",
      "The former United captain then discussed the futures of Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - second-half substitutes at Stamford Bridge and both have been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.",
      "Asked if those players plus Rasmus Hojlund are worth keeping, Keane replied: \"No, I wouldn't be hanging my hat on them three to get Manchester United [back to where they need to be].",
      "\"Mainoo comes on tonight. I watched him closely. He's strolling around the place. Some of his passes were sloppy. Garnacho, he's immature.",
      "\"You want players for the big clubs, you turn up week in, week out. And he doesn't do that. He's got a bit of talent. He makes some good runs, and he threatens him behind. And on his good day, you think, listen, I like what I see. But he's got too many bad days.",
      "\"And Hojlund, in his defence, I think he should have probably been a backup striker. A third or fourth choice and learn his trade off two or three brilliant strikers.",
      "\"The fact when he came to the club that he was going to be the main man, he's not good enough.",
      "\"He's certainly obviously lacking in confidence and belief. And he's not surrounded by brilliance either. So, the problems that we've spoke about United all season are still there. If people think they can fix that in one summer, then it's not going to happen.",
      "Keane even said Hojlund resembled \"the young kid from Chelsea\" with the Blues handing 19-year-old Tyrique George a first Premier League start in the victory.",
      "\"He looked like he'd just come out of the academy,\" said Keane. \"His runs weren't right, his timing, his hold-up play [ as well].",
      "\"We keep making excuses, we've talked about confidence, but you still think when you're a striker up there, you've got to make something happen sometimes.",
      "\"And what the big clubs have, and United ['s best teams in the past] have always had, are strikers who can produce something by themselves, even if they're not getting great service.",
      "\"They produce something because they've got quality, they've got a bit of desire, determination, a bit of experience and football intelligence. We don't see that with Hojlund. So United are up against it all the time. Obviously, he needs a little bit of support, but my goodness, sometimes you've got to just do a bit better.",
      "\"He got a ball in the first half on the edge of the box, and he didn't even know what to do! He wasn't even in the right body position to take a shot, and he knocks it back. He should be getting it in on goal.\"",
      "\"Right now, you'd look at that, and you'd probably be nervous for that squad going into Champions League football because it's not as if all of a sudden they're going to become better overnight.",
      "\"It's not going to get better because they've got a bit more experience. So, I think with pretty much every single player, Jason Wilcox and [Omar Berrada] the new CEO, they will look at it and go: if the offer's right, and then we can bring in somebody younger, better, we'll have to do it.\"",
      "United boss Amorim defended playing virtually his full-strength team at Chelsea, despite being so close to the must-win Europa League final - claiming it has helped him pick his team for the Bilbao game against Tottenham Hostpur on May 21.",
      "\"I won't talk about the summer,\" he said when asked about the Manchester United rebuild.",
      "\"The good news is in the Europa League, we are scoring many goals. We will prepare for the Europa League game.",
      "\"We have to deal with a lot of things in the summer, but today it was a really good game to prepare for the final. If we put some players out in the feeling of the last game, almost 10 days without playing, it would be a mistake.",
      "\"It was a good thing for them to play, that they feel they can do it, that we can have possession and push the opponent. In this club, you need to win and we are not winning games.",
      "\"It helped me a lot to choose the starting XI for the final. We'll see.\"",
      "Before the game, Amorim claimed United can have a much better season where they can qualify for Europe and beyond - because of some Premier League teams historically going from the bottom of the table to the top in one season.",
      "\"We need to finish this season,\" said Amorim.",
      "\"Every season has its history and the Premier League has a number of times with Blackburn Rovers - almost relegated, then champions. Leicester City, almost relegation then champions. Nottingham Forest, almost in the Champions League and last season they were fighting for their lives.",
      "\"So it's a different context. People don't understand how things are changing in Carrington, in our club, how many things are happening at the same time. Let's finish this season and we'll se.",
      "\"I'm seeing good things and I know what to do. That is a good thing, the board is doing everything. Sometimes it's not a popular thing but we know what to do. This season, it's tough but let's finish it.\""
