      "Thomas Frank is under huge pressure at Spurs(Image: Getty Images)",
      "The Premier League has seen its fair share of managerial casualties this season. Nuno Espirito Santo became the first victim back in September as he was sacked by Nottingham Forest.",
      "Graham Potter, Ange Postecoglou and Vitor Pereira then very quickly found themselves out of work as the first-half of the season progressed.",
      "The Premier League’s big boys have also not been afraid to get involved in the dugout drama. Ruben Amorim and Enzo Maresca were both moved on within days of each other earlier this month by Manchester United and Chelsea respectively.",
      "So with just over a third of the season still to play, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that some more managers could eventually find themselves without a job. Take a look at those under the most threat:",
      "Let’s get the obvious ones out of the way first. Mikel Arteta has Arsenal stationed at the top of the Premier League and is unlikely to go anywhere, while Pep Guardiola will still be the one to decide when he leaves Manchester City.",
      "Unai Emery is doing a terrific job with Aston Villa so it appears almost impossible that he will be going anywhere soon. Regis Le Bris has also enjoyed a brilliant first season in the Premier League so it would be a huge shock to see Sunderland opt for a change.",
      "Keith Andrews has silenced his pre-season doubters and doing a fine job with Brentford. Meanwhile, Michael Carrick and Liam Rosenior have only just been appointed by Manchester United and Chelsea respectively.",
      "When it comes to those in mid-table, Marco Silva has Fulham sitting seventh in the Premier League so a sacking looks far off. David Moyes, Fabian Hurzeler and Andoni Iraola are all doing more than respectable jobs so look set to stay in work for a bit longer.",
      "Michael Carrick has enjoyed a brilliant start to life with Manchester United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "That’s the boring bit out of the way, let’s look at some managers who could be in some real danger with a downturn in results. Arne Slot is the most obvious one, with the Dutchman having led Liverpool to a miserable title defence.",
      "Saturday’s late defeat to Bournemouth has left the Dutchman on somewhat uneasy ground. Is he one defeat away from the sack? Probably not but he needs to get a consistent run together soon.",
      "Newcastle boss Eddie Howe will also be hoping that he can get the same. It feels somewhat harsh on the former Bournemouth man but the club's owners will be expecting Champions League football next season and ninth in the league will not be good enough.",
      "Daniel Farke is also among the group of managers who will nervously be looking over his shoulder. The German appears to have steered Leeds away from choppy waters but another miserable run could put him in serious trouble.",
      "Sean Dyche will be feeling somewhat similar, with Forest sitting just five points above the relegation zone.",
      "Speaking of which, it feels as though each of Nuno Espirito Santo, Rob Edwards nor Scott Parker are in any immediate danger, particularly in the case of the West Ham boss. But a run of defeats could put their jobs in jeopardy.",
      "Newcastle sit ninth in the Premier League(Image: Getty Images)",
      "And then we move onto the managers under real pressure, Thomas Frank immediately comes to mind. The Dane arrived at Spurs in the summer but has endured a dismal stint so far.",
      "The North London side sit 14th and just eight points above the relegation zone. Fans also appear to have turned on Frank so it would not be a surprise to see his time at Tottenham ended sooner rather than later.",
      "Oliver Glasner might have already confirmed that he will be leaving Crystal Palace but it would not be a surprise to see him depart before then. The Austrian has been taking aim at club chiefs following the sale of Marc Guehi, while the Eagles have not won in the Premier League for nearly two months.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Patrick Dorgu was one of the stars of the show as Manchester United beat Arsenal(Image: Getty)",
      "Patrick Dorgu delivered a masterclass for Manchester United and netted a spectacular goal as they triumphed 3-2 over Arsenal on Sunday. A remark from former manager Ruben Amorim just months earlier suggests the 21-year-old is finally displaying his true potential.",
      "New boss Michael Carrick has managed to extract the best from his United squad during his second tenure in charge, securing a 2-0 victory against rivals Manchester City before boldly dismantling Premier League frontrunners Arsenal 3-2 on Sunday night.",
      "The encounter was level at the break, but moments into the second half, some slick interplay between Dorgu and Bruno Fernandes bore fruit. The Danish ace was teed up for a strike from outside the penalty area and unleashed a superb half-volley that flew past David Raya via the crossbar.",
      "Dorgu exhibited remarkable confidence throughout the encounter before being withdrawn in the 81st minute following an injury. Yet such self-assurance is precisely what former boss Amorim failed to witness in the youngster just months earlier.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "The 21-year-old was acquired by United from Lecce in February 2025 for £25million in an attempt to provide then-boss Amorim with another alternative at the left wing-back role.",
      "However, he struggled to find his rhythm during the latter half of last season and failed to register a goal or assist in the Premier League, despite featuring from the start in 10 matches. He kicked off the current campaign as a regular in the starting XI but quickly found himself relegated to the substitutes' bench.",
      "In November, Amorim discussed Dorgu's displays following a 1-0 defeat to Everton, drawing comparisons between his club performances and a goal-scoring appearance for Denmark against Scotland in a friendly weeks earlier.",
      "The Dane scored United's second goal with a brilliant half-volley(Image: Getty)",
      "\"I think it's the decision [making]. He needs to be calmer playing the game,\" Amorim acknowledged last November prior to his sacking in January.",
      "A particular 11 words from Amorim's assessment carry special significance as he went on: \"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball.",
      "\"I can feel the anxiety. You remember the shot against Everton. That was easier than the decision he had to make against the guys [for Denmark] from Scotland. He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here is different and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "Dorgu has proved Amorim's claim wrong(Image: Getty)",
      "When Bryan Mbeumo and Amad departed to represent their nations at the Africa Cup of Nations, Amorim started deploying Dorgu in more attacking positions and he has appeared a transformed player.",
      "Following United's 2-1 loss to Aston Villa in December, Dorgu has featured in virtually every minute of his side's subsequent six fixtures in an advanced role and has contributed three goals and an assist. His team remain undefeated throughout this spell.",
      "Even following Amorim's sacking and Carrick's appointment, he has maintained this impressive run of assured performances, comprehensively dispelling his previous manager's suggestion that he plays with a degree of nervousness.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Marcus Rashford is spending the season on loan at Barcelona from Manchester United(Image: Thomas Eisenhuth - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have suffered a setback in their pursuit of a Barcelona midfielder, which could have implications for Marcus Rashford's future. United sent Rashford on loan to the La Liga club last summer for the campaign, with the England international making a strong impression during his spell in Spain.",
      "Rashford indicated his wish to depart United during pre-season last summer, and subsequently joined Barcelona on loan with uncertainty surrounding his Old Trafford future.",
      "Since arriving at Barca, Rashford has netted eight goals and contributed 12 assists for the La Liga side, and has been tipped to secure a permanent switch at the end of the season. Beyond the ongoing speculation regarding Rashford's situation, United have been linked with a potential move for Barcelona midfielder Marc Casado.",
      "Barcelona secured a comfortable 3-0 triumph over Real Oviedo in La Liga on Sunday evening, with Casado instrumental in the victory at the Camp Nou.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "United have been strongly linked with signing a new midfielder this year, with Casado among the names mentioned as a possible option to replace Casemiro this summer. With United reportedly pursuing Casado, there have also been tentative rumours of a swap deal involving Rashford being finalised for this summer.",
      "Nevertheless, the prospects of any sort of agreement for Casado and United appear unlikely after Barcelona manager Hansi Flick ruled out the possibility of the midfielder departing the Camp Nou.",
      "“For me, there’s no question of him leaving,” said Flick. “We need everyone. Marc is a super professional player.",
      "“He deserved to play today [vs Real Oviedo]. He’s worked hard. I liked what I saw. That’s the Casado we want to see.”",
      "Marc Casado of Barcelona has been linked with Manchester United(Image: Icon Sport via Getty Images)",
      "Recent reports have suggested that, should Casado depart Barca, he would favour joining a club abroad rather than in Spain.",
      "United have until February 2 to finalise their transfer activity for the month, though it remains uncertain whether they'll manage to secure any new additions to their squad.",
      "Flick has already delivered a stern message to Barcelona players, both within the first-team setup and the La Masia academy, which emerged as Dro Fernandez moves closer to a switch to Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "\"If you want to play for Barca, you have to give everything...100 per cent,” Flick stated earlier this month.",
      "“That's what I want to say to everyone who is with us now or could be with us in the future. Same applies for La Masia youngsters training with the first team.",
      "\"They have to be here 100 per cent. These colours must be defended, that's what I want to see. As for the rest, I don't want them.\"",

      "The Portuguese midfielder has become disillusioned with how the club is run and the managerial changes. He came close to leaving United last summer, but rejected the chance to join the Saudi Pro League.",
      "The United captain will wait until the end of this season before deciding his next move. While Fernandes has been impressed with the impact Michael Carrick has made as interim manager, he wants to see who the next permanent boss will be.",
      "The 31-year-old knows his next deal will be the last major one of his career and that he needs to cash in. He also knows United bosses are desperate for him not to leave.",
      "United will stand a better chance of keeping Fernandes if they can offer him Champions League football. But club chiefs will still have to offer Fernandes a deal in the region of £400,000-a-week, making him the highest-paid player.",
      "This would be a significant increase on his current contract, which runs until 2027 and has the option of a 12-month extension.",
      "Fernandes knows his value to United - and wants to maximise it. It remains to be seen if United would be willing to hand such a deal to someone in their 30s.",

      "Former footballer Gordon McQueen's brain showed evidence of damage from heading the ball which contributed to his death, an inquest ruled today.",
      "The Scottish legend died from pneumonia, vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, which the coroner said was linked to heading the ball.",
      "Footballing greats Bryan Robson, Gary Bailey, Lou Macari and Joe Jordan gave evidence that McQueen was consistenly asked to head the ball in both defending and attacking situations in training.",
      "Prof Willie Stewart, a consultant at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow who examined McQueen's brain after his death, said that CTE was present.",
      "North Yorkshire senior coroner Jonathan Heath ruled that post mortem examination had found evidence of the damage caused by heading during his career.",
      "Giving a narrative verdict, he said: \"The post mortem examination confirmed the presence of CTE. The cause of death was pneumonia in the lower lung likely to be as a consequence of his vascular dementia.",
      "\"It is also likely that the impact of heading the ball contributed to his CTE. The condition has to be considered as a factor in his cause of death.\"",
      "The conclusion was that McQueen had died from pneumonia, vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "In a statement following the inquest, the McQueen family said Gordon did not simply die with CTE – he lived with it.",
      "”Gordon loved football, but the later years of his life were incredibly diﬃcult” the family said.",
      "Experts increasingly warn that CTE begins in youth, develops silently over many years and that it is not confined to elite football, but can aﬀect players from grassroots through to the professional game, wherever repetitive head impacts occur.",

      "“Gordon’s story shows why football must take action to protect its future” Dr. Judith Gates, chair and Co-founder of Head Safe Football said.",
      "\"Living with CTE is devastating, both to the aﬀected players and to their families.",
      "\"Because exposure begins early and accumulates over time, reduction in heading should start with young players and then be applied to every level.",

      "Man Utd and Scotland legend McQueen was diagnosed with vascular dementia, and died in 2023 aged 70.",
      "She told the hearing in Northallerton, North Yorkshire: \"He would say 'yes, heading a football all those years probably hasn't helped'. I remember coming home from school and Dad would be in bed. Or having a lie down.",
      "\"He would say he's been having headaches. I remember thinking 'why are you having headaches?'\" McQueen made almost 350 appearances for St Mirren, Leeds and United between 1970 and 1985.",
      "Hayley told the inquest she did not remember him having head injuries during his career, other than a few concussions.",
      "Gordon McQueen was a towering defender(Image: Popperfoto via Getty Images)",
      "But she outlined how loved ones noticed a change in his personality not long after his 60th birthday. He struggled with his swallowing and that \"continued for many years,\" Hayley said.",
      "\"His balance was very, very off and his personality started to change. My dad was very outgoing, dinners, part of the after-dinner circuit. He became off, which wasn't really my dad.\"",
      "Dysphagia caused the problem with swallowing, though McQueen had also been diagnosed with throat cancer. \"He just wouldn't really know what year it was or what day it was,\" Hayley added.",
      "\"He was very active and trying to do crosswords and watch football. He lost the ability to write. He couldn't make a cup of tea. He got confused about what went where. He kept saying, 'there's something not right in my head'. He used to get confused about things. Never people - he had an incredible memory for the past.",
      "\"It was more the withdrawn nature of my dad. He would be the centre of attention, but he had to be asked a question to speak.\"",
      "Michael Rawlinson KC, representing the McQueen family, asked how her father scored his goals.",
      "She replied: \"Mainly with his head, from a set-piece.\" They learned more about his illness after her mum Yvonne spoke with Dawn Astle, daughter of ex-England striker Jeff Astle, who had the brain condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and died in 2002 aged 59.",
      "Prof Stewart, a consultant at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow who examined McQueen's brain after his death, said that CTE was present.",
      "\"Gordon technically fell into the lower stage of the disease, although on the threshold of the higher stage,\" he added.",
      "Prof Stewart said symptoms of CTE were cognitive decline and neuro-behaviour change, and that they \"can't be explained by another condition.\"",
      "He said symptoms were \"typical in individuals who have long careers, professional footballers and rugby players\". Asked if there was a causal link between CTE and repetitive head injury, he replied: \"The answer to that is yes.\"",
      "Mr Heath said the post-mortem found pneumonia in McQueen's right lung, mixed vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "Prof Stewart, who conducted a 2021 study on whether certain positions on the pitch were more associated with neurodegenerative disease than others, said: \"The players, the goalkeepers who don't head the ball had a risk equivalent to general population, whereas in outfield positions, particularly defenders, the risk was higher.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim's time at Manchester United came to an abrupt end after plenty of frustrations on and off the pitch. His squad struggled to adapt to his 3-4-3 formation and, following a period of inconsistent results and growing tensions with the hierarchy, Amorim was dismissed barely a week into the new year.",
      "One aspect that became crystal clear during his tenure at United was his dissatisfaction with Marcus Rashford. A player who had served the club for a decade, Rashford is now on loan at Barcelona and it looks increasingly probable that Hansi Flick will make the forward's move permanent at the end of the campaign.",
      "Amorim voiced concerns about Rashford's work rate under his management and didn't hold back after a fixture against Fulham in 2025. \"It's always the same reason - the training, the way I see a footballer should do in life. It's every day, every detail,\" he said. \"If things don't change, I will not change.",

      "The jibe about Vital, Amorim's 64-year-old goalkeeping coach, effectively sealed Rashford's fate at United. Having been largely frozen out shortly after the Portuguese coach arrived, he found temporary sanctuary at Aston Villa before securing his dream transfer to La Liga last summer.",
      "Amorim later admitted he found it difficult to get Rashford to embrace his philosophy. \"What I say is I couldn't put Marcus to see the way you're supposed to play football and to train the way I see it,\" he said.",

      "Amorim isn't the first manager to raise concerns about Rashford's work ethic. Both Erik ten Hag and Jose Mourinho have previously questioned the England international's attitude, with the Special One sharing similar views to his compatriot.",
      "In a conversation with Hristo Stoichkov in 2018 following his own exit from Old Trafford, Mourinho famously remarked: \"I think kids these days have a different social life than us, and players have around them an entourage, and I mean a personal entourage, the people that surround them, that protect them more, give them more affection, more excuses. They reach maturity more slowly.",
      "\"When we talk about Luke Shaw, [Anthony] Martial, [Jesse] Lingard, [Marcus] Rashford, we're talking about kids with great potential but still lack a word I can't say but that you like a lot... they lack a bit of that. Character, personality, as they say in Spain as well, bad blood, that natural aggression that you had.\"",
      "Fellow former United manager Ten Hag identified what concerned him about Rashford. \"I think he always knew. Every player knows, when your lifestyle is not right you can't perform in the league we have to perform in,\" he said.",
      "Jose Mourinho won the Europa League with Manchester United(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"You don't get the right levels if you don't have a good and disciplined life away from Carrington. He needed some help, by backing him, for instance.",
      "\"But he has to do it himself, at the end of the day. He has to set his life right, his training attitude right, he has to set his match attitude right. When he sets his professionalism he will perform because he's a class player.\"",
      "According to a report from The Athletic, Barcelona are keen to retain Rashford beyond his loan spell, which could signal a permanent departure from United.",

      "Manchester United star Patrick Dorgu has delivered a brilliant 10-word response to club legend Patrice Evra following his spectacular strike during Sunday afternoon's 3-2 victory at Arsenal. The Red Devils initially trailed at the Emirates Stadium through Lisandro Martinez's first-half own goal.",
      "Nevertheless, Matheus Cunha produced a magnificent strike from the box's edge to leave Arsenal shell-shocked. Dorgu's strike in north London marked his second goal in consecutive fixtures, having also found the net during United's 2-0 win over Manchester City.",
      "The 21-year-old's effort on Sunday drew comparisons with Evra's memorable finish against Bayern Munich in 2014.",
      "The Frenchman has now responded to Dorgu's effort against Arsenal. Evra shared a video on X (formerly Twitter) featuring a replay of the goal with the caption: \"What are you doing to me bro!\"",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Dorgu subsequently reposted it, making reference to Evra's strike against Bayern. He said: \"Learned from the best. I've seen your goal against Bayern.\"",
      "The Danish player has sparked fresh injury concerns at United after being withdrawn due to an apparent problem on Sunday afternoon. With approximately 10 minutes remaining, Dorgu collapsed following a high-speed challenge with Ben White - grasping his hamstring as he remained on the turf.",
      "United's medical staff swiftly entered the pitch to assess him - before he was substituted by Benjamin Sesko moments later. Whilst the extent of Dorgu's injury remains unclear, it could present a considerable headache for Carrick at this vital point in the campaign.",
      "Nevertheless, speaking following the match, Carrick dismissed concerns of a serious issue for the Denmark international. \"He came off with hopefully a little bit of cramp, hopefully it's nothing worse,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"He ended up coming off, but I think it just shows what he put in with his performance. But yeah absolutely delighted for him, just hope he's not too bad.\"",
      "On whether it was definitely cramp - rather than a hamstring issue, he added: \"At this stage it's hard to tell. We'll just have to wait and see, but for sure we're hoping that it's not too bad.\"",
      "Sunday afternoon's win saw United move up to fourth in the standings with 10 wins, eight draws and five losses this season. Their next fixture is a home clash with Fulham on Sunday, February 1.",

      "Joshua Zirkzee is being eyed by Juventus in the closing days of the January window(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Italian giants Juventus have renewed their interest in Manchester United’s Joshua Zirkzee, who is yet to feature under Michael Carrick. The Dutchman has long-term admirers in Serie A, with Roma previously keen on signing him early in the January transfer window.",
      "But a move fell by the wayside following the decision to sack Ruben Amorim and the appointment of Carrick. The current United boss held talks with the Dutchman to convince him that his future lay at Old Trafford.",
      "That saw Roma move onto alternative targets, having signed Donyell Malen from Aston Villa, as well as Robinio Vaz from Marseille. And while a move to the Italian capital might not come to fruition for Zirkzee, rivals Juventus could be an option.",
      "According to Gazzetta dello Sport, the Turin side have been left frustrated in their attempts to sign Fenerbahce forward Youssef En-Nesyri and have now resumed talks with United regarding Zirkzee.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“The situation is pretty clear,” sporting director Giorgio Chiellini said about Juventus’ failure to sign En-Nesyri. “We went to speak to the player, he expressed a few doubts on the formula of the transfer, so for us right now the negotiations are over. We cannot and do not want to buy him outright.",
      "“We’ll see over the next few days if there are any developments or other opportunities, but for us it is over.”",
      "Zirkzee joined Man United from Bologna in 2024 but he has scored just nine goals in 65 appearances since. He has been ruled out of Michael Carrick’s first two games through injury.",
      "Youssef En-Nesyri was previously in talks to join Juventus(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Man United star Matheus Cunha has been among those to urge Zirkzee to stay at Old Trafford. He said: \"Josh is a pleasure. I feel like he has a lot of quality. Of course, his situation is not easy, but he has everything to change the situation. We need him. He needs to understand this and then everyone can count on him.",
      "\"But yeah, we are here to push him. And I think after the goal last week and the assist today, I think it will give him confidence to be more with us and then understand more his role in the team.\"",
      "Zirkzee is not the only Premier League star that Juventus are looking at. Liverpool winger Federico Chiesa is also a target for the Italian giants before next week’s deadline.",

      "United were behind in the match following an own goal from Lisandro Martinez, before Bryan Mbeumo swiftly levelled for Michael Carrick's side in North London. Dorgu then gave United the lead in the second half, only for Mikel Merino to draw Arsenal level in the closing stages.",

      "\"You have to be sure it has struck his arm to disallow it. Does the ball hit his hip and go forward? I think it does.\"",

      "\"If you can't 100 per cent tell if it hits his hand, you have to give the goal,” Bothroyd said.",

      "\"The move for Pat was a really good move, and the connection through the pitch, but to finish it the way he did was some finish,\" Carrick said.",
      "\"Pat's been a big player for us over the last couple of games. I think in so many ways, attacking wise, obviously he scored two goals, but I think in terms of the threat and his athleticism and his quality coming in as well, and connections.",
      "“I think defensively, he's been immense as well, down the side with Luke [Shaw] and doubling up against two teams that ask a lot of questions down the side.",

      "The victory for United means Carrick has now secured wins in both matches since taking over as United's interim head coach after Ruben Amorim's departure earlier this month.",

      "Scott McTominay's performance against Juventus was scrutinised by the Italian press(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Scott McTominay's most recent Napoli performance has been described as \"invisible\" and \"fatigued\" following a 3-0 defeat by Juventus. The Scottish midfielder, who left Manchester United in the summer of 2024, played the full 90 minutes of Napoli's crucial away trip to the Allianz Stadium on Sunday.",
      "Luciano Spalletti's Juventus dominated the reigning Serie A champions with a statement 3-0 victory on the night. Jonathan David gave the home side the lead in the 22nd minute before Kenan Yildiz and Filip Kostic put the game out of sight late on. Napoli, meanwhile, only registered one shot on target.",
      "The likes of McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund were unable to make things happen for an injury-hit Napoli side, who dropped to fourth place in the table in a major blow to their title hopes, while league leaders Inter Milan are now nine points in front.",
      "The Italian media’s assessment of McTominay’s individual performance marked quite a significant shift in tone compared to the \"Super McTominay\" headlines they ran with earlier this season. Instead, they focused on how the former United midfielder was neutralised by a superior Juve midfield.",
      "Eurosport Italy summed that up by pointing out how the Scot lost a spiky midfield battle against Khephren Thuram, while handing him a match rating of 5.5/10. They wrote: \"He acts like a leader and does it admirably, but his batteries are low. His energy is close to zero, and this forces him to force plays and shots.\"",
      "Il Messaggero raised the same point, giving him a rating of 6 as they wrote: \"A couple of his own bursts but too inconsistent, struggling against Manuel Locatelli and Thuram.\" Corriere della Sera handed the 29-year-old a 5/10, saying: \"He had no license to advance. That way he gets lost.\"",
      "Italy’s famous pink newspaper, Gazzetta dello Sport, dished out a similar 5.5/10 rating, again noting that McTominay looked \"fatigued\" and lacked the usual verticality that has made him a revelation in Serie A. They stated he was \"constantly forced to chase\" and that Manuel Locatelli and Thuram \"never gave him room to manoeuvre.\"",
      "Unlike his earlier performances, where he was described as \"physically devastating,\" Gazzetta suggested he looked like \"a shadow of the player who dominated the autumn.\"",
      "The Scot lost the midfield battle(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Rome-based daily Corriere dello Sport, which previously called him the \"Prime Minister of Naples,\" was unforgiving. They focused on his tactical struggles, stating that he \"lost the battle of the shadows\" against Thuram.",
      "Their match report assigned him a rating of 5/10 and mentioned: \"The protagonist who is accustomed to being on the cover was invisible for the wrong reasons. He struggled to find his positioning in the 3-4-3 and was often caught between two minds, neither protecting the defence nor supporting Hojlund.\"",
      "Tuttosport gave McTominay a 5.5/10. The Turin-based outlet highlighted that while McTominay never stopped running, his impact was minimal. They mentioned, \"The Scot's engine seemed to be running on fumes,\" perhaps a result of the heavy fixture load Antonio Conte has placed on him.",
      "Fatigue seems to have affected McTominay's performances(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "They also pointed out his usual \"game-breaking\" runs into the box were completely snuffed out by the discipline of the Juventus backline. That all led to him being \"outclassed\" by Thuram and Locatelli.",
      "Calcio Mercato issued a 5/10 rating. The site that once compared him to Diego Maradona and Edinson Cavani was brutally honest, stating, \"McTominay's magic has hit a wall.\" They argued that Spalletti had \"found the antidote\" to McTominay by assigning Thuram to shadow him for 90 minutes.",
      "McTominay, crowned the Serie A Player of the Year and MVP last year, is undoubtedly facing his first true period of difficulty since arriving in Italy. Manager Conte will need to get the best out of his exhausted star player quickly if Napoli are to salvage their season.",

      "Manchester United supporters are divided after a design claimed to be the club's 2026/27 third kit was 'revealed' online. The cream-and-red outfit boasts a centrally-positioned crest.",
      "With Ruben Amorim's departure, it remains uncertain who will be managing United when they officially unveil their strips for the 2026/27 campaign. Yet caretaker boss Michael Carrick has bolstered his case with a flawless beginning to his second tenure at Old Trafford.",
      "His team comfortably saw off local rivals Manchester City 2-0 in his opening fixture before heading to Premier League pacesetters Arsenal and besting them 3-2 on Sunday. Strikes from Bryan Mbeumo, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha secured all three points for Carrick's men at the Emirates, just weeks after Amorim's exit.",
      "This recent triumph saw United's players donning their existing black-and-yellow third strip. However, on the same day as this success, a social media account on X shared a concept design of a kit they allege will be United's third outfit next term. Supporters were divided over the supposed central badge positioning.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "A user on X suggests that United's third kit next campaign will be predominantly cream featuring red detailing, bearing resemblance to the current away strip. The parallels between the kits persist with the inclusion of the red devil emblem.",
      "This badge also appeared on the 2023/24 third strip, which shares some design features with the 'leaked' concept for next season. That kit came in cloud white and marked the first occasion a strip had displayed only the red devil crest.",
      "Fans have shared their views in the comments beneath the post, with some offering positive feedback about the badge arrangement. One wrote: \"I like the retro look with all the logos in the middle.\"",
      "Another penned: \"Finally some nice kits.\" A fourth supporter praised the design whilst questioning the badge positioning and wrote: \"Don't hate it. I'm not a big fan of the kit manufacturer being on top of the badge but it's fine I guess.\"",
      "Yet some were not quite as keen on what might become United's third kit next campaign and the positioning of the crest. One commented: \"That is surely a joke? It is disgusting.\"",
      "A second stated: \"I don't get the trend for shirts with all the badges down the middle.\" Whilst a third claimed: \"I think I would like it better if the logos were in a conventional layout.\"",
      "There's still some time before fans witness United players donning their 2026/27 strip. And with Carrick's second spell starting so promisingly, they might hope to see it displayed in the Champions League. But Carrick is maintaining a measured approach regarding European qualification, despite the victory over Arsenal lifting them above Liverpool into the top four.",
      "\"I know from our perspective, it's just moving forward to the next game,\" Carrick said following the Arsenal triumph. \"It's been less than two weeks we've been together. I don't think we can look too far ahead.",
      "\"We certainly won't be, anyway. I know that's kind of obvious, but looking too far ahead can come back and bite you really. So we've taken this week by week and game by game. We'll certainly continue to do that.\"",

Carrick has made the perfect start to his spell as United boss, backing up the 2-0 win over Manchester City in the derby with a stunning 3-2 victory away at the Premier League leaders.",
      "United have been rejuvenated by Carrick’s arrival as interim manager until the end of the season, picking up their best two results of the campaign. Carrick stuck with the same starting XI that beat City for the trip to north London and was rewarded with another impressive result.",
      "Goals from Bryan Mbeumo, Patrick Dorgu and Matheus Cunha saw them become the first side to win at the Emirates Stadium this season. United moved up to fourth place and have a huge sense of positivity around the team for the first time in a long time.",
      "That feeling was there ahead of the Arsenal game, according to Wayne Rooney, who spoke to his former team-mate Carrick the day before. Rooney explained on Match of the Day: “I actually saw him on Saturday morning and he said to me he actually had to stop training because it was that good.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "“He wanted to bottle it up and make sure they had that performance for the game the following day, which obviously we’ve seen with it. He’s done superb and I’m absolutely delighted for him.”",
      "Carrick replaced Ruben Amorim and scrapped the 3-4-2-1 formation in favour of a 4-2-3-1 shape. It has immediately reaped benefits and put his name in the frame for the permanent job at the end of the season.",
      "“He brings a level of calmness, which hasn’t been there for quite a while now,” Rooney added. “When you look at Michael Carrick you think he’s a quiet lad, [but] he’s studied the game, he understands the game and he’s gone into that job knowing it’s a difficult one to do and he’s brought the basics back to Manchester United – players working hard, getting behind the ball, running for each other, working for each other and they’re more confident.",
      "Manchester United have been rejuvenated by Michael Carrick's arrival(Image: Marc Atkins, Getty Images)",
      "“He’s an unbelievable communicator. I think for the best managers you need to do is make sure every player is happy and wants to play for you. The last two weeks have really shown that – Cunha has come off the bench twice and made an impact with the assist for Mason Mount and the goal against Arsenal.",
      "“He’s given belief into those players. Sometimes with young coaches, and I think with Ruben Amorim when he was there, they’re guilty of overcomplicating things, giving the players too much information. I think Michael has gone in and reminded them of the basics.”",
      "Asked if he could be the right man for the job long-term, Rooney replied: “Of course he can. Michael Carrick has got an opportunity to show everyone that he’s capable of that job. Of course he has to have a consistency about his results and performances, but what we’ve seen is that he’s more than capable of doing it.",
      "“And if it carries on then there will be a massive pressure on Manchester United board to put him in at the end of the season. I know they’ve been there before with Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer], but I think this feels different.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "They have been keeping a close eye on him and internal talks about a potential move are ongoing. Whether that comes to fruition in the winter window or it’s more one for the summer remains to be seen but it could be one that moves relatively quickly.",
      "Arsenal’s London rivals Chelsea could also be busy over the coming days. The Blues have expressed their desire to add a new midfielder to the squad following an injury to Dario Essugo.",
      "Douglas Luiz is a potential option for the Blues, albeit a deal would be quite complicated. The Brazilian is currently in the middle of a loan spell with Nottingham Forest so Chelsea would not only have to negotiate with the Reds but also his parent club Juventus.",
      "Douglas Luiz is being eyed by Chelsea(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Across West London, Chelsea’s near neighbours Fulham could also be very busy over the coming days. They have an interest in Manchester City wideman Oscar Bobb, who is expected to leave the Etihad Stadium following the arrival of Semenyo.",
      "They are also eyeing a deal for PSV forward Ricardo Pepi, having lodged a £28m bid for the American frontman. That could potentially be enough to tempt the Dutch side into selling.",
      "Sticking in London, West Ham might also be busy as they attempt to mastermind an escape from relegation. Nuno Espirito Santo has identified his former Wolves star Adama Traore as a potential recruit.",
      "Fulham boss Marco Silva has confirmed that the Spanish wideman is set for an exit, with the ball now firmly in Traore’s court over a potential switch to the London Stadium.",
      "Adama Traore may swap Fulham for West Ham(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Should Traore arrive at West Ham, that could potentially open the door to Brazilian midfielder Lucas Paqueta leaving the club sooner rather than later. He has been linked with an exit throughout the transfer window, with former side Flamengo keen on signing him.",
      "The Brazilian side have already seen a few bids rebuffed for Paqueta’s signature, with their latest being in the region of £38.5m. That could potentially be enough to convince West Ham to sell.",
      "The Hammers have already invested heavily this January, while Bournemouth are set to follow them with their own double deal. Goalkeeper Christos Mandas is set to move to the South Coast on loan from Italian giants Lazio.",
      "In the meantime, the Cherries are also attempting to find their Semenyo replacement. Vasco da Gama winger Rayan has flown to the UK ahead of a potential £25m move to the Premier League.",
      "Tammy Abraham is set to return to Aston Villa(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Aston Villa currently sit third in the Premier League and are just four points behind table-topping Arsenal. Unai Emery is now keen on adding some new faces to his side.",
      "One arrival could however be a familiar one in the form of striker Tammy Abraham. The English frontman is reportedly on the verge of a return to Villa Park, having spent the first-half of the campaign with Besiktas. Yasin Ozcan is reportedly set to move in the opposite direction.",
      "While Michael Carrick has suggested that Man United will not be making any major signings in the current window, outgoings have not been ruled out. Toby Collyer could move away from Old Trafford and join Championship side Hull City on loan.",

      "Michael Carrick has won his opening two matches as Man Utd head coach(Image: James Gill - Danehouse, Getty Images)",
      "Manchester United have the perfect chance to show they've evolved under their new leadership with an emotional decision increasingly presenting itself in the form of Michael Carrick.",
      "If there's one thing that Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his lieutenants Omar Berrada and Jason Wilcox haven't shown it is conviction. Their thought process is entirely led by results, even the types of results that cover up cracks that cannot be fixed.",
      "We all knew Erik ten Hag wasn't their man months before he was sacked, yet they were conned by an FA Cup final win. The status quo did its thing months later when he was shown the door.",
      "And so to their latest managerial call - and the decision to make Carrick their head coach until the end of the season. He's pressing his case to be the man long-term with wins over Manchester City and Arsenal. So now its on Ratcliffe and co to have the courage of their convictions.",
      "At the start of January they clearly didn't think Carrick was the man, otherwise they've have appointed him indefinitely, not until the campaign ends. That was a decision they made and one they need to stick with.",
      "The club statement confirming Carrick's role made numerous references about him taking charge \"until the end of the season\". Wilcox said that Carrick was \"ready to lead our talented and determined group of players for the remainder of the season as we continue to build the club towards regular and sustained success.”",
      "Clearly they weren't convinced that Carrick was the man to deliver \"regular and sustained success\" otherwise he'd have been handed the reigns, probably on a three year deal, not a 17-game deal, which is how long he's been given.",
      "Man Utd's hierarchy have continued to get major decisions wrong(Image: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista, Getty Images)",
      "These opening two games, the feel good factor, the idea of United being led by one of their own, has the biggest whiff possible of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2019. A stop gap that became the long-term plan, partly because his results made him impossible to ignore for a hierarchy that clearly had no long-term plan.",
      "Roy Keane is, unsurprisingly, certainly not being seduced by recent performances. He maintains that Carrick cannot be the man to take United forward.",
      "That was a narrative played out by Jamie Carragher during periods of the Solskjaer era when, no matter how hard he tried, he simply couldn't match the quality of Thomas Tuchel, Jurgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola. Of which there is no shame.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was appointed in 2019 after an impressive caretaker spell(Image: Getty Images)",
      "United's profile means that everyone has had a say on their next permanent boss. Some seeing Oliver Glasner, who will leave Crystal Palace in the summer, as someone who could be on the shortlist. Others long for a figure like Carlo Ancelotti, despite that being unlikely.",
      "Waiting until the summer also allows the Manchester outfit the chance to seize a manager who may have come to the end of his World Cup cycle. Be that England boss Tuchel or maybe Germany's Julian Nagelsmann. Talk of Luis Enrique leaving PSG continues to swirl.",
      "Ratcliffe and his team have made nearly every wrong decision possible, lumping them in the Glazer category already. Their popularity and competency is at a seriously low ebb and in a matter of months they could be faced with two decisions. The strong one or the popular one. Choose wisely.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Keane was joined by Gary Neville, Jill Scott, Ian Wright and Jamie Carragher, who welcomed Ant and Dec onto the podcast. The iconic TV presenting duo quizzed Keane – who works for ITV as part of their football coverage – about the United legend’s chance of appearing on I’m a Celebrity in the future, potentially this year.",
      "However, Keane gave a blunt response when asked about the possibility of making the trip to Australia for the show. “Roy, when you do it, you’ll realise it’s actually a lot of fun,” Ant told Keane. This led to the United legend replying: “Dream on, lads, dream on.”",
      "Ant then continued to try and persuade Keane to appear on I’m a Celebrity, with Dec then jokingly saying that he would put the quest to ITV themselves.",
      "“Is it a no then? Because I know you’ve joked about it on here a lot,” Ant said. “Do we just need to go back to ITV today with something signed?”",

      "Keane then replied: “Why do you think it’s always about numbers? Everyone thinks it’s about numbers.”",
      "Neville then asked Keane if his former United team-mate had ever previously been asked to appear on I’m a Celebrity. Keane then replied: “A couple of times, yeah.”",

      "“You would be so good,” Scott said. “Is there even one per cent of you that would consider it?”",

      "Gary Neville is stunned by the upturn in form from Patrick Dorgu(Image: James Gill - Danehouse/Getty Images)",
      "Gary Neville is stunned by the turnaround in Patrick Dorgu having seen him as an \"average wing-back\" under Ruben Amorim - before seeing him thrive as a winger more recently.",
      "The Dane was the first signing made by Amorim, who was wanting wing-backs to suit his system and signed Dorgu from Italian side Leece. The 21-year-old was unable to have a huge impact in what was a struggling Manchester United side however.",
      "Towards the end of Amorim's reign, when he veered away from his 3-4-3 formation, Dorgu found himself playing as a winger and that is a position he's continued in under Michael Carrick. The new head coach has adopted more of a conventional system, which has suited the team and its players.",
      "Dorgu scored in the Manchester derby win last weekend and then on Sunday backed that up with another strike, this time a stunning volley, as the Red Devils downed Arsenal with Neville stunned by his upturn in form.",
      "Neville elaborated on that as he added on his podcast: \"You can’t really say anything bad about him because he’s a willing runner, he always wanted the ball and worked hard under Ruben Amorim. But you thought, what is he? And how is he going to get man United back to where they need to be?",
      "\"The first time we saw a glimpse of what he could be was actually under Amorim when he played him as a wide right. I thought he could play a bit when he could play a bit higher up and had a player behind him, I thought he could be a good wide player and cause problems and get crosses in.",
      "Patrick Dorgu scored for the second successive weekend(Image: PA)",
      "\"Then Amorim put him back at wing-back and you thought, oh no. Looking at him now he’s obviously a winger, he’s obviously a winger. His goal was absolutely brilliant. Patrick Dorgu typifies what has happened at Manchester United in this last week.\"",
      "United's win has lifted them into the top four as the calls for Carrick to land the job beyond this season gather momentum. The former player and knocked off to the Premier League's top four sides whilst pushing United's hopes for a Champions League finish as he continues to receive plenty of plaudits.",

Patrick Dorgu then fired the Red Devils ahead before Mikel Merino looked to have rescued a valuable point for Mikel Arteta’s side.",

So it was nice to see him.”",

      "The British billionaire was asked whether he was happy with the result, and he responded: \"Very, yeah.\" Lisandro Martinez was walking a few yards behind Ratcliffe, and was given a warm embrace by Josh Thompson, an Ineos staffer who has worked at United since their investment into the club.",
      "Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro strolled through together. A Portuguese-speaking journalist pleaded with the pair to speak, and Fernandes explained why they had declined to do so in his mother tongue.",
      "Patrick Dorgu scored a stunning goal to fire United into a 2-1 lead at the Emirates. He came off in discomfort with nine minutes remaining, and Michael Carrick said in his press conference that Dorgu had suffered from cramp, but the in-form Denmark international left the stadium with a limp.",
      "When Dorgu was asked how his injury was, he said: \"We'll see.\" The 21-year-old's confidence is flowing after an impressive few weeks in a United shirt, and fans will be hoping he was substituted due to cramp, as Carrick suggested, not because he'd picked up a knock.",
      "Dorgu scored a screamer.(Image: 2026 Marc Atkins)",
      "Jonathan Woodgate chatted to a reporter who he recognised from his Real Madrid days, while Steve Holland took a minute to pause and check his phone before getting on the team bus.",
      "A few minutes earlier, Arsenal defender Ben White had left the Emirates. White has not played for the Three Lions since his withdrawal from the England squad at the 2022 Qatar World Cup, when Holland reportedly said that White, who does not watch football, wasn't interested enough in the game.",
      "Gareth Southgate insisted there had never been an issue, and White's withdrawal from the England squad was put down to \"personal reasons.\" It would have been interesting if their exits from the Emirates had coincided, though. It feels most likely that there would have been no acknowledgement.",
      "Holland lives and breathes football. He arrived at Carrington with bags of experience, and wins against Manchester City and Arsenal confirm he was a shrewd addition to Carrick's backroom staff.",
      "United's communications department has undergone a recent change, leaving the head of football communications overstretched on matchdays over the last month. A new staff member is set to arrive, but the head of football communications has essentially been left to deal with the media on their own.",
      "They were pushed for time to bring a player out to Manchester-correspondents in the mixed zone, to accompany players doing interviews with rights holders, and Michael Carrick at the press conference, but there is a 'proper' mixed zone at the Emirates, which means players must walk past journalists to leave.",
      "That means there is a chance a player will stop. Senne Lammens was happy to oblige, and he spoke for three minutes, reacting to the result and discussing the impact of Carrick so far.",
      "Lammens also took time to chat after the win at Anfield in October. He is mature beyond his years and speaks well. \"It's something I really look forward to - these big away games,\" he smiled.",
      "There was no comment from Gunnersaurus Rex, Arsenal's mascot, when asked whether he could front up about his team's performance. It's starting to feel like Arsenal last won the title when dinosaurs roamed the land.",
      "Gunnersaurus Rex was not in the mood to speak.(Image: Steven Railston)",
      "A disagreement erupted between two Arsenal fans beside the press box shortly after Dorgu's goal. The club's stewards were called to the incident, and the pair were prevented from exchanging blows.",
      "The pair began to argue again when Matheus Cunha scored the match-winner. There were further signs of discontent after the final whistle when fans huddled outside the stadium to record reaction for AFTV.",
      "AFTV is a well-known, fan-led Arsenal YouTube channel. The channel's popularity soared during the final years of Arsene Wenger's tenure, with personalities giving unfiltered - and often exaggerated - opinions.",
      "The Gunners were heavy favourites to win, but United caused an upset. The meltdown in the stands and outside the ground showed how much the defeat hurt their supporters.",
      "Arsenal fans held an inquest well after the final whistle.(Image: )",
      "There were chants of \"he's Carrick, you know, you'll never believe he's not Scholes,\" when arriving at London King's Cross to begin the return journey to Manchester.",
      "United returned to Carrington by coach, and the four-hour drive up the M6 should have gone quickly thanks to the result. Amad passed the time by tweeting an Arsenal fan from his official X account. \"Your only hope are corners, be humble KID,\" he wrote alongside laughing faces.",
      "However, Carrick will not get carried away and he was back at Carrington on Monday, despite the players having been given a day off. The coaching staff's attention has already turned to Fulham this weekend.",

      "Michael Carrick celebrates Matheus Cunha's goal with his coaching staff(Image: )",
      "It was half an hour until midnight when the Manchester United coaches carrying players and staff arrived back at Carrington on Sunday. The ecstasy of their win at the Emirates was beginning to wear off, and another long week was stretching out in front of them.",
      "Michael Carrick and his staff had spent the journey home poring over footage from the game and preparing for the week ahead. Although the players have Monday off, the coaching staff were in, finalising session plans ahead of the weekend's game with Fulham. At 1pm, they strolled over to watch the Under-21s take on Brighton in the Premier League 2 at Carrington.",
      "That is the third academy game since Carrick took over and the third he has attended. The diligence of the 44-year-old and his staff has been noted around the building. Two weeks ago, the mood at Old Trafford was one of despondency. When United were knocked out of the FA Cup by Brighton, the picture had become clear. There were 17 Premier League games remaining, and that was it. Another season of drift looked set for a long, drawn-out conclusion.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "There was no anger towards Darren Fletcher after that FA Cup exit. The Scot had been a safe pair of hands for a week after the chaos of Ruben Amorim's exit, but it felt like nobody was enjoying themselves any more. Not the players, and definitely not the supporters.",
      "Contrast that with the scenes in the away end at the Emirates on Sunday. Fifteen minutes after the final whistle had blown, there were United fans still there, slowly drifting towards the exit and the North London night. \"It's Carrick, you know...\" could be heard echoing back up into the stands.",
      "Inside the bowels of the stadium, Carrick was just about to speak to Norwegian broadcaster Viaplay when he was pulled away for a meeting with Sir Jim Ratcliffe. It wasn't a job offer yet, but if this carries on, one might not be too far away.",
      "Although you could argue this is just a continuation of his three-game spell as caretaker in November 2021. To the wins against Unai Emery and Mikel Arteta and a draw against Thomas Tuchel, he has added a victory against Pep Guardiola and another success against Arteta. It is shaping up as a seriously impressive coaching CV at the highest level.",
      "United got the Carrick era off to a winning start against Manchester City(Image: )",
      "Carrick has been unflappable since taking the reins from Fletcher. He is unobtrusive, low-key and has his feet planted so firmly on the floor that it's a surprise it isn't a challenge to lift them when he needs to move. He showed little emotion on the touchline on Sunday, only coming to life in front of the away end at full-time, with his two children among the 3,000 or so away supporters.",
      "It might have felt strange for them to be singing a song in their dad's honour, but then they might have been the only ones not doing so. Carrick has eschewed grand statements since his return. There has been no mention of chats with Sir Alex Ferguson, no real mention of his playing days or past glories. When it was put to him that United could do with a midfielder like Carrick now, he was self-effacing and made fun of himself.",
      "There has been no schmaltz or nostalgia since his return. This hasn't been a renaissance built on someone talking about the United DNA, but on someone delivering the United DNA. Two very different performances have produced the same result.",
      "This is a triumph of substance over style. It's been built on the training ground as much as Carrick is taking the plaudits now, he knows the work of Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate, Jonny Evans and Travis Binnion is essential to what they have delivered in the space of two weeks.",
      "For 14 months, Ruben Amorim wanted more time on the training pitches, but when he got what he wished for, he made little use of it. Whether the blame for that lies with Amorim or his experienced backroom team, it's clear that this thrown-together coaching set-up under Carrick is maximising the time they have.",
      "They had three sessions to prepare for Manchester City and delivered a game plan to dominate the derby and play front-foot, counter-attacking football. They then had a full week to come up with a strategy for the trip to Arsenal and delivered an approach that blocked space and offered the hosts nothing from open play.",
      "You can see the players have brought into it. Holland deserves plenty of plaudits as well. He is the most experienced member of the coaching staff and the Mancunian has quickly won the respect of the squad.",
      "The challenge for Carrick and co will change now. They have delivered tactical successes in games in which they were outsiders, but against Fulham on Sunday, United will have the ball and need to dictate the game. That will call for a change of focus this week.",
      "Cunha celebrates his dramatic late winner against Arsenal(Image: )",
      "Carrick said after the win at the Emirates that there were \"layers\" still to add to the game plan and things to improve. Some of that will be related to breaking down a low block. United's kryptonite recently has been beating teams at home that they should be beating.",
      "If they do that and do it with style, then the clamour for Carrick will only grow. The man himself is refusing to say whether he even wants the job.",
      "\"I am here to do a job,\" he said on Sunday \"When I came here less than two weeks ago, I said we would make every decision for the bigger picture.",
      "\"We are not getting carried away. It is two huge results, but we will keep our feet on the ground. I am enjoying it and I will continue to do what I can.\"",
      "That has been more than good enough so far, but a different kind of test awaits this week.",

      "Lammens took time to chat at the Emirates.(Image: 2026 Marc Atkins)",
      "Senne Lammens has revealed Sir Jim Ratcliffe spoke to Michael Carrick after Manchester United's win against Arsenal. United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory at the Emirates thanks to a late goal from Matheus Cunha, which condemned Arsenal to a first home defeat in the Premier League this season.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo equalised in the first half and Patrick Dorgu scored a stunning goal to fire United into the lead. Mikel Merino thought he'd salvaged a point for Arsenal when he scored with seven minutes remaining, but there was another twist when Cunha found the net to seal an away victory.",
      "Ratcliffe attended the game with Omar Berrada, United CEO, and Jason Wilcox, United football director. After full-time, the Ineos entourage was spotted making its way to the dressing room area within the Emirates. Lammens was asked whether Ratcliffe had popped into the dressing room to speak to the players, and he responded: \"No, I just saw him there when we came out of the dressing room.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"He was talking to the coach. It's nice to see them [United board] as well, like supporting the team as well, as they have. So it's always a good feeling and good support for them.\"",
      "Lammens has made a strong impact since signing for £18.2million from Royal Antwerp in the summer. \"I think it was one of the better ones, better feelings of my career,\" he said of the win over the Gunners.",
      "\"Away as well, yeah, whilst last week [against City] was at home, which is also really nice and really special. This one felt like a little bit more hard work. It wasn't always the best play from us, but they also games you have to win if you want to be at the top.",
      "\"So today we did that, I think just hardworking, defending together, and then at the end, the subs like Cunha made a difference, and also, the people who come in give our team energy.\"",
      "Lammens claims the ball at the Emirates.(Image: 2026 Marc Atkins)",
      "Michael Carrick has overseen wins over Manchester City and Arsenal in his first two games since his appointment as head coach, and Lammens put the team's improvement down to going back to basics.",
      "\"To be honest, there's not many special things he did. It's just like sticking to the basics,\" said Lammens. \"Football is basics. If you do the basics well, then the quality of us comes out, and I think we have players with the quality that can make the difference.",
      "\"But if you just do the basics right technically, we're standing right, defending good together. And just [playing] as a team, to be honest, he made it really clear what he wants from us and what he expects from us.",
      "\"And I think today as well, on the pitch sometimes it [the plan] didn't really come out, but if you fight as a team and if you keep believing in it, then you can still get the win.\"",
      "When asked about Carrick's post-match message to the players, Lammens said: \"To be honest, the same things. It wasn't the prettiest game, but those were the most difficult ones. Last week was, I think, in every aspect, a good game. I think we play really well. Today was not always perfect.",
      "\"But like I said before, if you work hard as a team, you can always win. And now it's up to us. We're there, top four, to stay there and to even look above us. Those games against those top teams, you have to win.",
      "\"But now the coming weeks, when they expect more from us, when we are the favourite to win, then you also have to pull through and those are also really important games.\"",
      "United welcome Fulham to Old Trafford next weekend. \"They are sometimes the most difficult ones, the ones you have to win, so to speak,\" he said. \"It's still a long way from the end of the season, so we don't want to look at the end. Like at the table, but yeah, we know we're there [top four].",
      "\"We know we can play against those better teams, so now we have to win against those teams who are maybe a little bit more difficult to play against, playing against low blocks. If you want to be a great team, you have to win against those teams as well.\"",

      "Michael Carrick told his Manchester United players to keep their feet on the ground and stay humble after they backed up a derby day win by beating Premier League leaders Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, with Matheus Cunha's late winner securing a stunning victory.",
      "United have beaten the Premier League's top two in Carrick's first two games in charge and now sit fourth with 15 games of the season to go. That puts Champions League qualification well within their grasp, but the 44-year-old is refusing to get carried away.",
      "Carrick has had an immediate impact since replacing Ruben Amorim, and these wins have sent out a statement about their intentions this season after a disappointing run of results in December, but one of the former United midfielder's strengths has been a calm demeanour, and he isn't about to misplace that now.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Although the away end revelled in a victory that hurt Arsenal's title chances, Carrick was focusing on the impact he could have within the club, rather than the statement it can send out to the rest of the league, and he is determined to make sure his players do not get carried away.",
      "\"I think it's more about the feeling that gives us as a group,\" he said. \"And the players and certainly the supporters, you know? That's my concern, how that can bring us together and lift us in a real positive manner.",
      "\"I'm not getting carried away. We've got some bigger games coming up, because every next game's the bigger game. So we're not getting carried away, we've got really important things coming up that we need to kind of keep improving with.",

      "United fans were chanting 'we're gonna win the league' as they left the Emirates but Carrick didn't flinch when told that in his post-match press conference, instead returning to a theme of focusing on Fulham next week rather than getting sucked into looking at the bigger picture.",
      "\"I know from our perspective it's just moving forward to the next game,\" he said. \"It's been less than two weeks that we've been together, so it's just keep getting good habits really, and good routines. The boys have been fantastic with that.",
      "\"I don't think we can look too far ahead. We certainly won't be anyway. We'll finish where we finish by the results we get. I know that's kind of obvious, but looking too far ahead can come back and bite you really so we've taken this week by week and game by game.",
      "\"We'll certainly continue to do that, but we've got to ride it. You've got to use the emotion, you've got to use the energy, you've got to use the confidence, but be humble enough to understand how we could just achieve these two big results and it doesn't just come easy. So we need to continue that and bottle it and use it again.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu is enjoying a purple patch and scored an incredible goal to fire United into the lead in the second period. Arsenal equalised through Mikel Merino, but there was another twist in the tale when Matheus Cunha came off the bench to make it 3-2 with a superb shot from the edge of the box.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Dorgu shocked himself",
      "Dorgu scored one of the finest goals of the season and didn't know what to do with himself as he celebrated. The 21-year-old was just as stunned as everyone in the crowd at his strike.",
      "There were limbs in the away end as Dorgu made his way over to the corner. Once he'd been mobbed by his teammates, Dorgu shook his head at the TV camera, as if he was thinking, 'how did I do that?'",
      "The Dane has gone from strength to strength over the last few weeks and his confidence is flowing. He had the audacity to take a swing from the edge of the box, and the execution was perfect. Arsenal goalkeeper Raya had no chance as the ball kissed the crossbar on its way into the net.",
      "Carrick made a bold decision to start Dorgu in the Manchester derby and he vindicated that selection by scoring. Dorgu would have felt 10ft tall in training this week, and he probably wouldn't have attempted the shot without that belief.",
      "The importance of corners",
      "Before facing United, Arsenal had scored 24 goals from set pieces in all competitions this season - the most by any team in Europe's top five leagues. They have earned a reputation as being deadly from set-plays during Arteta's tenure, and it was clear that United had been prepared for that threat.",
      "Casemiro cleared the first Arsenal corner of the game, winning the header amongst a scrum of bodies, and Maguire reacted by enthusiastically applauding him as if he'd scored a goal.",
      "Every corner felt like an event, and there was a sense of anticaption around the ground when United conceded a set-play. The players fed off that energy, and Dalot whipped up his teammates as United prepared for Arsenal's second corner of the match, which was successfully cleared.",
      "Carrick prepared his side in training to deal with set-pieces. United conceded from two corners at the Emirates in December 2024, and work had been done to ensure they would not suffer the same fate.",
      "However, it's still difficult to stop Arsenal from corners, even when you prepare to face their threat. They piled bodies into the box, and Senne Lammens was crowded when Merino scored to make it 2-2.",
      "Casemiro appreciation",
      "Casemiro turned to the bench and first pumped when Mbeumo equalised in the 34th minute. United celebrated in the corner, and Casemiro briefly considered saving his legs before deciding to join in.",
      "It was announced earlier in the week that he will leave United upon the expiry of his contract. The Brazilian is hugely popular with matchgoers and was serenaded by the away section.",
      "United are set to sign a replacement for Casemiro in the summer transfer window, and it will be a good sign if his successor becomes half as popular with fans.",
      "Mbeumo's trademark",
      "Mbeumo scored his ninth goal of the season to fire United back into the game, and he used the same celebration as he did against Liverpool at Anfield, outstretching his arms.",
      "He used the same celebration when he scored against Tottenham in November, and it feels like it's becoming Mbeumo's trademark to wheel it out when he scores against 'big' clubs.",
      "It must be irritating for opposition fans to see Mbeumo celebrating in front of them like that. The 26-year-old has been a brilliant signing and possesses the kind of confidence that you need to represent United.",
      "Carrick was composed",
      "Luke Shaw received tactical instructions from Carrick while United celebrated their equaliser. Carrick moved his hands while he was locked in conversation, and he appeared to ask to move the ball quicker.",
      "Some managers may have got carried away in the euphoria of the goal on the touchline, but Carrick remained composed and used the time to pass on instructions after spotting something that could be improved.",
      "Remarkably, Carrick did not even show emotion when Cunha scored to make it 3-2. Instead, he began a dialogue with his backroom staff. There was finally a release of emotion from the 44-year-old at full-time.",

His future remains uncertain with United keen to keep the 31-year-old but Fernandes set to demand a wage hike if he is to sign a new contract.",

      "Michael Carrick praised the way Matheus Cunha channelled his disappointment at not starting either of Manchester United's wins against Manchester City and Arsenal, after coming off the bench to have a major impact in both matches.",
      "Cunha got an assist at Old Trafford when he created Patrick Dorgu's goal but was the hero of the hour at the Emirates, firing in a stunning winning goal from 25 yards just moments after Mikel Merino had equalised for Arsenal.",
      "That capped off a madcap game in North London, with United coming from behind to lead 2-1 after goals from Bryan Mbeumo and a thunderbolt from Dorgu, but Carrick felt Cunha's reaction to being dropped summed up the spirit on show in the first two weeks of his spell in charge.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"Matheus coming on and having a big impact again, like he did last week,\" Carrick said. \"Creating a goal last week. I really fancied him to score. Again, fantastic finish. Kind of epitomises probably what, as a group, what the what we've been like this week. Matheus has not started both games, but he's had a real big impact and he's been disappointed not to start, but he's used it in a really good way.",
      "\"Two huge moments and he totally deserves that winning goal for that, how he's applied himself all week and I'm absolutely delighted for him.\"",
      "Dorgu's 20-yard volley had given United the lead and although it was a stunning finish, Carrick was pleased with the quality of the move leading to the goal and hailed the impact of the Dane in his first two games in charge.",
      "\"The move for Pat was a really good move, and the connection through the pitch, but to finish it the way he did was some finish,\" he said.",
      "\"Pat's been a big player for us over the last couple of games. I think in so many ways, attacking wise, obviously he scored two goals, but I think in terms of the threat and his athleticism and his quality coming in as well, and connections. I think the defensively he's been immense as well, down the side with Luke and doubling up against two teams that ask a lot of questions down the side",
      "\"It's a big, big job for him and I'm delighted for him because the two goals he scored, very different goals, but you get that because he's put so much into the performances. It's nice to see him smiling and happy.\"",
      "Dorgu came off towards the end after clutching the back of his leg but Carrick is hopeful it was just a bout of cramp.",
      "\"Hopefully a little bit of cramp, hopefully it's nothing worse, but he ended up coming up like that and just shows what he's put in, really, to the performance,\" he said. \"At this stage it's hard to tell, so we'll just have to wait and see, but yeah, for sure we're hoping that it's not too bad.\"",

Dalot once again started at full-back for United as Michael Carrick stuck with the 4-2-3-1 system.",
      "After an even start it was the Gunners who took the lead as Lisandro Martinez inadvertently turned the ball into his own net. Less than 10 minutes later, United were back level as Bryan Mbeumo capitalised on a poor back pass to round David Raya and equalise.",
      "With the scores level at the break, United hit the front through Patrick Dorgu's incredible strike which crashed in via the crossbar. Just six minutes of normal time were remaining when it looked as though Carrick's side would have to settle for the point as Mikel Merino squeezed the ball over the line after a scramble in the United area.",
      "But up stepped substitute Matheus Cunha to win the game with three minutes of normal time remaining as the Reds moved up to fourth. It has been a mixed season for United with the players and former head coach Ruben Amorim coming under fire for their performances.",

      "\"As long as I wear this shirt, I will not hide myself, I will not play the victim.",

      "When Ratcliffe left the stadium, he was asked if he could speak to reporters. \"No, no, no,\" he said before adding, \"just get the smile\" and gesturing that his lips were sealed. Then the United co-owner was asked whether he was happy with the result, and he responded: \"Very, yeah.\"",

      "Manchester United's players celebrate with Patrick Dorgu during the victory over Arsenal(Image: Ben STANSALL / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"You can feel the anxiety every time Patrick touches the ball. I can feel the anxiety,\" a deflated Ruben Amorim said about Patrick Dorgu following the inexcusable defeat to 10-man Everton back in November. In the next four Premier League matches, the Dane played a total of 30 minutes with the trust seemingly gone.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui and Amad's departures for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) meant Dorgu was thrust back into the United team in a more advanced role. Since then, Dorgu has started every Premier League match. In the three games the Dane has played since Amorim left, he has bagged two goals and an assist.",
      "The evolution of Dorgu has been as impressive as it has been surprising. When Dorgu signed in January 2025 he became, on paper at least, the only natural wing-back at United. Amad developed into a wing-back but his natural position was, and still remains, as a winger.",
      "Diogo Dalot, Luke Shaw and Mazraoui were all full-backs or centre-backs adapted to the wing-back role. And yet, when Dorgu was played there on the left, there was clearly something missing. You could see he was more comfortable attacking than defending but when in the final third, so many times his crosses let him down.",
      "When he received the ball in the box or was presented with a chance to shoot, Amorim was right - he did look nervous. \"You remember the shot against Everton,\" the former United head coach explained two months ago. \"That was easier than the decision he had to make [playing for Denmark] against Scotland.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"He made a great decision, and I saw it when he played in Italy. But here it is different, and sometimes the pressure is hard for them in the beginning, but he has time to improve.\"",
      "If that chance against Everton fell to Dorgu now, you can almost guarantee he would bury it. While Amorim was right about Dorgu at the time, it seems the 21-year-old has flourished thanks to the confidence injected into the dressing room by Michael Carrick's arrival.",
      "His two recent goals are clear evidence of that. Against Manchester City, Dorgu showed his attacking capabilities as he was the only man alert at the back post, he gambled and got his just rewards for doing so.",
      "Following his strike against Newcastle earlier in the season, we knew Dorgu had a wonder goal in his locker and so he proved again at Arsenal. But these are not just lucky pot shots which Dorgu is taking - you can see he is more comfortable having the ball at his feet and driving play forward these days.",
      "\"Patrick Dorgu looked like such an average wing-back under Ruben Amorim,\" Gary Neville concluded during the victory at the Emirates Stadium. \"Further forward he looks like a completely and utterly different player.\"",
      "And that is where the lesson must lie in this. Dorgu has become an undroppable for United now, unquestionably.",
      "However, this is only on the condition he remains in the attacking midfield three. The Dane may have been signed as a wing-back but his true strengths lie as a forward.",
      "Keep him fit and Dorgu could now be a real game-changer for United in the second half of the season. Looking on from afar, Amorim will not believe it.",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Casado, 22, has also been linked with Wolves and Atletico Madrid, as well as United, with speculation around the talented midfielder’s future continuing to swirl.",
      "United have been heavily linked with signing a new midfielder this year, with Cadado one of the players mentioned as a potential candidate to replace Casemiro this summer.",
      "With United being linked with signing Casado, there have also been tentative suggestions of a swap deal involving Rashford being agreed upon for this summer.",
      "However, the chances of a deal of any kind for Casado and United may seem unlikely after Barcelona boss Hansi Flick dismissed the possibility of the midfielder leaving the Camp nou.",

      "Gary Neville argued that Michael Carrick has succeeded in stripping things back for Manchester United in a way Ruben Amorim never quite managed, even though the Portuguese manager imposed a strict, no‑nonsense approach that demanded clear, concise instructions without overwhelming players with detail.",
      "Amorim, during his spell in charge, outlawed three practices: using international breaks as mini‑vacations, bringing food into the dressing room on matchdays, and allowing coaches to burden players with overly complex instructions. Although Amorim introduced those rules with the right intentions, his methods never truly took hold, and the squad struggled to adjust to his 3‑4‑3 setup.",
      "In contrast, Carrick has come in and made an immediate impact, switching to a 4‑2‑3‑1 that has produced convincing wins over Manchester City and league‑leaders Arsenal.",
      "Speaking on his 'The Gary Neville podcast' about the Reds' quick turnaround, Neville said: \"Michael Carrick, he's definitely instilled the simplicity of it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, it's my favourite system.",
      "\"We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. Still not at a point to get carried away but certainly at a point to suggest now that Manchester United have an unbelievable opportunity from where they were, ten/two weeks ago before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point, it's a remarkable turn around.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "\"Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's been said to them and we don't know what's been said in that training ground but they are responding like they weren't before. Why? We'll always speculate.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused as we all are in terms of the flip. The magic has returned in the last week. The magic seems to have returned to the club momentarily, the feeling of how to play with the aggression, with the risk, with the great goals, with the attack, the speed, the counter attack - it feels right.",
      "\"One thing this last week has told us, no matter where it leads to, is that that is the way Manchester United have to play because it's just felt right watching them. That might not lead to Champions League football, who knows what's going to happen, I think they'll finish in the Champions League now. They are better than what they've shown and they've proved it in these last two games they've really proved they can get compact, they can stay together, they can be aggressive in their shape - they can spring out of that shape and they can play good football and counterattack and hurt teams, and they can score great goals and get bodies in the box.",
      "Neville continued: \"That's it, I'm not simplifying football but there is a simplicity to how United do play football with width and excitement and then obviously all of them getting back as quickly as they can together. So, I don't want to overcomplicate things but I've really enjoyed watching them this last seven/eight days because I can watch this every day of the week.",
      "Michael Carrick has won two of his first games in charge of Man United(Image: Getty Images)",
      "\"It's a beautiful form of football, they've been brilliant in everything that they've done and they've beat two very, very good sides - the best two sides in the league and they've beat them which means, the players now, moving forward, have got no excuse.\"",

      "The 33-year-old moved to Old Trafford from Real Madrid in August 2022 for a fee rising to £70million, signing a four-year deal with an option for a further season. But the club have decided against triggering that extension, and the MEN understands the decision was made well before Thursday's announcement as part of their long-term planning.",

Casemiro arrived from Real Madrid in 2022 in a deal rising to as much as £70m, scoring 21 times in his 146 games so far from the base of United's midfield.",
      "After helping the squad to a League Cup and FA Cup win, there had been calls to sell the ageing midfielder, but this season has shown that he is still more than capable of being a key man, most recently at the derby win over Manchester City. Posting on his Instagram account, Casemiro said: \"Knowing when stages come to an end. Knowing when to say goodbye when you feel that you will be remembered and respected forever.",
      "\"Four months to give my all for this badge and for our goal. Eternal respect and affection for Manchester United and its wonderful fans. Forever Red Devil.\"",

      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Commenter Antw writes: \"People underestimate how good Casemiro actually is. He’s had a few off games, but when we played Lyon at Old Trafford & miraculously won, Casemiro had a part to play in all of the last 3 goals. He won the penalty, he set up Mainoo & also set up Maguire. Unfortunately his legs are giving up.\"",
      "Chrisssssss says: \"Yeah sad to see him go, but realistically seems like a sensible decision. Always more humble than I imagined.\"",

      "For others, thoughts are already turning to what comes next for United's midfield. 1968red says: \"Well at least it will free up a few quid for a replacement, but it's been money well spent since we signed him. Wish him all the best and thanks for the memories Cas.\"",
      "Rightwing7 wants to see a similar character come in through the door: \"One of the best, if not the best DM in football history. Unfortunately for us, we got only 30% of the best Casemiro, but he give us 100% of what was left in his tank. Never complaining, 100% professional. Wish we can get a young 'Case', like the one when he was in his prime. All my respect for a fantastic football player, and I wish him well in future.\"",
      "Some would even like to see him remain at United in a different capacity. On our Facebook page, Ng Yoon Fatt says: \"This guy is a fantastic professional. He could be an inspiration to our kids in the academy. Personally, I would want to keep him, of course at the right price.\"",

      "Tyrell Malacia could still leave Manchester United this month(Image: )",
      "Manchester United are yet to make a decision on whether Tyrell Malacia will be allowed to leave Old Trafford this month, with clubs in Europe interested in signing the left-back.",
      "Malacia was placed in the 'bomb squad' in the summer and made available for transfer, only to remain at the club for the first half of the season with no deal struck.",
      "The 26-year-old was reintegrated into the first-team squad in October and has made the bench for 13 of the last 15 games in all competitions, but he has been used only once when coming on as an 88th-minute substitute against Newcastle on Boxing Day.",
      "It's been a frustrating year for the Netherlands international, who joined PSV Eindhoven on loan for the second half of last season but returned to his parent club after making 12 appearances, with just six starts.",
      "There has been interest in Malacia from clubs in Italy, Spain and Turkey this month, but it is understood there is no move imminent. The former Feyenoord defender has just five months remaining on his United contract and will be released at the end of the season if a deal isn't done this month, although he is keen to get more games under his belt.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He was the only one of five players placed in Amorim's infamous 'bomb squad' who didn't end up leaving Old Trafford in the summer. Antony, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford all secured moves away, either permanently or on loan.",
      "Malacia played 45 minutes for United's Under-21s against Wolves earlier this month, scoring in a 4-1 win. He has proven his fitness since missing 517 days with two serious knee injuries.",
      "He made his comeback in an EFL Trophy game against Huddersfield in November 2024 and went on to make eight further appearances for United before his move to PSV last January.",
      "Malacia's place in the matchday squad could be in jeopardy, with Noussair Mazraoui set to return from Africa Cup of Nations duty with Morocco before Sunday's trip to Arsenal. Mazraoui offers full-back cover on the left and right, while Luke Shaw is the first-choice at left-back in Michael Carrick's back four.",
      "Patrick Dorgu can also play at left-back, although he played on the wing in the win against Manchester City last weekend. United also have the highly rated 18-year-old Diego Leon in their ranks.",

      "The summer transfer mission for Manchester United is clear: it's time to sign a midfielder.",
      "The club have been putting off their next big investment in the central ranks for some time now, having put their focus into improving other areas such as the backline and the attacking options.",
      "Now, it's time for the centre of the park. While that seemed likely to be the focus of the recruitment team anyway, that need has been accelerated due to Casemiro's situation.",
      "Man United have confirmed that Casemiro will leave the club this summer at the end of his contract, with the decision made not to trigger the extra year that is included as a clause in his deal.",
      "The Brazilian was one of the last major investments in the midfield, with around £60m spent on securing him from Real Madrid in 2022.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "While there have been some highlights, it seems United are keen to move on and look at the future beyond the 33-year-old, which puts greater emphasis on their deals in the summer.",
      "So, with that said, here's a look at a few potential replacements for Casemiro in the transfer market, and what they could offer the team in the years ahead.",
      "Adam Wharton has already proved he has the skills and qualities to slot into any Premier League squad at present. However, given he is currently wanted by the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City, Liverpool and Spurs, United will face stiff competition in securing his services this summer.",
      "A fee north of £65m could also await any interested parties, given the 21-year-old is already Premier League proven.",
      "While Wharton is thought to be United's main interest at present, it is thought that Elliot Anderson is also being monitored. The 23-year-old has been a shining light in a struggling Nottingham Forest squad this season, but a deal will not come cheap.",
      "That's because the Tricky Trees have reportedly slapped Anderson with a price tag of around £100m.",
      "United pursued Carlos Baleba for the majority of the summer, only to be put off by Brighton's £100m valuation of the 22-year-old. An interest still remains in the midfielder and it will be interesting to see if the Seagulls' stance on letting him leave the south coast changes this summer.",
      "Joao Gomes has excelled with Wolves despite the club staring directly down the barrel of imminent relegation. The MEN reported earlier this week that a loan with an obligation to buy for the 24-year-old would be a most likely move. Wolves reportedly want £40m to let him leave midway through 2025/26.",
      "Like Baleba, United found themselves linked with Real Madrid's Eduardo Camavinga in the summer. The 23-year-old has been a revelation at the Bernabeu, with Arsenal and Liverpool said to be monitoring him. It was reported last month that Los Blancos will listen to offers around the £87m mark."

      "Manchester United could fall out of the top 10 of the Deloitte Football Money League next season, after plummeting to eighth in the latest report, their lowest-ever position in its 29-year history.",
      "The report takes into account United's miserable 2024/25 season, when they finished 14th in the Premier League and suffered defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final. A total revenue of €793million for the season puts them below domestic rivals Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal.",
      "Although there was an increase in matchday and commercial revenues, there was a substantial year-on-year fall in broadcast revenues and the trend is set to continue into next season.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "United will play just 20 matches at Old Trafford this season and have no European football at all, leading to fears their place in the top 10 in the established Deloitte report could be at risk.",
      "\"I think it’s reflective of the tough times that the club’s going through and there's a genuine fear that they could fall out of the top 10 next season. Sir Jim Ratcliffe describes them as the world's leading football brand, but if the world's leading football brand is outside of the top 10 of revenue generators, then that's not very promising.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim steered United to the final of that competition in Bilbao, but even that didn't make up much of the shortfall to being outside of the Champions League at a time when a seat at Europe's top table is more financially rewarding than ever.",
      "\"With this new Swiss model, the Champions League is worth an absolute fortune,\" he said. \"And being in the second competition, you're probably getting around about a quarter of the money that you'd get.",
      "\"Even United getting to the final, they would have earned less money than the likes of City would have generated from being knocked out by Real Madrid in the play-off round.\"",
      "The value of Champions League football shows how important it is for United to secure a return to that competition this season after two successive years away.",
      "Last weekend's win against Manchester City in Michael Carrick's first game in charge has put them back in fifth, which should be good enough to qualify, although the league table remains congested.",
      "If Carrick can steer United back to the Champions League and they enjoy a good season next year, then it should put them back on track financially as well.",
      "\"One successful season can do it,\" explained Maguire. \"Every match at Old Trafford in the Champions League is worth £8million or £9million in terms of ticket sales, so you've got a minimum of four matches.",
      "\"You get to the quarter-finals, you're probably looking at six or seven, so that's £60million. They'll pick up £70million or £80million in prize money as a minimum if you get that far. That’s £150million, then you get the extra £10million from Adidas and other sponsors will be kicking in as well, so that’s the thick end of an extra £200million and they bounce back to where you would expect them to be.",
      "\"Paradoxically, Manchester United fans, from a financial point of view, should want City and Liverpool to do well in the Champions League because that will cement that fifth place, which could be the difference as far as next season is concerned.\"",

      "Known as Toninho, Cruz confirmed his departure on LinkedIn, and he is the latest scout to leave Old Trafford as the club follows the modern trend of using data and AI to aid their recruitment and player watching.",
      "A former lower-league player in Portugal, Cruz is one of dozens of full-time scouts to leave United over the past 12 months, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe's second round of redundancies including a slimming down of the scouting department.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "More than 80 full-time scouts were employed at that time, but swathes have been made redundant or moved on as director of recruitment Christopher Vivell seeks to overhaul what Ineos felt was an antiquated set-up.",
      "Writing on LinkedIn, Cruz said: “After 18 years at Manchester United as an International Scout, the time has come for me to close this important chapter of my career.",
      "“Thank you to everyone who has been part of this journey.”",
      "Cruz joined United in 2007 and as well as scouting first-team players in Portugal and Spain, he would offer valuable insight into Portuguese opponents ahead of European fixtures. His biggest success story from a recruitment perspective is helping scout Bruno Fernandes, who joined the club six years ago.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).(Image: )",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Manchester United are stepping up their interest in Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, positioning themselves to make the 21-year-old their marquee signing of the summer, though three Premier League rivals are primed to compete for his signature.",
      "The Red Devils view Wharton as a key piece in their ongoing midfield rebuild, with sources close to the club indicating that informal approaches have already been made to gauge the player’s availability.",
      "We first revealed way back in October 2024 that United are huge admirers of the Palace midfielder, and he remains top of the club’s shortlist alongside the likes of Brighton’s Carlos Baleba and Nottingham Forest’s Elliot Anderson.",
      "Despite United’s strong push for Wharton, competition remains fierce. Manchester City, Liverpool, and Newcastle United have all registered their interest, holding preliminary discussions with Wharton’s representatives.",
      "Liverpool, in particular, are understood to be aggressive suitors, with sources suggesting they have held fresh talks and that Wharton himself is open to a move to Merseyside. Some outlets even claim the Reds are frontrunners, potentially offering a long-term contract to secure his services.",
      "Newcastle’s involvement adds further intrigue, as Eddie Howe’s side seek to bolster their engine room amid ambitions to break into the top four consistently.",

      "At Selhurst Park, expectations are that Wharton will depart Palace when the season concludes.",
      "As we revealed in an update on January 20, sources indicate the chances of Wharton staying at Palace beyond this season are “almost zero”, putting his suitors on even higher alert.",
      "The talented deep-lying playmaker, who has impressed since his £18million move from Blackburn Rovers in February 2024, has established himself as one of the Premier League’s most promising young midfielders.",
      "His composure on the ball, tactical intelligence, and ability to dictate tempo have drawn comparisons to top-class operators, have earned him three senior England caps and a place in Thomas Tuchel’s thinking ahead of the 2026 World Cup.",
      "This graph from football analysts, Gradient Sports, tells a story.",
      "Palace are set to demand a substantial fee – figures in the £65-80million range have been floated – to part with their prized asset, though some sources suggest they could hold out for closer to £100million total package given the bidding war potential.",
      "For United, landing Wharton would represent a statement of intent under their current regime, addressing long-standing deficiencies in central areas. However, with multiple elite clubs circling, negotiations promise to be protracted and costly. Landing a Champions League spot would help them massively as we’re told that, ideally, Wharton wants UCL football.",
      "As the January window nears its end, attention turns to the summer, where Wharton’s next destination could reshape several Premier League midfields.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",

      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Brentford, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 22 with three more games each.",
      "Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Fulham were only selected once more – on the March midweek when every team will be televised.",

      "Arsenal fans are fuming and nobody is entertained by what could be the worst Premier League champions ever.",
      "We also have thoughts on Man Utd and West Ham, but mostly Arsenal. Send your views to theeditor@football365.com",
      "",
      "Not a revolutionary take here, but Arteta seems to have prioritised control over a game over all facets. The concept of ball possession as a means of control isn’t new – especially seeing as Guardiola pioneered and then arguably perfected it – but I would argue that Arteta has pushed it farther than ever this season.",
      "We’re all familiar with ‘haram ball’, which refers to Arsenal’s stodgy and incredibly practical (and effective) approach to football – playing for corners and set pieces, prioritizing ball circulation, and restricting the opponent’s ability to create chances above all else.",
      "Even as an Arsenal supporter, it’s been hard to watch. The biggest effect this has on players is that it rewards passive and sterile play over risk-taking actions, like letting fly from outside the box or going long. You can also see this from the lack of creative spark and output that previously effective players like Saka, Odegaard, Eze or Martinelli have displayed (at least in the Prem).",
      "I won’t argue that many teams set up to play into this almost half-court set from kickoff, especially at the Emirates. But United were different. You could argue that there was an element of luck to their goals (two great shots from outside the box and a giveaway), but it’s the aggression and desire to play forward that impressed me. If Zubimendi wasn’t trying to keep the ball at all costs, would he have tried an ill advised backwards pass when he could’ve tried open up his body and hit a forward in behind?",
      "Arteta has somehow ingrained in this team that losing the ball is always a bad thing, even if you’re trying to be creative and attacking. The entire offense at this point consists if feeding it to a wide player, who then vaguely tries to get to the byline and win a corner, or more often cut back and circle again.",
      "It’s hard to be happy with this sort of play, even if the results have been largely positive. At this point, it makes me question whether Arteta teaches any sort of attacking philosophy, interchange, or pattern, which is a real disappointment given how exciting the 22/23 team was. Arteta has managed to mold this team to be exactly what he wants, good or bad, and while I don’t think he needs to win the Prem to keep his job, his shortcomings are becoming clearer and clearer.\nKenny",
      "",
      "…It’s clear now that Arteta’s emphasis on controlling games may have blunted our attack. Our central players (Ødegaard, Rice and Eze) aren’t making enough runs into the box. I want to see them driving into the box for square balls and one-twos, it’d be interesting to see how we’d play with Eze and Ødegaard on at the same time with Rice backing them up. Otherwise far too much reliance on wingplay, link-ups with fullbacks and crosses has made us quite predictable in open play.",
      "The trouble is the risk from counter-attacks when our central players advance into the box. Can Rice cover this risk along with the back line? This is the trade-off that we have to consider but with the quality of Rice, Saliba and Gabriel with the added depth in the squad we could withstand this issue.",
      "Also hindsight is 20/20 but imagine if we’d signed Mbeumo or Cunha instead…\nVish (AFC), Melbourne",
      "",
      "…We’re 23 games into the season, Arsenal are still top of the table, and yet I’m struggling to remember a single attacking move or goal that genuinely excited me.",
      "That probably sounds ungrateful given the league position, but watching us week after week, I don’t see how this attacking setup wins a title. Most of our goals come from corners, second balls, or scrappy finishes off wide crosses. There’s almost no creativity through the middle, no willingness to shoot from distance, no moments where you feel a defence is about to be unlocked by something clever or unexpected.",
      "What’s worrying is that I’ve felt more entertained – and more hopeful – watching Wenger-era Arsenal sides that finished fourth than I do watching this team supposedly challenging for the title. Back then, even when we fell short, there was identity, invention, and a sense that something special might happen at any moment.",
      "This version of Arsenal feels efficient, controlled and sterile. That might be enough to stay near the top, but unless something changes creatively, I can’t see it being enough to go all the way.\nMubashir Iqbal, Gooner from Pakistan",
      "",
      "…So much wrong for Arsenal against United but to anyone that watches us weekly knew a result like that was coming.",
      "Liverpool would have beaten us, if they just tried a little harder. We’ve been playing this atrocious brand of football most of the season and especially since the Spurs game. No creativity, no spark, players coached to within an inch of their lives as the manager is so afraid of losing, he’s created a monster that is reliant upon results and he’s had them, quite a few to be fair but nothing that really states, we are going to be champions.",
      "So when a defeat comes, it’s going to look pretty ropey as the attention falls on the tactics. And they are not even what George Graham instilled in the club, at least they had an aura whilst playing hoofball.",
      "Time and again chances have presented themselves to show that we have character and the mettle. We’ve failed every single one. And a fourth year of it should absolutely spell the end of it if it happens again, barring a miraculous Champions League trophy.",
      "We are still 4 points clear. We should absolutely change the approach to football, playing with pace, intent and actually utilise the players we have properly. Odegaard, Saka, Martinelli have regressed and that’s down to their roles being very flat and one dimensional. Play them in the way we know they can win you matches. It’s not like our defence is that great either right now, so you need to play and not suddenly let Saliba be the creative force. Let the forwards be creative and take some risks.",
      "Thing is you know, I know, the Emirates knows, everyone everywhere knows, he’ll look to protect that 4 point lead rather than stretch it. And that will be the downfall. A trophyless season, and even the most ardent of Arteta fans will fall and there is no coming back from that.",
      "Sink or swim, Mr Arteta. Stop being scared.\nAli, Ealing",
      "",
      "Tickner mentioned in 16 Conclusions that United relied on two wonderstrikes to win, something he noted was “not a particularly repeatable tactic”. Later though, he described Cunha’s goal as “calmly curled in from 25 yards like it was a tap in”. Should we give more credit to strikes from distance as a repetitively effective tool to win football matches?",
      "First, save me the boring bollocks statisticians who will point to xG and all that nonsense. Maybe it’s nostalgia talking, but I hate feeling like the shot from distance is dying in favor of the Pep inspired robo-goal (slide it down the inside channel for a cut back and tap in from 7 yards) or the corners bundled over the line looking like playground scuffles.",
      "As a fan, when I think of memorable premier league goals, Gabriel scoring a header from a Declan Rice corner isn’t up there. It’s Morten Gamst Pedersen. It’s Erik Edman. It’s that one MOTD goal of the month selection in Dec 2006 that was worldie after worldie (think Scholes volley vs Villa won it but any of them would win goal of the season in more recent years) Even as an Arsenal fan I think of Henry vs Utd, or Bergkamp curling one in the top corner from 25 yards out.",
      "I smiled when Dorgu had a pop yesterday. Fair play. Also, might be worth continuing. For instance, United have scored 9 of their 41 PL goals from outside the box this year. Arsenal have scored 6 from their 42. United have significantly fewer touches in the opposition box than Arsenal manage, but yet shoot more in general (258 to 226), and hit the target more frequently from distance than Arsenal in the PL this season (70 to 48). In fact, of the 70-odd goals Arsenal have scored in all comps this season, 10 have come from outside the area and that’s including Martinelli’s actual tap-in after rounding Neuer at the half way line in the Champions League.",
      "United can score from a variety of different areas, and don’t shy away from an effort from distance. Maybe Arsenal need to take some stock in that tactic. To think the two of them have scored an almost identical amount of PL goals despite having such drastically different seasons so far is madness.",
      "Anyway, this is all just a roundabout way of supporting shots from outside the box!\nRocastle7 (and what about chips?! Why is nobody dinking keepers no more…?)",
      "",
      "An own goal, a scrambled in corner with 9 players crowding and elbowing the keeper, and they still cannot win a game. This Arteta side has to be the worst team to ever be at the summit of the league, and if they go on to win, the worst champions I’ve seen in my 33 years of life.",
      "It’s a cruel, morbid and ugly level of football where neither the defense is exciting, nor the attack. It’s purely set pieces and pray. Read somewhere they rank 17th in chances created from open play. That is just abysmal. There are no tactics, no plan of attack, no class.",
      "Please Emery & Villa, win the league! I am sure all 19 league clubs including City will be open to loaning you some top players for the season if you can stop this nonsense team from winning the league this year. Please do it for football’s sake. This is like if Hitler won the World War or Voldemort beat Harry Potter. Just bleak and grey.",
      "PS: I told y’all in my earlier mails Amorim was pure trash, not even close to a real coach. And happy to be redeemed. Rubbish rubbish waste of time and resources. Carrick doing the bare basics right has got the team functioning like an actual team again & not a reflection of an egotistical scam artist.\nAman (Ballon D’orgu time)",
      "",
      "…The thing about Arsenal is they always try to walk it in The thing about Arsenal is they always play for corners and just pack the 6 yard box with players so the keeper can’t come out to claim the ball. That’s why a lot of people don’t like this iteration of Arsenal.",
      "They’ve spent close to a billion pounds on players just to pack the 6 yard box with 6 foot + monsters and try to glitch their way to a league title. Like that one fella who found a character in Street Fighter, with a move that can’t be stopped, and spams the same thing over and over. Sure he might have won but no one particularly liked them.",
      "We saw a prime example of it at the weekend with the Merino goal. Arsenal fans will grasp at straws and say the deliveries are excellent from Rice and Saka. No they’re not. Any professional footballer should be able to cross a ball like that when they know the keeper is essentially pinned to his line. It’s a legit tactic, and Arsenal may very well spam enough corners before the end of the season to get them over the line, but don’t be surprised when even Liverpool fans are cheering on Man Utd against you. We’ll all be there if it goes wrong.",
      "Wenger’s words at the weekend said it all. Even he’s not enjoying watching it.\nDavid, Ireland",
      "",
      "United have had two brilliant results since Carrick was installed as interim coach. However if i hear another ex United player talk about DNA or he knows the club I’ll scream.",
      "There are a few simple reasons which have contributed to United looking like an actual good side. Most are just things which Amorim was just too stubborn to change.",
      "1. Formation to 4-2-3-1.\n2. Fernandes playing as a No. 10\n3. Midfield looking better defensively.\n4. Two experienced centre-backs\n5. More effort and more running.",
      "There are obviously some tactical tweaks Carrick has made as well but please stop the DNA BS.\nKen, Cork, Ireland",
      "READ: Man Utd and Carrick show succeeding Amorim to be simplest job in football",
      "",
      "Very mixed feelings this weekend. Great performance and result against a poor Sunderland. Fernandes is now arguably our most important player (Jared must be relieved to have someone even close to how brilliant he has been for so long), and at 21 is bound to be a massive star sooner rather than later.",
      "Gut wrenching to read your (correct) article about the vultures already circling. The Paqueta situation is confusing and depressing. Though, for what it’s worth, it’s 3 wins out of 3 without him. Brentford not showing up at all against Forest today was excruciatingly infuriating.",
      "However, I’d rather we were where we are now, on a good run of form, with a couple of new players providing competition for places, than wondering where the next win is coming from (cough, Palace, cough). As grim as the table looks, this feels a bit like the 2003 season when 18th place went down with 42 points (yes, us, with Joey Cole, Carrick, Kanoute, Sinclair, Defoe and Di Canio. Sorry, just throwing up again for the thousandth time). I feel like there will be a team or two that unexpectedly get dragged into a relegation battle. Maybe that’s just wishful thinking, but you have to have hope eh…",
      "On that note, I’ve just looked at Spud’s February fixtures. Hmm…. And with that in mind, I was amused by Mr Tickner’s emotional defense of his Spud’s “Big Six” position in that made up group. Perhaps he doth protest too much??",
      "Wasn’t sure whether he was saying that the Deloitte money table proves that Spurs are massive (the fact that we are in the top 20 globally surely makes that a farcical irrelevance), or whether the fact that they are playing in an, admittedly, hugely watered down CL system, is some kind of evidence.",
      "I’m glad that Spuds fans are so comfortable with their 17th place last year and 15th place right now, and can look to their “Big Six” status to gain such confidence and comfort. Whilst still unlikely that they will actually go down of course, I’d love to read Dave’s article next season explaining at his usual massive length how huge and important his team is, whilst in the Champo. We live in hope eh!\nMike, COYI"

      "The Premier League has gone a little bit sack crazy. Managergeddon is upon us and we are entirely here for the drama.",
      "Five clubs have changed manager since September. One has already done so twice, and another may yet follow that path. If/when that happens Nuno Espirito Santo will have lost not one but two Premier League jobs within mere months of getting Nottingham Actual Forest into Europe.",
      "But a couple of wins have eased the pressure on Nuno – a couple of wins really is all it takes to transform this market currently – and apparently even a grim point at Burnley is enough to save Thomas Frank, among whose latest crimes is wandering around Bournemouth with a little Arsenal coffee cup in his hands and also losing to the aforementioned Nuno in El Sackico. And – this bit feels important – serving up some of the least watchable football on Premier League record. It is surely ‘when’ not ‘if’ territory there.",
      "And it now looks like Arne Slot rather than Frank or Nuno will be the latest ‘winner’ here as Liverpool’s fraudulent unbeaten run finally came to an end at Bournemouth, who like West Ham, have been rejuvenated by Frank and Dr Tottenham.",
      "Frank, of course, only moved to Spurs in the summer to replace Ange Postecoglou who has already been hired and sacked by Nottingham Forest since then, while the true lay of the land at big clubs is laid bare by the fact two of the Big Six have binned off managers not for unacceptable results on the pitch but for unacceptable failure to acknowledge infallible wisdom and brilliance of their boardroom superiors. It is immensely modern football and there is almost zero chance we’ve seen the last of the managergeddon for the season. Not by a long chalk.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs, any one of whom really could, if they’re not careful, accidentally end up manager of Tottenham before the season is out.",

      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot and control in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are still absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable, and even now with 15 games to go both options appear tantalisingly plausible.",

      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Eight wins in the bag already and more points than any of the promoted-relegated teams managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season. The comeback victory over Bournemouth was evidence, if indeed it was still required, that Sunderland are proper, as was beating beleaguered Palace at home.",
      "Success against Newcastle on derby day has us firmly into ‘manager of the year’ territory for one of the big pre-season Sack Race favourites.",
      "",
      "Extraordinary season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks earlier it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run reached 12 wins in 13 Premier League games to lift Villa right through the mid-table slop, then into the top four, and then genuine title contention. And for the first 45 minutes at the Emirates it really did look like they might stick around for much longer.",
      "Despite a slightly sticky run including that ultimately heavy defeat at the Arsenal, Villa are still in there scrapping. An impressive victory at Newcastle coupled with Arsenal’s defeat to Man United has brought the gap back down to four points while keeping Villa well clear of any real risk of losing their grip on a Champions League place.",
      "Six wins in seven games have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle and Sunderland added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive effort in trying circumstances.",
      "That Brentford now sit cosily in mid-table, five points clear of their former manager and his supposedly greener pastures is quite something.",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the last international break. But just when we thought it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbled up, an impressive win over Sunderland and a restorative visit to Tottenham have sorted things out.",
      "Seven wins and two draws in 12 Premier League games since the November international break have lifted Fulham well away from the relegation battle and into the mid-table strivers, significantly lessening the real risk that either Silva or Fulham might do something they live to regret.",
      "",
      "The hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer even after their very good week. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faced the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, saw Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, but that run has gone surprisingly well. The narrow loss to Man City preceded a rare home win against Chelsea and comeback draw against Liverpool.",
      "The question now is whether Leeds and Farke have really hit on something sustainable, or this is merely delaying the inevitable. After the 4-1 win against Crystal Palace and a very decent point at Sunderland, it really does start to look like it might be the latter which has enormous repercussions for both Farke and several other names around him on this list.",
      "Enormously impressive even in heartbreaking defeat at Newcastle in a wild 4-3 that earned instant classic status. Key now is to ensure that it doesn’t throw them off course, because once the initial pain subsides there is no reason why it should. Victory over Fulham suggests they’ve taken it on the chin.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have had to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirmed Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Spurs (from 2-0 up) and Wolves and West Ham (twice), for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "We still subscribe to the view that every team between about seventh and 14th is equally good/bad and that no major judgement for good or bad should be based on whichever arbitrary position has been handed to them this week.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that as climbing into the top six demonstrates. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "",
      "Remained powerfully unsackable even in the depths of one of those long forlorn runs of relegation form that Bournemouth have oft indulged in under Iraola. And now they’re back doing the other thing they do after dramatic 3-2 wins over Spurs and Liverpool.",
      "A streaky manager of a streaky team, then, but with relegation only a distant prospect after the prognostications of doom when he had to sell pretty much his entire defence in the summer he remains firmly in credit and back in contention for all the many ridiculous Big Six jobs that are or will be available during the summer.",
      "",
      "Instantly unseated Eddie Howe and Thomas Frank at the top of the list of Premier League managers to sound most like a High Performance Podcast guest with that absurd cack about ageing men.",
      "This is Chelsea, so he absolutely could be gone before the end of the season. But this is managergeddon, and there’s almost no chance at least one other poor sod doesn’t go first. Which is for the best. We’d hate to think of Rosenior being forced out of Chelsea before he’s had any real chance to age any men at all.",
      "",
      "Might actually have made Wolves… quite good? Certainly a lot less bad, anyway. It is still almost certainly too little, too late, but that’s also not really Rob Edwards’ fault either.",
      "The first win of the season was a cathartic dismantling of a doom-laden West Ham, and it didn’t come out of a clear blue sky either. There had been signs of life even in defeat at Arsenal and Liverpool, before running away giggling from Old Trafford with a point.",
      "After a draw at Everton and another at home to Newcastle, that run became six points from four games. That’s a pretty big deal when you only managed two from the previous 18 games.",
      "Stranger things have happened, but admittedly not many. And most of them in the actual Stranger Things. On balance, Wolves would also probably rather believe in a wild conspiracy theory that suggests this current season has actually been entirely fake and that the real ending is yet to be revealed.",
      "",
      "Decision time for Burnley. There are two options available, and they prompt inevitable questions.",
      "Option one: Burnley decide to really try and beat relegation, and must decide whether they think Parker is the best man for that job.",
      "Option two: Burnley accept their overwhelmingly likely fate, and must decide whether Parker the best man to get them back up again.",
      "Parker’s job prospects likely rest on the decision. Because if it is indeed option two, he has a compelling case. Option one? He’s f*cked.",
      "But the longer he remains in place, the greater the chance that option two is the one. And right now he’s doing just enough to keep the wolves (literal and figurative) from the door.",
      "",
      "A 4-1 thumping of Everton followed a simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass and – with absolutely nobody in there being actually any good at all – have now managed to get themselves right to the very top of it, firmly back into the Champions League equation, via nothing more complicated than three straight wins.",
      "The 4-3 victory over Leeds was admittedly quite complicated, but also just tremendously exciting. Pure Newcastle heritage. The drab 0-0 at Wolves, not so much, while a limp home defeat to Aston Villa has Howe once again under fire.",
      "Few things better sum up the volatility of the sack race that Howe, who was only a fortnight ago celebrating three straight wins, is now level with…",
      "",
      "It’s been quite a year for Nuno. He ended 2024 as our manager of the year; he ended 2025 looking in imminent danger of his second sacking of the season.",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth left things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "But quite why Nuno had to be so very Nuno in the way he, on the back of 3-1 and 3-2 wins and a 2-2 draw, decided to approach a home game against a Liverpool team that had just suffered three consecutive three-goal defeats, is puzzling, irritating and, above all, a reminder that he is here as a firefighter and that the marriage to a fanbase with limited patience for drab and functional let’s-not-get-relegated football is merely one of convenience.",
      "However, for neither the first nor last time, Tottenham have come to the rescue. The momentum from last week’s vital win at Spurs has been parlayed into another over Sunderland to rekindle dwindling survival hopes for both club and manager.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield and joyful spangling of Tottenham should be enough to buy any manager coming into a relegation-haunted club serious time.",
      "But Mr Marinakis’ lair is never a safe place for any manager to lurk, and there have been a pair of honking defeats against Everton and a weirdly rubbish performance against Brighton as well that will have had one of 2025’s key supervillains twitching over his big red sack button once more.",
      "Looked in very serious trouble when trailing at half-time against West Ham; Forest’s first win in a Premier League game they’d been losing at half-time since 1997 was enormously well timed. Going out of the FA Cup at Wrexham not so much.",
      "Victory at Brentford has given Forest and Dyche a bit of breathing space despite West Ham’s recent improvements, but it does look like we’ve got a multi-team battle to avoid one relegation spot and that is going to make everyone twitchy.",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite continued (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is as they eye ‘two’ alternatives, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Somehow, despite themselves, City have managed to just about remain in the title race. But they are so unconvincing in how they’re going about it. If/when Arsenal do manage to make their superiority properly count in the league table, will Pep decide to sod it all for a game of soldiers? Possibly yes, but almost no chance that happens before at least one other Big Six team pulls the trigger.",
      "",
      "Definitely leaving at the end of the season, and very probably before that given the extent to which this relationship now appears to be breaking down with Palace currently matching Spurs stride for pitiful stride in freefalling towards the trapdoor.",
      "He’s currently among the names being considered by Manchester United for the permanent manager’s job that is set to be available this summer. And that’s before we mention Liverpool and Spurs. He really does deserve a crack at a big job; it’s just a shame really that they are all, in their way, so very silly.",
      "But so too are Palace. They are without a win in 11 games – a run that even includes airily dismissing the help of Dr Tottenham – and have achieved an FA Cup first as a top-flight side in managing to be eliminated by a sixth-tier one. This is all either very bad or very clever timing, depending on how you view the desirability of those various Big Six options.",
      "The prospect of Glasner walking long before his contract expires sounds very real.",
      "",
      "There have been good days and bad – losing at home to West Ham felt like the latter – and our whole pondering of Frank’s situation at Spurs has been about determining which of the two would eventually win out. The harrowing NLD-PSG-Fulham week was the first time he really did look f*cked.",
      "Spurs were timid and abysmal in the North London Derby, the second big London derby in a row which Frank had approached more in the manner of a League One manager attempting to avoid a paddling in the FA Cup third round than a legitimate rival facing a familiar foe.",
      "There was some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat at PSG, but even the very fact it’s possible to write the words ‘some encouragement in a 5-3 Champions League defeat’ is in its own way damning.",
      "But at least those two defeats came against what genuinely might be the two best teams in Europe at this time. With all due respect to Fulham and the sterling work of Marco Silva in recent years, they are not one of the two best teams in Europe at this time, and they were still much better than Spurs who torpedoed themselves inside the opening seven minutes to extend their extraordinarily – and in fairness largely pre-Frank – awful home record in the Premier League to three wins in 21 games since an increasingly odd-looking 4-1 win over Aston Villa in November last year.",
      "Frank’s response to the booing of Guglielmo Vicario after his hideous blunder was firmly in the ‘That’s true, but he shouldn’t say it’ category. And the way he went about it was all wrong.",
      "There should have been some acknowledgement that the booing of Vicario, unsavoury and unhelpful as it may have been, did not burst forth from a clear blue sky but instead a bubbling frustration from fans who pay among the highest ticket prices in the country to watch what is now among the worst and least effective football in the country.",
      "To instead label those supporters – and the boos did not come from a tiny minority inside the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – not real Spurs fans was another gaffe that pushes the manager further towards the exit.",
      "Until that point we’d felt the obvious comparisons between Thomas Frank and Nuno Espirito Santo didn’t quite fit.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big games has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "However, from there Spurs went to Newcastle and got a draw (albeit a ludicrous one) before they had a dominant 2-0 win against Frank’s old club Brentford, which everyone at Spurs sorely needed. It was easily their most convincing Premier League performance since the win at City on matchday two and a result that could have been even more compelling.",
      "They then pretty much secured a Champions League play-off round spot at the very least with a fine 3-0 win over Slavia Prague.",
      "But Spurs are Spurs, so they followed that with the worst performance yet of Frank’s reign in a truly inept and miserable 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Bringing Joao Palhinha and Ben Davies on to try and hold on to a 2-0 defeat and not even managing that feels uncomfortably like the infamous Nuno Moment against Manchester United.",
      "Have reached the kind of state where a dreadful home defeat to a very poor Liverpool is being dressed up as ‘signs of encouragement’. In reality, it might have been the worst possible result; still a defeat, yet one that risks extending the increasingly obviously doomed reign of the latest manager to be chewed up and spat out by the country’s most preposterous football club.",
      "The win at Palace was welcome if deeply unconvincing, while the sheer small-timery of a mind-meltingly dull goalless draw at Brentford really might have hurt Frank more than any of the many, many defeats. Or at least we thought that before they somehow contrived to Dr Tottenham their way to a 3-2 defeat at a Bournemouth side on a horrific streak while Frank was holding an Arsenal-branded cup.",
      "That and the fact the winning goal was scored by Antoine Semenyo with his last kick for Bournemouth before toddling off to pass the next two years on Man City’s bench were just the latest reminders that Spurs are a club where ridiculous things happen routinely, and that Frank simply isn’t and never will be capable of dealing with that.",
      "And in a strange way, that’s to his credit. It does look like Spurs are determined to try and muddle through the season with the obviously doomed Frank at the wheel, and in an odd way his immediate future might have more to do with West Ham than Spurs. It is West Ham’s (admittedly Spurs-assisted) resurgence and with it the very real danger of relegation that might finally get the Spurs board to see what has been alarmingly obvious to the fans for many weeks now.",
      "The fact a draw at Burnley appears to be enough to keep him in place for another week is damning. We assume we’ve all by now twigged that Spurs are obviously going to beat Man City at the weekend, so he really might be here for a good while yet, somehow.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad. West Ham were wonderfully welcoming hosts on Sunday, but to such an inexplicable extent that it’s hard to know just how much to read into Liverpool’s 2-0 win at the London Stadium against opponents who were barely there. Predictably, they were poor in a 1-1 against proper team Sunderland and showed no backbone in the collapse at Leeds United, which was then followed by a distinctly unwelcome MO SALAH BOMBSHELL that does leave things looking distinctly like either he or the manager will have to go.",
      "A run of four consecutive wins cooled the immediate temperatures, but it all felt extremely precarious. The wins over Spurs and Wolves lacked any real authority. And then there were careless draws against Leeds and Fulham.",
      "There was another draw at Arsenal, though this was comfortably the most promising of their most recent stalemates. Still, this has not stopped Liverpool from coming up with a ‘contingency plan’, which might be enacted after drawing at home to Burnley and losing at Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "According to reports, Tottenham Hotspur have a ‘preferred option’ regarding a replacement for head coach Thomas Frank, though there are two ‘concerns’.",
      "One point from three games against what are now Spurs’ relegation rivals has Thomas Frank on the thinnest of ice. Who could replace him?",
      "Michael Carrick has revealed that he’s spoken to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since beating the Norwegian to the Man Utd interim head coach role.",
      "Tottenham will reportedly give Thomas Frank more time to turn things around despite their latest poor result against Burnley on Saturday.",
      "The Mailbox can’t see a way back for Liverpool boss Arne Slot or Tottenham head coach Thomas Frank after their latest poor results in the Premier League.",

That decision is neutered by yet again another pointless start for the Master of “Looking Busy whilst passing the ball one yard”, Fraudegaard. Again, Arsenal midfield lacks creativity, lethargic, soporific and dull. Arsenal to their credit finally manage a goal from open play (the opposition scored it naturally) Like Liverpool at home: the Fake Champions-elect are passive, cannot create and cannot score. This time, even Islington MAGA struggle to read out a beaming report of RECORD CROPS (because everyone can literally the barren vegetation outside their window). Their verdict? Errrrm. “The Oscars nominations disrupted the players!”",
      "Lads. Arteta is a Bottler. Arsenal are bottlers. It isn’t deep. They’ve had chance, after chance to wrap up this PL title – first at Forest when Citeh dropped points, then at home to a washed Slot Liverpool. I bet on ManYoo to win this match because Carrick showed against Citeh that he’s brave enough to attack and take risks – whereas, as I’ve eternally maintained, Arteta is a coward plain and simple. What laughable excuses can still be made for this Arteta guy? Imagine spending over £1bn and being schooled at home to Carrick!",

      "It’s been this way for 22 straight years now, and no amount of teeth-gnashing denial, or laughable spin about Cornerball being a “strategy” can detract from El Fraudo’s mental febrility.

      "So after all that, it turns out that managing Manchester United is actually a piece of piss.",
      "Okay, that may be a conclusion too flippant to make the 16 in the wake of the Red Devils’ impressive win at Arsenal on Sunday. But there is certainly a strong argument for Ruben Amorim being one the easiest-ever managers to follow in the Premier League era.",
      "With each passing game under Michael Carrick’s control, the folly of Amorim’s religious devotion to a system that suited almost no-one at Old Trafford becomes more stark.",
      "Carrick came in after Darren Fletcher acted as first responder and in just two games, United might not be ‘back’, but they certainly look a sight closer to what a United team ought to.",
      "What’s Carrick’s magic formula? Play players in positions and a formation that suit their individual and collective talents.",
      "It really is that simple. Sure, Carrick and his coaching staff will have found other ways to lift a woefully-underperforming squad – taking ketchup off the contraband list, that sort of thing – but to make the biggest difference, all they really had to do was get out of the players’ way.",
      "That is not to diminish Carrick’s achievements so far. Going unbeaten against City and Arsenal would have been a very creditable return. To spark United to be the first team in a decade and a half to win back-to-back games against the top two is quite remarkable.",
      "MORE: 16 Conclusions from Arsenal 2-3 Man Utd: DNA, bottle, retro kits, Carrick, Arteta, Mbeumo and more",
      "But, more than anything, it highlights just how much Amorim’s stubbornness was holding United back.",
      "From being a team whose shortcomings in the middle third set them up to fail at either end, the Red Devils suddenly appear defensively solid and threatening going forward. It was all so bleedin’ obvious.",
      "Amorim is hardly the first and only coach to make it all about himself. Fans and the wider public now insist upon a philosophy, a recognisable style – usually recognisable because almost every other team is trying to play the same way – and identifiable patterns of play. More than anything, Amorim sought to make United the embodiment of his principles, at the cost of, y’know, winning football matches.",
      "Carrick was hired to keep it simple. That’s all United needed in the Amorim aftermath.",
      "In a system more familiar to every single one of them, the players look free. Liberated from Amorim and their own minds, no longer second-guessing each instinct while making 3-5-2-1 appear a quadratic equation.",
      "Any team will always be the sum of its parts and the improved performances of individuals is just as damning on Amorim as the collective revival.",
      "The most obvious: Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "Amorim deemed the England international – it wasn’t that long ago –  incapable of playing in the base of his midfield because… reasons. Mainoo might not have always helped his own cause but the fact him and United came as close as they did to giving up on each other highlights the misplaced priorities during Amorim’s reign.",
      "We know Mainoo is technically good enough for the role. His ability to cover the ground was questioned but in two starts under Carrick, he ran further (11.89km against City and 11.26km at Arsenal) than any other player on either pitch.",
      "Mainoo’s presence means Bruno Fernandes can play higher. Putting the skipper, one of Europe’s most creative players, on a leash held by three centre-backs ought to have been a sackable offence in itself. That Fernandes made the best of it reflects far better on him than the departed manager.",
      "Giving Mainoo and Fernandes the platform each need to thrive were such easy and obvious wins, Carrick probably could have been forgiven for thinking it was a trap.",
      "Any manager needs luck and Carrick has benefited from the timing of his appointment. Mainoo was just out off the treatment table when he walked into the dressing room and doubtless the change of manager helped speed the healing process. Fernandes too was just back from injury, as was Lisandro Martinez.",
      "Paul Scholes might not fancy the World Cup winner much but it is clear to anyone without an agenda that United, in and out of possession, are a much better with Martinez as part of a duo – not a trio – at the heart of their defence.",
      "If Carrick’s luck holds, and United keep their key players fit through the remainder of his interim rein, on the evidence of his first two games, he could back the board into the kind of corner they haven’t easily wriggled out of in the past.",
      "United will be egged on to keep Carrick more with each win, the danger of doing so only matched by refusing to even consider the possibility that he could be a leading candidate come the end of the season.",
      "The prematurity of that debate makes it tiresome already, but February will offer a clearer picture of what United and Carrick might be capable of. In contrast to opening with the top two, four of their next five games are against bottom-half sides, the type of opponent that tripped up United almost as often as they stumbled over themselves under Amorim.",
      "Arne Slot, Oliver Glasner and Thomas Frank will surely all be out of work soon, while Manchester United and West Ham being sensible does not feel right.",
      "With Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League now a useless four points, it is clear It Is Happening Again. But what even is a Bottle Job?",
      "Eddie Howe told Newcastle that they ‘can’t rely on one player’ as their miserable form without Bruno Guimaraes continued. But Sunderland should listen too.",
      "Man Utd have decided to make interim boss Michael Carrick their new permanent manager after two brilliant results, according to reports.",
      "Alexander Isak and Marc Guehi took different paths to a similar destination in the summer; history is repeating itself with Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola.",
      "Arne Slot will not be the Liverpool manager next season as the Reds decide to go in a different direction after defeat to Bournemouth, according to reports."

      "Michael Carrick has rocked up at Manchester United and thrown the cat among the title-race pigeons by… beating both City and Arsenal to ultimately leave things exactly where they were.",
      "But he’s got United playing again, he’s got them over their fourthplaceophobia and he’s got Arsenal wondering if it’s happening again.",
      "It’s not bad for a fortnight’s work, is it?",
      "",
      "1. An unlikely 3-2 win for interim manager Michael Carrick’s Manchester United having fallen 1-0 down to Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal.",
      "Having taken a 2-1 lead early in the second half, Carrick’s side were pegged back by an Arsenal equaliser before managing to respond yet again and find a winner.",
      "It was the last game of Carrick’s caretaker reign in 2021. It will not be the last game of his caretaker reign in 2026.",
      "If you, like poor old Mediawatch, wearied of DNA talk after last weekend’s win over Manchester City then we can only advise giving football media a wide berth for a few days after this.",
      "United really are speedrunning their now familiar ‘inspirational club man interim appointment’ storyline here. By tomorrow morning we expect to see full-blown Carrick Clamour, with his inevitable permanent appointment now pencilled in for just after he beats his other former clubs Spurs and West Ham over the next few weeks.",
      "",
      "2. But while none of us have to drink the Kool-Aid about Carrick’s Man United DNA being the reason for their dramatic improvement over the last 12 days, it thoroughly damns the previous regime that he has been able to come in and so conspicuously change the mood and performance levels.",
      "A manager last seen being sacked by Championship Middlesbrough has been able to turn United around in less than a fortnight.",
      "His masterplan? 1. Pick Harry Maguire. 2. Pick Kobbie Mainoo. 3. Change the formation, obviously. 4. Put players in the correct positions.",
      "",
      "3. None of it is complicated. All of it is obvious. It’s no criticism of Carrick to point out the changes he’s made are such straightforward and obvious ones; it would be ridiculous to think he could have done any more than that in such a short space of time with two such fiendishly difficult opening fixtures to negotiate.",
      "What matters, and reveals so much, is just how transformative those changes have been and how fast.",
      "This has still been unexpectedly impressive, obviously, and it does need saying that for all United were ultimately good value for their win here that it still relied on two spectacular goals. That’s not a particularly repeatable tactic.",
      "But these first two weeks of Carrick’s temporary(?) reign have shown that it never needed to be anything like as bad as stubbornness made it for so, so long.",
      "",
      "4. As for Arsenal… are they really doing it again? Surely they’re not doing it again? It’s an impossibly harsh but unavoidably relevant question. Arsenal’s recent history means the scope for things to become painfully self-fulfilling at this point is unbelievably potent.",
      "It is patently ridiculous that a team losing a 24-0-0 all-competitions record when scoring first is damned for the loss of such a record rather than praised for its existence. But nobody will be making these points more forcefully than Arsenal fans themselves. Nobody will be more aware of what this might be than Arsenal fans themselves.",
      "There was a desperate, palpable nervousness about Arsenal today as they sought to respond to victories for Man City and Aston Villa earlier in the weekend.",
      "",
      "5. And while the point about the spectacular nature of United’s second and third goals applies just as much to not over-reacting to Arsenal’s defeat as it does to over-reacting to United’s victory, it’s not as if they were bolts from the blue. These were not rogue misfortunes that derailed an otherwise acceptable performance.",
      "Arsenal were nowhere near it, and weirdly got more nervous and less certain after what should have been a perfect nerve-settler of an opening goal.",
      "",
      "6. It had been an odd start to the game before it burst so dramatically to life. Arsenal were in total control, but it was an eerily sterile dominance. Arsenal had all of the ball and all of the territory but before getting their goal via a swing and a miss from Lisandro Martinez led to the ball cannoning in off his standing leg, they had created precious little.",
      "At one point in the first 15 minutes Arsenal had completed 22 passes in the final third to United’s zero. Yet Arsenal had nothing really to show for being in such utter control of proceedings. The goal would eventually come, but it never felt like it definitely would. Never had the sense of inevitability you’d expect.",
      "It never, in fact, felt as inevitable as United’s equaliser did almost from the moment Arsenal went ahead. As for Martinez, we can only say that perhaps that goal wouldn’t have happened if he’d just bothered to be slightly taller? Something to think about there.",
      "",
      "7. So soon after Arsenal’s opening goal did United’s first glimmer of a chance come that Peter Drury hadn’t even finished his prepared soliloquy before grudgingly accepting the need to mention with a sigh that Bryan Mbeumo was now to be found bearing down on goal.",
      "That chance came to nothing, but another miscommunication at the back soon after created another chance for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "This time it required an extraordinary recovery from William Saliba to prevent an equaliser. Having initially let the ball run past him, presumably unaware of the lurking danger, he then somehow stuck out a telescopic go-go-Gadget leg to get their first and scupper Bruno’s shot.",
      "",
      "8. But the reprieve was temporary. Arsenal’s third and most egregious error in five baffling minutes saw Martin Zubimendi, usually the most reliably safe pair of hands imaginable, make a horrible mess of a backpass after having a pass fizzed into him with unnecessary pace.",
      "Mbeumo still had plenty to do, and did it with what is becoming customary style as he shimmied round David Raya to score his 50th Premier League goal.",
      "He is already one of the signings of the season and is developing a happy knack for scoring premium goals.",
      "That’s now goals in victories at Anfield and the Emirates, as well as in a home win over Man City. It’s a fine return on investment in his first season, and he was sorely missed during that dispiriting run of draws around the new year when he was away on AFCON duty.",
      "",
      "9. It would have been easier to forgive Arsenal’s first-half sloppiness and nervousness had they been shaken out of these navel-gazing afflictions at the interval. But they weren’t.",
      "The second half began very much as the first ended, with United encouraged to believe there was far more here for them today than anyone might have anticipated.",
      "Of course there’s an air of freakishness to Patrick Dorgu scoring what Gary Neville called on commentary ‘a goal of a lifetime’ but these are the things that can happen when you offer opponents as much seemingly unnecessary encouragement as Arteta’s side has taken to doing.",
      "Having played a sort of double one-two with Fernandes, Dorgu arced his shot spectacularly beyond Raya even before we’d fully completed the thought that we hoped he didn’t do that because it would force us to try and describe the set-up and ‘double one-two’ feels entirely unsatisfactory.",
      "",
      "10. We do feel we have to take some responsibility for Arsenal’s shoddiness here. You can’t go around publishing Quadruple Content on the morning of a match without expecting egg to be instantly administered to faces.",
      "Of course, nothing is f*cked here today. Arsenal are still four points clear. They are still heavy favourites to win the league. They probably haven’t just commenced a bottlejob. But we must all accept they are slightly less compelling quadruple candidates this evening than they were this morning.",
      "But whatever happens over the weeks and months ahead, they will have one quadruple to look back on thanks to the mass Hail Mary substitution Arteta attempted just before the hour to try and rejuvenate what was by now a thoroughly moribund performance.",
      "Four substitutes, Mikel? Four? That’s insane.",
      "In fairness, the introductions of Mikel Merino, Eberechi Eze, Ben White and Viktor Gyokeres did energise Arsenal a bit.",
      "",
      "11. Or at least, they energised the crowd. There was a conspicuous cheer for the introduction of Gyokeres in particular. It might not have been a good day for Arsenal, but Gyokeres wouldn’t be human if he didn’t feel something at the sight of Gabriel Jesus so utterly failing to stake a claim to a regular starting spot when handed the chance in a big game.",
      "",
      "12. And we were certainly invested in the idea of Ben White scoring an equaliser and then celebrating in Steve Holland’s face. Although even here we saw doubt and uncertainty from Arsenal where none has existed before. Hincapie’s return and White’s deployment in the reshuffle from the bench meant Myles Lewis-Skelly once again reduced to a watching brief.",
      "There still appears to be a lack of real belief in the youngster when the chips are truly down.",
      "",
      "13. Arsenal scored an equaliser of such unparalleled Arsenalness that it barely requires description. The words ‘corner’ and ‘Merino’ and ‘bundled’ and ‘goalline technology’ are all you need to know to form a perfect image of it all in your mind. Or failing that, in your planet-melting AI of choice.",
      "A subdued Emirates suddenly came alive with expectation. A horribly unpleasant afternoon was now pregnant with the possibility of some real Hallmark of Champions behaviour and possibly even some stern words and tut-tutting from the Celebration Police. There was surely only one winner from here, you thought to yourself.",
      "",
      "14. And you were right. In fairness, this is where a degree of caution must be particularly advised for those going all-in on Carrick’s club-knowing DNA-possessing Unitedness being the difference maker in a big away game at a long-term rival.",
      "Because really what United went and did here under Carrick is just what they went and did under Amorim at Anfield; after conceding a late equaliser, they went and found a late winner.",
      "It was another stunning goal, wonderfully and precisely worked with no panic or late-game-bluster before Matheus Cunha calmly curled the ball into the bottom corner from 25 yards like it was a tap-in.",
      "And as a general point, it does become even harder to avoid the temptation to compare this United to previous all-conquering iterations when they do this sort of thing to league leaders while dressed as the 1994 team in that wonderful black Eric Cantona kung-fu tribute kit.",
      "",
      "15. Victory finally takes United into a wide-open top four that has been waiting for them all season long. Nobody appears remotely interested in what is for now (but almost certainly won’t end up being) the final Champions League spot, with United among the most egregious offenders with all manner of daft results against daft teams when opportunity knocked previously.",
      "Now, after back-to-back wins against teams that are not daft, the chance has been taken. And there really does seem no good reason to think United can’t remain precisely where they now find themselves given who they’ve now eliminated from their fixture list.",
      "Nobody could accuse United of appointing an interim at a time designed to give him a straightforward start, but having beaten City and Arsenal it really could get even better for a while yet.",
      "United, infamously, are not overburdened with fixtures for the rest of the season, but even so they have what looks like an outrageously gentle February after this potentially punishing end to January.",
      "If they can avoid the classic ‘win the hard games, then mess up the easier ones’ trope, then a February featuring Fulham and Tottenham at home before trips to West Ham and Everton could be a rewarding one. Haircuts all round if that lot goes the way current form suggests it should.",
      "",
      "16. For Arsenal, a first home defeat of the season. And the loss of that 24-0-0 record in all competitions when scoring first. And three goals conceded in a Premier League game for the first time since a 4-3 win over Luton Town in December 2023.",
      "We haven’t crunched all the numbers but are going to say that it must at the very, very least be rare to concede three goals against a team that is relegated twice before you concede three goals to anyone else. If United get relegated twice before the next time Arsenal concede three then we’re all in trouble.",
      "The ridiculousness of that stat and indeed the nature of the goals Arsenal conceded today – two worldies, one silly gift – should also be a reminder of just how ridiculous and unbreakable that Chelsea goals conceded statistic really is.",
      "There was some talk earlier in the season that Arsenal could threaten the absurd 15-goal mark of Terry and Carvalho and Cech and, above all, Mourinho. We get it; Arsenal are an exceptional football team who at their best specialise in denying their opponents any chances whatsoever.",
      "But the fact that record is already off the table with 15 games still to play should give anyone pause next time someone comes along with an impressive pair of centre-backs and high-class goalkeeper.",
      "Arne Slot, Oliver Glasner and Thomas Frank will surely all be out of work soon, while Manchester United and West Ham being sensible does not feel right.",
      "With Arsenal’s lead at the top of the Premier League now a useless four points, it is clear It Is Happening Again. But what even is a Bottle Job?",
      "Eddie Howe told Newcastle that they ‘can’t rely on one player’ as their miserable form without Bruno Guimaraes continued. But Sunderland should listen too.",
      "Man Utd have decided to make interim boss Michael Carrick their new permanent manager after two brilliant results, according to reports.",
      "Alexander Isak and Marc Guehi took different paths to a similar destination in the summer; history is repeating itself with Oliver Glasner and Andoni Iraola.",
      "Arne Slot will not be the Liverpool manager next season as the Reds decide to go in a different direction after defeat to Bournemouth, according to reports."

      "Arsenal are doing it again, aren’t they?",
      "Manchester United were very good. Michael Carrick is at the wheel. Yadda yadda. More of that in 16 Conclusions.",
      "But Arsenal…wow. This is shaping up to be the worst bottlejob of the lot, and losing at home to their great rivals feels like the first step towards it.",
      "The Emirates felt edgy right from the start. Arsenal looked tentative, predictable, and nervous.",
      "It was a strange first half; the Gunners didn’t necessarily start poorly. For the opening 15 minutes, United couldn’t get out of their own half, but as soon as they did, the equilibrium shifted. Arsenal’s nerves and United’s confidence grew in tandem.",
      "Arsenal’s opener should have settled the anxiety, but if anything, they looked even shakier after taking the lead.",
      "In a game where the first goal felt pivotal, it proved to be so in a way we didn’t see coming. The hosts looked even more unsettled, and a calamitous Martin Zubimendi error led to Bryan Mbeumo’s 37th-minute equaliser.",
      "Under an insignificant amount of pressure, the Premier League’s best among the 20 most expensive signings of the season bobbled a woeful backpass towards David Raya, getting nowhere near it as Mbeumo calmly swept up the mess.",
      "They didn’t look like a team four points clear at the summit with a game in hand. Instead, they looked like a team desperate to relinquish the burden of being chased by Manchester City and Aston Villa.",
      "That passivity bled into the second half, and Michael Carrick’s men took full advantage.",
      "Patrick Dorgu’s go-ahead goal was spectacular, and having spent the evening refusing to take any risks, Arsenal were suddenly forced to show some character and inventiveness. They had to show us what they’re made of, basically.",
      "Mikel Arteta showed what he was made of almost instantaneously, hauling off four players in an unprecedented quadruple substitution before the hour mark.",
      "Benjamin White, Mikel Merino, Ebere Eze, and Viktor Gyokeres replaced Piero Hincapie, Martin Odegaard, Martin Zubimendi, and Gabriel Jesus. It gave Arsenal height, set-piece threat, and a delicious delivery specialist, and, alas, their equaliser came via a six-yard-box scramble from a corner.",
      "But on a day when not even the dark arts could bail Arsenal out, they were undone by another absolute belter, this time from substitute Matheus Cunha.",
      "Ironically, just as the Arsenal supporters looked like they believed and were fully behind their team, Cunha’s sucker punch sent the hosts right back to where they were four minutes earlier.",
      "It has been an almighty crash in recent weeks. Three games without a Premier League win. Their first home defeat of the season. The first time in 25 league games they’ve gone 1-0 up and failed to win. And the first time Arsenal have conceded three goals in a match since facing Luton Town back in December 2023.",
      "The connections weren’t there. Again. The individual sparks were non-existent. Again. It felt like the first significant step in Arsenal’s latest bid to bottle the Premier League title. AGAIN.",
      "It happened in quite remarkable fashion too, conceding two screamers against a Manchester United side enjoying a mini-revival under Carrick. The silver lining for Arsenal is that the Red Devils’ hierarchy and supporters might get giddy and hand Carrick the job full-time.",
      "As Gary Neville said on commentary, Arsenal didn’t lose the league today. They wouldn’t have won the league today either. But they are sending all the wrong signals. Wrong for them, right for a Manchester City team seemingly in crisis and an Aston Villa side that has no right to be third.",
      "City’s form has been poor, but they won on Saturday and will build on that momentum. Yet that will pale in comparison to the buzz generated by Arsenal losing at home in a fixture they had no right not to win.",
      "Even at kick-off, it felt like Arsenal players and supporters were bracing for disaster. That atmosphere was on the pitch and in the stands.",
      "Losing the 2022/23 Premier League was down to their title charge coming too soon. 2023/24 was one slip-up too many. Last season was just crap. If Arsenal don’t do it in 2025/26, it will be the worst of the lot by a country mile.",
      "If they do ultimately bottle it, this will feel like the first major step towards doing so.",
      "And as always, no one does more damage to Arsenal’s title hopes than Arsenal themselves."

      "Another year, another quadruple attempt. You can set your watch by them. Every January, some clever-clogs team will be chasing the quadruple before shamefully ending up with something embarrassing like only the Premier League and Champions League to show for it. Mortifying.",
      "Of course, there’s a good reason that the Full Quad in the world’s only proper football, which is obviously English football, and the four proper trophies available – Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup – has never been done. It is almost impossibly difficult. There is literally no shame in failing to complete it; that you can get past the halfway point of the season with something so impossible still theoretically possible is itself extraordinary.",
      "And Arsenal are right now among the less convoluted quad-chasers. They are top of the Premier League and top of the Champions League. They are current favourites in each of the four competitions. It really might happen. Except: it won’t. Because it never does.",
      "But that thought set us upon another thought: what is the best quadruple that has actually happened? We have, through necessity, allowed all manner of bullsh*t pots into this, but we have limited ourselves to Europe’s top five leagues for our own sanity.",
      "Unfortunately, that does mean no place for Celtic, whose 1966/67 Quintuple contains all the proper ingredients (European Cup, Scottish League, Scottish Cup, Scottish League Cup) as well as a Glasgow Cup which, given the historical if not current nature of Scottish fitba, is at least as good as a League Cup probably. But if we included them, we’d have gone down a long, arduous yet inevitable road that leads directly to Linfield’s 1961/62 Septuple and pure delirious madness. So we haven’t. Soz.",
      "",
      "A Quadruple containing neither European nor domestic league glory? F*** all the way off, you cheeky scamps. You’re trying to pull a fast one here and we’ll not have it. Quadruple? Notruple more like.",
      "",
      "This was Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona at the peak of their powers and an indisputably great side, no doubt about that. They don’t need a Quadruple to prove it. Which is just as well, because this is still firmly in tinpot territory. We’ll give you La Liga, obviously, especially after losing just once all season and still only edging out Real Madrid by three points in an epic tussle. But the rule that any cup containing the word ‘Super’ is bobbins is immutable and in play twice here.",
      "The UEFA and Spanish Super Cups are (or were at the time) both two-team low-wattage affairs (albeit the Spanish version was played over two legs) and not really major titles. The FIFA Club World Cup may have slightly more teams, but we all know that in its historical pre-Trump format it amounted in the end to the old Intercontinental clash between the European and South American champs. Barca started the season with six titles up for grabs, but missed out in the Copa del Rey to Sevilla in the last 16 and to Jose Mourinho’s party-pooping Inter in the Champions League semi-finals.",
      "",
      "It must be quite nice to be able to go “This is the worst Quadruple we’ve ever won”. The inherent implications can only augur well. This is the worst Quadruple Bayern Munich have ever won.",
      "",
      "And this is the second worst. A far better one in 2012/13 opened the Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup doors, gifts that were duly accepted. In accordance with tradition, Guangzhou Evergrande were beaten en route to World Cup glory, while penalties were needed to exact a measure of revenge on Chelsea for the 2012 Champions League final in the UEFA Super Cup. But Bayern were thrashed in the Champions League semi-finals by Real Madrid and sloppily passed up the DFB-Supercup right at the start of the season with a defeat to old rivals Dortmund.",
      "",
      "Don’t hear as much about this as you do the 1999 Treble, do you? Even though four is definitely more than three. Can’t think why this is less venerated. Not every day you beat Gamba Osaka and Quito to land the Club World Cup. Or beat Portsmouth on penalties to win the Community Shield. You can stick That Night in Barcelona up your arse, quite frankly.",
      "",
      "Scores grudging bonus points for the fact they’ve done this particular quadruple four times since replacing Lyon as French football’s dominant force. No arguing with the neatness of that. There’s a very obvious reason it’s not as good as 2024/25’s effort, but three of the four here are at least actual competitions containing multiple matches and more than two entrants.",
      "We also quite enjoy the fact that because PSG weren’t even letting anyone else have a go in the League Cup – winning six of the final seven renewals – it was just abolished altogether. We assume that’s why it was chucked in le bin anyway.",
      "The Trophee des Champions sounds much better than ‘Community Shield’ and less deceptively bombastic than ‘Super Cup’ but amounts to the same thing. It’s just a glorified friendly between league winners and cup winners, and PSG have won loads of the buggers. This is a Quadruple built around a Domestic Treble and therefore not too tinpot, but inevitably loses some points because farmers and no Europe.",
      "",
      "A Proper Domestic Double is a high-quality cornerstone of any respectable Quadruple, and Barcelona tick that box in style here, putting a three-game April wobble behind them to win their last five league games by an absurd aggregate score of 24-0 to pip Real Madrid by a point. Sevilla were beaten in extra-time for Copa del Rey glory, but alas it then goes once more into the realm of the tinpot. Athletic Bilbao offered minimal Supercopa resistance, while Guangzhou Evergrande (it is always Guangzhou Evergrande) and River Plate (it is quite often River Plate) were sorted out with little fuss in the Club World Cup. The Champions League bid came a cropper against eventual finalists and domestic rivals Atletico Madrid in the last eight.",
      "",
      "Yes, another Champions League for Real Madrid. Nice one, Loris Karius is crying. The rest of it: tish and fipsy. Alright, so the Supercopa was against Barcelona, but it was still a fancy two-legged friendly. Al-Jazira and Gremio were dispatched in the Club World Cup and Manchester United in the UEFA Super Cup. Real also finished second behind actual Tottenham in their Champions League group stage, and third in La Liga. Utter frauds.",
      "",
      "This is one of our favourite Quadruples. Because it highlights the absolute folly of it all. The whole Quadruple obsession vaguely reminds us of the razor blade wars when Gillette and Wilkinson Sword would constantly set out to one up each other by just adding blade after unnecessary blade. The Mach 3 was definitely enough, guys.",
      "And that brings us to Manchester City’s 2018/19 season, in which their Champions League hopes collided with the unstoppable chaotic banter force of Spurs with inevitable consequences, but they did complete an unprecedented English Domestic Treble. An achievement Sir Alex Ferguson had declared impossible, rightly acknowledging the League Cup is far harder to win than the Champions League. But here’s the thing: nobody cared.",
      "And, sure, a lot of that was because it’s City and people in general still don’t care about City the way they do United or Liverpool or even Arsenal. They still didn’t care all that much when they emulated United’s Proper Treble in 2023. But it wasn’t entirely that. Quadruple obsession had rendered Trebles meh. Ludicrous as that is.",
      "Still, though. Whack in the good ol’ Community Shield, and you have a Quadruple. And with all three proper pots pocketed in a league where that had never happened before or since it remains one of the better ones. And you can’t really blame anyone for coming off second best to Spurs with Fernando Llorente in his pomp, can you?",
      "",
      "Were it not for an extremely careless Copa del Rey quarter-final defeat over two legs to Celta Vigo, this would be challenging for top spot. The league title was snaffled after a typically forthright to and fro with Clasico rivals Barcelona, while a slightly scruffy Champions League group stage featuring three draws on their way to second place behind Dortmund was put right in a dominant march through the knockouts. Classic Real Madrid Champions Leaguing, really. They know their way around a UCL knockout tie better than most, a bother with which Man City are about to collide. Napoli and Bayern were beaten home and away in the last 16 and quarter-finals, while a 2-1 second-leg defeat to Atletico mattered not a jot with a 3-0 lead in the bag from the first. On to the final in Cardiff, and a 4-1 shellacking for Juventus. It is the history of the etc.",
      "Super Cup and Club World Cup formalities were also completed along the way, although extra time was required against both Sevilla in the former and Kashima Antlers in the latter. The Antlers were only in the tournament at all as J-League champions because Japan were hosts, but defied the odds to make it all the way to extra-time in the final, beating Auckland City, Mamelodi Sundowns and most notably Copa Libertadores champions Atletico Nacional (thanks in part to the first penalty ever awarded by VAR) along the way.",
      "",
      "We’re going to go right ahead and say it: winning the Champions League is better than winning the French Coupe de la Ligue. Let it never be said we are afraid of molten takes here.",
      "PSG seemed pretty happy, all in all, with a season that finally delivered that long-awaited first Big Cup success alongside a customary sprinkling of domestic baubles. But we’re still pretty annoyed that the abolition of the French League Cup meant no Proper Quad was achieved. On the flipside we are, in truth, relieved at their failure to win the summer’s Club World Cup because then we’d have had to decide which, if any, season it belonged to and we can’t be remotely arsed with that noise.",
      "But within the definite confines of the actual 24/25 season, the entire absence of the Coupe de la Ligue does leave this as a largely unimprovable effort with the domestic double at its core and the big European prize to go with the more tinpot Trophee des Champions.",
      "Of course, this season could set new benchmarks despite Coupe de France embarrassment. Having already won all three of the Glorified Friendlies available to them post-quad – Trophee des Champions, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Intercontinental Cup – and with a live interest retained in both Ligue 1 and Champions League there is a tinpot quintuple very much up for grabs.",
      "",
      "There is no Carabao equivalent in Germany, so this does have to go down as a largely unimprovable effort for Bayern, for whom a Quadruple featuring no tinpottery whatsoever is thus impossible. Won all three major pots in some style, breaking all manner of records on their way to a ludicrous 25-point victory margin in the Bundesliga and winning their six DFB-Pokal games by a combined aggregate of 20-2. Arsenal gave them an almighty scare in the Champions League last 16, winning 2-0 in Munich after a 3-1 Bayern win at the Emirates appeared to have put the tie to bed three weeks earlier. Sauntered past supposed European superpowers Juventus and Barcelona by scoring 11 goals and conceding none before outlasting Jurgen Klopp’s Dortmund at Wembley to take the Big Cup.",
      "We don’t want to get into the hypothetical, but it does seem pretty reasonable to assume this team that lost just once to a German side (2-1 to Bayer Leverkusen in October) all season long may well have won a German League Cup were there such a thing to be won.",

      "When the opening weekend of a Premier League season rolls around, there will always be excitable knee-jerk reactions to the first round of games.",
      "Teams and their players are often rashly written off after a disappointing start or hyped as the real deal, though these early assessments do not always reflect how the season pans out.",
      "This was particularly the case with Arsenal’s unconvincing 1-0 away win against Ruben Amorim’s supposedly resurgent Manchester United side at Old Trafford in August.",
      "At the time, there were the same old fears about Arsenal being held back by Mikel Arteta’s defensive mindset. Meanwhile, despite losing, Man Utd were widely praised for their positive performance that was tipped to indicate a much-improved season under Amorim.",
      "This has since been proven wrong on both counts, with Sunday’s reverse fixture pitting runaway Premier League leaders Arsenal against a Man Utd side with renewed optimism under a new interim head coach after Amorim ultimately failed to turn things around.",
      "So, ahead of Sunday’s match at the Emirates, we have revisited Matt Stead’s conclusions from the August fixture (he was right to be pessimistic about Man Utd) and detail ten main takeaways that have since been debunked and/or proven…",
      "",
      "‘Manchester United have trampled over too many green shoots of promise they have only just planted to engender much faith in this latest long-term plan. Their modern history contains more false dawns than a Vicar of Dibley convention. Do this against Fulham and Burnley before the international break and we’ll start believing this might be different.’",
      "Credit to Stead for shoehorning a great Vicar of Dibley bit into his dissection of one of Man Utd’s many false dawns, with good performances against top sides before losses against your Grimsby Towns, Brentfords and Evertons a hallmark of Amorim’s reign and other managers before him.",
      "We don’t need to go into what followed the Arsenal defeat right here, but those who naively felt Man Utd had turned a corner here were badly wrong, with this club now renowned for delivering letdown after letdown.",
      "Michael Carrick’s side will probably replicate the levels reached against Man City when they face Arsenal, but don’t be shocked if/when they lose against Fulham in their next game.",
      "READ: Paul Scholes should ‘f**king grow up’ as shock four-man Manchester United midfielder shortlist ‘revealed’",
      "",
      "‘Liverpool and Manchester City can make their four-goal statements before Arsenal stumble over their words, but the final message was all the same.’",
      "Arsenal were far from convincing in their 2025/26 opener, but their unrelenting reliability and defensive resiliance has given them a huge advantage over their title rivals, especially considering there’s been a significant drop off from Manchester City and Liverpool.",
      "",
      "‘A shiny penny to whomever is first to ask whether Arsenal are better without him.’",
      "Stead was pretty forgiving of Gyokeres’ first of many non-performances in a big game for Arsenal this season as he was far from 100% for the Man Utd match.",
      "Still, early signs of his ineffectiveness in the Premier League and in this Arsenal side were evident against Man Utd and have been laid bare in the months since. His stunning goal in midweek does little to gloss over the fact that he has been a huge disappointment and has not been the No.9 solution he was meant to be…",
      "",
      "‘Arsenal naturally looked smoother and more coherent when he came on but the difference in sharpness, technical levels and decision making against what came before with Gyokeres was clear.’",
      "As this season has developed, it has looked increasingly inevitable that Kai Havertz will eventually replace Gyokeres in Arsenal’s starting XI. And in actuality, the Swedish international’s situation is worse as he could realistically find himself third in the pecking order behind Havertz and Gabriel Jesus following the Brazilian’s unexpected resurgence.",

      "This has seemed a mistake, but Amorim’s exit and the return of Kobbie Mainoo ease their issues in this department. Still, as Stead mentions,  a marquee signing in Baleba’s mould is a must to fill the void left by Casemiro, with a four-man shortlist revealed.",

      "Arsenal are top of the Premier League, top of the Champions League, have one proverbial foot in the Carabao Cup final and are bookies’ favourites for the FA Cup.",
      "In other words, this is currently one of the more credible bids at the Proper Quadruple we’ve yet seen. Any talk at this time of the season is always, by definition, premature simply because actually winning the quadruple is vanishingly unlikely even when everything is going as swimmingly as it currently is for the Gunners.",
      "And if you don’t believe us about how small and twatty the banana skins upon which previous quadruple tilts have slipped, just have a look at this tale of hubris and despair and teams who ended up only winning two or three trophies like massive f*cking losers.",
      "",
      "Premier League: Won\nFA Cup: Won\nChampions League: Won\nLeague Cup: Quarter-finals",
      "A philosophical question for you: if a quadruple bid ends before anyone even actually realises it’s started, does it make a sound? Clearly, nobody was talking about a quadruple – or even a treble for that matter – when Manchester United travelled to White Hart Lane in December 1998 for a League Cup quarter-final against Spurs. They were third in the league, five points behind leaders Aston Villa, hadn’t started their FA Cup campaign and were not yet certain of qualification from a Champions League Group of Death alongside Bayern Munich and Barcelona.",
      "But given everything that happened across the rest of that season, and while acknowledging that the Butterfly Effect applies to quickfire Chris Armstrong doubles after half-time every bit as much as it does to the flapping wings of world-destroying insects, you could make a decent case that this is still actually the closest anyone has ever come and they didn’t even know it.",
      "Sure, maybe the distraction of a two-legged semi-final against Wimbledon and a final against Leicester might have derailed United’s loftier ambitions but also: probably it wouldn’t. And given that even a phenomenally mediocre Spurs team managed to negotiate those games and actually win themselves a trophy (arguably a more notable thing than United’s Treble) you’d have to imagine an all-conquering United would also have done so; they didn’t lose a single game from December 19 onwards in that fabled campaign.",
      "Essentially it boils down to this: all else being equal, United only needed to see off teams who finished the season 11th, 16th and 10th to add a final (but also first) coat of shiny gloss to their greatest ever season. But David Ginola yet again had other ideas.",
      "",
      "Premier League: Won\nFA Cup: Semi-finals\nChampions League: Quarter-finals\nLeague Cup: Semi-finals",
      "Bit harsh maybe to sully an unbeaten Premier League season with ‘What if?’ chatter, but Arsenal really were a few moments here and there away from something even more spectacular. If you take an unbeaten league season as the baseline, then ending up with only one trophy isn’t great is it? You know, relatively speaking.",
      "All three cups were distinctly winnable as well. Middlesbrough were Arsenal’s destroyers back then, beating the so-called ‘Invincibles’ home and away in the League Cup semi-final and then going on to defeat Bolton at the Millennium Stadium. Arsenal should definitely have won that one, really.",
      "Old rivals Manchester United knocked Arsenal out at the same stage of the FA Cup, but it was the still-elusive Champions League that was perhaps the real near-miss. Wayne Bridge’s 87th-minute goal secured victory for Chelsea at Highbury in a wide-open tournament that ended with Jose Mourinho and Porto beating Monaco in the final.",

Liverpool awaited in the Champions League semi-final.",

      "United did win eight of their last nine games to secure the Premier League title, including that weird week where Federico Macheda became the most important footballer in the country, but failed to defend their Champions League crown after getting schooled by absolutely peak Barcelona in the final.

      "Sunderland had been dispatched in the League Cup final a week earlier, and City would famously go on to pip slippy Liverpool to the league title with five straight wins at the end of the season. But the quad dream came crashing down a week after the League Cup win as Wigan stunned the Etihad with a 2-1 victory in the FA Cup quarter-final before Barcelona completed the formalities of a last-16 Champions League win with a 2-1 victory at Camp Nou, having won the first leg 2-0 in Manchester.",

      "But unlike United’s 1998/99 bid that only became apparent with the benefit of hindsight, City’s 2018/19 was so dominated by talk of quadruples that their unprecedented domestic treble drew mainly shoulder shrugs and indifference.",
      "The dream died on a gloriously silly night of European football at the Etihad as Spurs arrived with a hard-won 1-0 first-leg lead they gave back almost instantly before Son Heung-min scored two just as quick to take Mauricio Pochettino’s side into an improbable two-goal lead with away-goal buffer to boot, back when such things existed.",
      "City roared back; with barely 20 minutes on the clock the scoreline was an absurd 3-2 to City on the night with Spurs now narrowly ahead in the tie by virtue of those away goals.",
      "When Sergio Aguero scored on the hour, City appeared to have done enough. Only for Fernando Llorente to scramble home a highly controversial third Spurs goal to restore their away-goal advantage. City thought they had won it again in stoppage time only for an agonisingly long VAR check to eventually spot an offside in the build-up.",
      "Reading all that back, it is truly incredible to think that wasn’t even Spurs’ maddest away night of a Champions League run so unutterably bonkers that UEFA had no choice but to scrap the away goals rule altogether in direct response. Maybe. Also a reminder of one of the key things that makes a quad so very hard to pull off: football is really bloody daft.",

      "No Spurs or Wigan whimsy this time around, with Chelsea proving to be City’s undoing on this occasion. That’s slightly less embarrassing, at least but it did also occur twice.",
      "The quadruple has arguably never felt quite so feasible as it did on the morning of April 17 in 2021 when City, already in the Champions League last four and cruising to the league title with the Carabao safely in their pocket after Ryan Mason’s Spurs had been dealt with at Wembley, prepared to take on Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final.",
      "But a close-fought game was decided by Hakim Ziyech’s goal.

      "Liverpool never were top of the Premier League on that remarkable last day but the opportunity was right there. With the gap to Manchester City a single point, Steven Gerrard had done his bit by guiding Aston Villa to a 2-0 lead at the Etihad as late as the 75th minute. But Pep Guardiola’s side maintained a slender advantage on goal difference for as long as Liverpool could not find a breakthrough against Wolves.",
      "The Reds did eventually vanquish their obstinate visitors, but by the time Mo Salah and Andy Robertson scored in the 84th and 89th minutes to make it 3-1, Manchester City had already completed their remarkable turnaround with goals from Ilkay Gundogan and Rodri in the 76th, 78th and 81st minutes to lead Villa 3-2.",

Then again, what is a trophy-hoarding machine supposed to do when encountering a relegation-bound team and one of the worst managers in Premier League history? Nathan Jones was in charge of Southampton for 95 days and a list of the five teams he beat before being sacked is just incredible: Everton (who sacked Frank Lampard nine days later), Crystal Palace (who sacked Patrick Vieira 70 days later), Lincoln (who were in the bottom half of League One), Blackpool (who would be relegated from League One) and an otherwise all-conquering City.",

      "Somehow – to this day nobody really knows how – Liverpool emerged with a 1-0 win from a fearful battering in Paris but then lost by the same scoreline at Anfield before going out on penalties. It was as close as anyone came to halting PSG’s march in the knockout stages as Aston Villa, Arsenal and then most emphatically Inter were all dispatched. Liverpool would have very much fancied their chances of doing likewise had those spot-kicks gone differently."

      "Gary Neville is \"blown away\" by Manchester United's transformation under the management of Michael Carrick.",
      "United backed up a derby win over Manchester City with a 3-2 success at Premier League leaders Arsenal on Sunday in Carrick's second game in charge.",
      "Those results have transformed the mood following Ruben Amorim's sacking and Neville is confident United - who are up to fourth in the table - will finish in the Champions League qualifying spots.",
      "\"There are a number of things that have changed, the intensity, the compactness, the aggression of the defending, their willingness to get behind the ball together and be difficult to beat and dig in when you're in difficult moments of the game. And there was more of that [at Arsenal] than there was against City.",
      "\"I thought they played better football against City, but they were always going to have to dig in [at the Emirates Stadium] more. In that first 25 minutes when they didn't have a lot of ball, they didn't really lose too many chances.",
      "\"They controlled the game without the ball. And then they just started to play a little bit.",
      "\"But the big thing for me is that they've got a threat up front. They've got a group of players who are talented up front, who are also getting back and helping their defenders, who are digging in.\"",
      "Neville believes United's system shift away from Amorim's back-three preference to a 4-2-3-1 has boosted the team. He says Carrick has restored the \"magic\" to the team - and they are able to realise their potential to achieve a high finish in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's definitely instilled a simplicity to it in the last two weeks, in the last two games, that I like about it,\" said Neville.",
      "\"It's my favourite system. We've talked about it a lot, the idea of a talented player playing off a striker, two wide players narrowing in midfield, a back four that's really aggressive. It's been a huge turn.",
      "\"It's still not a point to get carried away but certainly a point to suggest now that Manchester United have got an unbelievable opportunity, from where they were before the Manchester City game, where it was a real low point. It's a remarkable turnaround.",
      "\"And Michael Carrick deserves enormous credit, so do the players for what they've done. They've responded to whatever's being said to them, and we don't know what's being said to them in that training ground, but they are responding like they weren't before.",
      "\"Why? We'll always speculate, Ruben Amorim could be watching at home thinking, 'what the hell am I watching from these players right now?' I'm sure he's bemused, as we all are in terms of the flip, but the magic has returned in the last week.",
      "\"The magic seems to have returned to the club momentarily, the feeling of how to play with the aggression, with the risk, with the great goals, with the attacking of speed, the counter-attack. It feels right.",
      "\"And I think one thing that this last week has told us, no matter where it leads to, is that is the way Manchester United have to play, because it's just felt right watching them.",

      "Gordon McQueen died aged 70 in June 2023 after contracting vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy; Coroner finds heading 'likely' contributed to brain injury behind death of former Scotland, Manchester United and Leeds defender",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 14:00, UK",
      "Heading a football \"likely\" contributed to the brain injury which was a factor in the death of former Scotland defender Gordon McQueen, a coroner has found.",
      "McQueen - who was capped for Scotland 30 times between 1974 and 1981, and played for both Manchester United and Leeds during a 16-year career - died at his home in North Yorkshire in June 2023, aged 70.",
      "The cause of death was pneumonia as he had become frail and bed-bound for months, the inquest in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, heard earlier this month.",
      "That frailty was due to a combination of vascular dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), coroner Jon Heath said.",
      "The coroner gave a narrative conclusion on Monday, finding that McQueen died from pneumonia as a consequence of mixed vascular dementia and CTE.",
      "He said: \"It is likely that repetitive head impacts sustained by heading the ball while playing football contributed to the CTE.\"",
      "McQueen's TV presenter daughter Hayley McQueen was in court to hear the findings.",
      "When giving evidence at his inquest earlier this month, she was asked by her barrister Michael Rawlinson KC if her father had discussed whether anything in his past history was behind his dementia.",
      "She said: \"He said 'heading a football for all those years probably hasn't helped'.\"",
      "McQueen said her dad was relatively injury-free during his career but did suffer some concussions, adding: \"They would just head back out and play.\"",
      "She also recalled how, when she was young, he would come home from training with Manchester United and lie down in a darkened room with a headache.",
      "She described how her father was very healthy and active - both in sport and with his family - during his playing days and after he retired.",
      "But she said the family began to notice changes in his personality after his 60th birthday.",
      "McQueen said her father had always been very sociable and outgoing, but became more withdrawn.",
      "She said that although her father was a central defender, he was well known for scoring goals from set-pieces, usually with his head.",
      "He came to prominence in England following his move to Leeds from St Mirren in 1972, helping the Yorkshire club to league title success in 1973-74 and playing a key role in their run to the European Cup final in 1975.",
      "McQueen then joined Leeds's arch-rivals Manchester United in 1978 and went on to win the FA Cup in 1983.",
      "Injury robbed him of a World Cup appearance in 1978 after he had been included in Scotland's squad having made his senior debut in 1974 against Belgium.",
      "After retiring as a player, McQueen had a brief spell as Airdrie manager and coach at former club St Mirren, and spent five years as coach at Middlesbrough under Bryan Robson until 2001.",
      "The inquest heard how McQueen's family donated his brain, after his death, to Professor Willie Stewart - a consultant neuropathologist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, who has conducted extensive research into brain injury in footballers and rugby players.",
      "Prof Stewart told the inquest he found evidence of CTE - a brain disorder linked to repeated head impacts - and vascular dementia.",
      "Prof Stewart agreed with Mr Rawlinson, for the McQueen family, when he asked whether the CTE \"more than minimally, negligibly or trivially\" contributed to the death and that \"heading the ball\" contributed to the CTE.",
      "The professor said the only evidence available was McQueen's \"high exposure\" to heading a football."

      "Michael Carrick has got off to the dream start as head coach of Manchester United until the end of the season; But are wins against Man City and Premier League leaders Arsenal enough to justify a premature permanent appointment?",
      "Monday 26 January 2026 14:25, UK",
      "Manchester United fans should not get carried away with Michael Carrick. But why not?",
      "So far, Carrick has shown you do not need to \"suffer\" to win football matches; instead, he's proved football is a simple game.",
      "But the dilemma now is whether he merits the permanent role, or, despite an apparent turnaround at Old Trafford, United should still bite the bullet and stick to their original plan to appoint a different permanent Ruben Amorim successor.",
      "Some fans have made up their minds and the players are rejuvenated but Roy Keane and Gary Neville remain cautious.",
      "Keane says United need a manager \"who you feel can get them winning league titles\", while before the derby day win and the victory at league leaders Arsenal, Neville said there \"cannot be any consideration\" that Carrick takes the job.",
      "However, the football United fans have been exposed to against Man City and Arsenal, the two sides at the top of the Premier League, cannot be taken for granted.",
      "As Carrick celebrated Patrick Dorgu's zinger to make it 2-1 at Arsenal, Neville said the stand-in United boss had put his hands up like the \"messiah\". What United have been exposed to in just two games is what they have been waiting for and prophesied about for over a decade.",
      "The football taught by Carrick works because, rather than treating the game like an exact science, he has allowed it to become an art of self-expression.",
      "Players playing to their strengths with the added pinch of nostalgia has been the recipe for Carrick's early success, with the squad no longer demanded to follow an elaborate instruction manual that never really makes clear what the final product would be.",
      "Carrick's United are direct, front-foot and have thus far been the perfect advert of \"United DNA\", averaging more fast breaks than any other team in the league.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo leads the line because he's made the most runs in behind per 90 in the Premier League this season. Bruno Fernandes is back in his favoured No 10 position as he remains one of the league's most potent chance creators. Dorgu has remained as a wide player because of his consistent displays high up the pitch.",
      "With very little time on the training pitch after taking on his team mid-season, there have been very few complaints from Carrick about his current situation. Why would there be? He's been given a free hit at Old Trafford, just as he was given one in 2021, following the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. As he did then, reinstalling fundamentals has become a stroke of genius.",
      "In truth, it's all the makings of what United would hope to see in the first two games of any new permanent manager. Perhaps if it wasn't Carrick, perhaps if it was someone new in the dugout, there'd be a unanimous acceptance that he should be the next man in charge. Unfortunately, United have been here before.",
      "In December 2018, a harrowing 3-1 defeat at Liverpool meant that Jose Mourinho's time at United was called to a close.",
      "United was described as toxic as Old Trafford soured under Mourinho, who grew grumpy in the role and was losing favour amongst the playing squad. Solskjaer came in and had an opportunity to stamp his mark and did so in style.",
      "A 5-1 victory at Cardiff set Solskjaer and United on a trail of 12 matches without defeat in the Premier League. With positivity flowing through the place, the change in style to something more akin to the glory days under Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "As we've seen under Carrick, there's something about a side fearless in transition that United fans love to watch.",
      "After winning 14 of his 19 interim matches, including an incredible comeback win at Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League, Solskjaer was named United's permanent manager in March 2019. Solskjaer's interim efforts propelled United's top-four chances at the time.",
      "However, after United appointed Solskjaer, everyone returned from the honeymoon and to a dose of realism that Solskjaer was an inexperienced manager whose positive energy outweighed his proficiency in the role. United quickly crashed and burned that season, winning just two of their last eight, missing out on the top four.",
      "Throughout Solskjaer's three years in charge, a similar pattern sustained. United would go on to finish third and second under Solskjaer, but notoriously couldn't get over the line to achieve material success.",
      "United fans look back at their time under Solskjaer, perhaps as fondly as any time since Ferguson's retirement in 2013, but there was ultimately nothing tangible gained under the manager who made United simply \"feel good\".",
      "Under Solskjaer, United were a nearly team, reaching multiple semi-finals in all the cup competitions before a Europa League final in 2021 ended in a penalty shoot-out defeat to Villarreal.",
      "David de Gea's missed penalty is viewed by many as the true sliding doors moment that led to Solskjaer's ultimate demise in the role but the reality was that United were serial losers when push came to shove.",
      "There's an underlying resistance to repeat the same mistake with Carrick. When United opted to appoint Solskjaer permanently, the regime at the time, in the same breath, lost the chance to appoint Zinedine Zidane and Mauricio Pochettino, who at that time were the outstanding rumoured candidates.",
      "Should United appoint Carrick permanently, they will miss out on tapping into the thriving economy of available managers to do what they have tried in the past.",
      "There's no reason to suggest Carrick would be the same or worse than Solskjaer, but after years of experimenting, the next decision on United manager feels like the most significant one yet.",
      "It could be the difference between returning to a side worthy of the name and reputation or remaining in a cycle of failure.",
      "On current evidence, Carrick would be an astute appointment. But if United want to do something new, however well Carrick does, he shouldn't be among the future candidates. Fans will get carried away, as fans are allowed to. INEOS, though, have another era-defining decision to make.",

      "Sesko went down the middle and the attack-minded Matheus Cunha was shifted to the left, with his winning goal coming from when he was able to drift into space before curling in.",
      "\"We're not getting carried away,\" said Carrick, but some Man Utd fans left the Emirates singing \"we're going to win the league\". They now sit inside the top four and while a title challenge is most unlikely, securing a Champions League spot is much more achievable.",
      "And Man Utd's next five fixtures are inviting: Fulham, Tottenham, West Ham, Everton and Crystal Palace.",
      "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer didn't lose in his first 11 games, winning 10, when he took over on an interim basis in 2019. It was a run that earned him a three-year contract.",
      "With 15 matches remaining, another former Man Utd player can stake his claim for extending his time in charge.David Richardson",
      "Is Ezri Konsa the best English centre-back in the Premier League right now? It's hard to argue against it.",
      "Newcastle away is a ferocious fixture. Konsa, instead, made it look calm. That, more than anything, is the mark of top-level defending.",
      "What stood out wasn't crunching tackles or sliding blocks, it was his positioning. Konsa was always where Newcastle didn't want him to be. He read the game two or three seconds quicker than those around him.",
      "There's a maturity to his defending now that suggests a player who truly understands risk. When to step out, when to hold the line. It was a performance that oozed class and intelligence.",
      "This wasn't a one-off, either. Konsa's consistency has been quietly excellent for some time, which perhaps explains why he started six of England's World Cup qualifiers.",
      "Right now, Konsa is playing with authority, composure and a footballing brain that elevates those around him.",
      "If England are looking for a defender they can trust when the pressure rises this summer at the World Cup, Konsa is making a compelling case.Lewis Jones",
      "Crystal Palace have had six rough weeks.",
      "Marc Guehi has left for Man City, Oliver Glasner has announced he will leave the club at the end of the season and speculation about Jean-Philippe Mateta's future is rife - not to mention their embarrassing FA Cup exit at the hands of non-League Macclesfield.",
      "And now, if Tottenham are being mentioned in conversations about the battle against relegation, the Eagles - level on points with Spurs, but a place below in 15th - must be, too.",
      "Since the 2-1 win at Fulham on December 7, it's now eight without a win in the Premier League.",
      "Indeed, they have now failed to win any of their last 11 matches across all competitions (D4 L7), which is both the longest current winless run of any Premier League side and the Eagles' longest winless run since a run of 13 between January and March 2023.",
      "They've picked up two points in the league across that run and scored only three goals, while shipping 18.",
      "There were plenty of signs they can avoid being dragged into the mix-up as it takes shape in the coming weeks, but right now, they just need a win, and with tricky trips to Nottingham Forest and Brighton up next, it's hard to see where it is going to come from.Dan Long",
      "As Rob Green put it, Nottingham Forest were unspectacular but effective. But that was more than enough to blunt Brentford for only the second time on home soil this season.",
      "The hosts had two gilt-edged chances before half-time, attempted 35 crosses but only forced Matz Sels into one real save across 90 minutes at the Gtech. They faced a Forest side playing peak Sean Dyche football for much of the game, but one they played into the hands of.",
      "Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic will head and kick everything away all day. Brentford did not move Forest around enough, and on the rare occasion they did manufacture something from a clever pass they nearly scored.",
      "The timing of the visitors' two goals, book-ending the game as they did, could not have been much better and showed up a Brentford attack which laboured but had few ideas to combat the visitors' low block.",
      "Brentford will not face Dyche every week. But losing Mikkel Damsgaard to a suspected knee injury will not aid their cause given a lack of real creative alternatives in midfield. Keith Andrews himself said it had been a delight to watch the Danish midfielder play - and he will hope more than anyone that his diagnosis is not serious.Ron Walker",
      "Newcastle's summer recruitment in forward areas was meant to soften the blow of life without Alexander Isak. Instead, it's starting to underline just how hard he is to replace.",
      "The 2-0 defeat to Aston Villa felt like a case study in attacking shortfall. Plenty of effort, plenty of running but very little incision. When the game needed a spark, Eddie Howe turned to his bench and got no real lift.",
      "Jacob Ramsey, Anthony Elanga and Nick Woltemade - a combined cost of £175m - were all given opportunities but the game passed them by. Ramsey looked lost, Elanga's pace never translated into end product and Woltemade looked isolated against Villa's centre-backs.",
      "Meanwhile, Yoane Wissa, another summer recruit, couldn't find space to threaten from the start.",
      "This is where Isak's absence looms large. He doesn't just score goals, his movement and intelligence won Newcastle games. Without him, the attack looks flatter, easier to contain and more predictable.",
      "Recruitment is always judged over time, but right now the early evidence suggests Newcastle haven't found the right blend to cover for Isak's unique profile.Lewis Jones",
      "Joao Pedro was the player of the match at Crystal Palace but Estevao continues to excite. The 18-year-old Brazilian became the youngest Chelsea player to score and assist in the same Premier League match since Neil Shipperley in 1993. Different times.",
      "His goal in the 3-1 win was superb, showing not just pace but skill and strength to hold off a quality defender in Tyrick Mitchell. The finish was emphatic, ramming the ball beyond Dean Henderson. No wonder Chelsea supporters want to see more of him.",
      "This was Estevao's first goal since the win over Barcelona in November, although Chelsea as a whole have been a little out of sorts since then. This was a first Premier League away win since beating Burnley that month, ending a run of five without a win.",
      "There are a plethora of options for Liam Rosenior in the attacking positions at Chelsea. That, coupled with some fitness issues, has led to Estevao making more of his appearances off the bench than from the start since losing to Leeds in early December.",
      "But Estevao's potential far outstrips that of his peers in Chelsea blue - not just for the future but the here and now. No player has scored more goals for the club at the same age during the Premier League era. His impact at Selhurst Park feels like just the start.Adam Bate",

      "Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick is relishing the opportunity for his side to prove themselves against league leaders Arsenal after a dream start at Old Trafford.",
      "Carrick, who is in interim charge of United until the end of the season, got off to a winning start as he led his side to a 2-0 derby day win at Old Trafford. It was a performance that earned plaudits for a dominant attacking display.",
      "The former United midfielder is preparing his side for another test against an Arsenal side that are in the driving seat to end a 22-year wait for a Premier League title.",
      "United travel to the Emirates, where the Gunners haven't lost a single game at the Emirates this season, searching for a first Premier League win at Arsenal since 2017.",
      "However, Carrick may take some added confidence given the fact that when he last took on Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, the 44-year-old guided United to a 3-2 victory in 2021, while in caretaker charge.",
      "\"I think Mikel's done a really good job assembling a team that can do so many things well. That in itself is a challenge.",
      "\"The wide men are dangerous one-vs-one. They fill the box and they get a good balance within the team, how they attack, how they defend.",
      "\"They're all a team and they all play their part. It's not necessarily one individual who carries them. Again, from a coaching point of view, credit to Mikel for that.",
      "\"Set plays, they're a threat as well. That's why they're sitting at the top of the league and that's why they're doing so well at the moment in the Champions League.",
      "\"The feeling we've taken over the last week or two in the game and the training, The boys feel in a good place and are looking forward to the game.",
      "\"It's a challenge, we know that, but we can go there and we can face it head-on. We've got good players and we're a good team as well, so we've just proved that. We need to keep proving it as we go.\"",
      "Recalling the win over Arteta's Arsenal in 2021, Carrick added: \"There's not much to take from that moving into this one. It's a whole new challenge, a whole new game, a whole new group of players. More feeding off what we've done this week, going into the game and looking forward to it.\"",
      "Mikel Arteta expects Manchester United to bring \"intensity\" and \"new ideas\" under Carrick as Arsenal aim to get back to winning ways following goalless draws against Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.",
      "The Arsenal boss is especially wary of their counter-attacking threat having watched them ruthlessly punish Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in last weekend's Manchester derby.",
      "\"Michael coming in will bring new ideas,\" he said. \"Always, the intensity rises up.",
      "\"You could see that in the Manchester derby, the kind of behaviours and the game that they played, so we will expect a really tough match and we'll adapt to that for sure.",
      "\"But we are at home and we know how important that game is for us.",
      "\"They are so good in a lot of departments, but it is clear that when that team has a space to go in a certain place to activate or run, they become lethal.",
      "\"You saw that a few days ago in Manchester. They have a lot of attributes to cause you problems. But as well, like every team, they have their weaknesses as well.",
      "\"Historically, there has always been something very linked to that,\" he added of their counter-attacking threat. \"And the profile of players that they always have and certain individuals that are so good at activating those spaces as well.",
      "\"I don't know the stats exactly, but for sure, they are one of the best.\"",
      "Arteta also recalled his meetings with Carrick as a player. \"One of my favourite No 6s,\" he said. \"Very intelligent, looked like he could never break sweat, he was so in control of the games.\"",
      "Of their previous meeting as coaches, Arsenal's 3-2 loss at Old Trafford in December 2021, Arteta added: \"Not great memories, so we have to change them.\"",
