      "Manchester United are gearing up to host Chelsea at Old Trafford this weekend as they aim to kick-start a bid to turn their season around. The Red Devils have had a rocky start to the campaign, with just one victory from their first four league matches - their latest defeat being a thumping at the hands of Manchester City last weekend.",
      "The task doesn't get any easier as they prepare to welcome Chelsea to Manchester. Manager Ruben Amorim is hoping to field his strongest team for the clash, and it seems he may be in luck with a couple of key players poised to make a comeback.",
      "Amorim has confirmed that both Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are fit and ready to play, although Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez remain sidelined.",
      "In his pre-match press conference, he revealed: \"Dalot is out, Mase and Cunha are in the squad. Licha is still out, that is it.\"",
      "Discussing Martinez's recovery, Amorim said: \"It's really important [that Martinez is nearing a return]. When you have that injury you recover a lot of times very fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step.",
      "\"We do miss Licha a lot. We miss the aggression in this moment, how aggressive he is on everything he does, we miss him. But he's always there in every meeting, even in training, he stays there to watch the training... I think we need Licha in this team.\"",
      "Another player who won't be featuring is Tyrell Malacia, who is currently up for sale. Speaking about the Dutchman, Amorim said: \"He is returning with contact with the ball with the Under-21s, then we will see.\"",
      "Enzo Maresca's squad have kicked off the new season on a high note. The Blues remain undefeated after four matches, despite a loss in their Champions League opener against Bayern Munich.",
      "The west London side faced a new worry during their match against the German giants as Cole Palmer appeared to pick up an injury, but he seems likely to be fit for the Old Trafford clash.",
      "During his pre-match press conference, Maresca confirmed: \"Cole is okay. We have a session now, we flew back yesterday. We need to assess some players, we have some doubt. We didn't have a session since Wednesday's game, but we will see.\"",
      "While Palmer appears ready to play, several other players won't be joining him on the pitch. Long-term injuries continue to sideline Levi Colwill and Liam Delap, while midfielder Dario Essugo is also out of action.",
      "Benoit Badiashile and Romeo Lavia are grappling with their own fitness issues and, although they're nearing recovery, this weekend's journey to Old Trafford may come too soon.",
      "In addition to the injury woes, Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi remain out of favour and are almost certain not to make the cut, while Ukrainian star Mykhailo Mudryk is serving a suspension.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United would've had to fork out £122million to have Gianluigi Donnarumma on their books for the duration of his five-year deal - with the finances involved ultimately motivating them to look elsewhere in the summer.",
      "The Italian was a man on the lookout for a new club when it became clear his time at PSG was up. The Red Devils were offered the chance to sign the highly-rated goalkeeper, who was being forced to leave Paris when his former club refused to entertain his wage demands.",
      "Whilst adding a shotstopper was on United's radar in the summer, they were concerned at the overall cost of having Donnarumma at the club. At 26 he remains in his prime and was seeking a lengthy deal - ultimately landing a five-year contract at Manchester City.",
      "But the Red Devils were originally quoted a fee of £35million to land Donnarumma. His annual wages were then a staggering £17.4m. That is a weekly salary of £330,000, which would've made him the club's highest earner, reports the Telegraph. Across the duration of a five-year deal, that would've been a mammoth £87m.",
      "United believe that the four deals they struck - which include adding Benjamin Sesko and Bryan Mbeumo - did not go against the market value or the club’s wage structure. Signing Donnarumma would have changed that.",
      "The Italian made a winning debut in the Manchester derby and underlined his quality with a stellar save from Mbeumo in the second-half. United have been criticised for their failure to land the Euro 2020 winner, but they had originally planned to stick with Andre Onana, Altay Bayindir and Tom Heaton.",
      "Senne Lammens, the young Belgian goalkeeper, was signed for £18m on deadline day, but their long-term planning was again under the spotlight when they allowed Onana to leave on loan. He headed to Turkey with Trabzonspor and United couldn't land a replacement as the window had shut.",
      "Earlier in the summer Ruben Amorim had considered moving for World Cup winner Emi Martinez. However, Aston Villa wanted a fee of £30m and the Argentina keeper’s wage expectations were as much as £10m a year.",
      "United remain scarred by their constant transfer failures of the past, which have largely come about because they overpaid for players and pursued individuals regardless of their age. Those blunders made an impact on their finances and left the club with a number of players who were difficult to shift given their hefty wages and the length of their contracts.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Enzo Maresca has delivered an update on Cole Palmer before Chelsea play Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday evening. Palmer featured for the full 90 minutes against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday night, scoring their only goal in the 3-1 loss.",
      "That marked the first match he has completed since picking up a groin injury last month. Palmer's comeback came as a second-half substitute during the 2-2 drawn with Brentford in their previous league outing.",
      "However, more than a month after sustaining that setback whilst warming up to face West Ham United, the concern appears to have passed. \"Cole is OK,\" Maresca responded when quizzed whether his player was fit.",
      "The head coach then revealed additional team news before the weekend's fixture during his press conference on Friday morning. \"We have a session now,\" Maresca acknowledged, \"we flew back yesterday.",
      "\"We need to assess some players; we have some doubts. We didn't have a session since Wednesday's game, but we will see.\"",
      "Maresca did reveal more when questioned about Alejandro Garnacho confronting his former club for the first time. \"In the last two games, he was very good when he came on,\" the Chelsea boss said.",
      "\"So we are happy with the way he has adapted to our style and what we want from the winger. I think he is ready to start.\"",
      "Estevao Willian, however, is a player who requires more time to develop. \"Estevao can be great in all of the attacking positions,\" Maresca conceded when asked about his potential. \"His talent is very good, he is a top player, but he is 18. He needs time.\"",
      "Maresca, meanwhile, confirmed that Marc Guiu remains part of their plans. \"The reason why he is back [from being on loan at Sunderland] is because we intend to use him,\" the coach said. \"He needs to do things better and improve things, but for sure, we are going to use him.\"",
      "That is not the case for Axel Disasi or Raheem Sterling, though. \"I've been in Raheem's situation and Axel's situation as a player,\" Maresca said.",
      "\"I know it is not the best feeling. You want to play games, but for different reasons, the situation is the way it is at the moment.",
      "\"The club is giving them the opportunity to work in the right way. That's all I can say.",
      "\"I know it is something you like and want to talk about. It's not just Chelsea, it's every club in the world. When, for any reason, the player and the club do not find any solution, you give the player the tools to train, but if you are not involved in the squad, you are not involved in the squad.\"",

      "Having featured in every previous knockout match in the tournament, the decision immediately sparked speculation about his Old Trafford future. His £40million move to the Blues made him United's fourth-biggest departure ever, trailing only Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria.",
      "The Red Devils also secured a 10 per cent sell-on fee as part of the agreement with Chelsea.",

      "A player who made his Premier League debut with Marcus Rashford is now a travel agent after quitting football at just 28. Following a tough few years, Rashford is on the crest of a wave following his match-winning brace for Barcelona at Newcastle in the Champions League.",
      "A perfect header and a rasping long-range effort at St James' Park underlined the quality Rashford has in his locker, which he struggled to produce on a regular basis at Manchester United, leading to his loan moves to Aston Villa last season and then Barcelona on a season-long deal. It’s been almost a decade since Rashford’s stunning first Premier League appearance.",
      "Having scored twice off the bench in a Europa League victory over Midtjylland, Rashford was deployed from the start by then-manager Louis van Gaal. It proved to be one of the better decisions of the Dutchman’s tenure as Rashford scored twice to really announce himself to English football.",
      "Another United youngster made his Premier League debut that day in February 2016, James Weir, who came on for Ander Herrera in the 89th minute. His career went a very different direction from Rashford’s. He left for Hull City at the end of that season after captaining United’s under-21 side to the Premier League 2 title.",
      "He played for Wigan Athletic and Bolton Wanderers and had spells in Slovakia and Hungary, but his career was blighted by injury before he retired last year.",
      "\"She was telling me about it, explaining that I could run my own business and that it was essentially a franchise, but you work as much as you want.",
      "\"I have always really liked travelling and I have been lucky enough to go to places in Europe and all around the world when I was younger with Man United; I went to Brazil and Singapore. I have always been one for going to different destinations which might not be on everybody's to-do list.",
      "\"I do enjoy that side of it and I like the idea of the freedom to run your own business. In football, you are constantly told what to do, when to do it, which is part of the game, but I like the idea of being a bit more flexible.",
      "\"I am really enjoying it. It is hard and it is a gradual thing, where you're building your business and your clients. But I am really enjoying it and I think I made the right decision.\"",
      "While his football career did not pan out as hoped, he remains proud of his senior appearance for United on such a memorable day. He told the Guardian: “For Marcus to score twice was surreal. It made the day even more special.",
      "“I was a bit older than him, but we were in the same digs together for a couple of years. We used to play FIFA together and go out for food, but I didn’t play with him too much as I was a bit older than him.",
      "“When he got to the reserves, we had a couple of games, but he was straight through to the first team really. He missed that period because we had no strikers at the time.",
      "“He went on to take his chance and the rest is history. We all knew he was the top one in his age group and that he was always destined to reach pretty good heights.”",

      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim has been steadfast ever since his arrival at Manchester United 10 months ago. The Portuguese boss replaced Erik ten Hag last November as the Red Devils boss, but almost a year on, it's been a simply dire period for fans across the globe.",
      "After a 15th-placed Premier League finish last season, the club's worst since the inaugural season of the top-flight, clear progress continues to seemingly evade the 40-year-old in his bid to bring success back to Old Trafford.",
      "With United having played six games across all competitions this season, they've earned just one victory which came against Burnley and are already out of the EFL Cup due to a shock upset loss against Grimsby Town.",
      "Despite the negative results, Amorim has dug his heels in when it comes to continuing with his system, as he said following their 3-0 defeat to Manchester City: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "The ex-Tottenham Hotspur midfielder earlier this month admitted he's surprised Amorim has remained in his job at Manchester, given the disappointing start of the season he's presided over.",
      "\"I can't believe Ruben Amorim is still in charge,\" he said on talkSPORT. \"When are they going to let it go? When are they going to just… do what Sheffield United have done, just swallow their pride [and say] 'we got this wrong?'",
      "\"Get Ole back in. They can't carry on doing this. They'll go down. They'll be playing Rotherham next season.\" Believing the Portuguese manager has run his course at Old Trafford, O'Hara claimed a re-appointment of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who was sacked by Besiktas last month, would be a step in the right direction for United.",
      "\"I believe that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, if you get him back in, go back to the formation that they were playing before, get the players back onside, give them a bit of freedom, and I think they can maybe just calm everything down.\"",
      "The ex-United first-team coach lamented Amorim's stubbornness to his footballing philosophy and claimed that if the negative results continue, he sees a reality where the 40-year-old faces the sack before Christmas.",
      "Speaking to football betting site BetVictor, the Dutchman said: \"Could Ruben Amorim be gone before Christmas?, Absolutely, he could well be. And I think if he keeps being as stubborn as he is and the results don't improve, he doesn't keep winning, then there's definitely no other way than the club has to make a decision.\"",
      "In the possibility that Amorim exits the club, Meulensteen advocated for Michael Carrick's return to United, with the former England midfielder having been out of a job since his sacking from Middlesbrough this past summer.",
      "He added: \"Michael Carrick might be the obvious option if Ruben Amorim is to go. Obviously Michael Carrick still knows quite a few players that were there when he was there. So he's still got some good inside information. He obviously knows the club. He knows what's expected from the club.\"",
      "Foster, 42, said the possibility of dismissing Amorim has been an idea for a while, given how their season went last year, but a decision hasn't been triggered yet. The former United goalkeeper urged the manager to change his system if he wants a change of fortune.",
      "Speaking on his Fozcast podcast, he said: \"It's been rumbling for a long time. Nobody wants to really commit to it [sacking Amorim] but I guarantee you that if they've got eight points and they're still in 14th position after eight games, somebody's going to have to pull the trigger.",
      "\"It can't carry on like that. It's nearly a year since he's been managing and it's been proven that it's not working. I get that he wants to play that system, but if you haven't got the players, you can't play it. Surely you just play your best players in their best position, because then you'll get the best out of them.\"",
      "The former Chelsea striker said the consistently bad performances and results United keep providing will eventually give Jason Wilcox, United's director of football, no chance but to make a decision on Amorim's future.",
      "\"I think Manchester United have got real issues now,\" Sutton said on BBC Five Live's Monday Night Club. \"How long has he been in charge? Is it his team now? Yes, it is. Is it working?",
      "\"If he is going to be that stubborn and be unwilling to change... If he is going to stick with this system and it is not working, then I am afraid Jason Wilcox and the Man Utd hierarchy have a decision to make based on performances we have seen this season.",
      "\"What is the ambition of Man Utd this season? I don't really know, but the fact that they are already out of one cup and there's no European football... The pressure is well and truly on.\"",
      "Amorim holds a woeful 26% win ratio at United with just eight wins in 31 Premier League games in charge. Despite the horrendous record, Pallister was insistent that patience will exist in regards to Amorim's future which he said won't be harmed by their loss to City.",
      "\"I think Mason was desperate to do well. I think he started [the season] okay. And then we lose them both to injuries. I think there'll be patience. Everybody's going to put him under the pump for sticking with the back three.",
      "\"It's not what a lot of teams do. And the longer it goes, and the longer we struggle with it, the more questions are going to be asked.\"",
      "The Manchester United legend said Amorim has no time to waste following the below-par start to the season. With United already nearing the bottom of the table just four games in, Neville admitted their upcoming clash against Chelsea holds tremendous weight regarding his future at the club.",
      "Speaking on the Gary Neville podcast following their derby day defeat, the pundit said: \"Ruben Amorim is going to come under big pressure, he’s going to come under big pressure, Manchester United are 14th in the league.",
      "\"It’s only a few games in, it’s four games in, but next week, if Manchester United lose and they go and they go to 15th or 16th and it’s five games in, before you know it we’re in October and Manchester United are in the bottom half of the table and that’s where they couldn’t be, having spent £200 million, with him having a pre-season.",
      "\"They might be seventh, eighth, ninth, they could be in those types of positions, but they can’t be in the bottom half of the table, so there’s got to be a turnaround pretty quickly, and the manager’s idea has got to land very quickly with the players.\"",
      "Amorim has made no qualms about walking away from United if the ownership and fans no longer have belief in his ability to do the job. The former Soccer Saturday presenter took Amorim's words on board and admitted he believes there's a possibility he resigns. \"I think there is a chance,” said Stelling on talkSPORT.",
      "\"I think he has looked pretty disillusioned and some of the things he has said - says to me he is pretty disillusioned. They are playing Chelsea this weekend but I am not sure the players are buying into [the system].\"",
      "The Newcastle icon is another who pointed out the lack of suitability the United players have shown in Amorim's style of play. In what was utter domination by City in their 3-0 triumph this past weekend, Shearer admitted that Amorim can't afford to lose like that against Chelsea.",
      "Speaking to Betfair, he said: \"I don't think they can afford to be beaten like that again this weekend. If they were then you'd have to fear for what's going to happen going forward for the manager. Something must improve rapidly.",
      "\"Man United can't be lingering in 14th/15th/16th in the Premier League. There hasn't been an improvement at all up to now and that can't continue with what they spent.

      "Manchester United remain convinced that Ruben Amorim is the manager to take them forward, and they've taken inspiration from Adoni Iraola's early Bournemouth struggles. The Spaniard endured a difficult start, but now has the Cherries flying high in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim is closing in on his one-year anniversary at Old Trafford, but he has struggled to have a meaningful impact. He's largely taken the team backwards and presided over their lowest ever Premier League finish last season when they ended in 15th.",
      "This term, despite more than £200million being spent in the summer, he's endured more setbacks. The Carabao Cup loss at Grimsby Town was a new low and United were then outclassed in the Manchester derby - beaten 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.",
      "Despite that, the Old Trafford hierarchy believe Amorim is still the right man - and feel that his improvements are backed up by the stats and metrics. A positive change from last term is that United are creating far more chances with the highest xG in the Premier League.",
      "The powers that be in Manchester have noted how Iraola endured a horror start at Bournemouth - failing to win any of his first nine games with six of those defeats. Yet their performances, according to the stats, were positive and the Cherries have benefitted from their patience, reports The Telegraph.",
      "Once Iraola got his first win, it in turn set the team on a run of seven wins in nine matches - one of those being a memorable 3-0 victory at Old Trafford against Erik ten Hag. Bournemouth repeated that result last term, only this time it was Amorim making the decisions in the dugout. They finished ninth last season and currently sit fourth.",
      "The Portuguese coach's record makes for grim reading; he has won just 17 of his 47 games in charge. In the Premier League, since taking charge, United would be placed bottom of all the 17 teams that have been in the league since his arrival.",
      "Criticism has come due to the fact the ex-Sporting Lisbon boss has refused to alter his philosophy or show any pragmatism. He's rigidly stuck to his 3-4-3 formation, which has not bought the desired results, but Amorim has frequently claimed the club will have to sack him if they want to play another way.",
      "He said: \"It's not a record that you should have in Manchester United. There are a lot of things that you have no idea what happened during these months, but I accept that. But I'm not going to change. When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.",
      "\"So, we'll talk about that every game, every game that we lose. 'I don't believe in that, in the system', or whatever. So, I play my way and I'm going to play my way until I want to change.”",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Lamine Yamal and Bruno Fernandes were both left gobsmacked after Marcus Rashford's dazzling double during Barcelona's 2-1 triumph over Newcastle United in the Champions League. Rashford, 27, who swapped Manchester United for Barcelona on a loan deal this summer, netted two goals within eight second-half minutes, helping Hansi Flick's team kick-off their European campaign with a win.",
      "His first goal arrived in the 58th minute when he connected with Jules Kounde's cross and sent a perfectly aimed header into the bottom corner. Not long after, the England star scored his second with an extraordinary long-range shot, smashing the ball into the net via the crossbar from the edge of the box, leaving Nick Pope helpless.",
      "Reacting to the spectacle on Instagram, Fernandes posted a clip of Rashford's second goal with a speechless message, simply adding two mind-blown emojis and a shocked face emoji. Teen prodigy Yamal, who missed the Newcastle match due to a groin problem, also shared his reaction to Rashford's stellar performance but, like Fernandes, didn't use any words; he reposted a post from Barcelona to his story before adding a person gesturing OK emoji and a fire emoji.",
      "Rashford also received encouraging messages from several of his former United teammates. After the England star posted on his own Instagram account, Rasmus Hojlund, Alejandro Garnacho, Joshua Zirkzee Antony, Jadon Sancho, Ethan Wheatley and Jesse Lingard each left a comment.",
      "Hojlund said: \"Well done Marcus [red love heart emoji].\"",
      "Garnacho admitted: \"Wow [star struck emoji, backhand index finger pointing right emoji, male version of the pouting face emoji].\"",
      "Zirkzee wrote: \"Love it [red love heart emoji].\"",
      "Antony posted a face with open mouth emoji, dashing away emoji and two fire emojis, while Lingard put two fire emojis and Wheatley left a smiling face with heart eyes emoji.",
      "Meanwhile, Garnacho, Antony, Hojlund, Sancho, Zirkzee, Lingard, Tyrell Malacia, Wheatley, Jack Grealish, Ayden Heaven, Brandon Williams, Joe Hugill, Bukayo Saka, JJ Gabriel, Richarlison, Amadou Onana, Phil Jones, Harry Amass, Shola Shoretire and Robin van Persie were among the million-plus people to like Rashford's post. Following a goalless streak in his opening four matches for Barcelona, Rashford has now broken his duck in spectacular style, with the Wythenshawe-born striker reflecting on his Catalan adventure after the match.",
      "Rashford added: \"It is an amazing experience. I have always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, as most people my age have watched them play from when we were younger.",
      "\"It is amazing football and amazing players. We just want to win as much as possible. I am very motivated and determined. The quality we have in the team excites me. It is so refreshing to play with these players.\"",
      "Newcastle gave Barcelona a run for their money, with Anthony Gordon netting a late goal to reduce the deficit, but it was too little, too late to change the final outcome. \"Here is not an easy place to play football, I know that first hand,\" Rashford concluded.",
      "\"The first half was very cagey. We did well, we tried to control the game - in spells - but it is very difficult to play against this team. I am really pleased we managed to win the game.\"",

      "\"That is what I am here to do - to help the team win, but also to try to improve and be the best that I can. It is an amazing experience. I have always been a huge admirer of Barcelona as most people my age have watched them play from when we were younger.",

      "Erling Haaland's goal against Napoli means he's become the quickest player in Champions League history to score 50 goals. It is the latest piece of history claimed by the Norwegian and he assumes the record from ex-Manchester United star Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "The Manchester City frontman opened the scoring in Thursday night's 2-0 win with a smart header and further underlined his status as one of Europe's elite marksman. He's bought up his half century of goals in a staggering 49 games.",
      "Van Nistelrooy had held the record for years but it took him 62 games to score 50 times. He was prolific, particularly during his time in Manchester, and had sat top of that list. Haaland's exploits though now have him above the Dutchman and Lionel Messi, who was the third-quickest.",
      "Pep Guardiola said of Haalands' latest achievement: \"What can I say? The numbers speak for themselves. We are lucky to have him. Just to congratulate him, because he's alongside goalscorers like van Nistelrooy, [Robert] Lewandowski, but especially the two monsters Cristiano [Ronaldo] and Messi for 20 years, for Erling to be there is unbelievable.\"",
      "Unlike Van Nistelrooy, Haaland can boast a Champions League winners' medal following his success in 2023.",
      "The striker burst onto the European scene with Red Bull Salzburg before his quality convinced Borussia Dortmund to secure his services.",
      "He remained prolific with the German club but has seen his numbers excel since moving to Manchester. His best single-season effort came in 2022/23 when he scored 12 times in 11 games and 27 of his 50 goals have come while wearing the City blue.",
      "Haaland has only scored the two hat-tricks on the European stage, which is the same number as Van Nistelrooy.",
      "It means he remains some way off the record of eight which is jointly held by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo - the two highest scorers in Champions League history.",
      "Ronaldo sits as the most prolific player in Champions League history having scored 140 times across his spells at United, Real Madrid and Juventus.",
      "Messi is 11 further back but with time on Haaland's side he has been tipped to rival the iconic duo at the top of the list.",
      "When asked if Haaland can one day surpass Ronaldo's mark, Guardiola said: \"In that rhythm, yeah. He's not injured, he could play for 10 or 12 more years, and he maintains this progression, absolutely.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford stole the headlines on his return to an English stadium, scoring a brace including a stunning second from distance. But it was the quiet efficiency of Pedri in midfield which caught Scholes’ eye.",
      "The Manchester United legend posted an image of Barcelona's number 8 Pedri, with the caption ‘My new favourite footballer’.",
      "The Spain international made a similar impact on Rashford, who swapped Old Trafford for the Camp Nou, admitting he was blown away by his talent.",
      "“If you didn’t know his age, you’d think he was 28 or 29 because he’s very mature and understands the game perfectly,” he said earlier this summer. \"He plays at his own pace, and that makes it easy for strikers to keep up with him.”",
      "Scholes’ comments come after he admitted that the options at his beloved United aren’t working as their slump continues. Under-pressure manager Ruben Amorim is strictly sticking to his 3-4-2-1 formation, despite their prolonged struggles.",
      "United spent big on forwards during the summer, bringing in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko for a combined £193million, but neglected recruiting a new midfielder.",
      "That has left Amorim struggling to build an effective partnership in midfield, with Bruno Fernandes being utilised deeper alongside the ageing Casemiro.",

      "He said: \"I don't think the quality is there.Whatever two out of the four or five they have got in [midfield] - Casemiro, Bruno [Fernandes], [Kobbie] Mainoo - whatever combination he seems to try doesn't seem to work.",
      "\"That's a big issue. I thought all summer the absolute priority was a centre midfield player with legs, who can play and can control a game.",
      "\"The recruitment side went to buy forwards. That did need addressing, but did it need three of them? I'm not sure it did.\"",
      "Amorim defiantly defended his midfield selections in the wake of their humbling 3-0 defeat to neighbours Manchester City. \"Guys, I understand how football is,\" Amorim said. \"The results will dictate all the narratives.",

The legendary Manchester United manager, who won 13 Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues and countless other trophies, is now 83 and has been retired for more than a decade.",
      "He is now spending more of his time involved with dementia charities, with the syndrome impacting his only sibling Martin. Ferguson also lost his beloved wife Lady Cathy in 2023, after being married for 58 years.",
      "During an interview with BBC Breakfast to recognise National Playlist Day, the ex-United boss spoke about his brother's situation and how it could potentially affect him in the future.",
      "\"I have a situation myself, with my brother,\" he said. \"It's not easy. I have to be in touch with him a lot. He recognises me [but] the memory's not great.",
      "\"But he's not bad. He's not getting any worse, let's put it that way, which is very encouraging.\"",
      "\"It's at the back of my mind all the time. You think, 'I wonder if he's in just now', or if I should give him a phone [call]. I try to do that each day.",
      "\"I keep telling him: 'Write things down.' I think he tries to do that, but he forgets a lot of the time. When you get to my age, you do have a little worry about whether your memory is going to stand up.",
      "\"I'm 84 in December and there are moments when I forget things. I probably did that 20 years ago, 30 years ago... no-one's blessed with a 100% memory. But when it comes to football, when I was a manager, the memory has always been important. Now I do a lot of crosswords, I sing a lot and read.",
      "\"I tend to go into history - the American civil war. I went to a few of the battlegrounds in America, which I really enjoyed.\"",
      "Ferguson also revealed that following the loss of his wife, he found himself sitting alone in his house for long periods, before moving closer to family and going on more worldwide trips.",
      "He continued: \"After my wife passed, I was stuck in the house a lot. I moved house, into the country, next door to my son - but it's not good enough just to sit watching TV, so I decided to travel. I went to Saudi [Arabia], Hong Kong and Bahrain.",
      "\"Occupy yourself. Dealing with the dementia group has been good for me. It's something that I enjoy.\"",
      "Ferguson spent 26 incredible years at Old Trafford, turning them into the most successful team in English football. In total he won 38 major honours and is still a regular at United's matches to this day.",
      "In 2024, Ferguson first revealed his fears over dementia when he said: \"Generally my memory is quite good - pray the lord, touch wood it’ll stay that way.\"",

      "It's Groundhog Day for Ruben Amorim, whose Manchester United side have continued in the poor vein of form they ended last season, despite splashing out £230million on new players this summer.",
      "It was a busy summer in terms of incomings and outgoings for the Premier League side, who welcomed the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens to Old Trafford. Among the several outgoings from United was Marcus Rashford who joined Barcelona on loan for the rest of the season.",
      "The Englishman has been subject to praise since his move which could see the 40-year-old question his decision to allow a player who scored 138 goals for the club to leave. Paul Scholes has also made his opinion clear on Amorim's decision to retain the services of some players at the club.",
      "Rashford has been described as \"incredible\" by Barcelona boss Hansi Flick, despite Ruben Amorim axing him from his Manchester United plans.",
      "The England star last played for his boyhood club in December 2024 before he was removed from the squad later that month to play Manchester City alongside Alejandro Garnacho.",
      "Rashford, 27, left United a month later to join Aston Villa on loan for the rest of the season, where he returned to form. However, upon his return to Old Trafford this summer, he was one of five players told by Amorim to find new clubs.",
      "A move to the Spanish giants came to fruition for Rashford, who is spending the season on loan at Barcelona. Flick recently said of the striker: \"I've been following Marcus Rashford since his early days at Manchester United and I've always thought he's incredible. What I've seen these past few weeks is very good.\"",
      "With Amorim having had pushed for Rashford's exit, the Portuguese boss also pulled the trigger on five departures, via a permanent sale or loan with Andre Onana, Jadon Sancho, Antony, Rasmus Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho all departing.",
      "However, two players that stayed have come under fire by Paul Scholes who aimed his wrath at Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw remaining Manchester United players.",
      "Maguire, 32, has only played 41 minutes of football in the Premier League this season while Shaw, 30, has started every game as Scholes lamented their lack of physicality and insisted they are not up to the level of their competitors.",
      "In an exclusive interview with SPORTbible, he said: \"I don't think the system was the problem against Manchester City. It's more the personnel. United lack real athletes,\" he said before singling out Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw. \"In the Premier League, you almost have to be like a machine to survive, and we've got people like Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.",
      "\"They are not at the level. In 85 to 90 percent of games, they will probably cope with people, but when you come to the bigger games, against City, Liverpool and Arsenal, they are going to fall short.\"",
      "With 29 injuries to Shaw's name since joining United in 2014, according to Transfermarkt, Scholes questioned just how damage the constant injuries have done to his body. \"You think of the injuries Shaw has had.",
      "\"He must have the body of a 40-year-old man because he’s had that many injuries and missed that much football. If he’d stayed fit, he could’ve been the best left-back in the world. Now, he’s playing left-sided centre-half. He really shouldn’t be at the club anymore.",
      "\"He should have left along with Harry Maguire in the summer. United should have brought in one or two new centre-halves.\" Maguire looks set to play a bit-part role for United this season as Scholes said his former club missed out on banking tens of millions of pounds by not selling him.",
      "\"Maguire has had so much stick, it’s hard to be tough on him because he came back from it,\" he explained. \"But I think they had a chance this summer to sell. They renewed his one-year option. I just didn’t understand that.",
      "\"It was a great chance for him to leave. They might have got £20 or £30 million for him. It was the ideal time. Maybe because he’s good in the dressing room, or good around the place, but football-wise, it’s just not right.\"",

Rashford's brace sank the Magpies as he virtually single-handedly guided Barcelona to victory, initially breaking the deadlock with a well-taken header.",

      "\"I wish the best to Rashford and to [Villa manager] Unai Emery, and they can connect because he's a very good player.\"",

I've won here a few times where we've not played the way we wanted to play, we gave a good account of ourselves and got the three points.",

      "Ruben Amorim answered questions from journalists at Carrington this afternoon.",
      "Manchester United lost 3-0 against Manchester City last weekend, with Amorim now boasting the worst win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "Following his appointment from Sporting Lisbon in November, Amorim oversaw the worst season at Old Trafford for 51 years. Amorim needed to start the new campaign well, but United have made their worst start to a season for 33 years.",
      "United sources have insisted Amorim retains the backing of the board, but football is a results business and Amorim needs to secure positive results to silence the doubters.",
      "Amorim will be hoping to oversee a victory against Chelsea on Saturday and spoke to the media ahead of the game.",
      "Recap what he said at the press conference below.",
      "Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are available for Manchester United's Premier League fixture against Chelsea on Saturday.",
      "Mount and Cunha missed the Manchester derby defeat at City after they both suffered injury in the first half of the 3-2 victory against Burnley three weeks ago.",
      "Diogo Dalot is still out, having withdrawn from the Portugal squad at the start of the month due to muscle soreness.",
      "Lisandro Martinez has started training on the grass seven months after he ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. United head coach Ruben Amorim admitted United have missed Martinez's \"aggression\".",
      "\"Dalot is out,\" Amorim said. \"Mason is in the squad, him and Cunha are in the squad. Licha still out. I think that is it.\"",
      "\"It’s really important [that Martinez is nearing a return]. When you have that injury you recover a lot of times very fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "That's a wrap from today's press conference at Carrington.",
      "\"We used that time to analyse the last game, analyse the next game and prepare different things. I think, again, we are playing well until we reach the boxes. We need to be more clinical. If you see the number of shots, the xG, all these things are good, but if you don't score, or win games, it doesn't matter. Then, again, I said after the last game, the way we suffer the goals, we can avoid it. We are being naive and we need to be more aggressive to win games. We just need to maintain how we are playing, with improving in the opponent's box and our box. That was the focus of the week, especially with Chelsea, which is a team that crosses they have more guys in the box and we suffer a little bit against Fulham and we work a lot during the week on that. It's always the same cycle. Analyse what we did and improve for the next week.",
      "After City, Amorim said there are a lot of things that have happened in the last few months that people don't know about. He was asked what he meant and said:",
      "\"You know more or less, you are here for a while and you have your sources, so you know I was talking about, but now I'm focused on Chelsea.\"",
      "\"And this is football and this is maybe the club with the most pressure in the world. We want to win. And again, you can say whatever. I think last year I was very critical of the way we played. I think we are playing well until the boxes - defending and attacking. We need to be more aggressive in the boxes and more clincal. The rest, I think we are improving. And comparing to last year, we're in a better place. But we need to win and we lost against Arsenal and City. Here losing, in the beginning, especially after last season, is a problem.\"",
      "\"New contract. He was offering me a new contract [laughs]. No, it was normal things, to show his support, explaining that it is a long project. He said many times this is my first season. For me it's not. But normal things. I spoke with him, Omar and Jason, trying to see all the data around the team. So a normal meeting and we had several. But in this moment, it's normal people pay attention to that.\"",
      "\"It’s really important [that Martinez is nearing a return]. When you have that injury you recover a lot of times very fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step. We miss Licha a lot. We miss the aggression in this moment, how aggressive he is on everything he does, we miss him. But he’s always there in every meeting, even in training, he stays there to watch the training. I think we need Licha in this team.\"",
      "\"Garnacho is not our player, I'm focused on our players. I'm really happy with Mason and Cunha returning. The rest, talk to the Chelsea manager.\"",
      "\"He is returning with contact with the ball with the Under-21s, then we will see.\"",
      "\"Dalot is out, Mase and Cunha are in the squad. Licha is still out, that is it.\"",

      "Odds via Betfair.",
      "Amorim will speak at 1.15pm at Carrington, but the quotes are embargoed until 1.30pm.",
      "We'll bring you updates from the press conference from then.",
      "United lost at home to Arsenal on the opening weekend and were defeated 3-0 by Manchester City on Sunday, while their League Cup campaign ended with a humiliating penalty shootout loss to League Two Grimsby Town.",
      "Dressing room sources say the mood after the derby has been particularly sombre, with United players ruing a \"missed opportunity\" against a City side that had lost their previous two games against Tottenham and Brighton.",
      "The United squad had been upbeat about the prospects of a successful season following a harmonious pre-season tour of the United States, when they were primarily based in Chicago.",
      "But their season has already spiralled with one win out of five games, which was secured via a 97th-minute penalty against promoted side Burnley three weeks ago.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Peter Schmeichel believes Ruben Amorim was wrong to suggest Manchester United need to sack him if they want change.",
      "Speaking after the Manchester derby defeat, Amorim was asked whether he would change his approach after United's worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/1993.",
      "Amorim responded: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "United's head coach has stuck by his system, but Schmeichel thought Amorim made a mistake in his post-match press conference because he 'put himself above the club'.",
      "In an interview with Sky Bet, Schmeichel reacted to the Manchester derby defeat, which increased the pressure on Amorim's shoulders at a time when he needs to secure positive results.",
      "Read the full story here.",
      "Alan Shearer believes Ruben Amorim could \"die on his sword\" at Manchester United.",
      "United were hammered 3-0 by Manchester City last weekend, with Amorim now boasting the worst win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",

      "The Reds welcome Chelsea to Old Trafford on Saturday and must bounce back after the derby defeat.",
      "Read what Shearer had to say here.",
      "Hello and welcome to today's Manchester United live press conference blog.",
      "Ruben Amorim will speak to the media today ahead of facing Chelsea on Saturday and he will be asked about the pressure he is under, Chelsea and how the next few weeks could unfold.",

The work rate he was putting in was really good. He held up the ball and passed the ball well. It was disappointing to lose him as well.",

They were miles apart in terms of ability, system, attitude and whatever else you want to name despite what Man United have spent in the summer. I don't think they can afford to be beaten like that again this weekend. If they were then you'd have to fear for what's going to happen going forward for the manager.",
      "\"Something must improve rapidly. Man United can't be lingering in 14th/15th/16th in the Premier League. There hasn't been an improvement at all up to now and that can't continue with what they spent. There has to be something that gets them going and if that doesn't happen quickly then everyone knows the rules when it comes to football management.",

He's either going to die on his sword or get the success that he needs. At the minute it looks really negative, and I don't think a lot of those players are suited to the system.",

Shortly after, the England international netted his second of the night, doubling his side's advantage with a stunning strike from the edge of the box.",
      "Reacting post-match, Rashford took to Instagram and issued a simple seven-word message following his match-winning performance at St James' Park.

      "As well as transfer links to the likes of Ruben Neves, Adam Wharton and many more, it was also a busy night to be a former United player. Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund will want to move on from this evening after losing 2-0 away to Manchester City with Napoli.",
      "However, the talking point of the evening is certainly Marcus Rashford's incredible display for Barcelona against Newcastle United. Do not be surprised if Ruben Amorim is asked about the United academy prospect he banished to the so-called 'Bomb Squad'.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund endured a difficult Champions League debut for Napoli as his side slipped to a defeat to Manchester City.",
      "The Manchester United loanee was back in the city with the Serie A winners. It was a difficult evening from start to finish for the £72million forward, as Antonio Conte's side went down to ten-men after Giovanni Di Lorenzo was red carded after being deemed to have prevented a goalscoring opportunity by hauling down Erling Haaland.",
      "Kevin De Bruyne was sacrificed to bring on another defender in the first half, but Hojound was substituted in the 72nd minute for David Veres when the Neapolitans were trailing to goals from Haaland and Jeremy Doku.",
      "Overall, it was an evening to forget for Hojlund and Scott McTominay, who could not wield the same influence on the blue side of Manchester.",
      "Within 82 minutes of football, Marcus Rashford levelled the total goal of Manchester United's new £200million attacking trio this season.",
      "The United academy graduate was handed a place in the starting eleven for Barcelona's Champions League clash against Newcastle United. It was a huge occasion for Rashford, who has experienced a difficult start to life with the Catalans.",
      "However, he drew level with the combined goal tally of Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, when he guided a fine header into the bottom corner from the penalty spot. If that goal was impressive, his second was spectacular as he found the top corner with a 25-yard rocket.",
      "His second goal of the evening extended his record for the season to two goals and one assist. It was a spectacular display for the forward who was completely frozen out by Ruben Amorim barely one month ago.",
      "On his start to life at Barcelona.",
      "\"Honestly, it's an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona, people my age have watched them from when we was younger, amazing football, amazing players and we want to win as much as possible.\"",
      "On his incredible second goal",
      "\"I've not seen it yet. It was a split second, I seen the far post, I thought I'd get a shot off, when you're going away from goal it's difficult to generate the power to keep it low, I thought try to aim high and I knew when I caught it, it would take some doing for the 'keeper to stop it.\"",
      "Peter Schmeichel ruthlessly slammed Manchester United's acquisition of Senne Lammens by saying \"I've never heard of him.\"",
      "The Red Devils bought the young Belgian from Royal Antwerp towards the end of the transfer window for £18.1million plus add-ons. At the time, United had been linked with Gianluigi Donnarumma and Emiliano Martinez, but opted for the 23-year-old.",
      "With Amorim still persisting with Altay Bayindir, despite the Turkish goalkeeper's difficult start to the season, Schmeichel has admitted he was disappointed the Red Devils did not sign a more experienced goalkeeper.",
      "Speaking to Sky Bet, he said: \"We should have signed Emi Martinez. In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance.\"",
      "He added: \"As for Lammens, I'll be honest, I'd never heard of him until the link came up. I know his stats are excellent across the top ten European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "\"Stats don't show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.\"",
      "Reports from Spain understand Chelsea are set to enter the race for Crystal Palace midfield maestro Adam Wharton.",
      "The England international has been linked with a move to Manchester United, but Wharton did not try to push for an exit from Selhurst Park. Real Madrid have also been mentioned as an admirer of the former Blackburn Rovers star, whose composure in the middle of the park has earned rave reviews.",
      "But according to Spanish outlet Fichajes, Chelsea view the midfielder as someone who can add further depth, particularly with Romeo Lavia struggling with injuries since his move from Southampton.",
      "Marcus Rashford is back in England to face Newcastle United with Barcelona.",
      "The Englishman made his first goal contribution for the La Liga giants, providing a sumptuous cross for Raphinha to tap home in their 6-0 demolition of Valencia. However, what are the terms of his deal?",
      "Agreement with Barcelona",
      "It's understood the deal with the Catalans was a season-long loan deal including a €30million (£26m) option to buy at the end of the season. Recently, there were reports saying Barcelona would have to pay a £4.3m penalty fee if they choose not to sign him permanently, but The Athletic understands this is not the case.",
      "Can he be recalled",
      "While there is no sign Amorim wants to bring Rashford back to the club, the Sun claims United would not be able to recall him even if the United boss did.",
      "With Ruben Neves being linked with a potential move to Manchester United, many fans may be wondering how he could fare.",
      "Fans may remember the sensational goals he scored for Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League and the Champions League. However, the Al-Hilal midfielder has other statistics which suggests he could be exactly what Ruben Amorim needs.",
      "Here are some below:",
      "- Average non-penalty goals per 90 minutes - 0.19",
      "- Average tackles per 90 minutes - 3.21",
      "- Average passes completed per 90 minutes - 74.89",
      "- Average pass completion % 91.8%",
      "\"The talks are ongoing. There’s nothing more to say. We’ll see what happens.’",
      "Manchester United and Manchester City are understood to be tracking 14-year-old goalkeeping prospect Alfie Smith.",
      "Smith is playing four years above his age level for Birmingham City's U18s side. The Midlanders, who are co-owned by Tom Brady, are trying to tie him down to a new long-term contract.",
      "However, the Daily Mail understands the teenager, who is already 6ft 1in tall, is being looked at by United and City, as well as Arsenal and Liverpool. While United have signed Senne Lammens this summer, any potential move for Smith would of course be with an eye on the long-term future, many years away."

      "Matheus Cunha is expected to return from injury for Manchester United's Premier League clash against Chelsea at Old Trafford this Saturday. The 26-year-old was forced off after just 31 minutes of the 3-2 win against Burnley prior to the September international break.",
      "The two-week domestic pause gave him time to recover without missing many matches, which was good news for Ruben Amorim, but he was absent from the squad to face Manchester City last weekend.",
      "Comments from the United boss before that fiery clash suggested he would be back sooner than later. Supporters would have feared the worst when Chelsea striker Liam Delap suffered a hamstring injury on the same day, ruling him out for a few months.",
      "Ahead of facing Chelsea, Amorim was on hand to deliver a mixed team news update. “[Diogo] Dalot is out, Mase and Cunha are in the squad,” the Man United boss admitted at his pre-match press conference.",
      "“Licha [Lisandro Martinez] is still out, that is it.” Having two attackers back available should come as a boost with it more than likely both are used from the bench after last playing three weeks ago.",
      "If it were up to Cunha, the Brazil international would more than likely not have missed any training sessions or games for United because of injury.",
      "After confirming that Cunha, Mount, and Dalot would be unavailable to face City, Amorim said, \"I don’t want to say [when they could be back]. If you talk to Cunha outside, he will say he can play this game. They are pushing really hard.\"",
      "The latest update regarding a potential return for Cunha came courtesy of journalist Ben Jacobs, and it certainly shows he is doing all he can to play as many minutes as possible.",
      "Speaking on the United Stand, he said: “[Matheus] Cunha has been working with a personal trainer, and he’s been telling people he’ll be ready for the Chelsea game.”",
      "Having Cunha back is a massive boost for Amorim and United, but it is unclear how much he will be able to play. Given the intensity that the Chelsea fixture will likely be played at, coming off the bench around the 60th minute is most likely depending on game state.",
      "An alternative option would be to start Cunha with the possibility of either taking him off at the interval or just before the hour-mark.",

      "Manchester United welcome Chelsea to Old Trafford this weekend desperate to finally kick their season into life. United have won just one out of their opening four league games and were dismantled by rivals Manchester City last weekend.",
      "And they've got another tough task on their hands as they welcome the Blues to Manchester. Ruben Amorim will certainly hope to call on his best players for the game and, thankfully, a couple of stars look set to return.",
      "The United manager has confirmed that both Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount are ready to return, albeit Diogo Dalot and Lisandro Martinez are still out.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference, he said: \"Dalot is out, Mase and Cunha are in the squad. Licha is still out, that is it.\"",
      "On the Argentine, Amorim added: \"It's really important [that Martinez is nearing a return]. When you have that injury you recover a lot of times very fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step.",
      "\"We do miss Licha a lot. We miss the aggression in this moment, how aggressive he is on everything he does, we miss him. But he's always there in every meeting, even in training, he stays there to watch the training... I think we need Licha in this team.\"",
      "Another star ruled out is up-for-sale Tyrell Malacia. \"He is returning with contact with the ball with the Under-21s, then we will see,\" Amorim said about the Dutchman.",
      "Elsewhere, Enzo Maresca's side have enjoyed a positive start to the new campaign. The Blues are unbeaten after four games, albeit they slipped to defeat in their Champions League opener against Bayern Munich.",
      "The west London side picked up a fresh concern against the German heavyweights with Cole Palmer seemingly sustaining an issue, but he looks set to be fit to play at Old Trafford.",
      "Speaking in his pre-match press conference, Maresca said: \"Cole is okay. We have a session now, we flew back yesterday. We need to assess some players, we have some doubt. We didn't have a session since Wednesday's game, but we will see.\"",
      "And while Palmer looks set to take to the pitch, there are a host of players who won't. Long-term absentees Levi Colwill and Liam Delap are both still on the side-lines, while midfielder Dario Essugo is also ruled out.",
      "Benoit Badiashile and Romeo Lavia have been struggling with their own issues and, while they are closing in on returns, this weekend's trip to Old Trafford looks slightly too early.",
      "Away from injuries, Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi both remain out in the cold and are almost certain not to be included, while Ukraine international Mykhailo Mudryk is suspended.",

    "source": "manchestereveningnews",
    "body": [
      "Many Manchester United fans will have cringed when they read Alejandro Garnacho's first words after signing for Chelsea.",
      "\"I can't wait to get started. I watched the Club World Cup, and to join the world champions is special - we're the best team in the world,\" said Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho trained alone at Carrington throughout the summer after a breakdown in his relationship with Ruben Amorim at the end of last season. He expressed his desire to leave, and a £40million deal was finally agreed with Chelsea in the final week of the transfer window.",
      "That felt like a low fee for a player of Garnacho's talent, but Chelsea initially entered discussions by offering £25m and United's bargaining power was damaged by the world knowing he needed to leave.",
      "Regardless, Garnacho became United's fourth-highest sale in history, behind Cristiano Ronaldo, Romelu Lukaku and Angel Di Maria.",
      "United included a 10 per cent sell-on fee in the deal and Garnacho signed a lucrative seven-year contract at Stamford Bridge. United said Garnacho left for London with their best wishes, but that sentiment is not shared by some supporters after an eventful final six months at the club.",
      "There were discipline issues with Garnacho during Erik ten Hag's reign, but the beginning of the end of his United career was in December when he was dropped for the Manchester derby.",
      "Speaking before that game, Ruben Amorim confirmed Garnacho and Marcus Rashford had been dropped due to selection reasons. They were available, but Amorim had seen something he did not like.",
      "Garnacho was reintegrated into the squad, while Rashford was sent on loan to Aston Villa. Garnacho sought to make amends with Amorim and did the right things to be involved again.",
      "However, cracks reappeared against Ipswich Town at the end of February when Garnacho stormed down the tunnel at Old Trafford after being sacrificed following a red card to Patrick Dorgu.",
      "Garnacho posted a photo of himself on an Instagram Story to tell the world he wasn't happy. Amorim subsequently clarified that he had apologised and offered to pay for a team dinner.",
      "\"He is a young kid that will learn,” said Amorim, but Garnacho didn't learn quickly enough because he undermined his manager again following the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham.",
      "Garnacho was introduced in the final in Bilbao with 20 minutes remaining. And earlier in the day, he uploaded a photo of himself scoring in last season's FA Cup final on Instagram.",
      "It appeared to suggest he'd been omitted from the starting XI, and Garnacho was confirmed to be on the bench at the Estadio de San Mames when the team news was revealed.",
      "Garnacho told reporters: \"Up until the final I played every round helping the team, and today I play 20 minutes, I don't know. The final will influence [his decision to stay at United].\"",
      "His younger brother, Roberto Garnacho, added fuel to the fire when he posted on social media: \"Working as no one else, helping every round, coming from two goals last two finals, just to be on the pitch for 19 mins and get thrown under the bus. Wowe, hahahaha.\"",
      "The irony is that club sources who worked with Garnacho at Carrington insisted he couldn't be further from the image that was eventually portrayed.",
      "Garnacho was described as a quiet, almost shy, member of the dressing room. He was said to be polite and humble, which probably contradicts the image some fans now have of him.",
      "But Garnacho is responsible for United fans' perception, and it will be fascinating to see how the youngster is welcomed when he returns to Old Trafford with Chelsea on Saturday evening.",
      "Garnacho is an academy graduate. He was talismanic during the special FA Youth Cup campaign in 2021/22 and produced some brilliant moments for the first team, including the opening goal against Manchester City in the FA Cup final in 2024, but the circumstances around his exit haven't sat right with fans.",
      "@creedthered: \"For someone who was given a long leash at Utd, he’s shown that he doesn’t deserve it. I remember Ten Hag, Bruno and other senior members talking about how he needed to change his attitude when he wasn’t a first regular. And for a second it looked like he did, but old habits die hard.\"",
      "@fcmuAhmed: \"Great talent and while he’s inconsistent, I believe the level of expectations is way too high for him, even though the chaos at United is well documented. Constant change of managers is never helpful, especially for young players. He’d have performed so much better at a well-managed team.\"",
      "@chiragcp1982: \"Shame young talent had to leave, but think his attitude and ego had got too big to the stage where he thought he was the best player at the club. Some of his performances last season were awful. Poor finishing, real lack of creativity from wide areas or when he played at 10.\"",
      "@AmarVijh999: \"Happy that he left as he didn’t represent the club in the right way. Speaking after a loss and making it about you is selfish, and that selfishness was seen more and more over his three years. He’s more interested in modelling than football. I will never see him as an academy player.\"",
      "@TheUnitedLad541: \"He is exactly what is wrong with the post-Fergie club. Good riddance.\"",
      "Garnacho was named on the bench for Chelsea's defeat to Bayern Munich earlier in the week. He is yet to start a game for Chelsea and might be limited to a bench role again at Old Trafford on Saturday.",
      "We will hear what United fans think about Garnacho if he makes an appearance.",

      "Hansi Flick has spoken about his eagerness to land Marcus Rashford when he learned about the opportunity to sign the winger from Manchester United.",
      "The England international joined Barcelona on loan in July after it became apparent he was not in Ruben Amorim's plans for this season. Rashford was initially left out of Amorim's matchday squad for the Manchester City clash last season and subsequently fell out of favour under the Portuguese head coach.",
      "He spent the second half of the season on loan at Aston Villa, where he showed encouraging signs before picking up an injury. Following his move to Barcelona, the 27-year-old went three games without a goal or assist before registering an assist in their 6-0 thrashing of Valencia.",
      "He then made an even bigger impact on the elite stage by opening his account in style, scoring a brace against Newcastle United in the Champions League. His return to home soil couldn't have gone better, as Rashford claimed the Man of the Match award.",
      "\"I’m not surprised, I’m not surprised,\" the Barcelona manager Flick said after the game. \"I said yesterday that I think he’s a fantastic player, with great talent so his skills are unbelievable. His finishing is unbelievable, and of course at half time I said to him, score two goals - not it wasn’t like that.",
      "\"But I think also in the first half he tried to create chances, but the finishing at the end, was not right. In the second half it was different, for a striker it’s always good to score goals and to finish them. I'm really happy that he was in the box when the cross came in, and yeah, for us, important player.\"",
      "Questioned on whether he was surprised to land the 27-year-old on a season-long loan deal, the German said: \"When we had this chance, we said, 'okay, we have to do it'.",
      "\"I spoke with him before everything, going in the right way. I said, 'I want you, I want you in my team', and 100 per cent, I'm happy because he's an outstanding player.\"",
      "\"I can feel the confidence that Flick has given me. I knew he was great before I signed, but working with him is a real pleasure.\"",
      "Barcelona have the option to make Rashford's move permanent next summer for a fee of €30m (£26m). Some reports had suggested that the Catalans would be forced to pay a €5m (£4.3m) penalty fee should they choose not to sign him permanently but The Athletic have confirmed that is not the case.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

The defeat left United in 14th with just four points from as many games with their problems laid bare, especially defensively as their wait for a clean sheet extended to nine matches.",

      "Some good news at Manchester United: Lisandro Martinez continues to make progress in his recovery from injury.",
      "On Wednesday, Martinez uploaded a photo of himself running on grass at Carrington alongside United physiotherapist Ibrahim Kerem.",
      "Martinez's knee buckled when he fell to the ground against Crystal Palace at the beginning of February, and it was confirmed he had suffered an injury to his cruciate ligament.",
      "United will continue to carefully handle Martinez as he enters the latter stages of rehabilitation and he will only be available for selection again when medical staff deem him to be fully fit and ready.",
      "The sight of Martinez skipping along the turf at Carrington is a boost, as the next step will be returning to full team training. However, United sources have been reluctant to put a timeframe on when Martinez will be available again, so it might still be a while until he joins the main group.",
      "It's understood Martinez will not return imminently and has some way to go with his rehabilitation.",
      "Martinez was spotted on a handful of matchdays at the end of last season. The 27-year-old joined the celebrations after beating Athletic Bilbao at Old Trafford and he arrived with the squad, wearing a Paul Smith club suit, at the Estadio de San Mames for the Europa League final against Tottenham.",
      "The defender also took part in the lap of appreciation at Old Trafford on the final day of the season. He was joined by his wife and newborn and was spotted waving at supporters.",
      "Martinez travelled to the United States this summer to continue his rehabilitation programme around the squad, which allowed him to still feel part of the group during his recovery.",
      "The Argentina international has had the challenge of overcoming a handful of injuries during his time in Manchester and will face the task of trying to win back his starting role in the XI when he eventually returns.",
      "Leny Yoro played on the left side of the back-three at the end of last season and delivered strong performances. The presumption was Yoro would continue in that position this term, but he has been permenantly relcoated to the right, with Luke Shaw chosen to start on the opposite side.",
      "Shaw was poor in the Manchester derby defeat, leading to calls to remove him from the starting XI and Martinez has an easier task to earn his role back now he is contending with Shaw.",
      "Martinez will be eased back into action gently, but if he can reproduce the kind of form that established him as a fan favourite then he will be able to lock down the left-sided role.",
      "Shaw could have done better for each of Manchester City's goals. He had performed well up until that game, but most would agree that Martinez is a better fit for the role.",
      "Martinez is a natural centre-back and Shaw has been playing as an auxiliary left-sided central defender. It's been interesting that Amorim has not considered Shaw as a serious option for left wing-back.",
      "The potential spanner in the works is that Martinez still needs to prove he is still the same player who won fans' hearts in 2022/2023. Martinez was outstanding in his first season, however, he has suffered injuries and hasn't strung together a similarly consistent run of performances.",
      "Having said that, there were positive glimmers last winter with Martinez showing a different side of his game by contributing four goal involvements between mid-December and January.",
      "Martinez's pass for Amad's winner at the Etihad was exceptional and his goal against Liverpool at Anfield was another highlight. United have missed Martinez's proactiveness and his spirit in the dressing room.",
      "United fans will be delighted to hear that Martinez is on the comeback trail. It might be a while until he returns, but it will be a relief when he is available again.",

      "Fernandes followed suit as he shared the effort from range on social media. The Portuguese international shared two mind-blown emojis with a shocked face in between.",
      "On commentary, ex-Scotland striker Ally McCoist was left flabbergasted by the quality of the United loanee. He said: \"Deary, deary me. That's absolutely majestic.",

      "\"It's just fabulous football from Rashford.",

      "Peter Schmeichel believes Ruben Amorim was wrong to suggest Manchester United need to sack him if they want change.",
      "Speaking after the Manchester derby defeat, Amorim was asked whether he would change his approach after United's worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/1993.",
      "Amorim responded: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "United's head coach has stuck by his system, but Schmeichel thought Amorim made a mistake in his post-match press conference because he 'put himself above the club'.",
      "In an interview with Sky Bet, Schmeichel reacted to the Manchester derby defeat, which increased the pressure on Amorim's shoulders at a time when he needs to secure positive results.",
      "Schmeichel explained: “You always have to look at what the manager’s job is; you’re employed to win football matches. At Manchester United, that also means winning trophies, and right now he’s not doing that.",
      "\"His win percentage is around 36%, which is the worst performer of any United manager since World War II. Sticking by his guns obviously isn’t working. Bruno Fernandes said after Sunday’s game that it’s very difficult to play in midfield when you’re always one man short, because you can’t cover the ground.",
      "\"The system might look good when it works, but it hasn’t worked yet. And I don’t think the system itself can be the most important thing. For me, the art of coaching is to get the maximum out of the players you have available. Right now, it’s clear not all of them are playing to their potential.",
      "\"They look confused, sometimes disorganised, especially at the back. That’s where the manager has to take a look and change something.",
      "“I say this because I was at United during a rebuilding phase, when we were moving towards winning trophies and the Premier League. Certain standards were always in place.",
      "\"The main one was simple - no one is ever bigger than the club. That applied from the manager down through the players and staff. If someone tried to go their own way and it didn’t work, it couldn’t continue.",
      "\"That was drilled into us every single day. Sir Alex Ferguson gave us a framework that was very simple and easy to understand. It started with not conceding goals, and then it was about recruiting players who could both defend under pressure and take risks going forward.",
      "\"Guys like Gary Pallister, Steve Bruce, myself behind them, Paul Parker and Denis Irwin as attacking full-backs. It worked because it was simple, and because of the mentality and quality of the players.",
      "“Right now, I don’t think we’re getting the quality out of the players we have. They can do more. The manager has to change his ways. I didn’t like what he said the other day – 'If you want change, you have to change the coach'.",
      "\"I like him a lot, I like his leadership qualities, and he came in during a very difficult period with unwanted players and dealt with it well. But as a Manchester United person, I don’t like that sentence. That’s putting yourself above the club and I don’t like that.”",
      "Schmeichel continued: “You only have to look at Sunday’s game at Manchester City to see how unhappy Bruno Fernandes was. He can look frustrated at the best of times, but this was different – he was really unhappy.",
      "\"And understandably so, because Manchester United were outnumbered in midfield throughout the game. The thing about Bruno is simple - why do we have him? Because he’s a world-class player on the ball.",
      "\"He creates, he spreads play, he scores goals. But you don’t score goals from deep. I’d much prefer to see him higher up the pitch. He’s never been a number six, he hasn’t got the legs for it, and it’s unfair to ask him to do that job because it takes away from his real strengths.",
      "“Now, I know people sometimes complain about former players being critical, and I hold my hands up – I’m one of them. But I’ve been there. I know what it takes, how much you have to invest, how much you need to be at 100% in everything you do.",
      "\"Nobody likes criticism, but this isn’t personal. When we talk about these things, it’s about suggesting what could make it better. It comes from love for the club, not for the headlines.",
      "“Bruno is the captain, and he speaks for the players, so of course it’s uncomfortable when there’s this kind of debate – but it’s necessary. United have new people in charge – Jason Wilcox, Omar Berrada, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Christopher Vivell – all of them new, without deep Manchester United knowledge.",
      "\"That’s why voices like mine, Roy Keane’s, Gary Neville’s, Paul Scholes’s matter. We’ve been there, we understand what it takes, and when we see things going in the wrong direction, it’s important we speak up to help, and at least make the people in charge think about it.\"",
      "United are next in Premier League action against Chelses at Old Trafford on Saturday evening.",

      "Marcus Rashford made it clear that his former Manchester United teammates are not far from his mind after his Champions League masterclass.",
      "The United academy prospect was given his first start in Europe for Barcelona against Newcastle United. After a difficult first half, Rashford exploded upon the restart with a spectacular brace at St James' Park.",
      "He opened his account for the Catalans with a sumptuous header, before firing in a blistering 25-yard effort, which proved to be the vital goal for Hansi Flick's side. His former United teammates, Bruno Fernandes and Jadon Sancho, wasted no time in posting their admiration for the England international.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Both players recorded his goal on their phones and uploaded them to their Instagram stories - with stunned emojis overlaying his strike. Rashford showed both players are not far from his mind by reposting their Instagram stories to his 20.6million followers shortly after the final whistle.",
      "The England international, now 27, was frozen out by United head coach Ruben Amorim - who signed off on a loan spell to Aston Villa last January and the temporary move, with an option to buy, to Barcelona. It also demonstrated Rashford still considers Fernandes to be an ally at Old Trafford.",
      "The United captain has been a loyal servant to Amorim - who is the one that might have ended Rashford's career at Old Trafford for good. Meanwhile, Rashford's decision to also repost Sancho's Instagram story also demonstrated he is still showing solidarity with the winger.",
      "While it was Erik ten Hag who decided to send Sancho on loan to Chelsea last summer, Amorim did not try and reintegrate the ex-Borussia Dortmund forward into his plans upon his return. Sancho was also quickly confined to the 'bomb squad' with Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, before he secured a loan move to Aston Villa.",
      "After the match, Rashford admitted he couldn't be happier playing under Hansi Flick's exciting Barcelona team. He said: \"It's going good, learning a lot, it's a new way of football but I'm enjoying it all - and I think that it's making me a better player.",
      "\"So that's what I'm here to do, I'm here to help the team win but improve and be the best I can.",
      "\"I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona - people my age have watched them from when we was younger - amazing football, amazing players and we want to win as much as possible.\"",
      "When asked to explain his thrilling second goal, Rashford added: \"It was a split second, I seen [saw] the far post, I thought I'd get a shot off.",
      "\"When you're going away from goal it's difficult to generate the power to keep it low, I thought try to aim high and I knew when I caught it, it would take some doing for the 'keeper to stop it.\"",
      "Rashford's display against Newcastle followed his performance in Barcelona's recent 6-0 demolition of Valencia - where he whipped in a fine assist for Raphinha to score. He will now be eyeing up the Catalans' next clash against Getafe on Sunday, September 21 (8pm).",

      "Manchester United legend Bryan Robson believes Ruben Amorim needs to be tactically flexible.",
      "Amorim oversaw the worst season at Old Trafford for 51 years following his appointment from Sporting Lisbon in November. Amorim needed to start the new campaign well, but United have made their worst start to a season for 33 years and speculation has begun about his future.",
      "United suffered a 3-0 defeat against Manchester City last weekend, which means Amorim has the worst win percentage of any permanent United manager since the Second World War.",
      "Amorim said: \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man. I believe in my way and I am going to play my way until I want to change.\"",
      "Some fans believe Amorim's system was never a good fit for the club, while others have suggested the 40-year-old change his formation to secure results and ease pressure.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "United legend Robson spoke to OLBG and shared his verdict: \"I feel as a manager you have to have a few tactics up your sleeve. Otherwise people know how to set up against you.",
      "\"If you're playing the same way week in, week out, the opposition, and especially with all the technology and everything nowadays, you can go out on the training pitch and you set yourself up to do well against a team. That's why I feel he's got to be a bit more flexible.",
      "\"Most top teams in the Premier League now are nearly always playing with a back four and so for me, if you’re playing with four at the back instead of three, you can mix it up a little bit more as well.",
      "\"Some people think about the old fashioned 4-4-2 but then I quite like 4-3-3 when you’ve got good forwards. I think United are still capable of doing that, going with the back four.",
      "\"Whatever the manager wants to set up, if it's with the back five, you have to get off to a good start and score the first goal and then counter attack against teams. I think it's a good system then.",
      "\"If you're chasing the game, I always feel that you're lacking a midfield player or a forward so you're short in numbers because you've got the five at the back.",
      "\"I would like to see him be a bit more flexible but it looks like he's got his mind and he said it all last season that he's got his mind set on the back five so it's up to him and the players to show that they really can play in that system.",
      "\"They need to take on board what the manager's trying to achieve and pick it up as the season goes on because it is still early in the season and we have played against two very good teams who are going to be up there challenging for the title. So it has been quite a difficult start.\"",
      "Robson is one of the finest midfielders to have represented United and he also shared his thoughts on Kobbie Mainoo, who is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "\"Back in my days, Paul Ince was an underrated player and great to play with because Ince was quick, he could tackle, he was a really good passer of the ball and I think Ince was a very underrated player,\" said Robson.",
      "\"Why he was underrated is because the United fans were not pleased that he fell out with Sir Alex and then he went to Inter and he came back and played for Liverpool, so all the Man United fans didn’t like that, a Man United player who's done really well going to Liverpool.",
      "\"I definitely do (think Mainoo could be the next Ince). When I heard that Mainoo might be leaving the club, I was really against it. I think he's a real talent. Last year, he had quite a few injuries and couldn't get going but the year before that, he was outstanding and he looked as if he had great potential.",
      "\"As long as he keeps his feet on the ground and works really hard at it, he could be a really good player. I know he's more attacking but Mainoo can do the defending if you put it on him, and that's what he's got to do.",
      "\"He's got to get his overall game a little bit more established and then I think he would go really well with Bruno being the more advanced midfield player.\"",
      "Last season was stop-start for Mainoo due to a few small injuries and concerns about where he fits into Amorim's system. Amorim played the midfielder in different positions, even using him as a false nine.",
      "Mainoo relocated to the deeper midfield role in pre-season this summer, but Amorim raised eyebrows when he said Mainoo was competing with Bruno Fernandes for a start.",
      "The youngster subsequently requested to leave on loan in the final days of the window, which was denied.",

      "United may have signed three new forwards, a left-back and a goalkeeper during the summer transfer window, but a lot has been said about the need to sign a new midfielder. Brighton star Carlos Baleba was heavily linked with signing for United, but a move never materialised with the Seagulls reportedly demanding a fee in excess of £100million for the Cameroon international.",
      "With the summer transfer window now closed, a fresh report has now emerged claiming that United are interested in Al-Hilal midfielder Ruben Neves. A report in the Daily Briefing has claimed that a €20million (£17million) deal could be on the cards with Neves apparently keen to return to Europe.",
      "This is not the first time that United have been linked with signing Neves. Reports first emerged back in 2018 claiming that United were interested in signing the Portugal international during his time at Wolves.",
      "Neves signed for Wolves in 2017 and helped the club secure promotion to the Premier League, before eventually playing a key role in helping the Molineux outfit also qualify for the Europa League.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games this season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Neves made 253 appearances for Wolves, scoring 90 goals, and has since featured 60 times for Al-Hilal since making the switch to the Saudi Pro League back in 2023. A move for Neves now would come seven years after United were first linked with the midfielder.",
      "United would certainly benefit from a new option in midfield. What will be key is how determined United are to sign Baleba, and if they have a realistic chance of getting a deal over the line.",
      "If the answer to that is 'no', then the club will consider their options - and links to Neves may stick around. Neves has already outlined his desire to return to his former club Porto before he retires.",
      "\"I've said it in all the interviews - it's not coming back to finish your career, it's going back to play and be competitive: that's my big goal,\" he said last month.",
      "\"Fortunately, I'm 28 years old and I feel very good physically. This is a career goal, because I wasn't champion at Porto and having a family of over 60 people who support the club, it's something I want to give them and experience [for myself].",
      "\"I used to go to the Aliados to celebrate Porto's titles but now I want to be on the other side and want to see my family celebrate.\"",

      "Ugarte vindicated Amorim's decision to start him. He was the best player in a red shirt in the first half, breaking up play and stifling City attacks, and he earned warm applause from his manager when he played a wonderful pass over the top to Mbeumo, who was flagged offside.",
      "However, Fernandes had another off day - he was poor when he missed a penalty against Fulham at Craven Cottage last month - and ultimately let the partnership down.",

Do you think we are the better team? Do you think that (Martin) Odegaard, (Declan) Rice and (Martin) Zubimendi are three top midfielders? They play with three. We play with two. One was Casemiro, the other was Bruno.",

The fans don't want to hear me saying these things. I know that they are not going to listen to nothing and be upset. With that, I cannot do nothing.",

But that conversation about the two midfielders, the pair, Kobbie and Manu, I understand all these narratives. But then when I look at certain games, we play with two. It is the same thing.",

      "Ruben Amorim is doomed at Manchester United as he’s been set an ‘ultimatum’ that everyone was aware of before this afternoon’s ‘exclusive’ was released…",
      "As usual, Amorim and Ratcliffe have been in the headlines as the INEOS chief has ‘flown in’ to hold ‘talks’ with the Man Utd head coach.",
      "This comes amid a dire start to the 2025/26 campaign for Man Utd, who look no better this season than they did in 2024/25 as they sit 14th after four games.",
      "Their situation is not helped by Amorim still refusing to budge from his favoured 3-4-3 formation, despite it being clear for all to see that it is not working and doesn’t suit this group of players.",
      "All indications are that Amorim is bullishly insisting that his tactics are not the problem, even though he suggested on Friday that his side is “playing well until the boxes”, which indicates a pretty major flaw regarding system and/or personnel.",
      "Alan Shearer reckons Amorim will continue to stick to his current tactics and “die on his sword” at Man Utd, and it’s hard to look past this being the outcome of his sorry saga at Old Trafford.",
      "READ: Rashford U-turn confirmed after Amorim somehow receives ‘pointed message’ from ‘toxic’ star",
      "And Amorim’s exit from Man Utd has moved a step closer following his meeting with Ratcliffe, with talkSPORT’s ‘exclusive’ revealing that he has been ‘given an ultimatum’.",
      "‘Ratcliffe believes the United squad assembled is capable of a top-five finish, although Champions League is not the stated or budgeted goal for 2025/26.",
      "‘However, returning to some form of European football is seen as essential by the United hierarchy.’",
      "First of all, it is pretty bold of talkSPORT to label this as an ‘exclusive’, because everyone knows that Man Utd’s minimum aim in any season is to qualify for some European competition, with this especially the case following another summer of huge spending.",
      "This is just common sense, but it does mean that Amorim is doomed, as a seismic change brought about by a change of formation and/or a couple of marquee signings in January is required to give Man Utd any hope of anything more than back-to-back bottom-half finishes in the Premier League.",
      "Amorim and Man Utd would have a greater chance of achieving an upturn in results and performances if there is a transition to a far more suited 4-2-3-1 formation, as the head coach is yet to come close to getting the maximum out of this squad.",
      "However, Ratcliffe’s assertion that this Man Utd side is ‘capable of a top-five finish’ is naive beyond belief and exposes his lack of know-how.",
      "The squads of Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea are far superior to Man Utd’s, while they can also make a strong case that Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United are better.",
      "So Man Utd may have earned ‘record revenue’ despite themselves, but the frailties of Amorim and Ratcliffe leave them miles behind their main rivals on the pitch, and there is more pain to come before INEOS gets the club back on an upward trajectory on the pitch.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has revealed what he and Red Devils co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe spoke about in a meeting on Thursday evening.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is giving the same energy as former Tottenham boss Juande Ramos when “he was trying to get sacked”, says David Bentley.",
      "Newcastle legend Alan Shearer thinks Ruben Amorim is likely to “die on his sword” and could be sacked this weekend if Man Utd lose heavily.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe has flown in for talks with under-pressure Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim, according to reports.",
      "Ruben Amorim continuing to dare Man Utd to sack him and Liverpool emerging from Arsenal v Manchester City as the biggest winner makes this a big weekend.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim should be sacked and replaced by former Red Devils head coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, according to reports."

      "The Red Devils invested as much as £70m in Casemiro in August 2022 from Real Madrid with the legendary midfielder joining amid much fanfare.",
      "However, things have not worked out for the Brazilian at Old Trafford with the Real Madrid legend potentially going down as one of the worst pieces of business in Man Utd history.",
      "Many players underperformed under Ruben Amorim last season as the Red Devils finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to qualify for any European competitions.",
      "After Amorim initially admitted struggling on how to get the best out of Casemiro last season, the Brazil international impressed the Portuguese head coach in the final couple of months of the campaign.",

      "READ: Man Utd: Shearer fears Amorim is ‘going to die on his sword’ and could be sacked this weekend",
      "Casemiro reportedly turned down a big move to Saudi Arabia in the summer transfer window as he preferred to stay at Old Trafford ahead of this season.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano revealed a couple of weeks ago that he thought Casemiro would be leaving Man Utd at the end of the current campaign.",
      "Romano said earlier this month: “For 2026, I think there is a concrete chance to see Casemiro leave Man Utd.",
      "“This could be the final season for Casemiro at a high European level, and maybe [he could] try something different from 2026.",
      "“This is not something decided, this is not something guaranteed, but from what I’m hearing in the industry, there is a feeling Casemiro might decide to take a different step from 2026.",
      "“For Man Utd, he remains an important player but [is] also on a big salary, so to save that salary in 2026 could also be important for Man Utd in terms of Financial Fair Play. Casemiro will be one to watch for 2026.”",
      "And now Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo insist that Casemiro – whose contract expires in the summer – is ‘being tempted by lucrative offers’, one of which is from Cristiano Ronaldo’s Al-Nassr.",
      "Casemiro does have a year option on his deal at Man Utd but the report explains why he is likely to depart, they add: ‘The Saudi club wants to reunite him with Cristiano Ronaldo, with whom he has previously worked at both Real Madrid and United. And it’s already clear they’ll spare no expense to make his dream a reality. Furthermore, it seems like a good time (given his age and track record) for the midfielder to take on other challenges and explore other leagues.",
      "‘Added to this is the fact that Rubén Amorim’s team has been having a disastrous few years on a sporting level.’",
      "One player Man Utd could look to bring to Old Trafford in the near future is Sporting CP winger Francisco Trincao, who played for Barcelona between 2020 and 2023.",
      "Spanish website Fichajes insists that Man Utd ‘want’ Trincao, who has been impressing in attacking midfield for Sporting this term, and ‘could be reunited with Ruben Amorim, the manager who has best exploited his talent in the past’.",
      "Despite being an important player, Sporting know an offer from Man Utd ‘could be difficult to resist’ and the Red Devils see Trincao ‘as an ideal reinforcement’.",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo will once again attempt to persuade Bruno Fernandes to leave Man Utd in January and move to Saudi Arabia, according to reports.",
      "Casemiro has been one of the very few success stories at Man Utd under Ruben Amorim, with his future more secure than expected.",
      "Are you really a world-record holder if you have to lower yourself to counting goals scored against Scotland? Cristiano Ronaldo is an embarrassing fraud.",
      "Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano has revealed that a Manchester United star is “one to watch” in 2026 as he has a “concrete chance” of leaving.",
      "We have a PFA Team of the Year XI made up of players who have been included at least five times in the Premier League era.",

      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Liverpool) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Arsenal) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Spurs) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Bournemouth) – £45m",
      "5th (Chelsea) – £42.4m",
      "6th (Everton) – £39.8m",
      "7th (Sunderland) – £37.1m",

      "12th (Brentford) – £23.8m",
      "13th (Brighton) – £21.2m",

      "19th (Aston Villa) – £5.2m",
      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "",
      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",
      "Their packages include all Saturday 5.30pm, Sunday 2pm and Sunday 4.30pm kick-offs, plus Monday and Friday evening games and three midweek rounds.",
      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to the end of September. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Aston Villa, Chelsea, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the November selections with four more games each:",
      "=1st) Chelsea and Liverpool (11 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £9.13m in 2024/25",
      "=3rd) Arsenal, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Manchester United, Nottingham Forest and Spurs (10 games) – worth around £8.3m",
      "8th) Newcastle (9 games) – worth around £7.47m",
      "=9th) Brentford, Everton and West Ham (8 games) – worth around £6.64m",
      "12th) Leeds (7 games) – worth around £5.81m",
      "=13th) Brighton, Fulham and Wolves (6 games) – worth around £4.98m",
      "=17th) Bournemouth and Crystal Palace (5 games) – worth around £4.15m",
      "=20th) Burnley and Sunderland (4 games) – worth around £3.32m",
      "",
      "The Premier League generally tries to announce the rescheduling of games for live broadcast six weeks in advance but complications with domestic and European cup competitions can sometimes cause a delay.",
      "These are their approximate dates for when they aim to announce live TV games:",
      "Matches in December and January – by October 15\nMatches in February – by December 17\nMatches in March – by January 21\nMatches in April – by March 4",
      "Games in May are particularly susceptible to being changed at shorter notice as there is a need to see what gaps appear in clubs’ schedules, and frankly so broadcasters can manufacture more drama in races for the title, European qualification or survival.",
      "Barcelona weren’t ‘remotely interested’ in ‘toxic’ Marcus Rashford, but a ‘subtle dig’ at Manchester United and a ‘pointed message’ to Ruben Amorim later…",
      "Liverpool have a ‘psychological edge’ over their opponents even while ‘looking pretty vulnerable at times’ because they have invented scoring goals.",
      "Ruben Amorim continuing to dare Man Utd to sack him and Liverpool emerging from Arsenal v Manchester City as the biggest winner makes this a big weekend.",

      "Amorim claims he has seen improvements on the pitch from his Man Utd side but that his side needs to be better in both boxes.",

      "It is difficult to view Marcus Rashford scoring two excellent and decisive Champions League goals in a narrow win for Barcelona against Newcastle as anything other than yet another reason to laugh and shake one’s head at Manchester United.",
      "Mediawatch hasn’t actually tried to see it from a different angle, so important and fun it is to marvel at how players immediately become good again once they leave Old Trafford.",
      "But it is inevitable that some would push that agenda too far, with this the top story from the MailOnline on Friday morning:",
      "‘The start of Marcus Rashford’s redemption? Barcelona star reveals why he is ‘better’ in subtle Man United dig as he is challenged to take the next step after stunning double in Newcastle win’",
      "A passing knowledge of Rashford and how he has generally publicly discussed Manchester United with respect and reverence despite that not always being reciprocated is all that’s required to know this ‘subtle Man United dig’ is almost definitely complete bumwater. But we are obliged to check out of interest to see just how daft it is.",
      "‘Rashford of course was delighted with his haul, saying: “It’s going good [in Spain], I am learning a lot as it is a new way of football, but I am enjoying it all and I think it is making me a better player.”‘",
      "The lads Amorim and Ratcliffe should know by now where to apply the ointment for that sick burn. It’s a dig so subtle you would be forgiven for not realising it existed.",
      "",
      "These are, by the way, ludicrous ways of describing that glorious second Rashford goal:",
      "‘The United loanee, bombed out and insulted by the hapless Ruben Amorim last season, then hammered home a second with a deflected shot which cannoned in off the underside of the bar’ – Dave Kidd, The Sun.",
      "‘Dodging a challenge from a Newcastle defender, he unleashed a 25-yard strike that spectacularly found its way into the far corner off the post’ – Patrick Austen-Hardy, Daily Mirror website.",
      "",
      "It is interesting to see Ian Herbert write in the Daily Mail about how Rashford bore ‘the look of a man who felt he owned the place and this stage,’ that ‘he has found something in Catalonia and the intensive Spanish lessons he is undertaking several times a week are more than mere diplomacy’.",
      "And there we all were thinking he had built a Duolingo streak just to keep up appearances.",
      "‘While Ruben Amorim treated him with thinly veiled contempt, Flick has given him professional respect,’ the deputy chief sports writer adds.",
      "Herbert goes on to say that while at times ‘it was hard to locate much evidence’ of Rashford ‘rediscovering the talent and belief he had put down somewhere and struggled to pick up,’ he ultimately provided, well, this:",
      "‘Evidence, before our very eyes, that the players we write off so soon are perhaps not the lost souls we believe them to be.’",
      "And that is interesting precisely because Herbert himself also wrote in January about how Rashford needed to be ‘talked out of his current sense of victimhood’ and was ‘apparently incapable of saving himself’.",
      "Which seems a little stronger than simply writing someone off or calling them a ‘lost soul’.",
      "It was obviously framed through the experience of Mark Hughes and how he ‘actually viewed wearing the No 10 jersey at Manchester United as a privilege and something to cherish,’ before taking the brave and bold decision to join Barcelona.",
      "And how Rashford, who has ‘a far higher opinion of himself’, ‘had rather imagined that he, too, would be heading to Barcelona’ but ‘as anyone could have predicted, Barca aren’t remotely interested in him, and neither is any other big club’.",
      "Oh, Ian. At least in the intervening eight months he has belatedly learned that the players we write off so soon – or refer to as ‘victims’ with high opinions of themselves who are ‘apparently incapable’ of turning things around – are perhaps not the lost souls we believe them to be.",
      "Although he did call Rashford a ‘boy, masquerading as a 27-year-old’ who ‘even makes Grealish seem like the soul of sobriety’ and is ‘viewed by some managers as too much of a risk, too toxic’ in July. So that lesson must have been recent. Thursday evening, maybe?",
      "This line from that January article is also pretty good:",
      "‘Goodness knows how Rashford – who says he feels ‘misunderstood’ and ‘disheartened’, despite years of coddling by United – would have dealt with what came Hughes’ way in Spain.’",
      "Fairly well so far. Three more goals this season and he’ll match what Hughes scored across 37 appearances in Spain. Not bad to say ‘Barca aren’t remotely interested’.",
      "",
      "The biggest bowl of piping hot nonsense is served up dutifully by Patrick Austen-Hardy of the Reach website stable, who predictably lap it up.",
      "For the Daily Mirror website, Rashford’s goal celebration obviously ‘speaks volumes’ despite him using said goal celebration since late 2022.",
      "Sticking his finger to his temple is, in all fairness, entirely specifically a ‘pointed message’. But to Amorim? When Rashford has been doing that for almost three years now?",
      "‘Considering the manner of his celebration, it may have even been a message to Amorim…’",
      "True. It may also have been a message to Donald Trump, or AI, or that weird Liverpool fan. Or maybe it was just something he has done for absolutely ages, and well before Amorim even came into his orbit.",
      "",
      "And of course, Rashford reminding the world he can be quite good at football has to prompt the return of just the dirt worst headline trope.",
      "‘Man Utd Marcus Rashford transfer recall rules explained and if winger can return’ – Daily Express website.",
      "The short version is that a) they have no idea if Rashford can be recalled, b) they acknowledge he probably can’t, going by how loan deals of this profile are generally structured, and c) even if he can, he absolutely won’t be because none of the parties involved will want to.",
      "But there was obviously mileage in pretending Rashford might have been recalled from his Aston Villa loan so why not bring that energy into a full season of speculating if and whether Amorim might bring him back to exile him and decimate his market value further?",
      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Man Utd forward Marcus Rashford has hailed his “refreshing” loan move to Barcelona after scoring twice in a 2-1 win over Newcastle on Thursday night.",
      "Liverpool have a ‘psychological edge’ over their opponents even while ‘looking pretty vulnerable at times’ because they have invented scoring goals.",
      "Ruben Amorim continuing to dare Man Utd to sack him and Liverpool emerging from Arsenal v Manchester City as the biggest winner makes this a big weekend.",
      "Marcus Rashford joined the Leaving Man United party with two goals, the second an absolute net-ripper, to steer Barcelona past Newcastle.",
      "Unless it’s against European elite, Champions League games have become basically like playing Bournemouth now for Premier League teams."

      "Here’s one stat-based nugget for each Premier League club after the first four games of the season, with numbers from the very excellent fbref.com.",
      "",
      "Arsenal have nine goals from 14 shots on target. To put that in some perspective, doom-spiralling crisis club West Ham have had 19 shots on target this season. Liverpool and Chelsea, joint top-scorers at this stage with Arsenal on nine, each have 21 shots on target.",

      "READ: ‘No more than four’ Emery signings a ‘resounding success’ as Aston Villa narrative flips",
      "",
      "And indeed more than everyone apart from Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool. But they rank only tenth for shooting accuracy, and have the sixth bottom for non-penalty xG per shot at 0.09.",
      "So lots of shooting, but not necessarily from the most optimum position. It’s the xG equivalent of lobbing enough balls at enough coconuts until you win a goldfish. Although we will need a different shorthand for expected goldfish, because xG is taken and it will get confusing.",
      "",
      "They still prioritise quality over quantity when it comes to shooting. Only Burnley have attempted fewer shots on goal, but only Fulham make their attempts from a closer average distance than Brentford’s 14.1 yards. Brentford’s non-penalty xG/shot of 0.13 is the third highest in the division.",
      "",
      "Only Manchester United have a lower goals-per-shot number, apart from poor old Leeds (still waiting for a first non-penalty goal, and thus on 0.00 in this penalty-excluding stat) and Aston Villa (still waiting for any kind of goal of any sort)",
      "",
      "We don’t claim to be boffin-like stats experts, clearly, but having the fewest shots of any team in the division (30) while allowing the most shots of any team in the division (76, which is already 21 more than anyone else) doesn’t seem a sustainable gameplan.",

      "The Cottagers’ average distance for attempts on goal is 13.8 yards, with Brentford and Tottenham – and there’s an obvious common factor there – the only other teams below 15 yards on average. Newcastle’s average shooting distance is a distinctly pot-shot 19.5 yards.",

      "City’s npxG/shot figure of 0.17 is also the highest in the division, ahead of Crystal Palace on 0.14.",
      "That’s why Erling Haaland will probably win the Golden Boot.",
      "",
      "Bearing in mind that the total shots count doesn’t include penalties, we’re struggling to remember a single one of these, but apparently United have had 68 attempts on goal – nine more than Chelsea and Liverpool and well over twice as many as Burnley, who have managed the same number of total goals as United.",
      "To no great surprise, only Villa and Leeds – the teams with no non-penalty goals – have worse goals/shot data than United.",

      "According to the boffins, Spurs should have scored 4.8 goals and conceded 4.6; the actual numbers are 8 and 1.",
      "There is evidence they’re already adapting to Frank’s long-standing and deeply held belief that quality beats quantity when it comes to shots. Three teams have outscored Spurs, yet eight have had more attempts but only two (including Frank’s old team Brentford) have a closer average shooting distance than Spurs’ 14.2 yards.",
      "",
      "Nobody else in the league has conceded more than two goals more than their npxG figure. Indeed, Wolves (+1.9), Bournemouth (1.5) and Brentford (+1.0) are the only teams even a whole goal worse off than the numbers suggest they should be.",
      "West Ham are 5.5 goals worse off, having conceded 11 goals from 5.5 npxG. Nobody else allows teams closer to their goal to shoot (average distance 13.3 yards) they concede 0.23 goals per shot allowed; the next worst figure in the league here is Manchester United’s 0.17.",
      "READ: Will West Ham make sensible Nuno decision or go batsh*t again?",

      "There are times when the title of this feature can seem bitterly ironic, but this weekend is not one of those weekends. This really is another Big Weekend on the back of last weekend, which was also very much a Big Weekend.",
      "This Big Weekend is one that could quite conceivably end with either Arsenal or Man City or indeed both an uncomfortable distance adrift of Liverpool even at this early stage, while all eyes will once again be on Ruben Amorim and his weirdly admirable ongoing insistence on denying objective reality. It’s a tactic we might all like to consider in these troubled times. Much easier than the alternative.",
      "And another Premier League weekend arrives with the really big question: will this finally be the game where Aston Villa score a goal?",
      "What if they don’t score a goal, though? What if they just never score another Premier League goal ever again? What then? Is there a plan in place for that?",
      "We don’t know.",
      "",
      "Assuming, as assume now we surely must, that a day earlier Liverpool have scored a preposterous late winner in the Merseyside Derby, this becomes an uncomfortably hefty early game between what are very likely the only two teams capable of giving the champions a problem over the course of the whole season.",
      "Neither would probably be choosing to play the other at the end of a weekend when the scoreboard pressure could be absolutely huge.",
      "If Liverpool have beaten Everton, then the scenarios in play involve either both these teams being six points adrift already, or City slipping nine points off the early pace, or Arsenal being five off the running and City eight away.",
      "It does very much feel like a game that might be most easily enjoyed by Liverpool fans basking in post-derby glow than either of the teams actually involved.",
      "But even without the whole ‘bollocksing up the title race in mid-September’ hoopla, there is still much to commend this fixture.",
      "That’s been true for a good few years now, since Arsenal managed to shake the habit of getting slapped silly every time City turned up.",
      "And last year Mikel Arteta even managed to shake off his usual big-game timidity to hand out a fearful thrashing of their own, with all the wonderful ‘stay humble’ saltiness that followed.",
      "Worth remembering also that that particular Arsenal statement of intent in the title race was followed by managing only one win from their next four games against Leicester, West Ham, Nottingham Forest and Manchester United.",
      "There’s a draining emotional heft to this fixture that both teams could probably do without just as the real two-games-a-week business kicks in, and every chance that no matter what happens at the Emirates the real winners are to be found at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Liverpool have played five proper competitive games of football this season. In three of those games they have eased themselves into a 2-0 lead, promptly p*ssed said 2-0 lead all up the wall, and then just gone and scored a ridiculous late winner anyway.",
      "It’s a fantastic bit, and long may it continue. It’s so rare for the best team in the country to also be the most fun to watch, and we should all try to cherish it while it remains the case here.",
      "The reason, most obviously, the best team is rarely the most fun is because the best team in the country is, almost by definition, unlikely to be one prone to repeated acts of nonsense. Liverpool certainly weren’t like this last season, and we much prefer this season’s approach as a neutral.",
      "The best team in the country might be the most electric going forward, or the most reliably secure at the back, or even both. But rare indeed is the season where the best team look simultaneously so vulnerable yet so inevitable.",
      "And with this newly impish, Jack Grealish-inspired Everton side looking far more capable than most Toffees of recent vintage of exploiting those Liverpool vulnerabilities we really could be in for a classic Merseyside derby.",
      "Just don’t whatever you do miss the last few minutes.",
      "",
      "It’s now one goal in his last 11 Aston Villa appearances for a striker Villa desperately need to start firing and soon.",
      "Sunderland away wouldn’t have been a fixture that filled Villa fans with dread when the fixture computer spat out its findings back in June, but a lot has changed since then. The Black Cats have two wins from two at home, and Villa need to find something soon to avoid this season spiralling into something truly unpleasant.",
      "They are still, preposterously, yet to score a single league goal a month into the campaign, crashed out of the Carabao at the first attempt – although there was at least a goal in that one, so progress, we guess? – and from next week have the added workload of European engagement to consider.",
      "It’s not that uncommon for a player to be in some need of the cliched one-to-go-in-off-his-backside at this stage of the season, and Watkins is very much there. But it’s something a bit different when a whole team is waiting for some buttock-based goalscoring good fortune to kick start an entire season.",
      "We mustn’t be too dramatic. We’re not yet in a Fear For Them situation with Villa, we really aren’t. But if this weekend goes wrong then it’s going to get harder and harder to ignore the warning signs.",
      "",
      "As he will be now pretty much every week until either a) he’s sacked, b) Manchester United become consistently and convincingly quite good on a semi-regular basis or c) the boiling seas rise and claim us all.",
      "What’s really fun is that right now our money is firmly on c).",
      "Last season, we’d have said that Chelsea at home wasn’t a bad fixture for an under-pressure United and their Beleaguered Manager. One of the quirks of last season was that United – before and after Amorim’s arrival – were very good at sorting out the dreadful relegated teams and perfectly capable of summoning up some kind of dormant muscle memory of their glorious past when faced with any of their former rivals.",
      "They could be relied on to put up a decent show against your Liverpools, your Arsenals, your Man Citys and the Chelseas of this world as well as beating the very worst teams; it was the vast array of teams in the middle that United had problems with seemingly every single time.",
      "But this season they have already celebrated a played-quite-well-actually cup when losing 1-0 to Arsenal and been thoroughly outplayed in the end by Manchester City in the derby.",
      "We’re not yet quite sure about Chelsea this season, either, with an inconsistent start after their Club World Cup antics suggesting they might not quite be the title contenders we thought they could be.",
      "They really should be able to sort out United, though, possessing as they do exactly the kind of game-controlling midfielders Amorim so conspicuously lacks and all manner of tricky, clever forwards capable of exploiting the ongoing confusion that reigns within a defensive structure where, if anything for me, Clive, United sometimes have too many players back with the result that nobody’s quite sure who’s supposed to be doing what.",
      "We know by now that Amorim isn’t going to change. He will live by his back three and die by his back three, with the only question really just how overtly he will attempt to goad United into handing him that lovely £12m pay-off if/when it does all go wrong again against another team United used to consider a major rival really not that long ago.",
      "",
      "Fourth meets sixth at the King Power in what already feels like a pretty significant early clash between two key promotion contenders, with Leicester yet to truly convince or stamp their obvious class on the division since dropping back into it.",
      "Coventry, meanwhile, remain unbeaten yet have foolishly concentrated far too many of their division-leading 15 goals into two big daft wins when they could have been far more usefully spread around. Silly.",
      "",
      "You can’t say fairer than a lovely slice of Sunday lunchtime-ish Rome derby action to set you up for the big afternoon of Barclays to follow. Especially with both teams smarting ahead of this one after disappointing defeats last time out against Sassuolo and Torino.",
      "In a just and right world it would be on Channel 4, of course, rather than so-called ‘DAZN’, but one can’t have everything.",
      "",
      "Having pretty adroitly in the end avoided Champions League humiliation at the hands of Brann, Elisabeth Terland’s hat-trick helping them overcome a 1-0 first-leg deficit with a bit to spare, attention turns back to the WSL for United and the visit of Arsenal.",
      "It’s a battle between two of the four teams still boasting 100 per cent records after two games of the new season, and one that might give us a few clues about which if either of these teams might have the best chance of ending Chelsea’s seemingly unstoppable reign of terror.",
      "Ruben Amorim is doomed at Manchester United as he’s been set an ‘ultimatum’ that everyone was aware of before this afternoon’s ‘exclusive’ was released…",
      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim has revealed what he and Red Devils co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe spoke about in a meeting on Thursday evening.",
      "Man Utd boss Ruben Amorim is giving the same energy as former Tottenham boss Juande Ramos when “he was trying to get sacked”, says David Bentley.",
      "Barcelona weren’t ‘remotely interested’ in ‘toxic’ Marcus Rashford, but a ‘subtle dig’ at Manchester United and a ‘pointed message’ to Ruben Amorim later…",

      "Legendary former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel has revealed he had “never heard of” Senne Lammens prior to the Red Devils being linked with him, and has told the club who they should’ve signed instead.",
      "United were told throughout the summer that their goalkeepers were not up to scratch. For a man who reached a Champions League final with Inter Milan, it was hard to tell Andre Onana had been close to that level.",
      "As such, in the final days of the summer, he was replaced by Lammens and loaned out to Trabzonspor.",
      "Pior to Lammens’ signing, though, there were links with Emiliano Martinez and Gianluigi Donnarumma. The former has won the World Cup and the latter the Champions League.",
      "Schmeichel feels those are the ilk of players United should have signed, instead of 23-year-old Lammens, from Royal Antwerp.",
      "“We should have signed Emi Martinez. In fact, we should have gone for Gianluigi Donnarumma when we had the chance,” he said.",
      "“With Martinez, everything was lined up and that felt like really good news, because he’s exactly the kind of goalkeeper Manchester United should have.",
      "“As for Lammens, I’ll be honest, I’d never heard of him until the link came up.",
      "“I know his stats are excellent across the top ten European leagues. But that was with Antwerp in Belgium, in a team that finished fifth.",
      "“Stats don’t show how you react after a mistake, or how you cope with the pressure of Manchester United. That pressure is unlike anywhere else in football.”",
      "Lammens has a fantastic save percentage, but has never played in a top-five league, has featured in the Champions League just once, and is yet to make his national team debut for Belgium.",
      "He is still yet to play for United despite being in place for their last Premier League game – the 3-0 loss to Manchester City.",
      "Indeed, Altay Bayindir was preferred between the sticks, despite rumours he could have been allowed to leave in the summer, and the goalkeeper having made mistakes during his time in the United net.",
      "When Lammens does get his first crack is unclear, as most would have expected he’d have been in immediately after his signing.",
      "In any case, Schmeichel was disappointed that he was the man signed, not a better option, and having one of the best players ever in your position, at the club you now play for, already on your back, is not a good start.",
      "Peter Schmeichel has questioned Manchester United letting a pair of stars leave the club, and he “hopes” one of them scores “25 goals” to show them what they’re missing.",
      "The brother of new Man Utd signing Senne Lammens attempted to stop him from joining the Red Devils but the Premier League club “gave him the best feeling”.",

      "Peter Schmeichel has questioned Manchester United letting a pair of stars leave the club, and he “hopes” one of them scores “25 goals” to show them what they’re missing.",
      "United allowed 10 players to leave this summer – Antony and Alejandro Garnacho permanently, and Rasmus Hojlund, Marcus Rashford and Andre Onana among those on loan.",
      "Antony and Rashford had both spent time out on loan last season, while Hojlund and Onana underperformed.",
      "Speaking on some of the exits, United legend Schmeichel suggested Antony’s was acceptable, but Hojlund still has a lot to offer to the Red Devils, and he hopes they can see that while he’s out on loan.",
      "He said: “With Antony, it’s different. He was never good enough for Manchester United. Yes, he scored on his debut, but very quickly you could see he didn’t have what it takes for the Premier League.",
      "“In Holland, playing in a dominant team, he looked good. But at United, the pace is relentless from the first minute to the last, the pressure is constant, and every opponent raises their game. To succeed here, you need something extra, and he didn’t have it. He’s moved on, and we wish him well.",
      "“The one that really pains me is Højlund. I honestly believe he could have been a 25-goal-a-season striker for Manchester United. The problem wasn’t him – it was the way the team played. The system didn’t suit him. When players like Garnacho or Rashford got the ball, they looked only to shoot. The ball into the No.9 never came, even though Rasmus was making really good runs.",
      "“The fans saw it. They loved him because he fought, he ran, he gave everything, and he had to play every game because there were no other strikers. Of course, when you don’t score as a striker, people point to it again and again. But what more could he do without service?",
      "“I’ve seen what he can do when he’s on form and gets the right service. That’s why I’m glad it’s only a loan. I hope he scores 25 goals, and that people at Old Trafford are then thinking: ‘We have to bring him back.’",
      "“With [Matheus] Cunha and [Bryan] Mbeumo now providing service, and Bruno [Fernandes] playing further up the pitch, I still believe he could be a fantastic striker for Manchester United. He’s already scored after just 30 minutes for Napoli, which shows his quality. He’s still our player, and that’s the positive.”",
      "Hojlund scored on his Serie A debut for Napoli, playing alongside Scott McTominay – last season’s Serie A player of the year after leaving United – who also has one goal so far this season.",
      "Schmeichel seems dejected at the fact the midfielder was ever allowed to leave.",

      "Amorim could only lead Man Utd to a 15th-placed finish in the Premier League last term and there is speculation that the Red Devils hierarchy will not put up with another season outside the European places.",
      "And the Daily Mail reported earlier this week that Man Utd captain Fernandes has expressed his unhappiness at being put in a deeper midfield role after contributing 17 goals and 16 assists last term.",
      "The report stated: ‘It’s understood some players have never been comfortable with a 3-4-2-1 system that was introduced when Amorim succeeded Erik ten Hag in mid-season last November.",
      "READ: Next Man Utd manager: Ranking Amorim’s replacements puts Southgate second",
      "‘Even one of his staunchest allies, captain Bruno Fernandes, is believed to be unhappy operating in a deeper midfield role.’",
      "And now journalist Graeme Bailey has told United In Focus that the Man Utd hierarchy are “furious about is the potential of leaks again”.",
      "Bailey said: ‘The one thing the club are furious about is the potential of leaks again, seeing stories about players and squad members not being convinced by Amorim or his tactics.",
      "‘The club thought they had really stamped this out, they see it as totally destructive to what they are trying to do.",
      "‘United firmly believe they are building something, but they won’t and can’t allow internal discontent to impact on the club as a whole.’",
      "Speaking about his midfield in the aftermath of the 3-0 Manchester Derby defeat to Man City, Man Utd boss Amorim said: “It’s the same thing, it’s always the same conversation. They [City] put four in the middle, we have three central defenders and two midfielders.",
      "“You can see Bryan [Mbeumo] is always inside and [Benjamin] Sesko is there, so that conversation is always the same thing.",
      "“We play last year the same way – of course with difference because the opponent is playing in a different way against Liverpool, against all these teams in the same way.",
      "“So it’s not the midfielders because, again, if you feel that what you are going to do in the first goal has to do with the amount of midfielders. Doku receives the ball, turns to the defence and then takes two guys inside the box. Then the second half, we start really well with two midfielders.",
      "“You are near the box controlling the game and then throw-in, goal. Third goal, you are controlling the game, trying to open the game, Bryan has a great opportunity, Amad is pushing on the side, we had some distraction with going to the ball, Haaland has all the field to run so it’s not to do with the midfielders.",
      "“It’s the way you want to see the games. I saw a lot of teams playing here [at the Etihad Stadium] with five midfielders just blocking and they suffer more than us. I see a lot of games from Manchester United playing here with a lot of midfielders.",
      "“Opportunities sometimes with one, two, so it’s not about that. Again, sometimes we play with the three defenders, five defenders, sometimes it’s five midfielders or two midfielders. It depends on the game of the opponent.”",
      "Manchester United have been told to sell Bruno Fernandes and build around Kobbie Mainoo, but they face the ‘most excruciating’ outcome.",
      "Paul Scholes has told Manchester United there is “no doubt” that Bruno Fernandes should be playing in a different position, and he might “get bored” in his current role.",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has hit back at pundits and former players who have questioned his demeanour in the past.",

      "The pressure on Ruben Amorim and his sheer bloody-mindedness means we must consider his replacements. And we’ve talked ourselves on board the Gareth Southgate train…",
      "The bookies aren’t often wrong so we’ve gone through the top 10 favourites to become United’s next manager.",
      "Frankly, it’s a s*** list. Bad enough to think that maybe 3-4-2-1 might work in the Championship after all.",
      "Please, Ruben. Just consider for a second that there might be a better way. Otherwise United should be bringing either the ex-England manager or a Barcelona legend back into management.",
      "Here’s how we’ve ranked the 10 current favourites to replace Amorim…",
      "",
      "Carrick failed to meet expectations at Middlesbrough in the Championship. Which makes a mockery of the fact that, at the time of writing, he’s third favourite for Amorim’s job.",
      "Of course, that’s down to his United legacy as one of the finest midfielders of the modern era. He also served as a coach and retains an unbeaten record as caretaker boss. Carrick’s link to United’s glorious past will always stand out on his CV. But the rest of it needs expanding and polishing before he can be considered a credible candidate for the top job at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Nuno’s stock has probably never been as high despite being sacked by Nottingham Forest. He left the City Ground after falling out with a man who falls out with everyone eventually, with Forest back in Europe for the first time in 30 years on his watch.",
      "Which is very commendable. Just not commendable enough to give him the keys to the Manchester United clown car.",
      "He would be far better off at West Ham.",
      "",
      "The nearly man of Dortmund has been out of work for over a year having left his boyhood club in the wake of their Champions League defeat to Real Madrid. Prior to that, he was a game away from winning the Bundesliga before blowing it spectacularly on the final day in 2023.",
      "Since leaving Dortmund, Terzic has spent his time preparing for his next opportunity, tapping into others’ knowledge to make sure he’s ready for wherever that might be. It was thought the German was on United’s list when they moved for Amorim.",
      "But Terzic seems to be looking for a project, the time for which he would never be afforded at Old Trafford.",
      "We have him pegged for Aston Villa.",
      "",
      "It was thought that Nagelsmann was only passing through international football and that he would be looking for a return to club management after the European Championships on home soil last year.",
      "But he then extended his stay to next summer’s World Cup, and subsequently signed a contract to manage Germany at Euro 2028. Presumably, he’s having a whale of time.",
      "So United would struggle to get the one-time coaching prodigy away from managing his country, especially given the mess he would be walking in to. That’s that then.",
      "",
      "The German won the FA Cup with Crystal Palace – a marvellous achievement that makes him an Eagles legend. Beating City also made him pretty popular at United. But it doesn’t make him qualified to put out the Old Trafford bin fire.",
      "Those lobbying for Glasner also point to the fact that he’s had success with 3-4-2-1, which Amorim is more wedded to than his wife. But Glasner would suffer the same as Amorim from the woeful lack of a midfielder than holds the system together.",
      "Doubtless Glasner would deserve a step up if he was to leave Selhurst Park. But there would have to be a bridging club between Palace and United.",
      "",
      "Much of what we think about Glasner applies to Iraola too. The Spaniard has done a wonderful job with Bournemouth. But Manchester United – especially THIS Manchester United – is a different proposition altogether.",
      "Iraola’s success at Bournemouth has come from high-press, high octane football. Which we know the current United squad is not built for.",
      "Would he get the time and breathing space to get them up to speed? Not a f***ing chance.",
      "",
      "Emery has already curried favour at Old Trafford by relieving United of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho. Though that goodwill must be tempered by concerns over the Spaniard’s judgement if he really believed signing Sancho to be a good idea.",
      "Emery has done a very fine job at Villa, taking a once-proud club flirting with relegation back in to the Champions League, all the while dealing with restrictive budgets and an unsustainable wage bill.",
      "Which makes Emery an ideal candidate. And given the general feeling of uneasiness at Villa Park right now, the timing could be perfect.",
      "But, for reasons we’re struggling to explain, it’s a very difficult proposition to get excited about. Perhaps it is the memory of his attempt at succeeding Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, from which he has bounced back from superbly. His subsequent body of work at Villarreal and Villa has restored his reputation. And no one at Old Trafford should be looking down their nose at the 53-year-old. So any lack of anticipation would probably say more about United’s perception of themselves than it does about Emery.",
      "🚨 Top 10 available managers: Nuno to be in demand as ex-Man Utd bosses seek jobs…",
      "",
      "Pochettino has had his fingers burned by United before, who might have hired the Argentine to replace as many as three of their previous managers. But every time, they have gone in a different direction.",
      "All of which led Pochettino to the United States job. And it is very difficult to imagine him walking away from that gig less than a year from hosting a World Cup.",
      "But not impossible. It seems that Pochettino and the United States remain to be convinced by each other, and if United finally make a serious play for the former Spurs, PSG and Chelsea boss, he might be tempted. He might also fancy telling them to shove it after multiple missed opportunities in the past.",
      "Out of sheer curiosity, we would be up for this.",
      "",
      "“I won’t coach in the next year, for sure. I’m certain of that,” said Southgate. A year ago…",
      "The ex-England boss doesn’t spark much excitement among United fans. Actually, we’re not sure he prompts any. But in that respect, he’s in very good company on this dreary list.",
      "His brand of football with England was hardly swashbuckling, but that is not what United need right now. First they have to stiffen up before they can zhuzh it up.",
      "Had his mate Dan Ashworth not been binned after 20 minutes as sporting director, Southgate may already have been fitted for his club blazer. And he is one of very few among the candidates who have experience with the level of scrutiny being United boss brings.",
      "On paper, after his success with England – let’s not pretend his record makes him anything else – Southgate has the credentials. He’s available and, according to his own timetable, he should be good to go. After the tacticians, maybe it’s time for the statesman.",
      "",
      "Xavi has already managed one giant basket case. Quite successfully too. While juggling financial levers, the Catalan guided his boyhood team to the La Liga title in his first full season in charge.",
      "He left after his second, initially of his own accord then the club’s, and Xavi spent last season on sabbatical. The 45-year-old is ready, though, for his next gig having used his break to broaden his coaching horizons.",

      "Manchester United will be weighing up the ‘eye-watering’ severance fee due to Ruben Amorim, but it wouldn’t even be in the top ten biggest manager pay-offs.",
      "Richard Keys was right all along: Amorim is trying to get sacked. That is the only possible conclusion one can draw from his comments after every ignominious defeat.",
      "And there have been a great many of those during his reign. To be exact, it’s 16 in 31 Premier League games. Which really does seem quite bad.",
      "Enough so for the ‘eye-watering’ pay-off to be revealed, at least. But at around £12m there have been far more expensive conscious uncouplings in dugouts across the world. Although mainly at Stamford Bridge.",
      "",
      "With the realisation having finally dawned about halfway into a three-year contract that Emery and Arsenal were incompatible, the decision was made to part and replace the Spaniard with the far more suitable manager whose appointment they bottled in the first place.",
      "",
      "It should forever go down as one of the more absurdly diabolical managerial succession plans in history. Manchester United let Ten Hag survive an internal review, oversee another £200m worth of signings he wanted or had previously worked with, sacked him a couple of months into the season and somehow found someone even worse to take his job.",
      "",
      "Even though the Russian Football Union was in significant debt to the point that billionaire Alisher Usmanov had loaned them £3.9m for some unpaid wages owed to Capello, it was felt that one of the more financially lucrative contracts in international football should have been worth more than a dreadful start to Euro 2016 qualifying which put Russia eight points behind Austria and four off the pace of Sweden in their group.",
      "",
      "Spoiler: it is not the only appearance Chelsea will make on this list. But Villas-Boas won’t pop up again after landing a paltry £4.5m when Spurs sacked him 18 months later. Poor bloke.",
      "",
      "See? Scolari only lasted seven months at Stamford Bridge and pocketed about £1.5m for each win in severance pay alone.",
      "",
      "It really is a ludicrous way to run what remains a broadly successful business. Less than a year prior Chelsea paid the biggest manager compensation fee in football history to extract Potter and his coaching staff from Brighton.",
      "",
      "A stunningly bungled appointment was only ever destined to end one way, even if all those involved might have expected there to be a slightly bigger gap between the number of days Spurs took to appoint a new manager (72) and the number of days that manager lasted (124).",
      "",
      "The first fall guy of many in the Boehly era had to make way for Potter six games into the season and about 15 months after following Champions League glory with a new contract.",
      "",
      "Daniel Levy had long been obsessed with the idea of Mourinho as Spurs manager and the Portuguese’s stock had finally fallen far enough while the club’s had risen for the stars to align. But the union lasted only 86 games and was ended on the eve of a League Cup final.",
      "",
      "It was described in official communications as a ‘joint agreement’ but a sizeable pay-off suggests something slightly less than mutual terminated Mancini’s £21m-a-year deal with the Saudis, who felt their chances of qualification for the 2026 World Cup were in jeopardy.",
      "",
      "“I would have liked that things happened in a different manner as it was a bit brutal,” said Blanc, whose alternate timeline would presumably still have included that healthy bank transfer. He was the most PSG of managers, winning 11 of a possible 15 trophies in three seasons but never advancing past the Champions League quarter-finals.",
      "",
      "In terms of matches managed it is and will probably forever be the third-longest tenure of Mourinho’s entire coaching career, featuring his proudest ever achievement of finishing second behind Manchester City and waiting patiently for a reallocated Premier League title to go with a decent compensation package.",
      "",
      "How different things might have turned out if the £20m paid to Pochettino and his staff had been set aside for an actual incoming transfer at any point between February 2018 and July 2019.",
      "",
      "The hat-trick is complete. Mourinho has made a small fortune out of burning bridges and scorching earth, with a gargantuan pay-off marking his first divorce from Chelsea. It was another expensive mutual consenting less than halfway through a five-year contract extension he signed in 2005.",
      "",
      "Chelsea’s own financial accounts listed “exceptional items of £26.6 million” relating to “changes in respect of the men’s team management and coaching staff, together with associated legal costs” after finally reaching a settlement with Conte over what was later judged to be an unfair dismissal. The Italian was ‘disgusted’ – and that was before he took over at Spurs.",
      "Chelsea have risen to the top of the Premier League prize money table alongside Liverpool as one of four teams to be picked for TV four times in November.",
      "Barcelona weren’t ‘remotely interested’ in ‘toxic’ Marcus Rashford, but a ‘subtle dig’ at Manchester United and a ‘pointed message’ to Ruben Amorim later…",
      "Liverpool have a ‘psychological edge’ over their opponents even while ‘looking pretty vulnerable at times’ because they have invented scoring goals.",
      "Ruben Amorim continuing to dare Man Utd to sack him and Liverpool emerging from Arsenal v Manchester City as the biggest winner makes this a big weekend.",
      "Unless it’s against European elite, Champions League games have become basically like playing Bournemouth now for Premier League teams.",

      "It looks like Ruben Amorim has picked a fight with the wrong man in Kobbie Mainoo, who’s up on points despite barely raising a fist and won’t need to do much more to land a knockout Manchester United blow.",
      "A video of Pep Guardiola putting his hands on his head as Mainoo diddled Phil Foden before nutmegging Nico Gonzalez to launch a Manchester United attack has been doing the rounds this week, suggesting the Manchester City manager may actually be more appreciative of the 20-year-old’s talents than the man currently in control of his career. And our friends at TEAMtalk reported on Wednesday that that may indeed be the case.",
      "‘TEAMtalk understands that Pep Guardiola, widely regarded as one of the game’s finest tacticians, views Mainoo as one of England’s brightest prospects.",
      "‘While transfers between Man Utd and Man City are rare, Guardiola’s admiration could make this a situation worth monitoring closely.’",
      "Mainoo’s teammates are ‘perplexed’ at him being sidelined by Amorim, Gary Lineker is “really worried” about him being “dismissed” and “baffled” by him not starting, and so too is Owen Hargreaves, who quite rightly said he was United’s “best player by a country mile” having come off the bench at the Etihad.",
      "Amorim believes he’s “helping” Mainoo, but it’s hard to see how and the academy graduate must be similarly confused as to why he’s not playing in a team performing so poorly. Just how bad do they have to be for him to be given a fair chance?",
      "He’s been told by Amorim that it’s either him or Bruno Fernandes, but we refuse to accept that Mainoo – ill-suited or not – would fail to do a better job alongside the Manchester United captain than competition winner Manuel Ugarte. And what has Fernandes done to merit his spot in the team over him other than scoring a last-minute penalty against Burnley?",
      "Mainoo is currently the second biggest stick to beat Amorim with aside from his failing philosophy and formation. It works in Mainoo’s favour with regard to his supporters and champions that his absence from the team is directly linked to that system, and very much against Amorim in the minds of those believing he should be sacked by Manchester United. Not only are they terrible, but there’s no place in the team for someone deemed by many to be the future of the club. It’s not a good look.",
      "United may have been a mess before Amorim arrived, but Mainoo was brilliant, for them and then for England at Euro 2024, and his cameo against City goes to show that very same dynamic, skilful player is still in there.",
      "It remains to be seen whether it’s a performance which will push Amorim to stick him in the starting lineup against Chelsea, but that surely won’t be the case if he sticks to his either/or stance vs Fernandes. He’s not about to drop the United captain.",
      "The obvious suggestion amid United’s poor start to the season and the decision not to grant Mainoo’s wish to leave the club on loan at the end of the transfer window is that he need only wait out Amorim to play regular football again.",
      "Guardiola’s admiration, along with longstanding interest from Chelsea, links to Real Madrid and recent rumours of a January move for his services by Newcastle suggests Amorim is one of very few managers not valuing Mainoo’s quality enough to rely on him as a key cog in a starting lineup.",
      "Most, we suspect, would be building the team around him.",

      "“It’s a pretty easy decision. This is my club. I have a lot of emotions and feelings. I’ve come with a belief I can come and help the cause until the end of the season. I’ll give my utmost to give the fans what they want.”",
      "Not the imagined words of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer when he takes back the Manchester United reins during the October international break, but those of Frank Lampard in April 2023 as he returned for an interim spell at Chelsea two years after his sacking, for a two-month nightmare which should serve as a warning to the man now being mentioned as a possible replacement for Ruben Amorim.",
      "“This is the worst Man United team I’ve seen,” Jamie O’Hara said on talkSPORT. “Honestly. I can’t believe Ruben Amorim is still in charge, honestly, when are they going to let it go?",
      "“When are they going to just…do what Sheffield United have done, just swallow their pride [and say] ‘we got this wrong?’ Get Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] back…get Ole back in. They can’t carry on doing this. They’ll go down. They’ll be playing Rotherham next season.”",
      "We can understand why Solskjaer would be seen as an attractive short-term appointment by some fans. What you could never say about his Manchester United is that they weren’t entertaining. His tactics board featured no coloured magnets and simply had ‘United Way’ written on it in permanent marker, with the old ‘go out there and express yourselves’ mantra clearly evident in what was some fantastic football to watch at times. The best since Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "Sure, “Ole’s at the wheel” was shouted back at them by goading scousers when Liverpool spanked them 5-0 at Old Trafford, but for a fair while the Manchester United fans chanted it with nothing but joy in their hearts at seeing one of their favourite sons leading them by playing a similar – if significantly less polished and gritty – style to that which saw him win nine major trophies in his playing career at Old Trafford.",
      "There’s no chance United would offer him anything but an interim role until the end of the season. Like Lampard upon his return to Chelsea having been sacked by Everton, Solskjaer is currently picking up the pieces of his managerial career after just 29 games in charge of Besiktas. And as evidenced by him not being good enough the first time, there’s only so much benefit to ‘knowing the club’.",
      "United hiring a manager whom they’ve already sacked once would be a bad look. But it wasn’t the INEOS regime that got rid of him and assuming they won’t make the same grave ‘now or never’ ultimatum error to force Amorim to take permanent charge mid-season, we could absolutely see them plumping for an appointment in a bid to get the fans back onside, with that fanciful ‘Manchester United DNA’ so far removed from the current football being played that it’s no longer even part of the ‘what’s wrong with United’ rhetoric.",
      "Solskjaer would also usher in the return of 4-3-3, which may be United’s best bet of getting back into Europe with the current crop of players, many of whom have now taken against Amorim’s doomed formation and philosophy, and would presumably welcome Solskjaer’s – let’s call it fluid – style.",
      "But we would urge Solksjaer when asking himself ‘why wouldn’t I?’ to consider Lampard at Chelsea.",
      "“I’m not getting ahead of myself,” Lampard said when asked about what the future might hold at the end of the 2022/2023 season. “I want to do the best I can to impact the club in this period and we will see what happens afterwards.”",
      "He arrived believing it possible he would be handed a permanent contract. He won one and lost eight of his 11 games in charge and Chelsea scored just nine goals, and left that role with many of us wondering whether that would be that for him in management before showing his worth at Championship level with Coventry.",
      "We imagine Solskjaer is poised for the United call. We can’t imagine a world in which he refuses an offer to return. But while the worst outcome for United would be another terrible season, the worst for him would be the demolition of an already broken reputation, and the best merely a few months of paid work and the Stretford End chanting his name before he’s out on his ear looking for further employment.",

      "Amorim is under scrutiny having only won one of Manchester United's first four games of the season and also been knocked out of the Carabao Cup in the second round by Grimsby Town.",
      "\"This is football and this is the club with more pressure, maybe, than any in the world, but we want to win,\" he said.",
      "The 40-year-old insists he sees improvement in their performances but admits they need to improve at both ends of the pitch.",
      "\"Last year I was very critical of the way we played,\" Amorim added. \"I think we are playing well until the boxes, defending and attacking.",
      "\"We need to be more aggressive in the boxes. We need to be more clinical. The rest I think we are improving compared to last year. We are in a better place.",
      "\"But we need to win. We lost against Arsenal and Man City. Here, losing, especially in the beginning after last season, is a problem.\"",
      "Amorim has had a free week with his players to prepare for Sunday's game against Chelsea at Old Trafford on the training pitch and says they have focused their efforts on being more effective in the boxes.",
      "\"We used the time to analyse the last game and the next game, and to prepare different things,\" he said. \"We are playing well until we reach the boxes.",
      "\"We need to be more clinical. The number of shots and the xG are good, but if you don't score, it doesn't matter.",
      "\"The way we suffered the goals, we can avoid that. We are being naive, we need to be more aggressive in order to win games.",
      "\"We have to maintain the way we're playing and improving in our box and the opposition's box - that was the focus of the week. Especially against Chelsea, when they cross, they are the side with the most players in the box.\"",
      "The Manchester United boss confirmed he will be able to call on Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount against Chelsea but Lisandro Martinez and Diogo Dalot are unavailable.",
      "Amorim bemoaned the absence of Martinez, who is edging towards a return to fitness having not featured since suffering a knee injury in February.",
      "\"When you recover from that injury, you have time where you recover a lot of things fast and then there is a boring part where it looks like you don't go to the next step,\" he said.",
      "\"We've missed him a lot. Especially in this moment, we miss his aggression in everything he does. But he's always there, in every meeting and when he finishes he stays to watch training.",
      "\"We need him in this team.\"",

      "Between the Lines returns with an in-depth look at Ruben Amorim's system and the reasons why Man Utd are struggling to make it work; Sunday's 3-0 loss to Man City leaves them with a worse record than any ever-present Premier League side since last year",
      "By Nick Wright, Adam Smith and Tom Stitson",
      "Friday 19 September 2025 10:30, UK",
      "Manchester United's 3-0 loss to Manchester City in Sunday's derby increased the pressure on head coach Ruben Amorim and raised more questions about his favoured 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Amorim reiterated his commitment to it despite the result. \"I'm not going to change,\" he said. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change. If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is understood the club remain patient and have no plans to change their head coach. But can Amorim's three-at-the-back set-up still bring success to Old Trafford, or is it doomed to fail?",
      "When Amorim says he won't change, history suggests he means it.",
      "He has started with a back three in 189 consecutive league games as a head coach since his appointment as Sporting boss in 2020.",
      "His most popular variation is 3-4-2-1, which he has used in 119 of those 189 games, including all four of Manchester United's fixtures in the Premier League so far this season.",
      "He has used a 3-4-3 a total of 68 times, with the only other variation being 3-5-2, which he has used twice since 2020.",
      "His three-at-the-back system brought him great success at Sporting, where he won two Primeira Liga titles in four years and gained a reputation as one of the most exciting managers in Europe. But it has been a different story so far at Manchester United.",
      "Amorim's win rate in league games has plummeted from 77.2 per cent at Sporting to just 25.8 per cent at Manchester United, making it the lowest of any manager in the club's history.",
      "Having taken just 31 points from his 31 games, Manchester United sit bottom among ever-present Premier League teams since his appointment, with twice as many losses (16) as wins (eight).",
      "So how unusual is his system? Data for the last two decades gives a picture of how formations have evolved in the Premier League.",
      "The favoured formation, by a considerable distance, is now 4-2-3-1, with 4-4-2 having dramatically declined in popularity. The 4-3-3 formation has also steadily increased in usage, albeit with a slight drop-off in the last two seasons.",
      "The graph above shows an increase in popularity for Amorim's favoured 3-4-2-1, which was barely used prior to 2015 but became more popular with Chelsea's title win under Antonio Conte in 2016/17.",
      "The formation is now at its peak in terms of usage in the Premier League, although that is largely due to Amorim's devotion to it.",
      "He has used a back three in all of his 31 Premier League games but Crystal Palace and Wolves are the only other sides to have consistently used the system in that timeframe, ensuring Amorim's side remain in a minority in a league dominated by back fours.",
      "Crystal Palace's success under Oliver Glasner, having won the FA Cup last season and qualified for Europe on a modest budget, proves a 3-4-2-1 formation can work in today's Premier League, so why is it not happening for Amorim at Manchester United?",
      "One issue is that they are still struggling to score goals. Despite spending more than £200m on the signings of Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko this summer, Amorim's side have only found the net four times in four games so far.",
      "Amorim can feel confident that those players will improve their output as they settle but he needs more from his wing-backs too. Patrick Dorgu and Noussair Mazraoui, his starters at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, have one Premier League assist and no goals between them in 52 Premier League appearances combined.",
      "The worry is that Amorim doesn't have enough attacking potency among his wing-back options and it is similarly difficult to see an immediate solution to the side's issues out of possession, many of which stem from midfield, where Amorim is now using Bruno Fernandes as part of his two.",
      "Fernandes' incisive passing allows Manchester United to launch quick attacks from the base of midfield but he is now spending less time in the areas in which he is most dangerous. His defensive deficiencies are also being punished routinely.",
      "For Manchester City's first goal on Sunday, Fernandes switched off and left Phil Foden free to head in Jeremy Doku's cross.",
      "The same lack of defensive awareness allowed Emile Smith Rowe to run beyond him and score Fulham's equaliser in the 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage last month, as shown below.",
      "Fernandes is not the only one struggling in Amorim's midfield, with team-mates Casemiro, Manuel Ugarte and Kobbie Mainoo all lacking the athleticism to cope with the demands of the role.",
      "Manchester City's second goal on Sunday, when Ugarte was dragged out of position to make an unsuccessful attempt to press Nico O'Reilly, showed how quickly they can become stretched.",
      "\"They start off really compact, where all 10 players are connected. Five at the back, two midfielders really close to that five, and then the three in front cuddling that two, so they are really protected.",
      "\"But if the game becomes a little stretched, which usually happens if Manchester United concede a goal, then those two look wide open and you can't deny that.\"",
      "\"If you're not brave enough to do that, it's very difficult. They will find the gaps and the spaces to play because we're playing against a top team, we're not playing against a bad opponent.\"",
      "And as Fulham and Burnley have already shown this season, it is not just the top teams who are punishing the weaknesses in Amorim's system. He has no plans to change but does he really have the personnel, either in midfield, or in his back three, or at wing-back, to make it work? Right now, their prospects do not look bright.",
      "We crunched the numbers on Premier League spending in the last edition of Between the Lines, unpicking some of the trends that defined a record-breaking summer transfer window.",

But theirs is a long-term plan to rejuvenate and regenerate the club, and while record revenues show that the club still has a huge commercial pull as one of the biggest in world football, fans shouldn't think that will mean bumper spending in the January window, or next summer.",
      "\"Deloitte said in January that United was the fourth biggest club in the world, only behind Real Madrid, Manchester City and PSG in terms of revenue. These latest figures will show that they have maintained that strong position, despite their worst performance on the pitch since 1974, when the club was relegated. A lack of Champions League football and a 15th-placed finish in the league cost them tens of millions of pounds.",
      "\"But the chief executive's statement has made the strategy clear: make United more and more commercially successful, and in future, there will be more and more funds to invest in the football squad, which they hope and believe will then lead to better results on the pitch, and a return to the days when they won trophies.",
      "\"We should not forget the underlying financial problems that United have, however, been brought about by the Glazer family takeover in the early 2000s.",
      "\"That 'leveraged buy-out' effectively lumped £790m of debt onto the club, which the Glazers used to buy a controlling stake at Old Trafford.",
      "\"These latest figures show that debt has reduced somewhat (by around £39m to £471.9m), but that reduction is because of a change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar, rather than any of the debt being specifically paid off.",
      "\"In addition, the \"revolving credit facility\" that the club has (in effect, like a personal credit card) now has £165.1m of additional debt on it - up from £35.6m last year.",
      "\"While the record revenues and reduced losses are no doubt a sign that United are making impressive commercial strides off the pitch, the Glazer debt and the continued under-performance of the team on the pitch are two nagging negatives.\"",

      "Tuesday 16 September 2025 13:03, UK",
      "It is four years ago now that Nicky Butt made headlines for his claim that Declan Rice is no better than Scott McTominay. While Butt acknowledges that the England midfielder has improved since then, there is more respect on McTominay's name now too.",
      "McTominay was the driving force behind Napoli's Serie A title win last season, scoring a dozen goals and winning the competition's player of the year award. It has made a mockery of the notion that he was not good enough to be a Manchester United player.",
      "\"Scott is an amazing person. He is a really great lad.\" Butt, who made 387 appearances for United, including one in the 1999 Champions League final, knows him well. He was an academy coach at United when McTominay broke through. \"He had it tough,\" he adds.",
      "\"He had a lot of growing problems, a lot of injuries.\" That growth spurt has been well documented. \"Back in the day, he was only small and slight.\" But his great strength was his resolve. \"His determination and his drive, you could not ever question,\" says Butt.",
      "\"Scott would be the first to sit here and say he was not the most gifted and talented footballer on the planet, which I wasn't, Roy Keane wasn't. But when you've got that kind of drive, which Scott has and obviously Roy had, you get yourself through the levels.",
      "\"And that is what Scott has done. Scott had the disappointment of leaving Man Utd, I felt that was wrong to let him go because he is one of your own, he would run through brick walls for you, a Manchester United fan from a family of Manchester United fans.\"",
      "McTominay returns to Manchester this week to play against City in the Champions League on Thursday. United themselves are not in European competition. \"It is the same old thing,\" says Butt. \"You don't know what you have got until you've not got it.\"",
      "He adds: \"He is a god in Napoli now. You go there and his picture is on all the walls. It is great. He has earned all that. He has grafted, worked hard, had knockbacks and fair play to him he is a player now. If he'd stayed, he might have stagnated and never got better.\"",
      "Indeed, Butt believes that even the famous Class of '92 would have struggled in the current climate. He made his Premier League debut alongside Bryan Robson in midfield with Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister behind him, Brian McClair and Mark Hughes ahead.",
      "\"Everybody talks about our group,\" says Butt of a crop of talent that included Paul Scholes and David Beckham. \"If we had been brought into this environment now, you would never have heard of us. We would have played seven, eight, nine or 10 games.\"",
      "Why is that? \"We got brought into a football team that was successful with world-class players but more importantly world-class professionals, good men. They made us, really. Trust me, it was more the fact that we had professionals around,\" he explains.",
      "\"When you come into a football club it is hard enough to put one young lad into a team. If you have not got real men to look after you then you will struggle. If we had got into this group now together, we would not have survived, we would have had a nightmare.\"",
      "Nicky Butt came close to making his own move abroad in 2004 when he was a target for Real Madrid. \n\n\n“I had a conversation with the club and they said that if you can find the right club for yourself and Manchester United then you can go. So I started looking around. Carlos Queiroz was Real Madrid manager at the time, he wanted me.”\n\n\nButt went as far as getting a passport sorted for his dog. “I am a big dog man so I made sure they were coming straight away. But it never transpired.” Sir Alex Ferguson decided to block the move.\n\n\n“Player power was not around then but even if it was I was not the kind of bloke to kick up too much of a fuss. I went to Newcastle which was an amazing club and I enjoyed my time there.”",
      "Speaking ahead of the launch of his new podcast with Scholes, The Good, The Bad and The Football, United's ongoing malaise is a recurring theme of the conversation. Having worked in United's academy between 2012 and 2021, Butt saw this unfolding up close.",
      "It remains a source of frustration. \"The worst thing you can do is bury your head in the sand,\" he says of City's rise to become the destination of choice in Manchester. \"Kids saw other clubs coming to them with better facilities. It was a massive pull for them.",
      "\"All over the country, academies upped their game. At Manchester United, we got a bit lacklustre, thinking we were the biggest and the best and did not have to go out and do all the things that the others were doing, but you have to stay on top of your game.\"",
      "Given his prominent role, could he not have arrested that slide himself? \"You're a small cog in a big machine.\" In 2021, he walked away. \"There were things happening at the club where there were people with different philosophies to what I was brought up on.\"",
      "An example. The separation between the academy and the senior players annoyed him. \"Young kids are moving further away from the first team,\" he says. \"I did not agree with the idea that the first team gets everything there and everyone else is on the other side.\"",
      "It was far removed from his own experience as a young player. \"When I was coming into the first team, I knew Brian Robson. I knew Mark Hughes. I knew Peter Schmeichel. I knew Brian McClair. All these superstars that you have on your wall,\" he says.",
      "\"Three years earlier I was at school. But I knew them because I was having dinner with them every day. I was training with them every day. And there was one big family. And when you go into the first team, they know your name and you know how they play.",
      "\"I could not ever imagine playing in front of 75,000 people and not even knowing who these people are. I think they have got to be a lot more together, a lot tighter. And my way, I felt, was changing. That was because other people were coming in from outside.\"",
      "If the sense is of Butt being wistful about United's past, do not mistake him for a sentimentalist. His take on the prospect of the club's proud record of having an academy graduate in every squad for 88 years and counting might just surprise.",
      "\"I'm a bit 50-50 with that. Unless you are bringing players in who are going to play for the club for years, it's pointless because anybody can put someone on the bench from the academy. They don't have to be good enough, it is just to keep the tradition going.",
      "\"If it is someone who you are putting on like Kobbie Mainoo or some of the other names that you can throw about, where you know they are a real player, an international who is going to improve the team and be there for the longevity, then that's brilliant.",
      "\"But if you are just going to bring in little Billy from the under-16s, who is nowhere near the level and you are just doing it to keep the tradition, it can be false, that. It is a bit of a sham. You have to be brave enough to go against the tradition. It will happen one day.\"",
      "United's future remains a fascination. And Butt, one of their own, is not optimistic that Benjamin Sesko can change their fortunes. He argues that it is not fair to expect too much of him. \"I hope he goes and gets the golden boot this year but it is highly unlikely.\"",
      "He is more encouraged by the investment in the training ground. \"The fundamentals of any club have to be solid.\" But how long until the title returns? \"That is the big question, isn't it? My heart says one thing,\" concludes Butt. \"My head says something else.\"",

      "Read on for Merson's thoughts in full...",
      "Ruben Amorim, the way he wants to play, is a worry.",
      "He won't change. He'll look at it and say 'I've got where I am today by playing the way I play', using three at the back and high wing-backs.",
      "He would have been a perfect fit for Chelsea. They've got world-class wing-backs in Reece James and Malo Gusto, they've got the best holding midfield player in the league in Moises Caicedo. It would fit the players.",
      "You look at Man United and this system does not suit the squad they've got at all. The two wing-backs are nowhere near it, nowhere near good enough. And they are a big part of this formation working. No legs in midfield. Everything is up against him.",
      "You've got to be able to change now and then. You can tweak it, it's horses for courses, that doesn't mean you are abandoning your beliefs.",
      "I don't see them finishing anywhere near it this season, there's too much work to be done. They haven't got the quality.",
      "They were decent against Burnley, but it ends up 2-2 and they need a penalty in the last minute. Their best two players are Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha, they cannot afford to be missed.",
      "He still hasn't won back-to-back games in the league, nearly a year in. That's unthinkable for a club like Man Utd. Unthinkable.",
      "I just wish he would change it every now and then and adapt to the personnel he's got available. It's worrying because he doesn't know his best team, the back three don't even play together every week. He's been there a year, that's a big, big worry.",
      "It's a hard week for Arsenal.",
      "I thought they played really well against Nottingham Forest, a solid result. The performance showed their depth. No Bukayo Saka, Declan Rice was a sub, Martin Odegaard had to go off - it just showed their quality.",
      "If they get through these next couple of weeks, I see them as the team. They are the ones. If they get through these next couple of games, you go advantage Arsenal. They have got ample quality to win the league.",
      "They were very good against Liverpool. That's the most comfortable I've seen an Arsenal team at Anfield in 20 years. If it had ended 0-0 we would be saying 'who is going to touch Arsenal this season?'. Liverpool didn't look like scoring for toffee and then Dominik Szoboszlai scores a worldie from nothing.",
      "Noni Madueke needs to keep on performing, it's only just started.",
      "Arsenal play a certain way, he's been positive, but the way Arsenal play compared to Chelsea will suit him.",
      "Arsenal move the ball quicker, it goes into his feet quicker and then he's one-vs-one in a flash. Chelsea are slower, by the time the ball is moved out to the winger the other side have doubled up. Arsenal don't do that.",
      "He's done outstanding so far - his goal for England against Serbia was really good - better than what I thought. But this has got to go on for the rest of the season. So far, so good.",
      "I'm unsure about Liverpool. They should be mid-table. They've been gifted six points.",
      "They never looked like scoring against Arsenal, Newcastle last kick of the game, then Burnley a penalty in stoppage time. What Hannibal Mejbri is doing there I do not know. You could take six points off Liverpool and no one would have argued. No one would say 'oh that's a bit harsh, they were bang unlucky'. All three should have ended up as draws, and they would be mid-table.",
      "I'm not convinced yet. There is a lot of work for Arne Slot to do. I don't think this Florian Wirtz one is working. I like Wirtz, a terrific player, but teams are sitting back against Liverpool and it's so claustrophobic for him. Their midfield three, for me, won them the league last year. I thought Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Szoboszlai were outstanding for long parts, dominating midfields - I don't see that this season. Teams are getting at Liverpool.",
      "Alexander Isak has got to come in, you can have all the best players in the world but if they don't gel, it doesn't work. So they could be mid-table, but you could also say they haven't started playing yet and they have won every game. That's the sign of a very good team.",
      "It's not like Aston Villa have been unlucky, you can't say they have been peppering opposition goals and been unlucky not to score. It's a slow burner. It's shocked me, I thought they would be right up there. It's worrying times.",
      "They will be okay because I think the manager is outstanding, but they have been caught behind. They didn't bring in a forward, Ollie Watkins looks lost. Hopefully one comes off his backside and he goes on a run but Villa don't look like scoring and that's the worry.",
      "They don't look right. A lot of stuff happened in the market - clubs spent, Villa didn't. Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio were taken away, goals have dried up. And these are players that can make chances for other people as well, they aren't getting those anymore. I look at that Villa team and it doesn't inspire me.",
      "I'm a big fan of Unai Emery, and so if anyone can turn it around, he can.",

      "Ruben Amorim has promised he won’t change his footballing philosophy and his bosses at Manchester United have no plans to change the head coach.",
      "The club has a long-term plan and while there is obvious and growing frustration with results, there will be no knee-jerk reaction or regular reassessment of the head coach's future after every defeat - however loud the noise grows from outside.",
      "Since Sir Alex Ferguson left 12 years ago, there have been two caretakers, and eight 'substantive' bosses. There is no desire to start afresh with a ninth.",
      "With four points from their opening four games, United have endured their worst start to a Premier League season since 1992/93. They also went out of the Carabao Cup - one of only three competitions they had the chance to win in 2025-26 - against Grimsby Town of League Two.",
      "This, after last season which saw their lowest ever Premier League points tally (42), and their most Premier League defeats (15).",
      "It is painful to watch. Amorim acknowledges and understands the supporters are hurting, but he says he is suffering still more as he battles to turn things around.",
      "He knows that his bosses are patient, and that they are realistic in their assessment that there are no quick fixes at Old Trafford. But there is also a recognition on all sides that currently things are far from good enough.",
      "There is no doubt Pep Guardiola's team definitively deserved the victory, and there is dismay at the three goals United conceded - with Erling Haaland's second a particularly tough one to swallow after the visitors vacated their entire defensive half to allow the Norwegian striker to run through unchecked.",
      "But there is pragmatism in the Old Trafford boardroom too recognising that, had Bryan Mbeumo's wondrous volley not been met with an equally wonderful Gianluigi Donnarumma save when the score was 2-0, or had Casemiro not missed a sitter at the back post later on in the game - there might have been a better gloss to the result.",
      "Amorim and the United hierarchy feel they are losing out on the fine margins right now.",
      "There are other mitigating circumstances too - the injuries to Mason Mount and Matheus Cunha are particularly damaging, especially because United's squad doesn't have the strength in depth of any of the other \"Big Six\" clubs right now.",
      "It will take several transfer windows and clever recruitment before that is a reality. Mount and Cunha should both be back available soon.",
      "Benjamin Sesko is still adapting to life in the Premier League, but there is optimism that he is beginning to feel more comfortable - albeit with very limited service. That was his first Premier League start for United on Sunday.",
      "Amorim's stubbornness over his playing system - with a defiant three centre backs - is very much a live debate. \"When I want to change my philosophy, I will change,\" the manager said on Sunday evening. \"If not, you have to change the man.\"",
      "It is not the first time that he has effectively said \"back me or sack me\" in front of the media. But when Amorim was appointed in November last year, the United hierarchy knew what they were getting, and the specific way in which the Portuguese coach chooses to play.",
      "There remains a belief, beyond Amorim's coaching staff, that the system can be a success.",
      "But there is some consternation that, with United's midfield struggling to hold its own so far this season, Amorim is repeatedly overlooking the talent of Kobbie Mainoo.",
      "The midfielder looked bright when he came off the bench for the last 30 minutes against City, and that again has prompted many a United fan to ask why he is yet to start a Premier League game this season.",
      "What is clear is that Amorim doesn't think he is the finished article and that, at 20-years-old, he still needs to develop. The United boss is working hard and personally with Mainoo behind the scenes, but rightly or wrongly - Mainoo's involvement will be managed. He is not currently in Amorim's first-choice line-up.",
      "For the Manchester United bosses, they feel little has changed after this weekend's game against their bitter rivals. That is not to say they will wait for change indefinitely. Rather, they accept that correcting United's malaise is a long-term project.",
      "And there is little or no desire to rip up the current plan, change the man in charge of the football team, and start (again) from scratch.",
      "Club legends are lining up to say enough is enough - Wayne Rooney, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more among the voices saying the pressure on Amorim is mounting, and things have to improve quickly.",
      "That is true. And no one knows it more acutely than Ruben Amorim himself."

      "\"But he is being asked to do something different. It is normal for a No 10 like he is to be able to do it for two or three games, to fill in when a midfielder is injured or suspended or something. But then you get a little bit bored of going back into position to defend.\"",
      "It is the voice of experience. \"I did both roles. As a No 10, the last thing you want to think about is defending. Once you go back into a two in midfield, all of a sudden you are thinking about defence, about what your runner is doing. It's a totally different mindset.\"",
      "There is a view now that Scholes was a natural deep-lying playmaker, England's answer to Andrea Pirlo or Xavi Hernandez. It is true that he took on that role late in his career but, now 50 and reflecting on his career, it is not necessarily how he sees himself.",
      "\"When I first came into the team I was a centre-forward,\" he recalls. And while Sir Alex Ferguson had always insisted that he would end up playing as a central midfielder, that took time. \"I ended up playing as a No 10 for three, four, five years, which I loved.\"",
      "They were some of his happiest and most successful years. \"Defending was not my strong point. I didn't like having to think about defending and as a No 10 you didn't have to. All you think about is getting your team to play, creating chances, scoring goals.\"",
      "In truth, the obsession with possession was never his. When watching old clips, he has been known to groan at the sight of himself passing backwards. \"It was not until my late twenties when I went into that controlling role as the manager wanted me to do.\"",
      "It required a mentality shift. \"I remember a game against Bayern Munich in the Champions League where he did not really want me to go over the halfway line, which was something different for me, because we were getting done in Europe quite a bit.\"",
      "Scholes' job was not to unlock the opposition but to stifle them. \"He wanted us to just be controlled and not vacate that area. It was something new for me to learn.\" Even now, he still recalls his surprise at the United manager's reaction to his performance.",
      "\"I remember after that game, I had not had a shot on goal and I don't think I created a chance. I didn't do anything attacking wise very well. He said, 'Brilliant, that is what I wanted from you'. From that day on, it just seemed to grow. I became used to the role.\"",
      "As such, you might expect Scholes to be an advocate for Fernandes making the same positional journey. The United skipper turned 31 this month, after all. Instead, it seems he would prefer the Portuguese playmaker to be the one still trying that killer pass.",
      "\"That is the way I was brought up. That is the way the manager wanted us to play. Pass forward and run forward. It was all about playing attacking, being entertaining. So, to go back, just passing it back, I hate seeing it now and I hated seeing it when I did it.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging conversation at a Manchester pub where he is even volunteering to pull pints to help promote his new podcast The Good, the Bad and the Football with fellow Class of '92 graduate Nicky Butt, Scholes touches on subjects old and new.",
      "He has been following the debate about the relative merits of Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney as teenagers. Scholes played with both. Owen even nicked the ball off his toe when scoring his wonder goal against Argentina in 1998. \"He could have left it for me.\"",
      "His own view? Succinct but definitive. \"At that age, Michael was the better goalscorer, Wayne was the better footballer.\"",
      "But he is keen to stress that Owen was a phenomenon in his own right, his pace setting him apart from the rest. \"With Michael in the early days, I just had to look and he would spin in behind and I just had to hit the ball into 20 yards of space. It was an easy job.\"",
      "Easy for Scholes, perhaps. He had a connection with many top-class strikers for club and country. \"As a midfield player you need to know your players' strengths.\" But Ruud van Nistelrooy was his favourite. \"I had the feeling that I knew what he wanted to do.\"",
      "Scholes wonders whether too much is being expected of the latest United striker Benjamin Sesko. Will he really be able to succeed where Rasmus Hojlund failed? \"He is a 22-year-old kid replacing someone of a very similar ilk. It is a difficult job to adapt.\"",
      "He would have liked the club to opt for a more experienced goalkeeper such as Emiliano Martinez too. \"He would have been a lot safer.\" And that is crucial. Scholes saw up close the difficulties that the club faced in trying to find a replacement for Peter Schmeichel.",
      "He is reluctant to criticise Massimo Taibi too much. \"He made a couple of mistakes. It did not work out.\" But he is less delicate on Mark Bosnich's footwork. \"Would he be able to play in this day and age for some of the best coaches in the world? I don't see it.\"",
      "On United more broadly, Scholes describes himself as \"more hopeful than confident\" that Amorim can bring the good times back. \"I like the way he speaks,\" he says, before later adding: \"The results are not really there to have massive confidence in him yet.\"",
      "Perhaps he would have more confidence if Fernandes were given more freedom to express himself further forwards. \"If you watched some of the Europa League games last year, he was really good in that [deeper] position so he can do it,\" says Scholes.",
      "\"I think if you asked him to do everything then he would try to do it all, almost in that Wayne Rooney type of way as well. But I think with him playing in that deeper-lying area it is taking away some of the important qualities that he has further up the pitch.\"",
