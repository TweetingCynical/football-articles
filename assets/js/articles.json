      "David Beckham’s desire to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid was solidified after the club tried to flog him to Barcelona. Beckham became a Galactico in 2003 when he swapped Old Trafford for the Bernabeu – but the transfer only came to fruition after Barca got involved in a tug of war.",
      "The England star came through the United academy and played for the club for 11 years before deciding to move elsewhere. A falling out with manager Sir Alex Ferguson played a role in the decision, with Fergie writing in his 2013 autobiography: “David was the only player I managed who chose to be famous, who made it his mission to be known outside the game.”",
      "He added: “The minute a Manchester United player thought he was bigger than the manager he had to go... David thought he was bigger than Alex Ferguson. There is no doubt about that in my mind.”",
      "Real Madrid ended up paying €35million (£25m) to United for Beckham and the right midfielder joined on a four-year contract which was reportedly worth €6m per year. But had United chairman Peter Kenyon got his way, Beckham would have actually joined Barcelona instead.",
      "\"My team was always Real Madrid and funnily enough I got sold from Manchester United to Barcelona,\" he told CBS Sports. \"I was on holiday, Peter Kenyon phoned me and he said: 'We've accepted a bid from Barcelona and we're selling you'.",
      "\"I said: 'If you are going to sell me, the only team I want to move to is Real Madrid', because I always had a dream of playing for Real Madrid when I was a young kid.",
      "\"I never thought I'd leave Manchester United but if I did, you know, I'd love to have played for Real Madrid. And if they wanted me to leave then the only club that I wanted to go to was Real Madrid.\" Beckham added: \"Funnily enough, in a day and a half, it happened.”",
      "In a separate interview with BBC Radio 4, Beckham admitted that United’s desire to sell him to a club he didn’t want to join helped clarify his thoughts about joining a star-studded Real. “There was never any revenge. I was hurt and angry at the time at how the situation had gone because throughout the season I was left out of certain games but never thought it would lead to me leaving,” he said.",
      "\"I then flew back to London. I tried to speak to Peter Kenyon and tried to speak to the manager and he said 'no'. I said 'well I need to speak to him and understand what is going on'. He said 'it's true, we have agreed a deal'.",
      "\"That is when I spoke to my agent and said 'if I am going to move, I'm going to move to Madrid'. Within a day, I was sat with the president of Madrid and we agreed that is where I was going to go.”"

    "body": [
      "Three years ago last week, Alejandro Garnacho's family were moved to tears in the directors' box at Old Trafford as, donning the No.47 shirt, he stepped onto the pitch for his Manchester United debut against Chelsea.",
      "At just 17 years old, Ralf Rangnick had spotted Garnacho's potential, which had been instrumental in leading United's academy to the FA Youth Cup final. Following his first-team debut, Garnacho returned to Old Trafford two weeks later and sealed the victory against Nottingham Forest with a brace.",
      "Since than, United have kept Garnacho from extensive media exposure. But on Wednesday, for the first time since his arrival in Manchester four-and-a-half years ago, Garnacho made his first Carrington press appearance.",
      "It came at a time where his long-term future is somewhat uncertain. In January, Napoli saw a £40million bid rejected while Chelsea have shown interest too. Both could launch summer moves. But Garnacho - a product of Atletico Madrid's and United's development as a winger - is now adapting to life under a coach devoted to a 3-4-2-1 formation. He's started 13 matches on the trot and is set to make it 14 against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday night.",
      "He conceded that the initial transition under Ruben Amorim had been \"difficult\". And he joined Marcus Rashford in being left out of the squad for the Manchester derby back in mid-December due to issues with their attitude. Since then, Rashford hasn't played for United and might never again.",
      "But Garnacho has knuckled down and is firmly back en vogue. United are closing in on a deal for Matheus Cunha which looks near enough done, sparking talk that Garnacho's place as a starter could be under threat as the club seeks a new No. 10 and a specialist.",
      "Yet this is the winger who surged past Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Anthony Martial, and Anthony Elanga in the fight for the left-wing spot. Garnacho has outlasted them all. Former teammates from Jose Mourinho's days at the helm have taken note of Rashford's inability to take criticism well. Meanwhile, Garnacho showcased self-reflection during his discussion at Carrington.",
      "Garnacho admitted: \"I think it's difficult for everyone when, in the middle of the season, a new manager comes in and we change the formation. But we just need to follow the rules and I try to improve every day.",
      "\"Obviously, the manager knows the characteristics of the players. You see the games, too many times I play, for example, wide on the wing and the wing back is coming inside. What we try to do depends on the players we have and we are improving as a team also.",
      "\"It's a little bit hard but it's just the mentality. My first two months, November and December were very difficult for me but my mentality is to keep working, to keep trying and show to the manager and staff I have to play.\"",
      "In preparation for the quarter-final second leg against Lyon, United opted for Harry Maguire to partner Amorim as they sought a \"leader\" for the press address. According to club insiders, Garnacho took the initiative himself to step up here, realising he hadn't previously faced pre-match media responsibilities and he fancied taking the lead.",
      "He wanted to convey his happiness at the club: “Obviously as a footballer you read and listen to some rumours about the future, but I have a contract here until 2028. I am happy here.\"",
      "Having played 140 times for United, Garnacho joining Amorim at the media forefront signalled his ascending maturity and experience.",
      "Despite having emulated Cristiano Ronaldo's goal celebrations, Garnacho modestly sidestepped direct comparisons with the legendary winger. He is just a single goal shy of equalling the 27 goals Ronaldo netted in his initial three years with United. Ronaldo was 21 years old in his third season with the club back in 2005-06, and Garnacho is set to celebrate his own 21st birthday this July.",
      "When it comes to statistics, Garnacho downplays their significance. \"I'm not focused on the numbers. I think when Cristiano played here he's a different footballer and different types of games, I just try to help the team and win games.\"",
      "\"Obviously, missing chances, we are training really hard, me, Rasmus (Hojlund), all the strikers in the team, so I think we are improving and trying to do better.\"",
      "Four members of Garnacho's family were spotted in the United executives' section in Bilbao last week, proudly wearing 'Garnacho 17' on their shirts. If he remains, it may not be long until he's upgraded to the club's much-vaunted No.7."

      "Manchester United and Tottenham are both just 90 minutes away from securing their place in the Europa League final. The Premier League giants have both endured miserable domestic seasons, finding themselves in the bottom half of the table.",
      "That has piled the pressure on bosses Ruben Amorim and Ange Postecoglou, but the two could both salvage their season with a European triumph. United are looking to win their first trophy under Amorim, while Spurs are looking to end their 17-year silverware drought.",
      "And along with lifting the trophy, winning the Europa League would also secure either side a passage to next season’s Champions League. Much to Arsene Wenger's annoyance.",
      "And the Premier League pair are well placed to reach the final later this month. United hold a three-goal lead over Athletic Bilbao after a brilliant first leg in Spain, while Spurs head to the Arctic Circle to face Bodo/Glimt after winning 3-1 in north London.",
      "Neither side are getting carried away, but should everything go to plan on Thursday evening it will be an all-English final. Here’s everything you need to know about the potential clash.",
      "It’s a relatively quick turnaround from the conclusion of the semi-final ties, with the final being played on Wednesday, May 21 at Athletic Bilbao’s San Mames Stadium. It will get underway at 8pm UK time.",
      "As is often the case with the UEFA competitions, the number of tickets on offer, compared to the amount going to supporters is a bone of contention. Bilbao’s stadium, built in 2013, holds more than 53,000 fans.",
      "But that hasn’t translated into large allocations for teams that reach the final. In fact, just over 29,000 tickets will go to fans of the finalists, with the remaining 24,000 allocated elsewhere.",
      "Unsurprisingly, that has angered all sets of supporters still in the competition, who will face a mad scramble to secure their place.",
      "Both Spurs and United have already opened applications to purchase tickets, due to the very small window between now and the final kicking off.",
      "Rather than the clubs themselves, UEFA will handle the ticket purchasing and distribution. Prices range from €40 (£34) for Category 4 tickets, all the way to Category 1 tickets which ill cost €240 (£204). There is an option for restricted view tickets at the top category level, which will set you back €190 (£161)."

      "A return to San Mames for the May 21 showpiece against Bodo/Glimt or, more likely, Tottenham Hotspur is within touching distance, having seen out an early storm against a side desperately seeking to reach the final at their stadium. Athletic flew out of the blocks but imploded after Casemiro put United ahead in the 30th minute, with Bruno Fernandes keeping his cool to score from the spot after Dani Vivian saw red for bringing down Rasmus Hojlund.",

      "“I think they have to think about the second leg,” said Amorim. “And they have to think more about the first 20 minutes than the rest of the game because the game is going to be really tough.",

And while it remains to be seen if they can finance a permanent move, Alarcon says they were always confident he would get back to his best. He told El Desmarque: “The good thing is that at Christmas we made a promise to Manchester [United]. If he comes to Betis, it’s a place where he’ll regain his value, which is what they wanted, because it’s through his play, and because it’s a place that adapts very well to the type of game Antony had.”",

      "The Red Devils will land a golden ticket for the Champions League if they go on to win the Europa League in the coming weeks.

      "“In that moment - and if you look at the Premier League since I arrived - we are the worst team in terms of results,” said Amorim. “At the end of this season, we can be the worst United team in Premier League history - one with a European title. But that will change nothing.",

      "Manchester United are reportedly eyeing an ambitious swap deal that could see them land two high-profile players who rejected Arsenal. With Juventus showing interest in Rasmus Hojlund, United are exploring several different options ahead of what's set to be a crucial summer for the club.",
      "According to Tuttosport, Juventus are open to offering both Dusan Vlahovic and Douglas Luiz in exchange for Hojlund, as they look to offload players to reshape their squad.",
      "Vlahovic famously snubbed Arsenal in favour of a £70million move to Turin in 2022, but his time in Italy could be coming to a close. With just over a year remaining on his contract, Juventus are eager to find a buyer to avoid losing him for free in 2026.",
      "Despite scoring 55 goals in 140 appearances for the Italian giants, Vlahovic, 25, has come under scrutiny for his inconsistency and inability to deliver in big games. His nine-goal return in Serie A this season, coupled with his eye-watering £317,000-per-week wages, has left Juve's hierarchy looking for a way out.",
      "Luiz, meanwhile, has struggled to cement a place in the Juventus starting XI since his £43m switch from Aston Villa last year. The Brazilian midfielder, 26, was once the subject of multiple deadline-day bids from Arsenal and has long been on the radar of Premier League clubs. Manchester City were linked with him as recently as January, but he could now end up across town at Old Trafford.",
      "With manager Ruben Amorim preparing for his first full season, United are expected to reinforce across the pitch. Midfield is a particular area of focus, and Luiz is seen as a player who could add energy and tenacity to the centre of the park.",
      "However, any move may depend on Juventus following through on their interest in Hojlund. The Danish forward has endured a difficult spell at Old Trafford, struggling to justify his £72m price tag since arriving from Atalanta in 2023.",
      "However, his prior success in Serie A ensures he remains a coveted asset in Italy, and Juve - in need of a Vlahovic replacement - are considering a swoop, particularly since Hojlund looks to be on the fringes of Amorim's current plans.",
      "Reports suggest Juventus are willing to part with both Vlahovic and Luiz to bring Hojlund to Turin. But whether this proposal aligns with United's priorities remains to be seen.",
      "The club's financial situation remains delicate, and a straight cash injection might be more appealing as they look to balance the books. That said, if Hojlund does leave this summer, United will need to replace him - and Vlahovic offers proven European pedigree at a potentially reduced cost.",
      "There is, however, the issue of Vlahovic's salary. With only three United players currently earning more than £200,000 a week, the former Fiorentina star would likely need to accept a significant pay cut to make the move viable.",
      "Nevertheless, the deal has the potential to be both shrewd and transformative - the kind of calculated risk United may need to take after a dismal campaign they can't afford to repeat."

      "Ruben Amorim has said he understands the transfer speculation surrrounding Bruno Fernandes but wants to keep the Portugal star at Old Trafford. Speculation has mounted on the Manchester United talisman following a difficult season for the club.",
      "Reports have emerged of interest from the Saudi Pro League, but Amorim was clear in wanting to retain the services of his captain. Al-Hilal are said to be ready to lodge a significant offer for United's top goalscorer.",
      "Fernandes, 30, has recorded 19 goals and 18 assists this season despite the Red Devils dwelling near the bottom of the Premier League and played a key role in the club reaching the Europa League semi-final. The midfielder saw speculation over his position at the club last summer but eventually signed a contract until 2027, with an option for a further year, in August.",
      "And Amorim would loathe to lose a key player as he attempts to transform United's fortune. The United head coach has already rejected the possibility of his star player exiting for Real Madrid at the end of the season, and was again reaffirmed his commitment to keeping Fernandes at the club on Wednesday.",
      "\"I think it is easy to understand that [transfer speculation], not just because of the numbers but the way he plays,\" said Amorim in his press conference ahead of Athletic Bilbao.",
      "\"He is a top player and we need to top players. He is a leader, the captain.",
      "\"It is natural that people want Bruno, but we want to keep him. He is one of the top players of the world.\"",
      "Earlier in his Manchester United tenure, Amorim claimed his side were the worst in the club's history. The 40-year-old boss was asked about those comments with the club now on the verge of the Europa League final.",
      "\"I think you have to see the quotes in the moment, so things can change. If you look to the Premier League, since I arrive, we are the worst team since I arrived.",
      "\"At the end of this season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title. This season has been really disappointing for everyone, but nothing is going to change. In that moment, sometimes I have to think a little bit more.\"",
      "Alejandro Garnacho also faced the media and had little issue with his manager's comments. The young winger is simply focused on earning a spot in the Champions League.",
      "\"We know that we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. But the manager said before that we have followed the rules and tomorrow is a final, and we will face it like it is 0-0.",
      "\"If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we will face next season with a different mentality and in a different way.\""

      "Once hailed as the epitome of unity and stardom, the Beckham household is now facing a very public family fallout that has left fans taken aback. Central to the turmoil is the deteriorating relationship between David Beckham and his oldest son, Brooklyn Beckham.",
      "Brooklyn's noticeable no-show at David's extravagant 50th birthday festivities earlier this month, combined with persistent family discord, has shone a harsh light on their fractured bond. To grasp how things got to this point, it's worth looking back to a critical turning point: when Brooklyn chose to walk away from football.",
      "This was an emotional moment that deeply impacted David and exposed the complicated layers of their bond.",
      "In 2014, Brooklyn, then just 15, decided to step away from football, even though he was in Arsenal's youth academy at the time. David, an international sporting icon and Manchester United legend, had long envisioned his son following in his footsteps.",
      "But Brooklyn, now 26, decided to carve out an entirely different identity for himself – pursuing photography, fashion, and entrepreneurship. In a 2015 interview with ABC, David claimed that it \"broke his heart\" to discover Brooklyn had been weighed down by the pressure of his famous surname.",
      "\"One of my boys turned around to me the other day and said, 'Daddy, I'm not sure I want to play football all the time,'\" David said. \"It broke my heart a little bit. He said, 'Every time I step on to the field, I know people are saying, 'This is David Beckham's son,' and if I am not as good as you, then it is not good enough.'\"",
      "Speaking to Variety in 2022, Brooklyn admitted that while quitting football made him \"sad,\" his father ultimately supported him. \"My dad wasn't sad, because he was like, 'I just want you to be happy,'\" Brooklyn said. \"But of course, I was sad. It was my whole life since I was literally two.\"",
      "This moment highlighted David's true nature – not as a controlling parent demanding his child fulfil inherited dreams, but as someone genuinely trying to respect Brooklyn's individuality.",
      "Brooklyn later opened up about his struggles with anxiety and the immense burden of expectations. He said he \"never really enjoyed\" the game, in part due to harsh scrutiny from coaches who expected him to emulate his dad's legendary career.",
      "That immense pressure turned football from a passion into a source of distress. Though it hurt, David acknowledged his son's right to choose a different path. But what once appeared as mutual respect may have slowly evolved into emotional estrangement.",
      "Now, in 2025, the Beckham family is mired in an ongoing feud. Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz skipped all of David's milestone birthday events – including an elegant Miami soiree, a countryside gathering in the Cotswolds, and a glitzy affair at the Met Gala in London.",
      "Insiders say Brooklyn avoided the celebrations due to underlying tensions linked to Nicola, who some insiders blame for worsening the family fallout. One report claims Brooklyn asked for a separate celebration without Romeo's partner, Kim Turnbull, with whom Brooklyn reportedly shares a complicated history.",
      "David declined, emphasising the importance of celebrating as a full family. That refusal apparently hurt Brooklyn, who chose to forgo the events entirely – a decision that has left both David and Victoria hurt.",
      "Tensions have been building since Brooklyn and Nicola's 2022 wedding, which was reportedly marred by disagreements and miscommunications with Victoria. While the two sides made brief strides toward healing, that progress appears to have reversed.",
      "Brooklyn's continued absence from major family events, including Victoria's 51st birthday in April, and the silence around his wedding anniversary have only deepened public suspicions of estrangement.",
      "David appeared to extend an olive branch with a birthday post captioned: \"You were missed @brooklynbeckham\". But Brooklyn's decision to prioritise Nicola and sidestep family moments has seemingly intensified the emotional distance, leaving the family torn and adrift."

      "It was three years ago last week that the Garnachos were reduced to tears in the Old Trafford directors' box. Alejandro, wearing the number 47, crossed the white line for his Manchester United debut against Chelsea.",
      "Ralf Rangnick recognised Garnacho's qualities as a 17-year-old who had inspired the academy to the FA Youth Cup final. Back at Old Trafford two weeks after Garnacho's senior bow, he decided the final against Nottingham Forest with two goals.",
      "United have been naturally reluctant to make Garnacho available to the media. Four-and-a-half years after he touched down in Manchester with the Covid-19 pandemic impinging on the public's freedom, Garnacho attended his first press engagement at Carrington on Wednesday.",
      "Usually, there are a handful of questions for the player as the focus is on the coach. It was different with Garnacho. He was the academy poster boy of not just Erik ten Hag's reign but United's future.",
      "That was in doubt in January. Napoli had a £40million offer knocked back. Chelsea have stockpiled almost enough youngsters to fill Stamford Bridge but also expressed interest.",
      "Garnacho was developed as a winger by Atletico Madrid and United only to now be coached by a man wedded to a 3-4-2-1 system. He admitted his first weeks under Ruben Amorim were \"difficult\".",
      "Amorim omitted Garnacho and Marcus Rashford from the Manchester derby squad on account of their attitude in mid-December. Rashford has not played for United and may never do so again. Garnacho has played in every match since.",
      "He has started in 13 successive matches and it will be a 14th against Athletic Bilbao on Thursday evening. Amorim has spoken about him in such glowing terms he was not actually asked about Garnacho, sat to his right, at the pre-match press conference.",
      "United's interest in Matheus Cunha is now so advanced it would be a surprise if the deal does not materialise. United need a new No.10 and a specialist, which threatens Garnacho's starting status.",
      "But this is a winger who barged ahead of Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Anthonys Martial and Elanga in the left-wing pecking order. Garnacho has survived them all.",
      "Teammates as far back as Jose Mourinho's tenure noticed Rashford did not react well to criticism. Garnacho was self-critical during his sit-down at Carrington.",
      "\"I think it’s difficult for everyone when, in the middle of the season, a new manager comes in and we change the formation,\" Garnacho explained. \"But we just need to follow the rules and I try to improve every day.",
      "\"Obviously, the manager knows the characteristics of the players. You see the games, too many times I play, for example, wide on the wing and the wing back is coming inside. What we try to do depends on the players we have and we are improving as a team also.",
      "\"It’s a little bit hard but it’s just the mentality. My first two months, November and December were very difficult for me but my mentality is to keep working, to keep trying and show to the manager and staff I have to play.\"",
      "United chose Harry Maguire to flank Amorim ahead of the quarter-final second leg against Lyon as they wanted a \"leader\" to address the press. That was Maguire's second media attendance in the Europa League this term and United were running out of willing talkers.",
      "Garnacho has conducted some rights-holder chats with Kobbie Mainoo and an impromptu post-match debrief on the Old Trafford pitch after the 2-0 victory over Everton last season. His English was like some of his wing play - fluent and swift. It was difficult to keep up with the transcribing.",
      "Club sources say Garnacho wanted to do it himself as he recognised he had never sat in for pre-match duties before. There was no specific message to get across. Garnacho has played 140 times for United and his presence at the top table with Amorim reflected his growing maturity and experience.",
      "For someone who mimicked Cristiano Ronaldo's celebrations at youth and senior level, Garnacho downplayed comparisons between the wingers. He is one goal away from matching the 27 Ronaldo tallied in his first three seasons at United.",
      "Ronaldo turned 21 in his third campaign in 2005-06. Garnacho celebrates his coming of age in July. His form last season, in particular, would suggest he was two years ahead of schedule.",
      "\"I’m not focused on the numbers,\" he shrugged. \"I think when Cristiano played here he's a different footballer and different types of games, I just try to help the team and win games.",
      "\"Obviously, missing chances, we are training really hard, me, Rasmus (Hojlund), all the strikers in the team, so I think we are improving and trying to do better.\"",
      "In Bilbao last week, four members of the Garnacho family sat in the United executives' section, all with 'Garnacho 17' on the back of their shirt. If Garnacho stays long enough at United, his squad number might be upgraded again to a standalone '7'."

      "Manchester United are 90 minutes away from a fifth final in five seasons and even their worst domestic team in 51 years is not expected to cock up their three-goal advantage against Athletic Bilbao.",

      "Matthijs de Ligt is out after his impact injury against Brentford on Sunday. Christian Eriksen did not participate in the open training session on Wednesday but is fit and available. Lisandro Martinez, Joshua Zirkzee, Ayden Heaven, Diogo Dalot, Jonny Evans and Toby Collyer are out.",
      "Here are five things to look out for this evening:",
      "No comeback?",
      "The absence of the Williams brothers might have caused another surge in prices for flights to Bilbao from Manchester in two weeks. Athletic Bilbao are far from certain of playing in the Champions League next season and their priority now feels like it has switched from Europa League to La Liga.",
      "In 133 Uefa Cup and Europa League knockout ties, no team has gone out after leading by three goals from the first leg. Deportivo la Coruna, Barcelona, Roma and Liverpool have recovered from three-goal deficits in the Champions League ahead of a second leg to go through. United have also lost 3-0 at home six times since the start of last season but Athletic are up against it.",
      "Hint at final XI?",
      "At the risk of getting ahead of ourselves, United's line-up for the final could already be pencilled in. With Matthijs de Ligt sidelined again, Noussair Mazraoui would be the logical inclusion in the back three. Amad's return and impact on the right wing against Brentford makes him a natural fit.",
      "Debuts?",
      "This could be as serene a semi-final second leg for United as it was against Schalke in the Champions League in 2011. They were 2-0 up from the first leg that night and won the second 4-1.",
      "More academy players trained with the first team on Wednesday. Jaydan Kamason has been an unused substitute in a few European ties already while Bendito Mantato was on the bench in Bilbao.",
      "Bodo or Spurs?",
      "Anyone in the press box tonight would be forgiven for having a live feed of the other semi-final on their smartphone. Tottenham players are dropping like flies, they will be playing on a plastic pitch and Bodo got a late goal to ensure they avoided a three-goal defeat. That tie does not feel like a foregone conclusion as much as United's.",
      "New tifo",
      "United's progression to the final seems such a certainty a genuine thing to look out for is the second Old Trafford tifo. They picked the right night for the unveiling of the first ahead of that uproarious epic with Lyon three weeks ago and United supporters appeared to approve."

      "Covering Manchester United this season is like covering two different football clubs. They are the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde of the Premier League.",
      "So as Ruben Amorim pulled up a seat in the Jimmy Murphy Centre to discuss a European semi-final second leg as routine as they come, it didn't always feel like this was a success story we were there to preview. In fact, Amorim made sure it wasn't that.",
      "Yes, United are 13 games unbeaten in Europe. They won 3-0 in Bilbao to put themselves on the brink of a return to that city for a Europa League final, but nobody can pretend this has been a successful season. In isolation, a European final and a potential route into the Champions League are fine achievements, but Amorim is determined that the campaign will be taken as a whole, warts and all.",
      "And in the Premier League there are a lot of warts. This team sit 15th in the table and shifting their focus to the Europa League could yet see them slide further down. They have already lost 16 times and nobody has stopped the count in that particular column so far.",
      "When Amorim was asked - again - by the Spanish press about his January claim that this was the worst United team in history, he didn't backtrack from it, he doubled down. Scaling back his historical timeline to the last 50 years is hardly offering an olive branch to the dressing room.",
      "Just over 24 hours before a night that could be rapturous at Old Trafford, Amorim delivered a few more home truths. When he was asked if he didn't know which United team would turn up, the question was calling out for a headline, and Amorim delivered.",
      "In fact, he went further. Not only did he not know which team would turn up, but he didn't know which team would be on show from one minute to the next when he is standing on the touchline watching them.",
      "As evidence, he pointed to a propensity for conceding goals in quick succession, a problem that dates back to the start of Erik ten Hag's second season in charge. He raised the 4-3 defeat at Brentford on Sunday, when United went from pushing for an equaliser at 2-1 to conceding two goals in four minutes to see the game move out of their reach.",
      "It has been a recurring problem, and it's why he is taking absolutely nothing for granted on Thursday, despite the three-goal cushion, home advantage and the fact that Athletic are without their best players.",
      "\"It is hard to say and sometimes it is not what kind of team will be tomorrow,\" he said, \"sometimes during the game we are one team, something happens and we lose our minds a little bit.",
      "\"But we are improving the way we play, we are more confident and we are ready to face this challenge.\"",
      "United have already ridden the rollercoaster during their European campaign, most notably in scoring three goals in the final six minutes of extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 at Old Trafford.",
      "But the best teams can exhibit the kind of control and consistency of performance that Amorim's United are still striving for.",
      "\"If you look at our team, we cannot say today what is going to happen. There are some teams in any league that can understand the game is going to be like this, the story is going to be like this and control the narrative, we cannot do that,\" he said.",
      "\"We have to face the game as one more game. I feel we need to score to go to the next round. This is the way we’re going to face the game.",
      "\"Then we use Brentford we are near a draw then we suffer a goal and another one quite fast. That can happen, four times it’s happened to Manchester United. We will have to suffer a little bit to go to the final and we are ready to suffer and we need to be better in the small details in this game.\"",
      "Even this United team surely can't play themselves into trouble in the second leg. The loss of Nico and Inaki Williams to Athletic Club is a monumental blow and suggests Ernesto Valverde has already turned his attention to securing fourth in La Liga and a direct route into the Champions League.",
      "But a final is the kind of game that calls for calm heads. You don't want to go into a showpiece like that when you are capable of 'losing our minds a little bit'.",
      "That is something Amorim won't be able to eradicate in the space of two weeks, but by bringing it up now when success is within reach, he is making it clear it's a trait that must be stamped out heading into next season.",

      "Head coach Ruben Amorim shuffled his pack for Sunday's 4-3 defeat at Brentford in the Premier League, meaning he is poised to revert to a similar XI to the one that started last Thursday's first leg at the San Mames Stadium.",
      "Regarding the team news, Amorim has confirmed Matthijs de Ligt will be unavailable for the next two games after suffering a suspected knee injury against Brentford. He also confirmed that he does not anticipate any fresh faces to be back in the squad.",
      "Below, our writers have had their say on how they would like to see United line up tonight:",
      "United should play the team that can be pencilled in for the final tonight. With De Ligt out, Noussair Mazraoui is a logical choice at right centre back while Amad is a natural fit for the right wing. Manuel Ugarte and Casemiro is the established midfield pairing for the meaningful matches in the run-in, while the three forward positions are also locked in, irrespective of their domestic form.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo is the main man who would miss out but his absence is not particularly glaring, given recent selections.",
      "This will be a very strong United team and arguably the one that starts the final, although that could change if either De Ligt or Dalot prove their fitness or Amorim decides he wants the left-foot of Shaw in defence. For now, Mazraoui, Maguire and Yoro are the back three.",
      "This is the ideal opportunity to give Amad an hour at right wing-back after he got 45 minutes at Brentford. Shaw could replace him during the game with Mazraoui moving to wing-back. Dorgu starts on the left and would be a certainty for the final. Ugarte and Casemiro have formed a good partnership in the deep midfield positions in the Europa League.",
      "Further forward, Fernandes and Garnacho have also created a good dynamic in the No.10 roles and they can start behind Hojlund, who has saved his best performances for Europe.",
      "Having blitzed Bilbao in the San Mames a week ago, Amorim must be feeling tempted to name the exact same starting XI. He made eight changes at Brentford on Sunday and that was done with a firm eye on tonight's game.",
      "However, with De Ligt sidelined and Victor Lindelof set to move on at the end of the season, it makes sense for Mazraoui to start at right-sided centre-back and open up the door for Amad to bag his first start since February.",
      "He has stepped off the bench in each of the last two games and the prospect of him starting against Athletic would give the crowd an even bigger lift ahead of kick-off. The Ivorian excelled as a wing-back earlier this season, and with United 3-0 up in the tie, Amorim may be more confident in unleashing an attack-minded wing-back from the start."

      "Amorim had just finished explaining how he believes his side will have to get themselves on the scoresheet if they are to give themselves the best possible chance of progressing to a third Europa League final in eight years, despite taking a 3-0 lead into the second leg of their semi-final showdown with the Spanish outfit.",
      "United pulled clear of Athletic in a 15-minute first half blitz at the San Mames Stadium last week thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes (2) and Casemiro.",
      "But Amorim is adamant his side will have to score to give themselves the best possible chance of returning to the San Mames Stadium for the final later this month.",
      "He said: \"We have to face the game as one more game. I feel that we need to score to go to the next round. That is clearly the way we are going to face the game.",
      "\"We use some image of Brentford: we are near the draw but we suffer a goal and suffer another goal, quite fast. That can happen, that happened four times here in Manchester United.",
      "\"So we know we will have to suffer a little bit to go to the final, and we are ready to suffer and we need to be better in the small details in these games.\"",
      "Amorim has often warned his players throughout his tenure that they will have to \"suffer\" in order to achieve their respective goals, with his warning on Wednesday a reminder that anything can happen.",
      "United, as recently as three weeks ago, were seemingly cruising towards the Europa League semi-finals after racing into a 2-0 lead in the second leg of their quarter-final showdown with Lyon at Old Trafford, securing a 4-2 advantage on aggregate.",
      "United squandered that lead before conceding two more goals in extra-time and being on the brink of elimination. After Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo had scored to make it 6-6 on aggregate, Harry Maguire's last-gasp header ensured they avoided the lottery of a penalty shootout to try and preserve their Europa League status.",
      "Events against Lyon should serve as a reminder to United's players that anything is possible. Athletic must become the first Europa League side in history to overturn a three-goal deficit in a two-legged knockout game when being the away team in the second leg.",
      "It sounds like a challenge too big for Athletic to overcome. However, as Inter Milan and Barcelona showed earlier this week, you never know what is right around the corner in this sport.",
      "Amorim's decision to highlight the importance of his team going on the attack and adding to their three-goal advantage highlights his mindset ahead of what is the biggest night United have had in years. The importance of getting to the Europa League final, keeping their hopes of winning a trophy alive and qualifying for next season's Champions League cannot be understated.",
      "United were lucky not to fall behind against Athletic last week and Amorim noted, admitting after after the game that he needed to \"think more about the first 20 minutes than the rest of the game\".",
      "His pre-match comments were a reminder to his players that they can ill-afford to let the guard down on a night of such importance."

      "The Premier League side suffered defeats at both the Emirates Stadium and Parc des Princes in their clashes, and Evra was clearly watching on as he took to X at full-time to issue a video discussing his thoughts on Arsenal's fans.",
      "\"I feel sorry for Arsenal,\" he said. \"People are being really hard on them. I love Arteta - Mikel is a good friend.",
      "\"I think people have no problem with the actual Arsenal players, people have a problem with their fans. They believe anything, you know?",
      "\"I even say I'm not sure I would do business with an Arsenal fan because they will promise you a lot of things but it will never shape,\" Man United's former 14-time trophy-winner commented on the rival fanbase.",
      "Before the season started the Gunners were the favourites to claim the Premier League title this season but have lost out to Liverpool, now having been dumped out of Europe and all domestic cup competitions, they've gone trophy-less for a fifth year running.",
      "At this point the Frenchman's message took a strange turn.",
      "Referring to a past comment he made about Arsenal 'always waiting for next season', he continued: \"We talk about the Netflix, Netflix season 21 is on it's way and they start recording, but it's you guys.",
      "\"And this is banter because people will say I'm anti-Gunners - I love Arsenal and first of all, you can't hate your babies, it's impossible.",
      "\"I think I define, an example is like imagine you have a good time with your wife, with your girlfriend or fiancee and you enjoy it. You enjoy it. Oh la la.\"",
      "For any downtrodden Gunners he added: \"I'm sorry, it's not like I'm trying to create a beef with you guys but I love you.",
      "\"Let's get ready for the next season and I hope for you United, Tottenham or Chelsea doesn't win a trophy this year because it's going to be terrible,\" and signed off with his catchphrase: \"I love this game!\"",
      "As well as United, Spurs are in prime position to qualify for this season's Europa League final whilst other rivals Chelsea also have one foot in the Europa Conference League final."

      "For a club boasting the kind of record of producing academy talent that Manchester United do, the idea they might need to consider contract decisions to fulfil Premier League and UEFA squad rules would normally sound fanciful.",
      "But as they consider offering third-choice goalkeeper Tom Heaton a 12-month contract extension, there is a degree of pragmatism in the decision ahead of a summer when a number of academy players could see their future come into sharper focus.",
      "There is sense in offering Heaton a deal into his 40s anyway. He is a reliable goalkeeper, with relatively low mileage in recent years, offers plenty of experience and is considered something of a dressing room leader at Carrington.",
      "Having come through the ranks at the club more than two decades ago, he is also an academy graduate. That brings not only an understanding of how the club operates as well as an insight into the standards required under Sir Alex Ferguson, but also the status of a home grown player under Premier League and UEFA rules.",
      "If United want to name a full 25-man squad in the Premier League next season, they must have eight players occupying home grown status (this season they had seven). To name a 25-man squad in a European competition, they also need eight home grown players, but four of those must be 'club-trained', which means they must have been on the club's books for at least three years between the age of 15 and 21.",
      "This season, United occupied those four slots with Heaton, Dermot Mee, Jonny Evans and Marcus Rashford. They named Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho on the B list, but could promote them to the A list to meet the club-trained criteria if required.",
      "In the Premier League there are no rules about club-trained players, and this season Evans, Heaton, Harry Maguire, Mee, Mason Mount, Rashford and Luke Shaw filled the seven home grown slots. Mainoo and Garnacho could again supplement this list, as could Harry Amass and Toby Collyer.",
      "The issue for United ahead of a potentially busy summer transfer window is that a lot of these players face uncertain futures, especially when it comes to that smaller group of club-trained players. That would only be an issue if United win the Europa League and need to name a squad for the Champions League next season, but that is now a realistic prospect and requires planning for.",
      "Of the quartet that filled those slots this season, Mee will turn 23 in November and is yet to get a look in at first-team level. He is only going to be fourth-choice goalkeeper next season if he stays at the club. Evans is set to leave when his contract expires this summer and Rashford is set to be sold after his loan at Aston Villa.",
      "There is also uncertainty over the future of Mainoo and Garnacho. United were open to offers for both in January as they looked to raise funds to reinvest and as academy graduates their sales would be considered as pure profit under the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability rules (PSR).",
      "Mainoo is yet to agree terms over a contract extension and Garnacho had interest from Chelsea and Napoli this summer. His performances have improved under Ruben Amorim but there is competition for places in the No. 10 roles and he is not yet considered a natural fit in the Portuguese's 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "If Evans, Rashford and even one of Mainoo and Garnacho depart, that could leave United light on club-trained players. That's the extra context that might make a decision to keep Heaton a sensible one.",
      "It's rare that third-choice goalkeepers end up playing an active role on the pitch, but for training and squad purposes, clubs not want an experienced player in that role. Heaton fits that brief, as well as offering United the chance to fill an academy graduate spot in squads.",

      "Ruben Amorim's side are 3-0 up in the semi-final tie after a comfortable win in the Basque Country last week, but Amorim will be cautious and knows the job must be finished on Thursday.",

      "The new tifo banner design was approved by fan groups and United captain Bruno Fernandes, and the design will remain secret until it is unveiled just minutes before kick-off on Thursday.",
      "In an interview with club media, Casemiro praised United supporters and said: “They always support us. Whether we are playing well or badly. To be honest, this season, we aren’t where we wanted to be. We aren’t where we want to be in the league. But when I get home, I speak with my family or my inner circle about what the fans are like here.",
      "“Here, even when you aren’t playing well, and you aren’t where you want to be and there are lots of changes or problems... what the fans do here at this club, they always support you; they push us and help us. All I can say, from my heart, is thank you very much.",
      "“If they didn’t support us like they do, it would be even more difficult, so the thing we have to say to everyone who comes to games here and to the whole city is, it’s something incredible. All I can say is thank you, thank you very much.”"

      "Bilbao will be without defender Dani Vivian for the fixture after the centre-back was shown a red card in the first leg at the San Mames Stadium. Vivian will serve a suspension, which will cover the semi-final second leg and leave him unavailable to face United.",
      "Valverde could turn to Aitor Paredes as the replacement for Vivian in defence. Paredes was introduced by Bilbao from the bench just a few minutes after Vivian was shown a red card against United last week.",
      "Nico Williams is a doubt for Bilbao after the forward missed the draw with Real Sociedad in La Liga at the weekend and was not in training on Monday. The Spain international was substituted in the 79th minute in the first leg against United but has been dealing with an ongoing groin injury for the last few weeks.",
      "Bilbao could also be without midfielder Oihan Sancet, who has been sidelined for the last couple of weeks and missed the reverse fixture in Spain. It remains to be seen if Sancet will be available to face United in the second leg, having missed training on Monday."

      "The veteran shot-stopper had been weighing up his future with his current deal due to expire at the end of this season, but his playing career could now be prolonged with the expectation that United will offer him a 12-month deal.",
      "There had been an expectation that Heaton would leave the club this summer and he was weighing up whether to hang up his gloves or look to extend his playing career elsewhere, but he is open to another season at his boyhood club.",
      "The former England goalkeeper, who turned 39 in April, could even move into a coaching role at the club when he does decide to end his playing career.",
      "Heaton came through the youth ranks at United more than 20 years ago and after leaving to build a successful Premier League career with Burnley and Aston Villa, he returned on a free transfer in the summer of 2021.",
      "He has remained third-choice since then, making just three first-team appearances, as well as playing for the Under-21s in the EFL Trophy earlier this season.",
      "He is a popular member of the dressing room, however, and has been part of the leadership group, with his experience valued by Erik ten Hag and now Ruben Amorim. Heaton has also struck up a friendship with club captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The decision to look at extending his deal hints at the uncertainty in the goalkeeping department at Old Trafford this summer, with the futures of Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir a little uncertain.",
      "Onana is two years into his Old Trafford career after his £47million move from Inter, but he is yet to totally convince and has had a difficult campaign this year. There is interest in the 29-year-old from Saudi Pro League clubs although there has been no indication at this stage that United are ready to sell and look for a new No. 1.",
      "Bayindir has made eight appearances this season, having featured just once in his first season at the club following a £4.2million move from Fenerbahce.",
      "He has struggled to challenge Onana, however, and has conceded four goals in three of his eight starts this season. The 27-year-old is expected to look for a move to secure first-team football this season.",
      "That could leave United on the look-out for a second-choice goalkeeper this season and potentially someone to lay down a greater challenge to Onana, so keeping Heaton around for an extra year will at least provide some continuity, with clubs keen to keep three experienced goalkeepers on their books."

      "Manchester United have sent Torino into a ‘panic’ over goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic after Fabrizio Romano revealed ‘initial contacts’ have been held over his summer transfer.",
      "United are scouring the market for alternatives to Andre Onana and Altay Bayindir after a difficult season for the stoppers at Old Trafford.",
      "A number of high-profile errors from Onana, most notably in the Europa League first leg against Lyon, led to Amorim dropping the Cameroon international from the starting XI, with his understudy failing to convince between the sticks either.",
      "And transfer expert Romano told GIVEMESPORT this week that Milinkovic-Savic has emerged as a potential option after an outstanding season for Torino.",
      "‘Manchester United are preparing an important summer transfer window with several movements expected. It’s not only Matheus Cunha as the club has started making contact over other potential targets ahead of the upcoming months.",
      "‘One of the positions to follow will surely be the goalkeeper; it’s not an urgent priority compared to other positions in the team, but for sure it is one of many roles Man United want to cover in the summer.",
      "‘Torino goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic has recently been added to the list at Man United also with initial contacts made to explore a potential summer move, based on the price tag wanted by the Italian club for their Serbian goalkeeper.’",
      "The 28-year-old has a release clause of just €20m (£17m) which applies to foreign clubs, and Italian outlet Tuttomercatoweb has confirmed the Red Devils’ interest while revealing the club’s owner, Urbana Cairo, is now in a state of ‘panic’ as he pushes for the goalkeeper to sign a new deal at the club.",
      "‘The Red Devils, in fact, carried out the first surveys, well aware that in the Serbian contract there is a clause of around 20 million euros valid only for abroad.",
      "‘That’s why President Cairo wants to sit around the table with Milinkovic-Savic as soon as possible: the goal is to find a new agreement to remove, or at least raise it to higher figures, this sword of Damocles.’",
      "The report offers United a boost in their bid to sign Milinkovic-Savic by revealing that Torino are currently looking at options to replace the 6ft 8in star, including former Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius, whose Schalke contract expires this summer, and Sampdoria’s Jonathan Klinsmann.",
      "Chelsea and Manchester United have also been credited with interest, but United may hold the advantage having signed Milinkovic-Savic back in 2014, only for the then teenager to be released due to a work permit issue."

      "Alejandro Garnacho admits he “listens to some rumours about the future” amid Manchester United exit reports and claims Ruben Amorim’s arrival mid-season made things “difficult”.",
      "Garnacho has been linked with a move to Chelsea or Napoli this summer after both clubs showed previous interest in the forward, with United reportedly demanding at least £65million for the 20-year-old.",
      "Responding to the reports ahead of his side’s crunch clash against Athletic Club in the Europa League, Garnacho said: “Obviously as a footballer you read and listen to some rumours about the future, but I have a contract here until 2028. I am happy here.",
      "“We know we have to work hard here to be even in the squad and I just have to train well every day and I will be available for all the games.”",
      "United are languishing in 15th place in the Premier League after a miserable domestic season which has seen them win just ten of their 35 games.",
      "Erik ten Hag was replaced by Amorim in November but the results and performances have if anything deteriorated following the Portuguese manager’s arrival.",
      "Amorim has stuck rigidly to his philosophy and Garnacho has been one of many players who have struggled to adapt.",
      "“I think it’s difficult for everyone when, in the middle of the season, a new manager comes in and we change the formation,” Garnancho explained. “But we just need to follow the rules and I try to improve every day.",
      "“Obviously, the manager knows the characteristics of the players. You see the games, too many times I play, for example, wide on the wing and the wing back is coming inside. What we try to do depends on the players we have and we are improving as a team also.",
      "“It’s a little bit hard but it’s just the mentality. My first two months, November and December were very difficult for me but my mentality is to keep working, to keep trying and show to the manager and staff I have to play.”",

      "With the Argentina international not celebrating his birthday until July, there’s every chance he can equal or even surpass the United legend, but Garnacho insists he’s only focused on improving to help his team.",
      "But, for now, Garnacho is concentrating on the here and now, as United prepare for the Europa League second leg against Athletic Club at Old Trafford.",
      "“I’m not focused on the numbers. I think when Cristiano played here, he was a different footballer, [they were] a different type of games,” he said, at Wednesday’s press conference. “I just try to help the team and try to win games.",
      "“Obviously, yeah, on missed chances and things like this, we are training really hard, me, Rasmus [Hojlund] and all the strikers in the team, so I think we are improving and we will try to do better.”",
      "United won their first leg 3-0 in Bilbao and have a great chance of reaching the Europa League final and Garnacho says he’s working hard with Hojlund – who’s been particularly poor in front of goal this season – to improve their output.",
      "“I speak with him a lot. We try to help each other,” he added. “Sometimes, from this side, it’s difficult but we try hard, try harder every game to try to score more of these chances, and the team will improve if we score more goals.",
      "“We know that we are not doing a great job in the Premier League. But the manager said before that we have followed the rules and tomorrow is a final, and we will face it like it is 0-0.",
      "“If we win the Europa League, we will be in the Champions League and we will face next season with a different mentality and in a different way.”",

      "We haven’t updated the manager rankings for a bit, so we’re sneaking a quick update – you know, just the 7000 or so words – before doing a full and proper job on it when the season ends.",
      "It is, of course, the most scientific and rigorous of endeavours so if you find yourself disagreeing with anyone’s placing simply know and understand you just aren’t as clever as the supercomputer we pumped full of data to deliver results absolutely none of which are as silly as when we accidentally had Kieran McKenna seventh last time.",
      "You can read that malfunction and the rest of the last update here if you absolutely must, but the TL;DR placings are in the brackets below.",
      "",
      "30) Erik Ten Hag, Man United August-October (28)\nShould obviously have been sacked in the summer, could very easily have been sacked after either of the two grimmest thrashings – Liverpool and Spurs – and arguably most compellingly of all should have gone after trying to convince himself and the world that a 0-0 draw at Crystal Palace was evidence of anything much at all about his future prospects.",
      "As we said after he was eventually put out of our collective misery last year:",
      "As is very often the case for a flailing manager – especially at the biggest clubs – he is not really the biggest problem but nor does he show any hint of being in any way part of a possible solution.",
      "The football is uninspiring and, much as we hate the phrase, increasingly small time. Ten Hag’s confidence has shrunk to the point that he no longer feels able to take his team to a place like Aston Villa and do anything more than cling grimly to the 0-0 he started with.",
      "There are teams where you can justifiably point to hard-earned, backs-to-the-wall goalless draws at Crystal Palace and Aston Villa as evidence that you know what you are doing and are going to get the job done, but Manchester United surely cannot ever be one of those clubs.",
      "The irony, of course, is that a man who spent a large part of the second half of his United managerial career desperately insisting that results be ignored finally did get the tin-tack after a result that on its own probably could have been ignored.",
      "Given the chances United missed – Diogo Dalot’s in particular was one for the all-time list and probably not really Ten Hag’s fault if we’re being fair about it – and the genuine absurdity of the penalty that eventually settled it, there is a strong case to be made that West Ham 2-1 Man United is the most easily dismissed result in the Premier League since Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool.",
      "It wasn’t quite as abysmal a bit of officiating as that one, but it was arguably worse because a) it came so late in the piece and b) represented VAR actively changing a perfectly fine decision rather than a failure – however ludicrous – to overturn an error that already existed.",
      "But when you have somehow come out the other side of at least four clear sacking windows as Ten Hag so obviously had, the sympathy that exists for getting the boot during an altogether more opaque one can only be very limited indeed. He had to go, and even United’s struggles to adapt to life under Ruben Amorim don’t really offer much vindication for Ten Hag given that so much of that struggle is down to the squad rot – both in personnel and mindset – that was allowed to fester during his time.",
      "",
      "29) Ivan Juric, Southampton, December-April (27)\nBeing both appointed and sacked by two clubs during one season is novel, even for a manager who has now had nine managerial jobs and lasted less than 50 games in seven of them, including all three of his spells as Genoa manager between June 2016 and December 2018.",
      "No wonder he had itchy feet after three whole seasons at Torino, who he left last summer before taking over at Roma in September, being sacked in November, then taking over at Southampton in December before again being sacked in April. Slightly disappointing he hasn’t managed to squeeze in another job in Italy before the season finishes, if we’re being brutally honest.",
      "His Southampton reign was a failure, obviously. But it didn’t have to be quite so hefty a failure, surely. Not managing to save them from themselves is one thing, being really no better than Martin in any significantly measurable way and statistically inferior to Simon Rusk, the caretaker who preceded and followed him, is not a good look.",
      "",
      "28) Russell Martin, Southampton, August-November (26)\nYou can’t blame a guy for trying, can you? Having sat and watched Vincent Kompany brazenly and above all successfully place his own career prospects several levels above Burnley’s survival prospects last season, you can forgive Russell Martin for wanting a slice of that pie having surprised many by steering Southampton back to the top flight.",
      "The problem is that Southampton were even less suited to trying to Pepball their way around the Barclays than Burnley. Burnley had at least cruised through the Championship in dominant fashion; Southampton scraped up through the play-offs after an end to the season in which even a relegation-haunted Huddersfield had scared the living sh*t out of them.",
      "And lo it came to pass that Southampton were not capable of passing Premier League sides to death. There is a wider point here about wanting to do this.",
      "It’s something that now-established teams like Brighton and Brentford didn’t do when they first came up. They showed the Barclays some damn respect. These days everyone wants everything instantly, and these teams and managers think they can just saunter on in here and started passing out from the back from day one.",
      "The utter and total failure of Southampton and Martin, who we fear remains unlikely to be the next manager of Bayern Munich despite his impeccable credentials, should at least serve as a warning to others.",
      "READ: Promoted clubs’ predictable relegation is a further sign the Premier League has broken English football",

      "27) Julen Lopetegui, West Ham August-January (25)\nGetting rid of David Moyes in the hope of finding something a bit more proactive and enjoyable and then replacing him with the Spanish Moyes was always an interesting choice from a club that deals almost exclusively in interesting choices, but it’s still been striking to watch just how badly it’s gone and in such Moyesian fashion.",
      "The worst of Moyes’ West Ham were so, so similar to the worst of Lopetegui’s: unnecessarily painful to watch given the talent available, but also and more damningly utterly ineffectively painful to watch. The 4-1 defeat at Man City was the ninth league game out of 20 this season in which the Hammers had conceded at least three goals.",
      "It could only ever end one way, and given how bad West Ham have been you do almost have to hand it to the way the people running that club managed to make Lopetegui look like a wounded victim by making such a complete bollocks of his very necessary departure. Sacking managers is part of the game, but you can still do it with some dignity and grace.",
      "Making the poor sod take training on the morning of a day he knows is going to be his last was just deeply weird, deeply unpleasant behaviour. It makes no sense unless viewed as some kind of desperate ploy to enrage Lopetegui to the point that he might jump before they had to push him.",
      "",
      "26) Ben Dawson, Leicester, November-December (24)\nLeft Newcastle in the summer after 15 years in various academy and age-group coaching roles for a job on Steve Cooper’s coaching team at Leicester. Might have been an error. Named caretaker following Cooper’s departure, he oversaw a 4-1 defeat at Brentford before handing the reins to Ruud van Nistelrooy.",
      "",
      "25) Gary O’Neil, Wolves, August-December (23)\nAn apparent recovery on the back of two straight wins and a four-game unbeaten run in October and November crashed and burned spectacularly as Wolves lost three straight games, one of which involved the genuinely weirdly impressive achievement of conceding four goals to Everton.",
      "O’Neil’s job was very much on the line ahead of a home game with Ipswich, one that ended with a late winner for Wolves’ relegation rivals and star man Matheus Cunha getting fisty with stewards. So, on balance, a sub-optimal run of form and antics. It felt like the end. It was the end.",
      "And now we don’t really know what happens next for O’Neil. He’s a man who has now completed two genuinely impressive firefighting jobs from hospital passes (need a police reference here really don’t we, but buggered if we can think of one) at first Bournemouth and then Wolves. But having been replaced to such great effect at Bournemouth by Andoni Iraola and now having made a right bollocks of things at Wolves after his first stab at an actual pre-season of proper preparation he might just be a bit stuck.",
      "To make matters worse, he has now been even more swiftly and conspicuously outperformed by his replacement at Molineux than he was at the Vitality.",
      "There are presumably two kinds of jobs that now exist for O’Neil’s next foray. One, another desperate Premier League club enlists his proven relegation-avoiding credentials but that means waiting until someone like West Ham sh*t themselves with panic in around October.",
      "Two, and perhaps more likely, an upwardly-mobile ambitious Championship club tasks him with doing the ‘getting into the Premier League’ bit before his specialist subject of ‘staying in the Premier League’, which is now so difficult for promoted clubs that it is essentially witchcraft.",
      "What we do know for certain is that O’Neil will get the job on the back of some fine video screen analysis and Speaking Well, I Thought on Monday Night Football.",
      "",
      "24) Ruud van Nistelrooy, Leicester, December onwards (21)\nA fun little bit from this season has been Ruud van Nistelrooy being at the heart of both the best and worst bits of decision-making all season long.",
      "Manchester United haven’t got much right this year, but appointing a bona-fide club legend as interim manager to chuck in a few mood-boosting results before swiftly and correctly replacing him before it all went horribly sour – as all manner of subsequent evidence suggests it absolutely and entirely would have – suggests that at least someone somewhere at that daft club learned something from the Solskjaer years.",
      "One of the main reasons to doubt the sustainability of Van Nistelrooy’s United bounce was the fact that two of his four games and two of his three wins came against Leicester.",
      "This appears to have been a factor in Leicester’s decision to appoint him manager. Which at first glance appears understandable but only gets more weird the more you think about it. Why appoint a manager based on the fact he has proved he can beat you, when that is the one thing he can never, ever do in the job you’ve just given him?",
      "Although, we guess, actually he kind of did. He oversaw two games in which United beat Leicester while he was United boss, and then did the same again as Leicester boss. We should have expected no different.",
      "Hard to see him staying on for the attempt to get Leicester back into the Premier League next year, but if he does walk away he does so as the proud owner of one of the more compelling examples of The Joke Is Always On Spurs.",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s effort was so long and repetitive that even Stewart Lee might have rejected it, with 15 defeats scattered either side of Leicester’s 2-1 win at Spurs. After the two goals early in the second half of that one they abandoned goalscoring altogether for more than two months.",
      "That 16-match, four-months-in-the-making joke is also bookended by a pair of 2-2 draws with Brighton, which means that, we guess, the joke is also always a tiny bit on Brighton for some reason. Maybe needs some more digging, that one.",
      "READ: Ranking this season’s Premier League managerial changes from Vitor to Ruud",
      "",
      "23) Sean Dyche, Everton, August-January (20)\nThe last manager rankings were compiled just days before Everton gave Dyche the Spanish Archer, and if you’ll indulge us we would like to revel in this rare example of us having got the situation pretty much spot on.",
      "Current Sack Race favourite and you have to say that’s fair enough. There really isn’t any compelling excuse for Everton to be slumming it like this in a grimly miserable relegation scrap again, and if Dyche cannot build a coherent case that he’s the best man to keep them above the relegation waterline, then really what is the point?",
      "The belligerent run of spoiling draws against City, Arsenal and Chelsea is starting to look more and more like a defiant but futile last hurrah for Dyche’s particular brand of misery with Everton increasingly inclined to look elsewhere for a manager who might do more than drag them a point above the relegation zone with such misery-inducing football. Feels like for a club of Everton’s history and stature you might be able to get away with flirting with relegation and you might be able to get away with football that makes the ears bleed, but you can only do both for so long before it just becomes demeaning for all concerned.",
      "Everton finally losing their long and proudly-held top-tier record the precise moment they move into a shiny new stadium is just far too Everton a piece of behaviour to be ruled out, and it does look more and more like it might need a change of direction, a change of mood, and a change of manager to prevent that nightmare scenario becoming horrifyingly real.",
      "What Everton have subsequently achieved under David Moyes – even if the new manager bounce has inevitably lost a bit of air from its glorious early days – damns Dyche further.",
      "He really did have them in a full-blown relegation scrap, in this Premier League season of all Premier League seasons, and wasn’t even going about it in entertaining fashion.",
      "",
      "22) Steve Cooper, Leicester August-November (22)\n‘Nobody is currently talking about Steve Cooper’ we chirped in November. Turns out we just weren’t listening. He was gone within days, with nobody much happy with the sufferball on offer even though it was keeping Leicester very much afloat in a choppy and complicated relegation fight.",
      "The timing of his dismissal was odd, coming as it did after a narrow defeat to Chelsea straight after the international break that rather indicated he was already done for and a new manager could have been given a bit more time during that break to get his feet under the desk.",
      "All became clearer, mind, when Ruud van Nistelrooy – who only completed his interim duties at Manchester United at said international break – was the man anointed as the saviour of Leicester’s season just after inflicting a couple of sizeable blows upon it with the Foxes’ relegation rivals United.",
      "It went… poorly.",
      "",
      "21) Graham Potter, West Ham, January onwards (15)\nFeels like a much better post-Moyes fit for the Hammers than Julen Lopetegui ever did, and we retain hope that it will all work out in the end. But uncomfortably and unavoidably true it is not working out currently for a team whose current eight-game run without a win includes the twin embarrassments of home draws against both Southampton and a barely-interested Spurs.",
      "Potter should be better than this. West Ham should be better than this. They are currently just about the only team really giving the incoming promoted sides hope that the story of the last couple of seasons can change.",
      "And that’s a pretty embarrassing state of affairs for both club and manager. The start of a season is obviously always important for all sorts of managers for all sorts of reasons, but those early weeks of next season right now feel more important for Potter than anyone else in this league.",
      "",
      "20) Kieran McKenna, Ipswich (7)\nSeventh? Ahem. Sorry about that. A giddiness that we are now attributing to a desperate desire for at least one of the promoted trio to give survival a real shot. Even back in January it was clear Ipswich offered the best/only hope of that, but they too have ultimately come up well short.",
      "It does feel like over the season as a whole they have been more consistently more competitive than the other two, and unlike both Leicester and Southampton there is a decent body of evidence to go with a gut feel that they still have the right man in charge to try and earn them another chance back in the top flight next season.",
      "Luton remain the warning from history there, but for now McKenna has just about emerged from this season with reputation intact if not perhaps enhanced in the way he might have hoped or expected.",
      "",
      "19) Ange Postecoglou, Tottenham (19)\nOne of two potential absolute noodle-scratchers when the final rankings are put together a month from now.",
      "But while it is Ruben Amorim who insists winning the Europa League cannot save United’s season, it’s really Postecoglou for whom it feels more of a sticking plaster over a gaping wound.",
      "It’s not to say it wouldn’t be a huge achievement – and Spurs’ recent performances in the latter stages of the competition have been pretty compelling – and it would absolutely be a huge deal for Spurs as a whole.",
      "But could it or should it save Postecoglou? We’re really not sure it should. If the Europa League efforts offer some mitigation for both the poor recent league results and the shoddiness of the returns during their injury crisis, they also damn Postecoglou as well.",
      "Because it should never have got that bad during the injury problems and it should never have remained this bad when the injured players returned, Europa distractions or no Europa distractions.",
      "There’s also the sticky issue of how and why he’s been able to coax such whole-hearted performances out of this squad on Europa League nights but not in the Premier League.",
      "United and Spurs have probably benefited from the presence of each other in the same unexpected area of the league table this season, each serving to normalise the ridiculousness of the other.",
      "But it is Postecoglou who has less excuse for being there. He’s in the second full season of his plan, and the fact a 17th-place finish remains entirely possible is a stain that not even winning the Europa could or should wash away entirely.",
      "Tottenham’s league form has now been absolutely rotten for a strikingly long time; since the heady days of those first 10 games of last season in which Ange’s swashbucklers picked up eight wins and two draws they’ve managed only 78 points from 63 games, very nearly half of which have been lost.",
      "To put that in full perspective; those first 10 games of last season still account for a quarter of all Postecoglou’s Premier League points. Even including that run with its eight wins and no defeats he has still has just as many losses as wins in the Premier League.",
      "Winning the Europa League might still save his job for now, especially with Spurs’ much-discussed record when it comes to such things, but we will be staggered if he starts 2026 as Spurs manager.",
      "",
      "18) Ruben Amorim, Manchester United, November onwards (18)\nThe pure absurdity of the Europa League run is doing a lot of heavy lifting and the fact we’ve now reached the point where United winning it and thus securing a third silverware-winning season in a row despite being increasingly dreadful has just about tipped over from possibility to probability is absolutely wild.",
      "But this remains one of the most clear-cut cautionary tales this division has ever served up. Man United got it wrong last summer and Amorim got it wrong in failing to call United’s bluff when they insisted it was now or never in November. He should have stayed with Sporting like he wanted to, and backed himself to have opportunities at least as good as this one – even very probably this precise one – come the summer.",
      "He could also absolutely have shown at least hints of flexibility in acknowledging the squad was not up to the challenge of what he would be demanding.",
      "It’s not his fault that United’s squad was left technically, physically and mentally weak by previous managers and regimes, but it is still his fault that he didn’t recognise that at the outset or accept the reality of it during the season.",
      "The sheer incompetence of the teams below United has prevented things becoming even worse, but his Premier League record is miserable and it’s going to take one heck of a summer to offer any meaningful resolution. The full rebuild required is going to take at least a couple more windows beyond that.",
      "The Europa League run has been spectacularly entertaining throughout, but the starkest of facts is in that league form. United have won only twice since January, against Ipswich and Leicester. If next season begins anything like the way this one is ending, Amorim will be in big trouble very quickly and that silverware will not save him.",
      "",
      "17) Simon Rusk, Southampton, December and April onwards (17)\nHis two brief interim stints have delivered over 18 per cent of Southampton’s Premier League points this season and 50 per cent of their clean sheets in 13 per cent of their games, thus making Rusk – stopgap between Russell Martin’s egocentric Kompany-lite stylings and whatever it is Ivan Juric was attempting to achieve and now between Juric and whatever comes next – comfortably Southampton’s most impressive manager of the season.",
      "Had Rusk been manager for the whole season it is a clear statistical certainty that they would now have 15 points and left Derby for dust. Undeniable facts.",
      "",
      "16) Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman, Everton, January (NE)\nOne hundred per cent record after a 2-0 FA Cup third-round win over League One strugglers Peterborough in a sole game in charge before David Moyes’ glorious return, you’ll never sing that.",
      "",
      "15) Mikel Arteta, Arsenal (13)\nThis is going to be a season that contains all manner of awkward questions that will require addressing. Especially when it’s a season that carries still the prospect of Arsenal finishing third (or worse…) in a two-horse race and having to watch all the clubs joining them in the Champions League next season win silverware.",
      "Liverpool have a trophy. Newcastle have a trophy. Chelsea will probably have a trophy. Man City will probably have a trophy. And most humiliatingly of all, either Spurs or Man United will almost certainly have a trophy.",
      "It doesn’t spell the end of Arteta by any stretch, and we’ve talked before about just how hard it is to put together three title-challenging seasons in a row. It might well be that this was always Arsenal’s fallow season and it’s just the inadequacy of others that kept them artificially and deceptively high in the table.",
      "But there has been a clear regression in their league form, with a lack of the clinical ability to get the job done that marked them out as the real deal in the second half of last season. Points have been frittered carelessly and consistently with the injury problems providing at best partial mitigation only.",
      "It all makes next season feel like a decisive one for Arteta and his – still worth remembering, this – enormously ambitious plan to restore Arsenal to the summit of English football after a couple of decades away.",
      "It is not easy, this season has provided more questions than answers and exposed some familiar failings.",
      "",
      "14) Ruud van Nistelrooy, Man United, October-November (10)\nYeah, that genuinely went brilliantly well. Credit to everyone here. If we were going to have a four-match reign as Manchester United manager, what we’d do is to make sure that all four of those matches were at home and, ideally, two of them against Leicester and another against PAOK in the Europa League. Get some lovely fat wins under the belt.",
      "But let’s not pretend United would have won those three games as straightforwardly under Erik Ten Hag (or, it must now be conceded, Ruben Amorim) as they did under Ruud. It’s not really Ten Hag’s fault, but everything had become extremely stressful by that point. Absolutely nothing was coming easily, and maybe one of those three games might have been straightforward. But at least one would have been harrowing.",
      "And perhaps the most impressive result of Van Nistelrooy’s reign was the one game he didn’t win, with a 1-1 draw against Chelsea giving us far more information than some easy wins over dreck.",
      "Essentially, though, it was the perfect interim stint. It’s had all the positives of the initial Ole caretaker spell, with the instant mood-lifting morale boost of seeing a bona fide club legend in the hotseat, without any of the unpleasantness of mistakenly leaving him there for another two years after that initial buzz had entirely worn off.",
      "",
      "13) Oliver Glasner, Crystal Palace (14)\nA curious Premier League season in which Glasner’s side won none of their first eight games and now none of their most recent five means that they might somehow still fall short of that apparently impenetrable 50-point mark despite a run of 34 points in 17 games between December and early April. They now need a ticklish four points from games against Tottenham, Wolves and Liverpool if they are to raise their bat.",
      "But none of that will matter at all if Glasner can become the first Crystal Palace manager to win a major honour in the FA Cup final against a Man City side who despite recent improvements remain distinctly vulnerable.",
      "",
      "12) Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton (11)\nLook, this is probably still more of a Brighton thing than a Hurzeler thing but at some point they are simply going to have to decide whether they are any good or not. Until they make up their minds about this, how on earth are any of the rest of us supposed to do so?",
      "",
      "11) Pep Guardiola, Man City (16)\nExtremely plausible that this season now ends with a second-place league finish and a trophy. Which would be one heck of an outcome for a season that flirted for a serious amount of time with genuine disaster.",
      "At their lowest pre-Christmas ebb, City and Guardiola both appeared broken in a way that was dizzyingly unfixable. We’re still not truly convinced he’s fully recovered despite the improvement of results trending back towards something approaching City normality over recent months.",
      "We still feel like this is a season that has pushed him closer to the City exit door rather than convinced him he should hang around to build a new team to go again against Liverpool and Arsenal and whoever else can manage to put together more than a half-season’s worth of results.",
      "The impending departure of Kevin De Bruyne means the loss of another key stabilising, familiar reference point in Guardiola’s City adventure, and for so many reasons next season feels like one that holds more uncertainty for City than just about any other during his outrageously successful reign.",
      "",
      "10) David Moyes, Everton, January onwards (NE)\nPretty mad that we haven’t actually done an update since Moyes’ glorious homecoming to Everton, but it’s been one of the division’s more compelling good-news stories this year.",
      "The new-manager bounce is a real and unignorable phenomenon, but rarely have its effects been more pronounced than during that five-game, 13-point run just after Moyes’ came back to Goodison after 10 often difficult years away.",
      "The whole mood of the club was utterly transformed as the dread fear of relegation and losing that cherished and tightly held top-flight status just before moving into their stunning new ground gripped Everton fans.",
      "At the very least it appeared certain they faced another agonising end to the season in which relegation if it was to be averted would only be dismissed as a prospect late in the season.",
      "Instead it was pretty much off the table by mid-February with Everton instead allowed to spend the last few months giving their grand old ground the proper farewell it deserves without any of those intrusive thoughts about the worst-case scenario.",
      "Even if the highs of those early weeks have faded slightly among a flurry of draws – it’s now six and a solitary win in Everton’s last 10 games – the key work for this season at least had been done.",
      "Now, of course, for the next step. There is no plausible Everton manager more deserving, more worthy of taking them into their new life at their new ground. No manager who could more fully understand everything it means.",
      "But there remain few guarantees about how it will all pan out.",
      "",
      "9) Thomas Frank, Brentford (9)\nFrank is going to remain a top-10 staple for just about any next manager market worth the trouble but we remain entirely wedded to the idea that this is a club and manager in perfect harmony and the idea of either party risking their serendipitous relationship on something flashier is fraught with danger.",
      "It’s probably inevitable at some point, but it’s not something we like to think too hard about. In keeping with the other teams currently jockeying for positions 8 to 11 in the final table, it feels like theirs has been a season that doesn’t really deserve a bottom-half finish even though the cruel reality of maths demand that be somebody’s fate when the music stops.",
      "",
      "8) Enzo Maresca, Chelsea (5)\nIt’s not perhaps a satisfactory conclusion, but the one we find ourselves drawing is that Chelsea is simply a place where stuff happens and these days the manager is as much a passenger or bystander as anyone else.",
      "It doesn’t quite seem fair to heap either praise or derision on the fella trying to steer a course through the season at a club that spends so lavishly yet haphazardly.",
      "Maresca has made many mistakes, as a man with his lack of top-level experience was always likely to, but he’s got a lot right as well.",
      "And the fact that when the Champions League spot they had pretty much held all season came under pressure they have responded with a run of 20 points in nine games while remaining on track in the Conference isn’t to be sniffed at.",
      "In summary: Maresca is neither as good as his best nor as bad as his worst. Nothing means anything. It’s all just a bunch of stuff that happened.",
      "",
      "7) Marco Silva, Fulham (8)\nHis side just seem to have run out of puff a bit since the international break, and that’s a shame because until then Fulham appeared to have a very plausible chance to do something extraordinary.",
      "They have even in a weary phase that has delivered a crushing FA Cup defeat and four losses in six Premier League games still managed a thrilling win over Liverpool when that was still at least theoretically meaningful to all concerned.",
      "But it does now look like another mid-table finish for a club and manager that have finished 10th and 13th in the last two years. Again, there’s nothing wrong with that and none of the teams promoted since Fulham were joined by Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest two years has managed anything like it, but finishing 11th would now represent something of a disappointment given where they were and what seemed possible not that long ago.",
      "",
      "6) Unai Emery, Aston Villa (6)\nA tricky one now. Has that PSR-baiting January window been justified by what’s followed? This has been a season that has delivered memories for a lifetime, with Villa’s run to the Champions League quarter-finals an eye-catching one that remained thrilling to the very last moment.",
      "Villa fans have seen things they could surely never have expected to see at Villa Park with Marco Asensio and Marcus Rashford combining to give the club a hefty nudge into the second half of the season.",
      "But the likelihood now is that they will finish the season outside even the expanded Champions League places, without the silverware that other similarly equipped clubs will have to show for the campaign and with a sense that what they’ve built this season has been done ever so slightly on sand.",
      "That thumping defeat in the FA Cup semi-final is a really bruising one for Villa. And the way their season ends, with games against Tottenham and Man United, feels strangely apt too. Both clubs will offer a reminder that things could be so much worse, but one will also awkwardly show how things could also have ended up so much better.",
      "",
      "5) Andoni Iraola, Bournemouth (4)\nWe are acutely aware that there is little more annoying to fans of ‘smaller’ clubs than constant media narratives about anyone doing well with them heading off to one of the ‘bigger’ clubs. You only have to look at how upset Liverpool fans are about Trent Alexander-Arnold right now to see that.",
      "We take no joy in prodding at that sore spot and therefore apologise in advance here, but… of all the managers currently overperforming as manager of one of the Premier League’s burgeoning ‘middle-class’ clubs Iraola is the one we’d most like to see take the step up soon.",
      "Because we’re pretty sure he’s the most interesting. We’re pretty sure he’s the one with the greatest variety of possible outcomes.",
      "Placed in charge of one of the bigger beasts might bring the best or worst elements of his work to the surface. Or they might just continue to co-exist as they do now, only with attention shifting inevitably and inexorably to the dodgier parts.",
      "He’s been Bournemouth manager for two years now, and across that time they have almost always resembled either a team that could and should challenge for Europe or one that could and should be battling relegation. There is very little middle-ground.",
      "This is a team that completed a league double over Arsenal yet lost at home to Ipswich. A team that beat Newcastle and Nottingham Forest in successive weeks by an aggregate score of 9-1 to stretch their unbeaten run to 11 Premier League games and yet two months later found themselves on a run of one win (against Southampton…) in their next eight.",
      "In the last month alone they have suffered such embarrassments as failing to beat either West Ham or Man United, yet gone to the Emirates and prevailed.",
      "Their last three matches are against Aston Villa, Man City and Leicester and absolutely any result feels as likely as any other in any of those matches.",
      "And all of that is broadly fine at Bournemouth but brings a fascinating and chaotic dynamic to any club higher up the food chain.",
      "Essentially our point with Iraola is this: the exact season he’s produced for Bournemouth to great acclaim this season would be considered among the Spursiest things ever recorded if he were to repeat it at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium next season.",
      "For his own sanity and career he should not take that job, but we can’t help wondering what goes off if he does.",
      "",
      "4) Vitor Pereira, Wolves, December onwards (12)\nHas triggered an astonishing transformation in Wolves’ fortunes given the mess he inherited from Gary O’Neil.",
      "That start – nine points from the first 16 games of the season – ensured Wolves would be the last team to successfully extract themselves from the biggest non-event in Premier League relegation fight history, but when it happened it happened with absurd speed.",
      "It’s entirely true that Wolves’ squad is not one that should have been in the mess that it was, but nor was it one that could have been expected to so adroitly streak not just clear of the relegation zone but beyond the lower-mid-table stragglers like United, Spurs, Everton and West Ham into comfy mid-table.",
      "And as we’ve noted before: imagine the coverage both Pereira and O’Neil would be getting now had their stories this season been reversed.",
      "",
      "3) Eddie Howe, Newcastle (3)\nIn terms of neatly and effectively meeting a pre-season brief, there’s a strong argument that nobody can match Howe’s achievements this season with Newcastle. Sure, others have more obviously obliterated pre-season targets in thoroughly dramatic fashion, but we’re not sure anyone has taken the two obvious top objectives for a team this season and delivered in the manner of Newcastle.",
      "Back in the Champions League and ending English football’s most ridiculous trophy drought is special, special stuff. Sure, the wider media reaction to Newcastle winning the Carabao might have been too saccharine for most tastes, at times giving the impression that Newcastle had invented winning a trophy after not doing so for ages, at others journalists who have apparently never met a single real-life actual football fan expressing bafflement that all supporters of all clubs weren’t all overjoyed and thrilled about it.",
      "This generally took the form of ‘you just don’t understand what it means’ when the truth was ‘we all understand exactly what it means, we just don’t care as much as Newcastle fans do about it’. This really should be straightforward. Should, say, Tottenham win the Europa League there will be no equivalent media outpouring, no suggestion that if you aren’t as thrilled as Tottenham fans about it all that you simply don’t understand.",
      "So, to be clear: nobody is unclear about the scale and significance of that achievement for Eddie Howe and his team. Not least because even the standard ‘only a Carabao’ barbs struggle to land even more when you consider Newcastle’s run to that trophy.",
      "They took down four of the current top seven en route to glory, thoroughly outclassing Arsenal over two legs in the semi-final and then schooling Liverpool in the final.",
      "One can argue that those clubs had larger primary targets but neither was exactly phoning it in by that stage of the tournament either. And Newcastle beat them up.",
      "The final in particular was a spectacular performance and a huge personal triumph for Howe, who set his team up perfectly to nullify Liverpool’s huge threat at one end without ever curtailing their own attacking capabilities.",
      "The players delivered wonderfully, but this did feel like the manager’s success every bit as much. And for a manager with obvious talent but so little experience of such major finals, that was doubly impressive.",
      "Throw in the now very likely success of goal two – getting back in the Champions League – and you’ve got a manager who in any normal season would be a worthy favourite for manager of the year but in this one finds himself scrapping just to stay on the podium.",
      "",
      "2) Nuno Espirito Santo, Nottingham Forest (1)\nThere’s a risk that they might be running out of steam at just the wrong time, that a seemingly rock-solid grip on Champions League football might be lost on the run-in.",
      "Forest have won only twice since March in a run that has seen them slip to sixth in the league and go out of the FA Cup at the semi-final stage.",
      "And those two wins have been against Manchester United and Tottenham, and at this stage those barely count.",
      "But while we remain keen advocates of the idea that goals change across a season and relative failure can and should often still just be considered failure given the scale of the opportunity being passed up, sometimes you do have to step back and accept that ‘Nottingham Forest only finishing sixth’ would have been a simply batshit sentence to utter in August.",
      "And even more so when Nuno, his reputation in this country in tatters after The Tottenham Unpleasantness, took over a club mired in points deductions and facing relegation.",
      "Two wins at the back end of last season, against the even more stricken Sheffield United and Burnley, were enough to keep Forest up and they have taken that and run with it in remarkable fashion.",
      "Sure, there’s no doubt they’ve been assisted by an unusually high number of big clubs having absolute daftnesses, but they’ve still been hugely impressive.",
      "Forest are not a complicated team to understand, but that’s praiseworthy in itself. They know what they are, what their strengths are and how to get the absolute most out of that more often than not.",
      "Smart recruitment and canny coaching has produced a team more than the sum of its parts, and that’s really all anyone can reasonably ask any manager to produce in what is still less only a season and a half in charge.",
      "",
      "1) Arne Slot, Liverpool (2)\nIt’s very unfair but also true: it has ultimately proved quite hard not to end up using the sheer ease with which Slot has cracked the Premier League puzzle at the first attempt as a counter-intuitive caveat against his achievements this season.",
      "If anything, Clive, he’s almost won his first Premier League title too well.",
      "We’re guilty of it. We still don’t see Slot becoming the next great legacy manager, the next man to put together an era of dominance containing a string of league title a la Ferguson or Guardiola.",
      "We still can’t entirely shake the notion that this has all in some way been a last hurrah for Jurgen Klopp and his team rather than the start of something magical.",
      "And there’s every chance that is going to be made to look like utter foolishness.",
      "Nevertheless, a big part of why Slot’s impact and success might not be quite as hailed as it ought to be is that it’s been so obviously coming for so long that the failure to add any burnishing additional silverware feels vaguely disappointing because human brains are daft things that operate daftly.",
      "What he’s achieved has been staggering, and the easiest and fairest way to measure that is not to simply look just how far clear Liverpool have ended the season – because that really can end up working against them – but where everyone had them finishing when the season began.",
      "They fell away from the title race just as it really got going last season, and few were backing them to match even that under a new manager working largely with the squad he inherited.",
      "It’s been repeatedly and correctly pointed out that Klopp left a very decent squad – albeit one with a few huge contractual roadblocks in the very near distance – but still nobody outside stopped-clock ‘our year’ Liverpool fans really saw this coming.",
      "Just the simple fact the machinations around the Contract Three have never had any dread impact on the field is impressive. And, yes, getting Virgil van Dijk and Mo Salah to be really good is a little bit ‘I told him to do that’ but there have been plenty of new managers before who have come into a settled and successful dressing room and not achieved the level of buy-in from those players to new methods and new ways of doing things.",
      "Still, though, it remains the remodelled midfield that stands as Slot’s greatest achievement. He has elevated Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai to new levels. Each of them had obvious class before this season, but none had shown such a high level for such a sustained period in this league.",
      "It’s not hard to picture plenty of other higher profile managers coming in and finding those the available resources and spending six months whinging about it.",
      "Slot was having none of that, and really has felt like the absolutely ideal kind of coach to come in and take what was already there and provide the small tweaks here and adjustments there to make something even better.",
      "He has, in short, proved the ideal man to finish a necessary rebuild about which Klopp correctly deduced two things. One, that it had to happen but two, that he himself no longer retained the requisite energy to deliver it.",
      "Saying farewell to Klopp was hard, but he knew precisely what he was doing and Liverpool have already reaped the benefits of that.",
      "",
      "Presenter Gary Lineker has suggested that Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta’s decision against Paris Saint-Germain proves he doesn’t trust one of his players.",
      "The entire Arsenal squad has now been fully indoctrinated by Mikel Arteta and his ‘woe is me’ schtick. Declan Rice is now just making stuff up to excuse failure.",
      "Mikel Arteta gets a massive kicking after Arsenal came up short once again. Is this just Handsome Man Syndrome in the extreme?",
      "Arsene Wenger and Luis Enrique both disagreed with Mikel Arteta’s claim that Arsenal have been “the best team” in the Champions League this season.",
      "Plenty of decent options if Arsenal want to stick with the nearly-winning formula of Mikel Arteta and go with another Spanish midfielder anyway.",
      "Arteta reckons there has been “no better team in the competition” after Arsenal lost to PSG in the Champions League semi-final, blaming defeat on their “worst state”."

      "Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal have reportedly identified Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes as their ‘top target’ and have offered him a ‘three-year contract’.",
      "Fernandes signed a new deal at Man United last August and has been, by some distance, their best player this season.",
      "He remains United’s most influential player and has worn the captain’s armband since July 2023.",
      "Amorim’s side would obviously prefer to keep their star man and skipper, but they could be tempted to sell for the right price – while Fernandes himself may be swayed by a lucrative offer, especially given his age and the uncertainty at Old Trafford.",
      "It’s unclear how eager Amorim’s side would be to part with the Portuguese international, who fits the profile of players being aggressively targeted by Saudi clubs.",
      "Saudi Pro League teams have focused on signing high-profile, peak-age players to raise the league’s profile – and Fernandes would be among their most ambitious moves yet.",
      "According to transfer expert Ben Jacobs, writing for GiveMeSport, the United captain has a three-year contract offer on the table from Al Hilal, who have already snapped up Neymar, Ruben Neves and Aleksandar Mitrovic since the 2023 summer window.",
      "The report claims Al Hilal are ‘ready to make a record-breaking offer’ to sign Fernandes, who is said to be their ‘top target’.",
      "The Saudi giants had previously set aside funds to move for Mohamed Salah, but after the Egyptian signed a new Liverpool deal, their focus has shifted to the Manchester United captain.",
      "They reportedly have a staggering £510million to spend on a marquee signing, with £170million per season earmarked for wages alone.",
      "A move for Fernandes could contribute to ‘a record amount this summer in the history of football’, as Al Hilal look to add a genuine ‘superstar’ ahead of the expanded Club World Cup. They’re said to be ‘prepared to offer a British record fee’ for the 30-year-old.",
      "However, there are conflicting claims around a potential £60m release clause in Fernandes’ contract. While some reports suggest such a clause exists, United have been quick to ‘downplay this’, insisting no official release clause is in place.",
      "That said, Al Hilal reportedly ‘understand there to be a threshold’ – an informal price point – ‘above which United would be willing to negotiate, particularly if the player expresses a desire to leave Old Trafford’.",
      "The report also states that Fernandes’ representatives have been in ‘contact since the summer of 2024’ with Al Hilal over a potential move to the Middle East.",
      "A ‘non-binding offer’ has already been tabled, with a three-year contract on the cards. So far, Fernandes ‘is yet to respond’.",
      "Should he accept, he could reportedly earn up to £65m per season, but it’s believed the Portuguese playmaker ‘wants to remain in Europe until at least after the 2026 World Cup’.",

      "Man Utd man tops the 10 busiest outfield players in the Premier League this season ranked by minutes played.",

      "The Man Utd legend was speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate with Jamie Carragher, and admitted he was “a massive fan” of Kane, not just for his scoring, but his overall evolution as a modern forward.",
      "“He’s definitely up there,” Rooney said.",
      "“I love Harry. I think, as a goalscorer, he’s evolved his game over the last few years as well, which we’ve all seen, in dropping deep, he’s got a good range of passes, he can shoot from outside the box as well.”",
      "Harry Kane is England’s all-time leading scorer with 63 goals, and his 213 Premier League strikes leave him just 47 short of Shearer’s all-time record. It’s a mark Rooney believes he still could hit, if circumstances align.",
      "“If Harry had stayed in the Premier League, he’d break Shearer’s record for sure. Also, if he played for United, he would be considered. He still can. He still should.”",

He lamented the decline of the traditional centre-forward role and said the game has changed to leave modern No. 9s “bored” and uninvolved.",
      "“The game’s changed massively,” he said. “Strikers don’t touch the ball anymore. Goalkeepers and centre-backs have more touches. It’s all build-up now, everything’s precise. You don’t cross the ball anymore, you don’t put it in behind and compete.”",
      "Even Rooney’s son, currently in Man Utd’s academy, has felt it. “He plays as a No. 9 and said to me, ‘It’s boring.’ I keep saying, ‘No, you’re playing as a nine.’ But they’re just not involved in the game as much now.”",
      "That tactical shift is, for Rooney, a reason why only a few true centre-forwards are emerging at the top level.",

      "And what of the greats of Rooney’s era?",

      "",
      "10) Youri Tielemans (Leicester City to Aston Villa)\n“From the first day I set foot on this ground, your warmth and passion embraced me. Victory and triumph, love, hope and even defeat,” wrote the Belgian midfielder as he confirmed what we had all long knew: He would leave a relegated Leicester City with an FA Cup winner’s medal and the knowledge that he could have done little more to stop the slide from two consecutive top-five finishes to relegation.",
      "In truth, his final year at Leicester was poor after a failed transfer to Arsenal left him ‘mentally gone’. We expected Arsenal to return when he became available on a free transfer in 2023 – it really did feel like a no-brainer – but it was Aston Villa who won that particular race. “The manager was selling me this idea of playing Champions League and I really bought into it,” said Tielemans, who would be playing in Europe’s elite competition a year later.",
      "After a tricky first season in Villa colours, he has since thrived in the Champions League and Premier League, where he has made a good case for making the Premier League XI of the season.",
      "READ: Alexander-Arnold joins list of every Premier League club’s biggest free transfer exit",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (Manchester United to PSG)\nThe Spanish midfielder was reduced to tears on a Manchester United podcast when discussing his exit from the club: “I got the Player of the Year award by the fans and the club didn’t call me that summer to sign a new contract, and they did with other players. That was painful for me, honestly.”",
      "Herrera won the individual gong on the back of United’s most successful post-Sir Alex Ferguson season, in which he played a key role in their League Cup and Europa League titles, and memorably man-marked Eden Hazard out of a clash with Chelsea in perhaps the defining game of his United career.",
      "But the new contract did not arrive that summer and a lame offer as his deal came to a close was comfortably improved by PSG. “There is red in my heart,” said Herrera as he confirmed his departure.",
      "He ranks pretty high in a (largely awful) list of Manchester United transfers post-Fergie.",
      "",
      "8) Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City to…)\n“I don’t know about the future unfortunately. I have shown I can still play here, otherwise I don’t do what I do these last four or five weeks,” said Kevin De Bruyne after striking the only goal as Manchester City beat Wolves, taking him to 250 goal involvements under Pep Guardiola.",
      "He has won six Premier Leagues, one Champions League and seven domestic cups (an eighth could come in the FA Cup this month) for City, making him one of the most decorated players in Premier League history.",
      "The Belgian is clearly very upset not to be offered terms by City, meaning his 10-year reign as one of the best midfielders in Premier League history is coming to an end. Or is it? His form in the final weeks of his City stay has prompted some cheeky links with Liverpool, while Aston Villa are said to be very interested.",
      "“Let’s talk about the statue – for me he is Manchester City’s greatest ever player,” said Jamie Carragher. Would the club still build him a statue if he stays in the Premier League? They would probably quite like him to slink over to the semi-retirement of MLS.",
      "",
      "7) Gini Wijnaldum (Liverpool to PSG)\n“What this person – this wonderful, joyful, selfless person – has done for our team and club I cannot sum up in words, in truth, because my English is not good enough,” said Jurgen Klopp as Wijnaldum played his 237th and final game for Liverpool.",
      "The Dutchman had barely stopped running in five years at Anfield which earned him Premier League and Champions League medals, but he fell victim of FSG’s reluctance to hand long contracts to players in their 30s. He wanted to stay and Klopp wanted to keep him – he was ‘perfect’ for Klopp’s system – but a business decision was made.",
      "It seemed that Barcelona would sign Wijnaldum – they are masters of the free transfer swoop – but PSG stepped in to offer twice the money. There he won a French league title but being wonderful, joyful and selfless buttered no parsnips in Paris and he is now in Saudi Arabia playing as a striker.",
      "",
      "6) Emre Can (Liverpool to Juventus)\nIt’s been seven years since we said the free transfer exit of Emre Can from Liverpool should be met with ‘shrugs’, and we were absolutely right. As galling as it always is to allow a player worth £30m-plus to leave for nothing, he was never integral to a Liverpool side building towards Champions League and Premier League glory under Jurgen Klopp.",
      "It helps of course that he was then pretty poor at Juventus (though his career has since been rescued by Borussia Dortmund) while Liverpool brought in Fabinho and immediately won the Champions League. Can was never missed.",
      "",
      "5) Andreas Christensen (Chelsea to Barcelona)\n“Having spent ten amazing years at this club, I felt now was the right time for a new beginning for me and my family,” said the Dane, not so fondly remembered by Chelsea fans after he made himself unavailable to play in the FA Cup final against Liverpool in 2022. The decision to leave had clearly affected the form of a player who had won the Champions League the year before.",
      "There was enmity between club and player at the end, with Christensen blamed for twice reportedly reneging on verbal agreements to sign a new contract. He then engaged new agents who wanted to start the whole process again from scratch.",
      "He won the title with Barcelona in his very first season but has been perpetually linked with a return to the Premier League, with the Spanish club likely to accept slightly less than his £430m buy-out clause.",
      "",
      "4) Antonio Rudiger (Chelsea to Real Madrid)\nIn the same summer that Christensen left, Rudiger also departed Chelsea. And the Blues have been struggling for leadership at the back ever since; they have won nothing since the German left in 2021.",
      "Rudiger admitted that the uncertainty surrounding Chelsea’s ownership and the knock-on effect on player negotiations were a big factor in his exit, saying: “For me, there was a gap between August and January, and that made me think “what’s going on”.",
      "“You get pressure from other teams because it’s January and people don’t know what’s happening and you would have to wait until June because you have a contender to take over the club but even today you cannot talk to him because you have to go through Government stuff and everything.",
      "“I didn’t want to wait until June to sort out my future because it’s been almost a year of uncertainty.”",
      "And nobody can begrudge anybody joining Real Madrid, right?",
      "",
      "3) Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal to Juventus)\n“It all happened…I agreed to a contract they proposed,” said Ramsey when attempting to explain why he had left Arsenal after 11 years at the club. He claims that the offer was then retracted as manager Unai Emery decided he wanted to take the club in a different direction.",
      "A few months later Emery was sacked by Arsenal and Ramsey has signed a deal with Juventus that gave him the highest basic salary of any British footballer. But there were few regrets from Arsenal as he never started more than 13 Serie A games in a season for the Italian giants (though he did win a Serie A title) before a loan spell at Rangers and a permanent exit to Nice and then Cardiff.",
      "",

      "Courtesy of the wonderful FBREF we’ve used the PSxG minus goals allowed metric to rank the top-flight stoppers. ‘What the f*** is that?’ you might reasonably ask…",
      "Post-shot expected goals is expected goals based on how likely the goalkeeper is to save the shot. When the number of goals they have conceded is subtracted, we are left with the figures below. FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Here’s how the Premier League keepers have performed this season, and at this stage they must have started 12 Premier League games.",
      "",
      "1) Ederson (Manchester City): +3.8\nHe’s been a whole lot busier without Rodri; he’s been exposed far more than at any other time in his Manchester City career and emerged very much in the black. But he literally did not have a shot to save against Wolves.",
      "",
      "2) Kepa (Bournemouth): +3.2\nConceded 10 goals in five Premier League games before seven saves earned the Cherries a precious win v Fulham. And then had literally nothing to do v Palace. Made five saves v Manchester United, meaning he conceded just once from a PSxG of 1.7. He did similar v Arsenal as the Cherries remain in sniffing distance of a European place.",
      "",
      "3) Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest): +3.0\nOne among many incompetent Forest keepers last season but has a 74.3% save percentage this season and 13 clean sheets, making him the favourite for the Golden Gloves award. Which he would deserve rather more than David Raya.",
      "",
      "4) Guglielmo Vicario (Tottenham): +2.6\nTottenham have the highest PSxG of any Premier League side outside of the relegated three clubs this season, which keeps the Italian pretty sodding busy. He was definitely culpable in the 5-1 defeat to Liverpool but he was not alone.",
      "",
      "5) Dean Henderson (Crystal Palace): +2.5\nWas doing incredibly well until he conceded 10 goals in two games against Manchester City and Newcastle United. Redeemed himself with a clean sheet v Bournemouth.",
      "",
      "6) Lukasz Fabianski (West Ham): +2.3\nMade eight saves to protect a point v Bournemouth as the old man proved he’s still got what it takes. Was excellent v Brighton, particularly to save a deflected effort from Yasin Ayari, and then made a series of saves v Southampton before being stretchered off with a head injury. Returned to over-concede v Fulham but he was at least on the winning side. He under-conceded v Palace and lost. Now on the West Ham bench.",
      "",
      "7) Robert Sanchez (Chelsea): +1.6\nHas the best save percentage in the Premier League but still gets pelters from pundits.",
      "",
      "",
      "9) Mads Hermansen (Leicester City): +1.4\nOnly one keeper has ever made more saves in a Premier League game than the 13 Hermansen managed against Arsenal. That was David de Gea against the Gunners in December 2017; the Foxes’ No. 1 was unfortunate that Mikel Arteta’s side are slightly better now.",
      "Topped this list earlier in the season, got injured, and then returned to find the Foxes worse than ever.",

      "",
      "11) Andre Onana (Manchester United): +1.2\nConceded only once in three games in the Premier League but was dropped for the battering by Newcastle for his antics in the Europa League. Not at fault for Wolves’ goal as he was recalled.",
      "",
      "12) Mark Flekken (Brentford): +0.9\nConsistently one of the worst goalkeepers on this metric last season, no keeper has made more saves than Flekken this season. But he had something of a ‘mare against Manchester United.",
      "",
      "13) Nick Pope (Newcastle): +0.8\nMade four saves v Man Utd as Pope under-conceded for the fourth Premier League game in a row. And then saved a penalty. But he was exposed v Aston Villa. Had literally nothing to do v Ipswich.",

      "14) Stefan Ortega (Manchester City): -0.7\nProof, if proof were needed, that all Manchester City goalkeepers are not created equal.",
      "",
      "15) David Raya (Arsenal): -0.8\nArsenal have the lowest PSxG against them this season so it’s hard for a goalkeeper to truly shine. But he was poor v Crystal Palace and Bournemouth as more points were dropped, with Oliver Glasner making it clear he was targeted.",
      "",
      "16) Emiliano Martinez (Aston Villa): -0.8\nCulpable once again as Villa lost a crucial clash with Manchester City; that Bernardo Silva goal had a PSxG of just 0.28. Has conceded more goals than Jordan Pickford this season from a very, very similar PSxG in the same number of Premier League games this season.",
      "",
      "17) Arijanet Muric (Ipswich Town): -1.6\nWas very poor in the 4-0 defeat to Newcastle United, taking him into the black for the first time this season. Then dropped after the Arsenal defeat in which he was much better. Recalled v Southampton and Ipswich somehow lost 2-1. Alex Palmer is the captain now.",
      "",
      "18) Bernd Leno (Fulham): -2.5\nA really poor season compared to his usual standards. Only Liverpool and Arsenal should actually have conceded more than Fulham this season.",

      "Man Utd boss Amorim revealed in March he had told the 30-year-old he was \"not going anywhere\" following links to Real Madrid, with Amorim striking a similar tone amid talk of a summer move to Saudi Arabia.",

      "\"He is a top player, we need top players. He is a leader, he's the captain, so he's really important.",
      "\"It's normal that a lot of clubs want a player like Bruno, like (Alejandro) Garnacho, like others.",
      "\"But we want to keep the best players and Bruno is clearly one of the top players in the world, so our idea didn't change. We want Bruno here.\""

      "",
      "The 3-1 defeat at Chelsea will do little to trouble Liverpool as they celebrated their deserved title. But if anyone was questioning what Arne Slot's side may have looked like with a few injuries, then that performance was it.",
      "There were probably some party-related reasons for Liverpool's flat performance and a lower intensity than normal, but Arne Slot wanted to use these final four games to help him plan for the summer. Those he brought into the team at Stamford Bridge failed to impress.",
      "The entire midfield was changed and the trio of Wataru Endo, Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliott could not cope with their Chelsea counterparts, notably Romeo Lavia and Cole Palmer who ran the show.",
      "Jones slipped in the build-up to Chelsea's first, Elliott was hauled off after the Blues' second - and Endo showed he, at 32, will struggle to replicate what Ryan Gravenberch did brilliantly all season.",
      "At the top end of the pitch, Diogo Jota was anonymous with just 13 touches - he has one league goal in 2025 - while Darwin Nunez missed two good openings after coming on. At least he managed one more touch than Jota.",
      "None had a worse outing though than Jarell Quansah, with one own goal and one penalty conceded in a disappointing and unconvincing display at centre-half, one that was reminiscent of his opening-day struggles at Ipswich.",
      "Liverpool will not stand still this summer and rest on their laurels. The club want to be busy in the transfer market and strengthen their squad to compete again next season and develop the next title-winning team.",
      "And with Kostas Tsimikas failing to ease Liverpool's left-back woes, that looks like four areas Liverpool could strengthen this summer. Left-back, centre-back, midfield and striker - and don't forget a right-back if Trent Alexander-Arnold departs, as expected.Sam Blitz",
      "Bilbao or bust has been the mantra at Manchester United for some time. Watching them fall to a 16th league defeat of the season as they lost 4-3 at Brentford, their most for 35 years, made that abundantly clear. But there is something more behind their struggles.",
      "Ruben Amorim named the third-youngest team in Premier League history at Brentford. Considering United's recent domestic form, and the eight changes made after Thursday's win over Athletic Club, defeat was almost inevitable, strange as that sounds.",
      "Everything, understandably, is focused on the Europa League. That doesn't answer the question of why United, the only undefeated side in European competition, haven't beaten a team that will be playing top-flight football next season since January 26.",
      "Since that 1-0 win at Fulham, sealed thanks to Lisandro Martinez's deflected strike, United have played 10 teams outside the bottom three and failed to win against any of them. They still had a round left of the Europa League league phase after that win.",
      "Meanwhile, in Europe United have overcome Real Sociedad and Lyon. Barring a shock collapse, not something you would put past this group, you can add Athletic Club to that list. Then they are one game from a European trophy. Puzzling.",
      "The defeat at Brentford, although not the fairest game to draw conclusions from, served up a perfect example of the problems plaguing Amorim in the Premier League: United were simply unable to cope with Brentford's physicality, pace and direct football.",
      "Regardless of who was picked, as this season has shown us, those same vulnerabilities would remain.",
      "Amorim has inherited a squad ill-equipped to cope with the rigours of English football. Those squad-building missteps must be corrected this summer, particularly if Champions League qualification is secured, otherwise Amorim will see no improvement.Zinny Boswell",
      "Alexander Isak must have felt like his moment would never come in Newcastle's 1-1 draw at Brighton. Twice he had picked up the ball thinking he was about to have a free shot at goal from 12 yards after referee Craig Pawson had pointed to the spot. VAR ruined Newcastle's fun by spotting two incorrect calls from Pawson so it was looking like one of those days for Isak and his team.",
      "But one more chance would come on 89 minutes when Pawson finally correctly spotted a legitimate penalty and Isak was in no mood to pass it up.",
      "In scoring he became the first Newcastle United player to score 23 goals in a Premier League season since Alan Shearer in 2002 and now has 22 goals in his last 26 league appearances. There is still time to catch Mohamed Salah in the Golden Boot race, too. He is five back with three games to play and Salah has only scored once in his last six Premier League games. Stranger things have happened.Lewis Jones",
      "There have been calls from some sections of the Brighton fans for goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen to be replaced.",
      "Before the 1-1 draw with Newcastle, the Seagulls had conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their previous 11 league encounters. Verbruggen was not solely to blame but his lack of confidence and authority has not been helping his defenders. Brighton also have the worst save ratio in the Premier League this season (59.6 per cent).",
      "However, Verbruggen put in his best performance of 2025 to repel Newcastle. Solid from set-pieces and looking much more composed under pressure, Verbruggen made four saves - the pick of which came in stoppage time to deny Callum Wilson a winning goal. If he can stay in this kind of form, Brighton's defensive process and numbers should be back on the improve.Lewis Jones",
      "Ange Postecoglou's wholesale changes in Tottenham's 1-1 draw at West Ham allowed those brought in to put forward their case to start in Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg at Bodo/Glimt - and Mathys Tel took it.",
      "The French forward was Spurs' most dangerous player at the London Stadium as he assisted Wilson Odobert's opener after pressing West Ham defender Max Kilman into a mistake.",
      "Tel attempted eight dribbles - the most of any player in the game - and had two shots, with only Jarrod Bowen having more.",
      "It was another promising display from the on-loan Bayern Munich man, who is finding his feet out on the left wing for Spurs, with Postecoglou praising the 20-year-old in his post-match press conference.",
      "He said: \"He's taken in the information and he understands the role now a little bit better, especially out on the left.",
      "\"These last few weeks, we've obviously had Sonny [Heung-Min Son] out. We've needed him to fill that void and I think he's done that job well.\"",
      "If Tel were to start in Norway on Thursday, then it would be well deserved. And with more performances like this, Spurs will be keen to activate the £45m option to sign him permanently from Bayern.Declan Olley",
      "It took Michael Kayode just under three months to make his first start for Brentford after joining on loan from Fiorentina in January. Before then, there were fleeting glimpses of what he had to offer; eye-catching cameos that provided a taste of what was to come.",
      "But he has started at right-back in the Bees' last three games and been a key part of the team that has won three in a row for the first time since a run between October 21 and November 4 2023.",
      "The 20-year-old looked eager to get forward from the very start during Man Utd's visit to the Gtech and his boundless energy caused Amorim's side problems - as did his monstrous throw-ins, as shown in the lead-up to Luke Shaw's own goal.",
      "Kayode completed the most dribbles (5) in the match, won the most duels (10) and finished with a 97 per cent pass accuracy, the most of any player to play 45 minutes or more. \"He looked like he just enjoyed playing football,\" said Thomas Frank afterwards.",
      "There is surely no doubt Brentford will take up the option to make Kayode's stay in west London permanent at the end of the season.Dan Long",
      "If ever there was to be a day when things finally clicked into place for West Ham under Graham Potter, the visit of rivals Tottenham to the London Stadium was surely it.",
      "The Hammers had a week to prepare for the London derby, a luxury compared to Spurs' 64-hour turnaround from Thursday's Europa League semi-final against Bodo-Glimt.",
      "Spurs had more than an eye on Thursday's return leg in Norway, Postecoglou's eight pre-match alterations made that clear, so opportunity knocked for Potter's beleaguered Hammers to end a seven-game wait for a victory.",
      "Before a ball had been kicked, frustration summed up the mood among a fanbase who had not seen a victory since late February, but that turned to apathy come full-time.",
      "Hoards headed for an early exit despite the scoreboard reading 1-1 with the prospect of a late derby victory still on the table.",
      "The fact that was not enough to keep sections of the disgruntled fanbase in their seats shows just how deep West Ham's rut is with three games left to salvage something from this season.Jack Wilkinson"

      "Amorim, who made eight changes and named the third-youngest side in Premier League history, was prioritising Thursday's Europa League semi-final second leg against Athletic Club, with United 3-0 up on aggregate.",
      "Since Amorim took charge of United on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "United will be playing Champions League football next season if they can win the Europa League, but Amorim says that is a \"real dilemma\" for the club.",
      "\"We know that, but we need to win, and we need to fight to win this competition, to give something to our fans, and to go to the Champions League.",
      "\"Then we will have time to prepare the team to cope with those two competitions. So, it is a dilemma, but we want to win, of course.\"",
      "United were trailing 4-1 with eight minutes to go at Brentford, but late goals from Alejandro Garnacho and substitute Amad Diallo restored some respectability for Amorim's struggling side.",
      "There were flashes of promise, particularly Mason Mount's opener, his first league goal for 13 months, but the performance, for the most part, stood in stark contrast to Thursday's impressive 3-0 win over Athletic Club.",
      "Amorim has failed to translate United's Europa League form into consistent performances and results in the Premier League, but insists he is seeing signs of progress.",
      "He added: \"I have no doubts that we are playing better, and we are understanding the way we play, even in this context. So, we have to take all the hits.",
      "\"We are losing games in the Premier League, we are fighting for the Europa League, so we need to accept that and to think about Thursday as the most important game for us.\"",
      "Asked about the goal for Mount, who has endured another season blighted by injuries, Amorim added: \"It's not just the finish, it's the position that he has on the pitch. He's like a third midfielder that can reach the box. He's really intelligent.",
      "\"He's getting there and he trains really hard. Sometimes I have to push him back and to take him off the pitch because he wants to do so much more. We are taking care of him.",
      "\"He wants to play more minutes, but the minutes were controlled. I'm really happy with him.\"",
      "Striker Chido Obi became the youngest player in United's history to start a Premier League game at Brentford, aged 17 years and 156 days, as fellow academy graduates Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got the nod.",
      "Amorim was pleased with the young trio and the experience they gained, but sent a clear message to them that United's standards in their worst season in the Premier League era would not be accepted moving forward.",
      "\"It is really important to understand that we cannot do this anymore,\" he said, when asked about how important it was for the young players to learn from the defeat.",
      "\"We know the context, but this kind of season we need to change. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They [have] not [been] playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.\"",
      "Asked about the experience they would have gained, Amorim: \"It's really important because you can train a lot with the first team, but to have that feeling, playing with the players, feeling the players, the speed of the game, I think it is the best thing.\"",
      "Obi, on his first senior start, was tasked with leading the line against Brentford's physical centre-back pairing of Nathan Collins and Sepp van den Berg, whose last-minute block denied a goalbound strike from the teenage striker.",
      "The Denmark U21 international had a frustrating full debut until that moment, when he burst through a challenge in the box, and looked destined to at least test Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken but for Van den Berg's intervention.",
      "\"Chido fought for all game, but you can feel that he's really naive sometimes in the way he puts his body,\" Amorim said. \"He's going to understand what is the feeling of playing in these games. This is the best way.\""

      "Brentford increased their hopes of qualifying for Europe for the first time as they beat a much-changed Manchester United 4-3 in a thriller at the Gtech.",
      "Conversely, it was Man Utd's 16th league defeat of the season, their most since the 1989/90 season, when they also lost 16.",
      "Since Ruben Amorim took charge on November 11, only the now-relegated sides Ipswich (3), Leicester (3), and Southampton (1) have won fewer Premier League games than United (6).",
      "After United won the first leg of their Europa League semi-final 3-0 against Athletic Club on Thursday, Amorim rung the changes and named the third-youngest starting XI in Premier League history.",
      "Sensing an opportunity as a result, Brentford pressed high from the off and should have been ahead when a Luke Shaw and Altay Bayindir mix-up led to the former almost heading past his own goalkeeper.",
      "Brentford:  Flekken (6), Kayode (8), Collins (6), Van den Berg (6), Lewis-Potter (6), Norgaard (7), Yarmoliuk (7), Mbeumo (7), Damsgaard (7), Schade (9), Wissa (8).\n\n\nSubs:  Jensen (6), Henry (6), Ajer (n/a), Nunes (n/a), Thiago (n/a).\n\n\nMan Utd:  Bayindir (6), Fredricson (5), De Ligt (6), Shaw (4), Dorgu (5), Ugarte (7), Mainoo (6), Amass (6), Mount (7), Garnacho (8), Obi (5).\n\n\nSubs used:  Maguire (6), Yoro (6), Diallo (7), Eriksen (7), Lindelof (6).\n\n\nPlayer of the match:  Kevin Schade.",
      "There was a brief boost when Mason Mount slid Alejandro Garnacho's cross home against the run of play, but the Bees deservedly levelled when Mikkel Damsgaard poked a shot that hit the unfortunate Shaw, then Bayindir, then the net.",
      "Within five minutes, the turnaround was complete. Man Utd switched off, wanting play to be paused when Matthijs de Ligt went down with a leg injury after a tangle with Yoane Wissa, but referee Anthony Taylor played on, so Christian Norgaard was able to pick out Kevin Schade to head home.",
      "Only a last-ditch save from Bayindir to keep out Norgaard's connection on Damsgaard's free-kick prevented it becoming three before the break.",
      "United started the second half well, but found themselves further behind when Schade headed in a peach of a cross from Bryan Mbeumo, before the impressive Michael Kayode squared for Wissa to roll home and make it 4-1, with the goal confirmed after a VAR review.",
      "Garnacho hit a stunner from the edge of the box, before Amad's strike deflected off Sepp van den Berg to make it 4-3 and set up a tense finale, but Brentford held on for their third win in succession as their positive end to the campaign continues.",
      "Brentford head coach Thomas Frank:",
      "\"Basically, from the first year in the division, we respect everyone but fear no one. We believe that we can win every game.",
      "\"We try to go for that win. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose, but we really, really, really believe it every single time. The players are fantastic. It is a fantastic group to work with.",
      "\"We spoke about it [Europe] before the Brighton game. I rarely say that to the players as it's more about performance, but [I said] this game, we need to win. We have to win this if we want to be in with any chance of maybe having a dream about Europe. And the players did that, big credit to them.",
      "\"Then we played a difficult away game to Nottingham Forest, beat them, home to Man Utd, beat them. And all three wins, well deserved.",
      "\"We've got this momentum, hopefully we can keep it up. It's all about getting the job done and it's one at a time. We had a laser, laser, laser focus throughout four seasons on the next game. It's all about the next game.\"",
      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim:",
      "\"I think it reflected our season. We started quite well, controlling the game, not creating big chances but controlling the pace of the game. We suffered a lot with the throw-ins and set-pieces but we already knew that our team would struggle against this team.",
      "\"We didn't have the height necessary for this kind of game. They scored twice in this kind of moments, even with De Ligt on the floor.",
      "\"And then in the second half I felt that we were near the draw and then we suffered a goal and like some other times we disconnected. And then another goal, almost three minutes, five minutes later. And then we pushed forward, tried to score, we scored twice but we didn't have the time to do better.\"",
      "On playing youngsters: \"They have to understand this season is really important also to understand that we cannot do this anymore. Of course, we know the context, but this kind of season we need to change that. They need to understand what it is to play for Manchester United.",
      "\"I think they did really well. They are not playing so much, but then they have to play 90 minutes because we have to change some other players to save them for Thursday.",
      "\"I think we can help the young kids even more, especially Tyler Fredricson did quite well in the third goal. He needs more help from Amad. So these small things I think we can help them more, but I'm really happy with the performance of the young kids.\"",
      "On De Ligt's injury: \"We don't know what will happen with De Ligt. If we don't have Luke Shaw available on Thursday we could have a problem and then we don't have enough defenders for the game. We had to protect some players at half-time, thinking about Thursday. So it was just that, not about thinking about the game.\""

      "Our betting expert Jones Knows unleashes his insight and angles across the Premier League and thinks Liverpool are a juicy price to beat Chelsea.",
      "It's always worth keeping the player shots lines on your mind against Brentford as their style of play does tend to a high volume of shots conceded. Only Southampton have faced more shots this season than the Bees (588).",
      "This brings forward the case to back Manuel Ugarte to have two or more shots at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "Which Premier League teams will qualify for Europe?",
      "Not known for his shots volume, the midfielder has come to life in that regard under Ruben Amorim, averaging 1.9 shots per 90 across his last 13 appearances. Those backing his two or more shots line have copped a return on six of those occasions.",
      "If the Tottenham that showed up in midweek against Bodo/Glimt does so again - a team full of aggression, creative spark and defensive focus - then West Ham are here for the taking.",
      "However, it's likely that we're going to see the Spurs side that have taken just 16 points away from home this season in the Premier League, losing 10 times. It wouldn't surprise me to see any of three match outcomes here. Great help, I know.",
      "A better angle is in the Tottenham player fouls market where Ben Davies stands out at 7/4 with Sky Bet to make two or more fouls.",
      "West Ham's tricky trio of Jarrod Bowen, Mohamed Kudus and Lucas Paqueta are foul drawing kings.",
      "The last 33 centre backs to have played against West Ham under Graham Potter have made 38 fouls between them with 25 of those 33 making at least one foul. Davies is showing clear signs of decline, making five fouls in his last four starts and is likely to be exposed at some point.",
      "Brighton remain a team to fade, especially against such a relentless and well coached side like Newcastle with a goal in their sights. The Seagulls have conceded at least twice in each of their last six Premier League games and shipped 24 goals in their last 11 league encounters.",
      "These poor returns certainly marry up with my opinion that Fabian Hurzeler is struggling to get the best out of this talented squad.",
      "Newcastle have scored two or more goals in six of their last seven matches and sometimes the obvious bet is the best bet.",
      "Therefore, Alexander Isak to score in a Newcastle win looks a great bet to attack at 9/4 with Sky Bet.",
      "This time of year always brings about big decisions for punters - which teams are overpriced based on a perceived lack of motivation? If Liverpool were going for the title there would be no way you'd be getting 21/10 with Sky Bet on an away win. But the 'week on the beers' theory is certainly affecting their price - wrongly in my opinion, so Liverpool have to be the bet.",
      "Also, Mohamed Salah is a man completely motivated by numbers and breaking records.",
      "He is just two goals away from breaking the record for goal involvements for the season currently held jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer (47). The Egyptian looks a fine bet to add to his tally of 28 goals and 18 assists by grabbing another goal involvement in a win for Arne Slot's machine team. Salah to score or assist and Liverpool to win can be combined through the BuildABet function to generate an 11/4 shot with Sky Bet.",
      "Nottingham Forest's season has been built around the magnificent trio of Nikola Milenkovic, Murillo and Matz Sels.",
      "But just like when forwards lose their form in front of goal that in turn affects the output of a team, the same can happen in defence and that's occurring with Forest. Mistakes are now being made at key moments in matches and Forest's defensive numbers are now that of a mid-table team.",
      "Across their last 12 Premier League matches their expected goals against process is working at 1.77 per 90 - only Leicester, Ipswich and Southampton have a worse defensive process.",
      "This is seriously worrying for Forest and their hopes of Champions League.",
      "And it makes them impossible to fancy up against such a dangerous and powerful Crystal Palace attack, where Eberechi Eze is sparkling once again. He is 4/1 with Sky Bet to score for a third game in a row. That's generous.",
      "P+L = +7.97"
