      "Marko Arnautovic already admitted he was subject to numerous overtures from Manchester United - but decided to decline an offer to join the Premier League giants. The Inter Milan forward is gearing up for the Champions League final on Saturday, where the Italian giants take on Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "A win for the Nerazzurri would see Arnautovic capture his second UCL medal with the Serie A side, having been part of their last triumph in the competition in the 2009/10 season.",
      "The Austria international played just three times during his first stint with Inter but made a name for himself during his four-year spell with Stoke City.",
      "His performances led him to a move to West Ham, where he hit double digits in goals in both seasons he spent in London before earning a big-money transfer to Chinese side Shanghai Port.",
      "A return to Italy beckoned in 2021 with Bologna as Arnautovic, who was 33 at the time, enjoyed a career-best season with 14 goals in 33 games before following that up with 10 goals in 22 games in his second campaign.",
      "With that came summer interest from United, who had just appointed Erik ten Hag. Reports of the forward potentially arriving at Old Trafford weren't well received by sections of fans, with the club then reportedly pulling out due to the feedback they received despite tabling a bid worth £7.6 million.",
      "However, Arnautovic's agent set the record straight and claimed that it was his player who turned down a move to United, with the forward himself backing up the story in 2022. \"Manchester United tried to sign me several times,\" Arnautovic told Laola1. \"And it was a difficult decision to stay in Italy because my family wanted to return to England.",
      "\"For me, it’s clear that the Red Devils remain at the top of the universe. And Bologna, as a name, are not. But that’s fine. Here everything is calm, you have time for yourself and no stress. This is only good for me.\"",
      "The interest in signing the forward was due to the possible departure of Cristiano Ronaldo, who was said to have wanted to depart Old Trafford after failing to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "While the Portuguese legend remained in Manchester beyond the summer, his relationship with Ten Hag deteriorated, leading to the striker conducting a bombshell interview with Piers Morgan in which he slammed his then-manager.",
      "\"He doesn't respect [me] the way I should deserve [to be respected],\" the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said of the Dutchman. \"But it is what it is. This is why probably, the game against Tottenham, I left.",
      "\"Excuses, I see as excuses. I saw many things that, I don't want to criticise him. He can have [a] different opinion than me. They choose the players that they think is better for the team. I respect that but excuses all the time you know; the excuses have short legs, cannot excuse all the time, which is things that don't make sense.\"",
      "Ronaldo eventually left for Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr in January 2023 after his United contract was ripped up shortly after his interview. Fast-forward two years, and the 40-year-old's time in the Middle East looks to be coming to an end after a social media post sparked doubts over his future.",
      "After Al-Nassr's last game of the season, where they lost 3-2 to Al-Fateh, Ronaldo posted a snap of himself on the pitch with a caption that read: \"This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.\""

      "United's recruitment chiefs will now turn their focus to a new striker. Their initial plan had been to sign Ipswich's Delap for around £30m, but that pursuit is in tatters, with the Englishman instead heading to Chelsea.",
      "That has forced United to look into alternative targets, such as Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. The Bees are keen to get their money's worth out of the 25-year-old, who still has another year on his contract, with a club option for an extra 12 months.",
      "But a big fee is not something United are likely going to be able to raise, without major sales. One player who is looking to leave is Antony, with the winger closing in on a move to Real Betis.",
      "Manchester United will have to pay out a mega fee for Bryan Mbeumo if they want to sign the Brentford star. Bees boss Thomas Frank has insisted that his club will not be afraid to reject bids they deem to be too low.",
      "“It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot,” Frank told tipsbladet. “Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",
      "\"There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for. I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don’t look at him. He is a good player.”",
      "Manchester United and Real Betis chiefs will meet next week to discuss the transfer of Antony. The Brazilian flop spent the second half of the season on loan at Betis and hopes to make that move permanent.",
      "According to Marca, one of the first 'pending issues' of the summer for Betis is the signing of Antony. There is said to be 'enourmous satisfaction' with his performances since his arrival in January, with 'complete and absolute consenus' to bring him back permanently.",
      "Betis have now scheduled a meeting with United chiefs for next week to assess the various scenarios. Nothing has been ruled out yet, including another loan deal, with Antony set to be forced to take a pay cut if he wants to return to Betis.",
      "Manchester United's bid to sign Jonathan David looks to be over with the Canadian set to snub a move to the Premier League. David has starred for Lille but will leave the Ligue 1 side on a free transfer this summer.",
      "United had been linked with a move for the 25-year-old, who helped to fire Lille to the French title in 2021. But according to iNews, David has instead set his sights on moving to Serie A.",
      "Italian champions Napoli and rivals Juventus are expected to battle it out for the Canadian. Napoli are the frontrunners to sign him having made David's representatives a 'concrete offer', though Juve are hoping to steal in under their noses."

      "Bruno Fernandes has been given SEVEN DAYS to decide to leave Manchester United. The club captain is wanted by Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal in a monster £100million transfer, that would also see the Portuguese earn himself £100m tax-free - a whopping £700k-a-week - over the next three years.",
      "Al Hilal will play in the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup, and Saudi chiefs are desperate to see their marquee club make a splash, well aware that the eyes of the world will be on them when they face Real Madrid in their tournament opener on June 18.",
      "And they are desperate to land 30-year-old Fernandes, in a move that would see him link up with Portugal team-mates Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo, ex-Chelsea defender Kalidou Koulibaly, former Fulham hitman Aleksandar Mitrovic, and, potentially, Cristiano Ronaldo - if a deal can be fixed to allow him to join on a temporary deal.",
      "Fernandes' agent, Miguel Pinho, spent three days in Saudi at the Four Seasons Hotel in Riyadh this week, as he held negotiations with club Al Hilal representatives. And there is growing belief that Fernandes could be persuaded to make the move.",
      "Publicly, United insist their best player is not for sale. However, the £100m transfer fee is a transformational sum given their financial predicament, with those pressures having only grown after last week's Europa League Final loss to Spurs, a defeat which ultimately cost them £100m in Champions League revenue next term.",
      "Publicly, United insist their best player is not for sale. However, the £100m transfer fee is a transformational sum given their financial predicament and it's not beyond the realm of possibility that Fernandes is asked to leave for the good of the club.",
      "But boss Ruben Amorim is desperate for him to STAY - and told Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the club's decision-makers to make up the money elsewhere.",
      "Speaking after United ended their post-season tour of Asia with a 3-1 victory over Hong Kong, which Fernandes played the opening 45 minutes of, Amorim was asked if fans had seen the last of their captain in action.",
      "\"I don't think so, I don't know for sure. Nobody knows but I don't think so,\" the Red Devils boss said. \"I think he is seeing us taking some actions to change all the things and I think he saw that and I think he wants to stay.",
      "\"He is saying no to a lot of things but he shows he wants to win. He's really young, he's really good he needs to be in the best league in the world.\"",
      "Amorim was then asked if United, who've failed to qualify for Europe for the first time in 11 years, were in a position to turn down the kind of money which Al-Hilal would be willing to pay for Fernandes.",
      "\"Yes, we can find another way to earn money,\" he replied. \"Of course I'm the manager, I'm the coach but sometimes it's the decision of the player. But of course I talk with him, I explain things. I just have that feeling if he wants to stay.",
      "\"Of course in a lot of games this season he was so frustrated but he knows what we are doing.",
      "\"The feeling is every time I speak with him he wants to continue at Manchester United but you never know.\"",

      "The 11-time Premier League champion said on The Overlap Fan Debate : “They are talking about £100m for him. Man United cannot say no to that.",
      "“You know when you talk about this system as well, I know he has been brilliant and carried the team on his back but where does he play? What is his position? Do you see him as a number 10? Do you see him as a holding midfielder?",
      "“He almost confuses the whole system because he doesn’t have that one position for him. I mean he has been brilliant don’t get me wrong.",

      "Bids have already been lodged, while some contracts have already been signed. And that is only sure to ramp up over the coming days as the window opens.",
      "Due to this summer’s Club World Cup, there will be two separate windows. The first opens on June 1 and runs until June 10.",
      "Arsenal - Martin Zubimendi (Real Sociedad)",
      "Admirers of the Spanish midfielder for some time, Arsenal have bitten the bullet and decided to pay his £51m release clause. Reports in Spain suggest that he is preparing to complete an Arsenal medical soon so a deal might be done very shortly.",
      "Aston Villa - Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)",
      "The Man United academy graduate had managed to recover his form before an injury cruelly cut short his time with Aston Villa. The Midlands side have a £40m option to buy him permanently which they could activate but whether they do that without a guaranteed Champions League payday remains to be seen.",
      "Bournemouth - Kyogo Furuhashi (Rennes)",
      "The Cherries have already conducted some business this summer with defender Dean Huijsen on his way to Real Madrid. Reports have suggested that ex-Celtic man Kyogo Furuhashi could be targeted and given the rotten time of things he has had in France, it could be a relatively straightforward move.",
      "Brentford - Caoimhin Kelleher (Liverpool)",
      "Kelleher has regularly expressed his desire to leave Liverpool for more regular first team football. Brentford could offer him just that. The Bees have been in touch with their Premier League rivals over recent days regarding a deal.",
      "Brighton - Diego Coppola (Hellas Verona)",
      "A talented young defender, the Italian has made a name for himself with Hellas Verona in Serie A. As it stands, the Seagulls are the favourites but could face competition from Juventus and Aston Villa.",
      "Burnley - Daniel Peretz (Bayern Munich)",
      "This very much depends on what happens with James Trafford. But reports in Germany have claimed that the Clarets are keen on sealing Peretz on a loan deal. Bayern would reportedly be willing to loan him out so a deal could be relatively easy.",
      "Chelsea - Liam Delap (Ipswich)",
      "A relatively straightforward one, Chelsea have already activated the £30m release clause written into Delap’s Ipswich contract. It won't be two days, as his medical is happening on Monday, but it should be smooth sailing from there.",
      "Crystal Palace - Reinildo Mandava (Atletico Madrid)",
      "After winning the FA Cup, Palace are understandably keen to bolster their squad. Atletico Madrid left-back Reinildo has reportedly been identified as a replacement for Ben Chilwell, who will return to Chelsea at the end of his loan spell.",
      "Everton - Charly Alcaraz (Flamengo)",
      "Much like Rashford, Charly Alcaraz could see his loan move to Everton turned into a permanent one very shortly. The former Southampton man is now in talks over personal terms and is fully expected to become a full-time Toffee.",
      "Fulham - Ardon Jashari (Club Brugge)",
      "This one might actually be a bit more difficult than some of the other names on the list. The Club Brugge midfielder has shone over in Belgium, garnering interest from the Premier League. Fulham could steal a march with an early move.",
      "Leeds United - Manor Solomon (Tottenham)",
      "One of the heroes of Leeds' promotion, there have been calls for the club to push through a permanent deal. And it appears that it could actually happen, with Spurs open to selling. Leeds might face competition from Everton so they might need to get their skates on.",
      "Liverpool - Florian Wirtz (Bayer Leverkusen)",
      "Jeremie Frimpong is done and his Bayer Leverkusen team-mate may not be far behind. Liverpool have made a second offer to the Germans worth a cool £109m and with Wirtz heading on international duty shortly, his desire to move to Anfield and Leverkusen's delight it's not Bayern, this could move very, very quickly.",
      "Manchester City - Tijjani Reijnders (AC Milan)",
      "The champions certainly need some signings to reclaim their crown. And it appears to be in midfield where Pep Guardiola is keen to add some new faces. AC Milan have already rejected City’s opening offer for Reijnders but don’t be surprised if they try again.",
      "Manchester United - Matheus Cunha (Wolves)",
      "Another release clause, another imminent move. Matheus Cunha appears set to become a Red Devil after his £62m release clause was activated. The Brazilian is also set for a medical over the coming days.",
      "Newcastle - Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace)",
      "Newcastle are long-term admirers of Guehi and have seen a number of bids rebuffed in the past. But with some financial muscle behind them courtesy of their Champions League qualification, this summer might finally be the window where they get him.",
      "Nottingham Forest - Igor Jesus (Botafogo)",
      "Speaking of European football, Nottingham Forest could do with some depth ahead of their return to continental competition - particularly up front. Botafogo striker Igor Jesus has reportedly emerged as a target with the two clubs seemingly not far away from a deal.",
      "Sunderland - Jordan Henderson (Ajax)",
      "There's been rumours of an emotional return this summer and it could finally be the perfect time for it to happen. Henderson has really struggled to settle since leaving Liverpool and his boyhood club might be the perfect place to do that.",
      "Tottenham - Mathys Tel (Bayern Munich)",
      "Having scored just three times for Spurs since his arrival on loan from Bayern Munich, there is a debate to be had over whether they should activate their option to sign Tel permanently. A deal would be costly at the £50m mark but it would be a relatively easy one to rubber-stamp.",
      "West Ham - Daniel Cummings (Celtic)",
      "West Ham certainly need some additions after their disappointing campaign. Young Celtic star Daniel Cummings will join West Ham this summer at the end of his contract and the move could be announced imminently.",
      "Wolves - Kieran Morrison (Liverpool)",
      "With Cunha on the move, Wolves need to add bodies in attack. But it appears that their concentration is elsewhere for now. Reports have suggested that the Black Country side have made an approach for young Liverpool midfielder Kieran Morrison.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Worst Premier League season in their history, no trophies, terrible performance in the Europa League final.",
      "One of the biggest budgets in Europe but won only 11 of 38 league games. Nobody could have dreamed it would be as bad as this. Ruben Amorim needs a total rebuild.",
      "Sav predicted: 3rd",
      "Before Vitor Pereira came in, they were in big trouble and shipping goals for fun. But he strung together six wins in a row and won the hearts of fans by celebrating with them in the pub. Matheus Cunha is off to United, so that’s a big piece of the jigsaw to replace.",

      "Sav predicted: 6th",

      "Sav predicted: 18th",
      "Again, no surprise that they went down - but the Tractor Boys were one of the biggest spenders in Europe last summer (£120 million) and I expected them to put up more of a fight than just six points from the last available 54.",
      "Sav predicted: 19th",
      "Sorry, but Saints were pathetic. If they hadn’t beaten Derby’s record low of 11 points I would have given them a big fat zero marks, but they managed to beat the Rams’ low-water mark in 2008 by a single point.",

      "Brentford boss Thomas Frank has warned Manchester United that Bryan Mbeumo will cost \"a lot\" of money this summer. The Cameroon international was one of the Premier League's most-potent attackers this season, notching up 20 goals and seven assists for the Bees.",
      "However, Brentford have reluctantly accepted that after nearly six years in west London, Mbeumo could now be set to depart the club and move onto pastures new.",
      "United and Newcastle are eyeing the 25-year-old but Frank insists the Bees won't rollover during transfer negotiations.",
      "The Dane told Tipsbladet: “It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount. It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot.",
      "“Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done. There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for.\"",
      "When asked to shed light on the extent of potential interest, Frank added: “I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don’t look at him. I would be surprised with what he has to offer.",
      "\"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.”",
      "Between Mbeumo and fellow forward Yoane Wissa, the pair hit 39 goals in the Premier League this term despite losing Ivan Toney to Saudi Pro League side Al-Ahli last summer.",
      "Mbeumo has just over one year left to run on his current contract but Brentford do have a one-year extension option which the club can activate. United are in the market for attacking reinforcements for Ruben Amorim but they're operating with limited finances after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham. They've now activated Matheus Cunha's release clause, worth £62.5million, so their spending power will now be dictated by player sales.",
      "Newcastle have long been chasing Mbeumo and he has been on their radar for some time while Arsenal had previously looked at the highly-rated winger.",
      "Speaking towards the end of the season, Frank admitted that Brentford remain a selling club and pinpointed that unfortunately, they would struggle to keep hold of their best players moving forward.",
      "The Bees narrowly missed out on UEFA Conference League football but they did secure their second top-half finish in three seasons, ending up in 10th spot.",

      "Manchester United needed to come from behind in Hong Kong on Friday as they brought their miserable season to a close in what could end up being Bruno Fernandes' last game for the club. There was at least one bright spark, though, with Chido Obi's double turning a half-time deficit into victory.",
      "After a shock defeat in midweek against the ASEAN All Stars, Ruben Amorim wanted a response. There were some promising early moments, but it was Hong Kong who struck first as Juninho's effort beat Tom Heaton all too easily.",
      "It remained 1-0 at the break, and United boss Ruben Amorim changed his entire XI at the break. The changes bore fruit within a few minutes, with Obi equalising impressively, and fellow sub Ayden Heaven had a chance to make it 2-1.",
      "There was still some danger on the break, though, with sub keeper Altay Bayindir needing to be alert to deny Lau Ka Kiu midway through the second period. As the match entered the final 20 minutes, though, United kicked on and Kobbie Mainoo got an opening but couldn't keep his shot down.",
      "United also saw a penalty appeal waved away when Mason Mount went down in the box. It was Obi who settled the tie, though, sending a glancing header into the far corner, and Heaven's stoppage-time header made it three.",
      "United looked full of energy in the opening minutes, with Rasmus Hojlund getting a sight of goal early on, but the striker was unable to beat Hong Kong keeper Ka Wing Tse. United had the ball in the net not long after, with Casemiro sending a diving header into the nt, but the flag went up for offside.",
      "Tse made a couple more sharp saves insde the first half hour to keep Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho at bay. The pair were among the senior stars handed starts by Ruben Amorim, while youngsters including Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson also got minutes from the get-go",
      "Before the game, much of the conversation surrounded Bruno Fernandes. He was reported to be open to a United exit. Al Hilal appear to be the most likely suitors, with a £100million transfer fee mooted as well as a £200m contract.",
      "United are said to be relaxed about the situation, and there was no danger of their skipper sitting this one out. His usual creativity was on show early on, but Casemiro hasd strayed just offside before heading home the captain's free-kick.",
      "He came close to breaking the deadlock with another free-kick, with the ball moving wildly and almost deceiving Tse. There was an even bigger chance 10 minutes before half-time, but he opted to attempt a rabona when one-on-one with the keeper and saw it blocked, and only time will tell whether that ends up being Fernandes' final game for the club",
      "It was another scoreless game for Rasmus Hojlund, despite his early sight of goal. A second chance arrived late in the first half, only for the Dane to allow an opposition defender to snuff out the chance, and his recent record still stands at just one goal in the last month.",
      "Chido Obi found things far easier after taking his place, though. The young striker replaced Hojlund for the second half and wasted little time finding the net.",
      "His goal was an impressive one, too, with the teenager spinning and firing confidently into the bottom corner. He had more chances before his late winner, and the movement was something Hojlund lacked during his 45 minutes.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho si another who could be on his way, and perhaps he saw this game as a chance to show his quality and willing to potential buyers. He delivered a jinking run and early shot to test Hong Kong's keeper early on, and another run saw him set up a great chance which Shea Lacey sent wide of the far post.",
      "In recent weeks, Garnacho's exit has looked like a matter of when and not if. The same thing appeared to be true in January as well, though, and he ended up sticking around.",
      "Amorim may well have already decided Garnacho is among those players who needs to be sold to raise transfer funds. At his best, though, he can certainly be a difference-maker - it just so happens that he may end up taking on that role for someone else next season.",
      "Heavy rain in Hong Kong ahead of the game made the pitch slow at times, and United paid the penalty. Most notably, Garnacho looked poised to connect with an inviting early cross from Jaydan Kamason, only for the ball to hold up on the turf and allow an opposition defender to clear up.",
      "It was harder to determine whether the slippery conditions might have had something to do with the opener. Either way, the veteran will feel as though he was beaten too easily by the first shot to come his way.",
      "A bigger challenge in difficult conditions can be the risk of injury. Thankfully for United, there was no sign of any setback on that front.",
      "Ahead of the game, Ruben Amorim spoke about his decision to continue blooding first-teamers during the tour. \"Yes because we need to respect and do better than the last game,\" he said.",
      "\"We understand the players are tired from all the commercial things for our fans. Now it's time to perform to show good things for our fans.\"",
      "It has been, by every conceivable measure, a season to forget for United. It's now over, though, and they can finally look towards the future.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Paul Scholes has urged Manchester United to cash in on Bruno Fernandes this summer because the £100million sum offered for him is too good to turn down. The Red Devils legend also believes Fernandes can be detrimental to Ruben Amorim’s tactics because he “confuses the system”.",
      "The Portugal international, 30, has become a top priority of Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window. Al-Hilal are understood to have held lengthy talks with Fernandes’ representatives over a lucrative contract this week, with those discussions improving their chances of signing the United captain.",
      "Fernandes, who joined the Red Devils in January 2020, led the side to their worst-ever Premier League finish this term. And it is believed he is seriously considering quitting United next week as Al-Hilal look to sign the playmaker in time to field him at the upcoming Club World Cup.",
      "Fernandes himself has failed to provide any assurances about his future, while his post-match interview comments after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham last week sparked concerns that he was ready to leave.",
      "Old Trafford bosses, however, are reportedly relaxed about the situation and are willing to listen to offers for any member of their squad, including Fernandes. Having missed out on a significant windfall by failing to qualify for the Champions League, INEOS understand that they will need to sell players in order to rebuild the squad while complying with strict Financial Fair Play and Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR).",
      "Equally relaxed about Fernandes' potential departure is club legend Scholes. The 11-time Premier League champion said on The Overlap Fan Debate: “They are talking about £100m for him. Man United cannot say no to that.",
      "“You know when you talk about this system as well, I know he has been brilliant and carried the team on his back but where does he play? What is his position? Do you see him as a number 10? Do you see him as a holding midfielder?",
      "“He almost confuses the whole system because he doesn’t have that one position for him. I mean he has been brilliant don’t get me wrong. But when you’re getting £100m for him you snap their hand off and take it.”",
      "Pundit Jamie Carragher agreed, saying: “I’ve always described Bruno Fernandes as a great talent but not a great player. Where does he play?",
      "“He’s a bit mad in that he just runs all over the place, like a kid in the school yard. The best player in the school yard doing everything but in a really poor team. I don’t think he’s ever had any discipline in those No. 10 positions.”",
      "The four-time United Player of the Season's manager, Amorim, however, has made it clear he wants Fernandes to stay. The Portuguese head coach sang the midfielder’s praises during the club’s post-season trip to Asia this week.",
      "Asked about the present situation, Amorim said: \"We’ve talked about this many times. You can see by his performances. You can see by his leadership.",
      "“You can see the passion he has for the game. In difficult moments Bruno is the guy who takes responsibility. He should do because he is the captain.\"",

The Portuguese admitted that Bruno Fernandes started against Hong Kong because his team had to improve following a defeat to ASEAN All-Stars in Kuala Lumpur.",
      "The fixtures are set to land United around £8million in additional funds as the club, led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, continues its attempts to find their way to more comfortable financial footing.

      "A team including Andre Onana, Harry Maguire, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro and Rasmus Hojlund lost United's opening game in Malaysia. Fernandes only played the second half of that fixture but the Red Devils captain was on the pitch from the outset against Hong Kong.",

      "Yet United's current pull in the market is now under threat, meaning the midfielder is believed to be weighing up the decision to move on, with Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal said to be circling him.",
      "United's loss in the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur and their subsequent inability to offer European football next season means luring some of the game's biggest stars to Old Trafford may prove difficult. Mounting financial concerns will also provide a hurdle for Ruben Amorim this summer.",
      "Speaking to the club's website upon signing his contract extension, Fernandes said: \"The club knew that I want to compete with the best teams. They knew that we needed to improve the team. And I think that we’re doing that.",
      "\"I said to the, ‘I don’t need you to promise me that we’re going to win the league, because no one can promise that. But at least that we will have a team to compete and be competitive throughout the season, to try to achieve silverware and to compete at the highest levels.'\"",
      "Under former manager Erik ten Hag, United did hold their end of the deal last summer. Joshua Zirkzee, Leny Yoro, Matthijs de Ligt, Manuel Ugarte and Noussair Mazraoui were brought in for a combined fee believed to be in the region of £200million.",
      "However, Amorim has long been aware funds will likely be tight this summer. In a move that could signal some ambition to Fernandes, it's understood that United are looking to wrap up a £62.5m deal for Wolves forward Matheus Cunha.",
      "Regardless, Fernandes' agent, Miguel Pinho, is already believed to have held discussions with Al-Hilal about a stunning £100m transfer. United have also refused to rule out his possible sale after insisting that every member of their underperforming squad is up for sale.",
      "Al-Hilal are eager to conclude a deal quickly so Fernandes, 30, can play for them in the Club World Cup in the United States next month. After United's Europa League final defeat, Fernandes cast doubt on his future by suggesting the club could \"cash in\" on him.",
      "United signed Fernandes from Sporting CP in January 2020 for a fee rising to £67.7million. He was United's top scorer in 2024/25 with 19 goals and he retained the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award - an accolade he has won in four out of his six seasons at the club.",

      "Florian Wirtz has been told Arne Slot is a better manager than Erik ten Hag as the Liverpool boss was revealed to have played a major role in the German's potential move to Anfield. The future of the Bayer Leverkusen star was already set to be a major talking point this summer with the Premier League champions, Bayern Munich, and Manchester City all in the hunt for the 22-year-old.",
      "Conversations surrounding Wirtz's next move indicated that a transfer to the German champions was most likely until he conducted a meeting with Slot, alongside his father and agent, Hans-Joachim Wirtz.",
      "The intervention from the Reds boss was said to have proved critical in the attacking midfielder deciding to snub Bayern in order to move abroad for the first time in his career.",
      "According to Bild, the meeting on May 13 saw Slot provide Wirtz with a clear picture of where he'll fit within his title-winning team and was promised of a starring role in the side's attack.",
      "Becoming enamoured with promises of a central role within one of the world's best teams, as well as being informed of the fervent support that the club possesses from their fans, resulted in Wirtz's father informing Bayern executives Uli Hoeness and Max Eberl that it was Liverpool who had won the race for his son's signature.",
      "Wirtz could have ended up playing for Ten Hag next season, had he chosen to remain with Leverkusen, after the former Manchester United boss was announced as their new manager following the departure of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid.",
      "However, a move to Liverpool will see the Wirtz team up with the better manager, according to Mark Diemers. The Cambuur midfielder enjoyed spells playing under both managers, having spent a brief period alongside the ex-United boss at Utrecht before joining Slot during his time at Feyenoord.",
      "Best positioned to give an opinion on the managerial abilities of both men, the 31-year-old had a clear opinion when admitting who he enjoyed working with more. \"I choose Arne Slot,\" he told ESPN Netherlands last year when asked about the best manager he has worked with.",
      "\"I can only talk from my time. I found Ten Hag insanely good tactically, so were his training sessions. I just didn’t think he was very good, at that time, on a human level. But that was already six or seven years ago. I thought Slot was a lot stronger on a human level.",
      "\"Look at what kind of clubs [Ten Hag] has worked at, so he must also have qualities on a human level. I still have contact with him via WhatsApp. Then he also comes across as very friendly to me. He will undoubtedly have grown on a human level as well.\"",
      "Despite the lack of consistent success in Manchester – and some issues in the dressing room – Ten Hag still managed to win two trophies in his time at the club as he made sure to maintain his status as a manager who is adept in capturing silverware.",
      "Ten Hag also won plaudits for his style of play at Ajax, which encouraged United to initially make a move for the 55-year-old. However, it's Slot who has arguably managed to cement himself as the better of the two in recent times following title successes with Feyenoord and, of course, Liverpool in his first season in as boss of the Premier League club."

It didn't take long for Ince to establish himself in Serie A. He dominated the midfield while wearing the No. 8 shirt of the Nerazzurri, and their iconic fan base took him in as one of their own - quite literally on one occasion.",

To this day, I want to do it again, I’d love to do it again. I did not get many red cards in the Premier League. But in Italy, it was different. Players were rolling over, feigning injuries.",
      "\"I got sent off about three times, which was very rare for me. I was a strong tackler, but in Italy, I got sent off a lot. I think the fans loved me because of that. The fans were devastated when I left. The fans still love me and still idolise me, so it was great.”",
      "He would go on to leave Inter and return to Liverpool after two seasons, in a move that broke the hearts of the Italian giants and their ultras. Family reasons is what drove Ince back to England. Despite his exit, he is still admired by fans at the club to this day, so it's hard to imagine he'd struggle to secure another invite from the ultras.",

      "News of Bruno Fernandes considering a Manchester United exit will come as a bitter blow to head coach Ruben Amorim as he attempts to transform the Red Devils' fortunes this summer. Fernandes is said to be seriously weighing up a move amid a mega-money offer from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal.",
      "Despite United's dismal season, finishing 15th in the Premier League, Fernandes once again was a standout player in the division. The Portuguese international scored 19 goals and provided 20 assists amidst a poor season for the club.",
      "United's captain is subject to a potential £100million transfer fee, and a huge £200m contract. The player's agent met with the suitors earlier this week, and talks are reported to have run late into the night as Al Hilal set a tight deadline on a decision from Fernandes with a Club World Cup campaign looming..",
      "United are said to be 'relaxed' regarding the situation with a £100m bid seeing a significant profit that they would be able to reinvest in the squad. But it would be no small feat to replace Fernandes' contributions in recent seasons.",
      "And it would ensure Amorim's task is all the more difficult heading into his first pre-season with the club. The 40-year-old has already made it clear how important he believes Fernandes to be.",
      "Amorim said on Tuesday that Fernandes \"is really important for us and what we want to build for the team. We talk about this many times.",
      "\"You can see by his performances. You can see by his leadership. You can see the passion he has for the game.",
      "\"In difficult moments, Bruno is the guy who takes responsibility. He should do because he is the captain.\"",
      "Fernandes however, appeared to accept that an exit could be on the cards earlier this month. The United star appeared to put the ball in the club's court over a move.",
      "Speaking after the Europa League final defeat to Tottenham, Fernandes said: \"If the club thinks it's time to part ways because they want to do some cashing in or whatever, it's what it is.",
      "\"Football sometimes is like this. I've always said I will be here until the club says to me that it's time to go.",

The Nigeria international spent last term on loan at Galatasaray after the Serie A side failed to secure a permanent move away for the forward after signing Romelu Lukaku.",

      "Italian outlet Il Napolista has claimed Hojlund could be used as part as a swap deal that would see Napoli part ways with Osimhen however. United may need to foot up an additional £33.7m to land the 26-year-old.",
      "Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is said to have told intermediaries that Osimhen will be sold to the highest bidder this summer. The sharpshooter bagged 36 goals in 40 appearances in Turkey and the club is hoping that his €75m (£63m) release clause will be activated this summer.",
      "United's constrained finances mean that they may want to use Hojlund as a makeweight for Antonio Conte's side. And the Italian champions have already found success signing players from the 13-times Premier League and Scott McTominay has become a star since making the move.",

It is a strikingly similar situation to the one the Dutchman experienced at PSV Eindhoven, where he quit after telling players and staff he no longer felt “supported” by the club.",
      "History could very much repeat itself for the Foxes boss, who is still yet to receive any indication whether he will be kept on by the club going into next season. Leicester ended a dismal campaign with a 2-0 loss to Bournemouth last weekend as they fell back into the Championship.",
      "But current boss Van Nistelrooy says he is unable to plan for next season in the second tier and make signings because he hasn’t had a conversation with the board about the club’s plans. The 48-year-old said recently that whether he remains in charge “depends on how the conversations go”.",
      "And when quizzed about his plans for the upcoming season, Van Nistelrooy confessed: “I still have to wait at least to have a conversation on a future together or not. Before that, you cannot start planning. I need to speak to be able to get a feeling on hopes. It’s all dependent on that.”",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s state of limbo has fuelled speculation that he may be replaced by Russell Martin, formerly of Southampton, as the Foxes look for a manager with a prior history of clinching promotion to the Premier League.",
      "Van Nistelrooy has endured a disastrous tenure since replacing Steve Cooper at the King Power Stadium in late November, which saw their relegation to the Championship confirmed in April.",
      "The Foxes were one point clear of the relegation zone at the time of his appointment but a dreadful run of form followed, which saw them lose a whopping 16 games from 18 played between December and February.",
      "And it’s not the first time Van Nistelrooy has found himself at odds with club bosses. The Manchester United legend quit his old job as PSV boss in May 2023 over a lack of support from the Dutch giants just a year after taking charge of the senior side.",
      "It came as somewhat of a surprise, given that he'd won a Johan Cruyff Shield and a TOTO KNVB Beker, while also looking set to finish in second place in the Eredivisie.",
      "PSV at the time alluded to his falling out with the board, releasing a statement, which read: \"Van Nistelrooy told the first-team squad and coaching staff that he would be stepping down with immediate effect, due to a lack of support within the club.",
      "\"PSV regrets his decision and is grateful to him for winning the Johan Cruijff Shield and the Dutch Cup, and hopes to finish the season in second place.\"",
      "Van Nistelrooy’s next job came when he was appointed as Erik ten Hag's assistant ahead of the 2024/25 season. After a poor start to the campaign led to Ten Hag's dismissal, Van Nistelrooy took over in an interim capacity.",
      "The former Netherlands striker, however, was left feeling \"disappointed\" and \"hurt\" after being told to pack his bags by United's incoming boss, Ruben Amorim, who brought his own backroom team with him.",
      "Meanwhile, Van Nistelrooy’s potential successor, Martin, was sacked by the Saints in December and just 16 games into the Premier League season, having overseen an astonishing 13 defeats. Martin has also been touted for the vacant managerial position at Rangers.",

Correio da Manha reported the Gunners flew a contingent to Portugal for talks with the player's agent this week, while a move to Old Trafford would see Gyokeres reunite with former Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "Tomasson has admitted he usually likes to give players input on where to move, whether that be to benefit them in terms of playing time or stylistically. But the media circus that's erupted around Gyokeres has convinced him to remain out of the equation, at least in public.",
      "The former Blackburn boss, who took charge of Sweden's national team in 2024, has more of an inside scoop on the matter than most. But the 48-year-old was unwilling when asked if he would divulge whether he has a preference in where Gyokeres moves.",
      "\"No, of course not,\" he said while speaking to Swedish outlet Aftonbladet from the national team's training ground. \"Because then it would be blown up like this [stretches arms].\"",
      "Like most national team coaches, Tomasson said he prefers to select players who are getting regular minutes for their respective clubs. He added that he regularly speaks to his players about \"what would be a good and bad club,\" but it appears an exception will be made in Gyokeres' case, unless he reaches out for advice.",
      "\"There are definitely players changing clubs! We know that each year,\" he continued. \"If you look at each player, you need to make the right choice.",
      "\"You actually don't know if it's the right choice before you're at the club. You have family as well you have to have in mind. It's not easy, but at the end of the day, that's [football].\"",
      "Gyokeres, who turns 27 on Wednesday, is arguably the form frontman in Europe after scoring 97 goals in 102 outings for Sporting. And those in his inner circle have been unabashed in admitting they want him to remain in Lisbon.",
      "The player's uncle, Chris, revealed his nephew's summer prospects were a hot topic of discussion at a recent family dinner. And he left no doubt as to where he'd like to see the former Coventry talent end up next season.",
      "\"Yes, very much,\" he told Sport.TV, when asked if he and the family felt connected to Lisbon. \"Yesterday at dinner, we decided that he has to stay.\"",
      "It was during the recent celebrations at the Taca de Portugal final that Gyokeres' girlfriend also gave her take on the situation. And actress Ines Aguiar was quoted saying she \"promised\" to do her utmost to convince him to stay at Sporting for a third campaign."

      "Leading the line for Manchester United is such an unappealing and onerous task that a City reject has rejected them. A United striker finally emerged as their matchwinner in Hong Kong.",
      "Chido Obi, the more frugal and callow Danish striker signing by United, clinically claimed his maiden goal for the first team. Obi replaced Rasmus Hojlund at half-time and took five minutes to crash the ball into the net. And crash the WiFi.",
      "Liam Delap’s decision to join Chelsea over United is merely a stay of execution for Hojlund. United need a proven goalscorer, not one born four days after Hojlund and jettisoned by City’s academy to a promoted team who Jason Wilcox watched develop. United tried to cut corners with Delap’s release clause when they need a proven commodity.",
      "Obi is not ready for competitive matches but his goals will do him no harm. Just as impressive as his equalising strike was his reaction. He eschewed celebrations in favour of fishing the ball out of the net.",
      "The 17-year-old ought to have converted with one header and the next time he rose to meet the ball he glanced it into the corner. With fan favourites long since substituted, the crowd in the Hong Kong Stadium switched their affections to Obi.",
      "Obi was still pressing intensely in added time. One of United staff’s bugbears with Hojlund is they reckon he does not exert himself enough. Obi applied himself as though he sensed an opportunity. His tour ended with a man of the match award.",
      "His winning goal fuelled such optimism that there was a rendition of “Glory glory Man United” from the Hong Kong crowd. Whoever United’s starting striker is next season, Obi has had enough time around the first team to at least remain involved in that set-up for what will be a sparser season without European football.",
      "There was little to savour when he scored his first goal as United were 1-0 down again. Their first half performance was in keeping with their annus horribilis; not scoring before conceding. United conceded the first goal in 32 of their 60 competitive games and they have tagged on a couple more in the post-season.",
      "United had 15 attempts to Hong Kong’s one in the first half. No prizes for guessing which side scored. United encountered a Sergio Aguero in Kuala Lumpur. This time, the namesake of another scourge from their past was on target in Juninho.",
      "At least the outcome was different for United this time. The mood was described as “downbeat” after the loss to ASEAN All-Stars, if you can believe that, and as meaningless as these matches are many at the club will breathe a sigh of relief that they avoided a second defeat in Asia.",
      "The players will not be doom-scrolling on their smartphones when they board their flight back to Manchester on Friday evening.",
      "This was certainly a farewell appearance for Jonny Evans and possibly Bruno Fernandes and Alejandro Garnacho. Amorim had been asked at his pre-match press conference whether both would start after Lionel Messi caused a furore in Hong Kong last year by withdrawing from an Inter Miami exhibition match. Fernandes and Garnacho were in the United line-up that pressed the flesh of local dignitaries.",
      "Fernandes elicited cheers when he appeared on the large screen and there was a hearty cry of \"Bruno, Bruno, Bruno\" from the crowd as he lined up for a free kick. The adoration was louder for Garnacho on the ball.",
      "The United captain was still his usual self, bickering with Casemiro after his teammate strayed offside for a disallowed goal and advising Harry Amass to chest the ball rather than hopefully stick his leg out.",
      "Fernandes might have signed-off with one of his most audacious United goals but his one-on-one rabona - when one leg is wrapped around the other to poke the ball forward - was repelled. Hojlund naturally miscontrolled the ball on the follow-up before Jaydan Kamason’s drive was blocked on the line.",
      "It sounded suspiciously like a fan wielding a megaphone shouted, “Garnacho, you’re f*****g s**t.” Garnacho can take criticism to heart and was soon on his haunches on a cool and wet evening. It transpired that the fleeting rendition emanated from a section populated by Hong Kong fans.",
      "The Hong Kong ‘keeper Tse Ka Wing kept out Hojlund and Garnacho before Shea Lacey screwed a clear chance well wide. Lacey was substituted before the half-hour mark yet it was an achievement for him to be in Asia after a season where he was restricted to four starts for the academy. Starting for the first team was an unexpected reward.",
      "For Obi, staying in the first-team set-up would be his bonus."

      "Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes is giving serious consideration to joining Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal.",
      "Fernandes's agent, Miguel Pinho, has held discussions with Al-Hilal about a mooted £100million transfer and United have refused to rule out his possible sale.",
      "Al-Hilal are eager to conclude a deal quickly so Fernandes, 30, can play for them in the Club World Cup in the United States next month.",
      "United sources are relaxed about the situation, with the club prepared to listen to offers for any squad member after they finished 15th in the Premier League, their worst top-flight finish since relegation in 1974.",
      "After United's Europa League final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur last week, Fernandes cast doubt on his future by suggesting the club could \"cash in\" on him.",
      "United signed Fernandes from Sporting in January 2020 for a fee rising to £67.7million and he has won the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award in four out of six seasons at the club.",
      "However, United have endured some of their worst campaigns in living memory with Fernandes, who was a losing European finalist with United for the second time in Bilbao nine days ago.",
      "Fernandes was United's top scorer in 2024-25 with 19 goals and he retained the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year award. The Portugal international is on United's post-season tour in Hong Kong and has remained professional as he continues to carry out his responsibilities as club captain.",
      "United head coach Ruben Amorim said on Tuesday that Fernandes \"is really important for us and what we want to build for the team. We talk about this many times.",
      "\"You can see by his performances. You can see by his leadership. You can see the passion he has for the game. In difficult moments, Bruno is the guy who takes responsibility. He should do because he is the captain.\"",
      "Fernandes' Portugal career would not be in jeopardy if he moves to Saudi Arabia. Cristiano Ronaldo and Ruben Neves both continued to be picked by national team coach Roberto Martinez despite playing in the Gulf state."

      "Hello and welcome back to the Manchester United transfer blog on Friday, May 30.",
      "Yesterday was another tough one for United's recruitment department as one of their top targets decided to go elsewhere. Ipswich Town's Liam Delap has chosen to join Chelsea despite the Reds being able to activate his release clause of £30m.",
      "It is expected that the Blues will complete his deal this week and that means United need to turn their attention to alternatives. Napoli's Victor Osimhen is being heavily linked as an option for the Reds in lieu of Delap.",
      "There have been reports that recruitment director Matt Hargreaves is in Naples to try and thrash out a deal. Osimhen will likely want to get his business done sooner rather than later, considering how his exit last summer fell through on deadline day.",
      "Sporting's Viktor Gyokeres has also been linked to United thanks to his close relationship with Ruben Amorim. However, it appears the Reds are in a long queue for him which now looks to include Liverpool.",
      "Stay tuned to all the latest news from United's summer transfer window below...",
      "According to The Athletic, Delap will undergo his medical on Monday ahead of a potential move to Chelsea.",
      "The report claims Chelsea met the £30m release clause in the striker's contract. This was activated following Ipswich Town's relegation to the Championship.",
      "Despite attracting interest from the likes of Man United, AC Milan and Juventus - Delap has informed the Blues over his preference to move to west London.",
      "Chido Obi put in an impressive display for Man United in their post-season fixture against Hong Kong.",
      "The young striker scored twice as United claimed a 3-1 victory at the Hong Kong Stadium. Ayden Heaven was also on the score-sheet after Jorginho put the hosts in front, as United made a second-half comeback with three goals.",
      "Obi currently wears the No.56 shirt for United, which is the same number which was handed to him when he first arrived at Old Trafford and featured for the first-team. This summer could be the time that United put their faith in the striker and give him a new number for the upcoming season.",
      "Several numbers are set to be available to new signings this summer - as well as for current members of the squad who are deserving of an upgrade. If United do decide to give Obi a new number there are several options available. The No.19 is currently vacant at United, having previously been worn by Raphael Varane until his departure in the summer of 2024. No.14 is also set to be available once Christian Eriksen leaves as a free agent.",
      "No.10 is currently worn by Marcus Rashford, No.12 by Tyrell Malacia and No.21 by Antony, with all three men facing uncertain futures going into the summer. United also have every number from 27 up to 36 available, to either new signings or for in-house upgrades.",
      "It has been another remarkable season for Viktor Gyokeres at Sporting Clube de Portugal, having won the Liga Portugal Betclic and the Portuguese Cup, while he was also named Player of the Season amid ongoing transfer links to Man United.",
      "As he now prepares to join up with the Sweden national team, coach Jon Dahl Tomasson was inevitably asked whether he could offer any hints about the player's future.",
      "\"Of course, I'm not going to say,\" he said when asked about which club Gyokeres should join. \"Otherwise there would be an explosion. There will definitely be players changing clubs.",
      "\"We know that every year. If we look at each player, the right choice must be made before heading to a certain club. We also have family and we have to keep that in mind. It's not easy. At the end of the day, that is football.\"",
      "Bruno Fernandes' future at Manchester United has become the subject of intense speculation in recent days following the conclusion of the 2024/25 Premier League season.",
      "The news should not come as any real surprise to the club, given the 30-year-old’s response when he signed a contract extension in August last year. At the time, he is said to have made it clear to co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe that he expected the club to sign top-tier players capable of competing at the highest level.",
      "Read more here.",
      "The former Man United goalkeeper has extended his contract with Fiorentina - signing a deal until the summer of 2028.",
      "The 34-year-old had reportedly been the subject of interest from AS Monaco but has chosen to commit his future to the Italian side.",
      "De Gea left Man United in 2023 after 12 seasons at Old Trafford.",
      "Brentford head coach Thomas Frank has confirmed it will take \"a lot\" of money for them to cash-in on Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "United have been credited with interest in the Cameroon international this week amid their hunger to strengthen their attacking options ahead of next season. With interest in the former Troyes man expected to be rife this summer, Bees chief Frank has made it clear the Londoners must attempt to try and command the biggest fee possible for him this summer.",
      "\"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,\" Frank told Tipsbladet. \"It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. Then it is clear that it is impossible to replace him one for one. It cannot be done.",
      "\"There is a reason why he costs x number of million pounds, and we do not have x number of million pounds to buy for. I would say that I would be surprised if a lot of big clubs don't look at him.",
      "\"I would be surprised with what he has to offer. How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\"",
      "According to Spanish newspaper Marca, Betis are expected to submit another loan offer for Antony.",
      "However, United are keen to recoup a significant portion of the £82 million they spent on him in 2022. The La Liga club is also reportedly considering purchasing a share of Antony’s rights, the report adds.",
      "Speaking of the Brazilian, Betis boss Manuel Pellegrini said: \"Antony is a very good player. I am absolutely sure that this is a huge time he had in Betis to continue improving his career.\"",
      "MEN Sport understands that United are keen to sell Antony permanently this summer to drum up funds for Ruben Amorim's rebuild project.",
      "According to BILD, Manchester United have 'earmarked' Sesko as a potential reinforcement for their attack this summer.",
      "This comes after their reported failure to land Liam Delap, who is reportedly favouring a move to Chelsea. The report also states that United chief Omar Berrada has personally endorsed the move for the 21-year-old after conducting several individual assessments of the striker’s progress.",
      "Berrada is even believed to have watched Šeško in action during RB Leipzig’s recent 3-2 win over Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga.",
      "Sesko is also attracting interest from Arsenal.",
      "The Man United captain is a target for Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal this summer.",
      "\"They are talking about £100m for him. Man United cannot say no to that,\" Scholes said on the Overlap Fan Debate.\"You know when you talk about this system as well, I know he has been brilliant and carried the team on his back but where does he play? What is his position?",
      "“Do you see him as a number 10? Do you see him as a holding midfielder?",
      "\"He almost confuses the whole system because he doesn’t have that one position for him. I mean he has been brilliant don’t get me wrong. But when you’re getting £100m for him you snap their hand off and take it.\"",
      "Andreas Georgson has left Manchester United after ten months as a first team coach.",
      "Georgson joined United as their set piece coach in July and was retained by Ruben Amorim following the dismissal of Erik ten Hag in October. Amorim discarded assistant coaches Ruud van Nistelrooy and Rene Hake, as well as goalkeeping coach Jelle ten Rouwelaar, but kept Georgson and Darren Fletcher.",
      "He was not present during the post-season tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong following talks with Amorim and technical director Jason Wilcox. Sources say Georgson acknowledged there was less space in the new set-up for the role he was originally brought in for. Amorim has put his assistant, Carlos Fernandes, in charge of set pieces.",
      "Georgson said: \"It has been a fantastic experience serving as first team coach at Manchester United and I will always be proud of my association with such a great football club. This period of my career has now come to an end as I leave to find a new challenge elsewhere. While excited about the opportunities ahead, I am sad to be leaving so many great colleagues and friends at Carrington, who make Manchester United truly special.",
      "\"Even during such a tough season, the professionalism and dedication of the players and staff never wavered and I know there will be better times ahead. I want to thank Jason, Ruben and Erik for the opportunities they gave me, and wish everyone at the club the best of luck for the future.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim does not think Bruno Fernandes will leave Manchester United.",
      "Fernandes is giving serious consideration to leaving the club and his agent, Miguel Pinho, was pictured meeting officials from the Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr.",
      "The 30-year-old captained United in a 3-1 win against a Hong Kong XI in their final post-season tour match on Friday and was substituted at half-time as Amorim fielded an entirely different team for the second half.",
      "Fernandes has not told United if he wants to leave and he conducted meet-and-greet signing sessions with fans after the match. Although Amorim hopes his compatriot remains at Old Trafford, he also admitted no one knows for certain whether Fernandes will stay or go.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "Manchester United have reportedly organised a meeting with Real Betis to discuss the future of winger Antony this summer.",
      "The Brazilian had a difficult time at Old Trafford and when Erik ten Hag was sacked in October and replaced in November by Ruben Amorim, the writing was on the wall for him.",
      "In January, the Reds agreed a loan deal until the end of the season with the Seville club for Antony and it was an unexpected success.",
      "United's loanee became a key player for Real Betis and helped them qualify for the Conference League final. Despite falling just short of European glory, it remains a good season for the La Liga club as they bagged a spot in next season's Europa League thanks to their domestic finish.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has urged the club to accept a £100million offer for Bruno Fernandes this summer, stating that the sum is too large to refuse.",
      "He also expressed concerns that Fernandes disrupts Ruben Amorim's tactics as he \"confuses the system\". The Portuguese international, 30, has reportedly become a top target for Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal ahead of the summer transfer window.",
      "It's understood that Al-Hilal have been in lengthy talks with Fernandes' representatives about a lucrative contract this week, which has increased their chances of signing the United captain.",
      "MORE HERE.",
      "According to German publication Kicker, new Bayer Leverkusen head coach Erik ten Hag is planning a double raid on United once Florian Wirtz is sold.",
      "It is understood the Dutchman is keen to sign Antony and Garnacho this summer as he looks to add new recruits to his squad.",
      "The United duo hold good relationships with Ten Hag and both men are available to be sold this summer.",
      "While on the surface it seems like a disaster that Gyokeres and Delap look set to move to clubs that aren't United, Amorim has already insisted that he is unfazed if they choose another team.",
      "In a press conference when asked about the importance of Champions League football to attract players, Amorim insisted that players would be signing for the wrong reasons if they only wanted to play for United because of the competition.",
      "Gyokeres deal? I didn't talk to him. But if a player only wants to come to Man United to play Champions League, then he won’t come. We want players who want to represent United, not players who want to play certain competitions.",
      "United's push to sign Gyokeres looks to be falling flatter by the day as new reports emerge from Portugal.",
      "According to Record, both Chelsea and Juventus have made approaches to Gyokeres this week in a bid to sign the Swede.",
      "Liverpool are also gaining popularity in the race to sign the striker and currently sit 11/2 with bet365 to get a deal over the line.",
      "According to Marca, United have a meeting booked in with Real Betis next week to discuss the future of Antony.",
      "It is claimed the two clubs are meeting to discuss 'different scenarios' however another loan spell in Seville has been ruled out by the Reds.",
      "Antony impressed at Real Betis since moving to the club in January and MEN Sport understands he is one of the players the club has earmarked to sell to raise funds for Amorim's rebuild.",
      "Amid all the talk of the United captain's future, there is a post-season friendly against Hong Kong to sink our teeth into.",
      "Fernandes will start for the Reds as will Garnacho who has been told he can leave the club this summer.",
      "United starting XI vs Hong Kong: Heaton; Fredricson, Evans, Kukonki; Kamason, Casemiro, Fernandes, Amass; Lacey, Garnacho; Hojlund.",
      "Substitutes: Bayindir, Armer, Heaven, Munro, Dorgu, Kone, Collyer, T. Fletcher, Mainoo, Moorhouse, Ugarte, Mount, Thwaites, Amad, Obi.",
      "You can follow the friendly HERE.",
      "Having drawn a blank in Malaysia against ASEAN All Stars, Hojlund was the subject of media questions to Amorim post-match.",
      "The United boss spoke coyly about the Dane and the need to add attacking reinforcements.",
      "Sometimes you cannot overthink the situations. Sometimes you go to holiday and then you arrive in the first day and you start a new season, even the environment in training ground can help all these players have more confidence. If you look at the data we improved in the last games. We have a lack of goals we will try to assess that and be prepared.",
      "According to Football Insider, Newcastle are leading United in the race to sign Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo this summer.",
      "The versatile attacking midfielder is thought to be available for £50m this summer.",
      "While United are keen on his signature, it is believed Newcastle with the pull of being in the Champions League next season are leading the way.",
      "Despite this update surrounding Fernandes' agent meeting Al Hilal, it is still clear that Amorim wants his captain to stay at the club and he is not looking to force him out.",
      "Speaking recently, Amorim explained:",
      "You can see by the performance, you can see by the leadership, the passion that he has for the game, so he’s really important. You could see that in the last game [Sunday’s 2-0 win against Aston Villa]. I felt that the team was without pressure and they performed quite well, everybody wants the ball. But we had some difficult moments and in those difficult moments you can see that Bruno is the guy that takes that responsibility. He should be because he’s the captain, he’s experienced, so he’s really important for us, and really important for what we want to build with this team.",
      "According to The Athletic, who have matched the information we have received, there is a feeling internally that Al Hilal's interest in Fernandes could have a knock on affect.",
      "It is believed that United sense that if they entertain a bid from the Saudi Pro League club, European teams will also enter the race for their captain.",
      "They claim that Fernandes would be earning, wages alone, £84m over the entirety of a four-year contract in Saudi Arabia.",
      "The stance in the United camp surrounding Fernandes is thought to be 'relaxed'.",
      "The club are refusing to rule out selling Fernandes this summer, with offers open for all United players.",
      "Despite uncertainty surrounding his future, Fernandes has remained professional while on the post-season tour in Asia.",
      "MEN Sport understands that United's captain is seriously considering leaving the club to join Al Hilal this summer.",
      "Fernandes's agent, Miguel Pinho, has held discussions with Al Hilal about a mooted £100m transfer and United have refused to rule out his possible sale.",

      "United meanwhile are insistent that Fernandes is not for sale.",
      "According to reports from Italian media outlet Il Napolista, United are negotiating a deal in Naples for Victor Osimhen.",

      "We are going to start by looking at United's Plan B now Delap has decided to join Chelsea.",
      "After a disappointing 2024/25 campaign, Manchester United will have been hoping their transfer strategy to help move past this was watertight.",
      "So with United being dealt a considerable blow in landing one of their top two targets, MEN Sport writers have their say here on how United can move past Delap and find another suitable target.",
      "Everyone connected with Manchester United knows they must sign a striker this summer.",
      "It's why there may be some disconnect that the Reds have missed out on what looked to be a relatively simple deal to sign Ipswich Town's Liam Delap. Here is a player with Premier League experience who is available for £30million after the Tractor Boys' relegation to English football's second tier.",
      "But would a young striker like Delap be able to cope with the pressure of leading the line for Ruben Amorim's side? It's a responsibility that has weighed heavily on the shoulders of Rasmus Hojlund since arriving from Atalanta. Moving from Ipswich to Old Trafford would be a huge step up.",
      "Read the full piece here",
      "Manchester United have been handed an update on Kobbie Mainoo amid transfer speculation surrounding the midfielder.",
      "Reports in March from The Guardianclaimed that Mainoo is minded to reject the offer of a new contract at ­Old Trafford and seek a move abroad. With just two years left on his current deal, United might eventually have to sell. The Reds' PSR position will likely force their hand.",
      "It is claimed that United value Mainoo at around £70million, but the question is whether any foreign club would be able to afford that fee. Only Premier League clubs tend to pay that price, unless you are Real Madrid, who may be too big of a step up for the Englishman right now.",

      "Manchester United ended their post-season tour with a 3-1 win against Hong Kong.",
      "The hosts opened the scoring at the Hong Kong Stadium and were leading at half-time, but United looked much better after several substitutions and they turned the game around.",
      "Chido Obi replaced Rasmus Hojlund at the break and scored twice, taking both of his goals brilliantly. Then Ayden Heaven scored in injury time to wrap up the victory.",
      "United will now give their players a chance for a break after a long campaign.",
      "So here are the moments you might have missed...",
      "Hong Kong were under the cosh in the opening 15 minutes of the game, but they weathered the storm and ruthlessly counter-attacked to take the lead through forward Juninho.",
      "Godwill Kukonki could have done better but Tom Heaton was at fault for the goal, allowing the shot to squirm into the net at his front post.",
      "Fernandes was sent through on goal and had a huge chance to equalise, however, he attempted an audacious rabona finish and his shot was blocked by goalkeeper Ka Wing Tse.",
      "In normal circumstances, Fernandes would have drilled the shot into the bottom corner, but he wanted to have fun and attempted a cheeky finish, which tells you what the players think of the post-season friendlies.",
      "Most supporters would have been working while United played Hong Kong, and the fans who weren't might have turned MUTV off before added time when Heaven scored.",
      "United were leading 2-1 and Heaven put the icing on the cake by scoring his first goal for the club in injury time, finding the top left corner after a wonderful cross from Amad.",
      "The defender didn't celebrate, but he did have a smile on his face. Heaven has been a stellar addition considering he was signed for just over £1million from Arsenal in January. Amorim recently gave him the ultimate compliment when he said United need to sign more players like him.",
      "Shortly after Casemiro's goal was disallowed in the fifth minute, he was spotted bickering with Fernandes about something. The pair exchanged a few words and perhaps Fernandes was questioning why the Brazilian was offside.",
      "Casemiro was offside when Fernandes stepped up to take the free-kick and he didn't get back onside quickly enough, which meant his headed goal was chalked off.",
      "It was unnecessary from Casemiro and Fernandes seemed to give him a telling off. That is his responsibility as captain, and there is no standout candidate to inherit the armband if Fernandes signs for Al-Hilal.",

      "United played 60 competitive games throughout the season, but they still flew halfway around the world after facing Aston Villa, with the purpose of raising roughly £10 million in cash.",

      "Hojlund looked the same as always against Hong Kong: blunt. He didn't look convincing against the 153rd-ranked national team in the world and took a few heavy touches in the box.",
      "It would be harsh and unfair to heavily scrutinise Hojlund's performance, given these post-season friendlies were arranged at the end of a long campaign, but it certainly wasn't the first time that Obi had replaced him from the bench and looked more capable of finding the back of the net.",
      "Obi was introduced for Hojlund on a few occasions in competitive games this season, and a clear pattern has emerged that suggests the Dane should be doing a lot more up front.",

      "Osimhen, 26, joined Galatasaray on a season-long loan deal last September after falling out with Napoli boss Antonio Conte and he was considered as something of a coup for the Turkish giant.",
      "Of his 36 goals, 25 of them were netted in the Super Lig, earning Galatasaray a whopping 21 points. Without them, Galatasaray would have surrendered their crown to Jose Mourinho and Fenerbahce, who finished 11 points behind in second.",
      "Many will be quick to suggest that the Turkish Super Lig is not the most challenging of leagues in Europe and has been a dumping ground for Premier League talent in recent years.",
      "Osimhen, though, has established himself as a seasoned goalscorer, scoring 84 goals in the last three seasons for Napoli and Galatasaray combined. He scored 26 goals in Serie A in 2022/23 to deliver Napoli their first league title since 1990.",

      "In Osimhen, United would be sourcing a proven goalscorer who has delivered the goods at whatever club he has played for. It is a striker of his calibre they need.",
      "The elephant in the room, of course, is that United cannot offer any prospective signings European football for next season. Osimhen played in the Europa League for Galatasaray this season, scoring six goals, and had played in the Champions League for two consecutive seasons with Napoli prior to that.",
      "However, the Nigerian, who is entering his prime years, has previously outlined his hunger to play in the Premier League, describing it as a \"dream\" back in 2023 - a time when both United and Chelsea were being heavily linked with him.",

However, if Osimhen is still as hungry to play in England, he may be willing to give up European football for a season and make it his mission to take United back to the Champions League.",
      "If United are to swoop for him, he would be signed to spearhead their attack, making him a guaranteed starter.",

      "With star player Bruno Fernandes said to be taking an offer to sign for Saudi Pro League outfit Al-Hilal into serious consideration, Manchester United could be faced with their biggest decision of the summer.",
      "United, as with all players on their books this summer, have refused to rule out that possibility.",
      "Fernandes has arguably been Old Trafford's greatest servant throughout a forgettable era. Ever since signing from Sporting CP in January 2020 for £47m, the midfielder has made 290 appearances, scoring 98 goals and assisting 87.",
      "He was appointed captain in 2023, winning one of his two major trophies for United wearing the armband.",
      "It's beyond any question that his contributions have made him a fan favourite and at a time there has been very little to celebrate.",
      "With his contract through to 2027 - and the option of a further year - selling Fernandes to Al-Hilal is very much a decision between sporting and financial value. Here, the MEN Sport writers run the rule over which way this saga should go;",
      "United could quite clearly do with the money. Getting £100million for a 30-year-old, that is the kind of offer that requires no second thought at all.",
      "But that's under normal circumstances. With 15 goals and 13 assists, no United player has contributed more in the time Ruben Amorim has been in charge.",
      "His role extends beyond that of a talisman, as he's a leader and a focal point for supporters to rally behind in the dark times at Old Trafford.",
      "For now, they can't risk losing their best player. I also don't trust them to replace him properly. Maybe in a year's time, if conditions are more stable and a similar offer were to be made, then it should be considered.",
      "After any other season, I would have backed United to sell Fernandes. An ageing player going for £100million, that would be a brilliant deal.",
      "However, who would United be able to lure to the club this summer after such a disastrous season, especially with Fernandes gone. He's the only glimmer of sunshine left at the club.",
      "If he goes, United look even less appealing. The thing with the Saudi Pro League clubs, like Al-Hilal, they are always looking for big name players to join them.",
      "Yes, they might not get the same money next year but, if United put their foot down now, have a better season next year - with a top-half finish and win a domestic cup - they would be in a much better position to sell. Right now, though, I would be saying thanks but no thanks, we will find our funds for Amorim's rebuild from elsewhere.",
      "Any club turning down £100million for a player who's seriously considering leaving and will soon turn 31 is hard to imagine. United, more so than most, because of their preparedness to sell any player this summer.",
      "Making a £30million-plus profit on what they paid for Fernandes five-and-a-half years ago also appeals amid what would be a welcome boost to their compliance with Premier League profitability and sustainability rules (PSRs). In the context of missing out on Liam Delap, and the impending signing of Matheus Cunha, there's an argument that the latter can help replace the playmaking they would lose from Fernandes leaving.",
      "Having those funds to spend would also make signing the striker they want this summer more viable, rather than being left with whichever option they can afford. Cunha and Viktor Gyokeres, maybe, coming in for Fernandes, will very much suit Amorim better, too.",
      "It would be madness for United to sell Fernandes after the season they've had. Imagine where they would have been without him? It's not a stretch to suggest they could have been looking over their shoulders at the bottom three - and with that relegation!",
      "Selling him in a year's time, when he has just a year left on his contract, would make more sense. I'm sure if United remain a mess on and off the pitch, that decision is likely to be a lot easier for the player, as well.",
      "For now, though - with so much else to do this summer - the last thing they need is to sell their best player. If he wants to leave, though, United will just have to accept that and hope someone like Cunha will be able to fill that void.",
      "Fernandes has been the one constant in an otherwise disastrous season for United and yet I think they should accept the £100million offer from Al-Hilal.",
      "There's no denying that United losing their captain and best player would be a major blow but, even if he stays, a significant rebuild is needed and completing that with more money may only be a positive thing. Splashing out the funds gained in the correct way is another matter entirely, however.",
      "United's recruitment over the last few years has not exactly been good, and putting such a huge transfer budget into the wrong hands could be dangerous especially with Antony, Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho and Jadon Sancho expected to depart permanently.",
      "Even without selling Fernandes, that should be £100million raised right there, but over half is going on Cunha and, therefore, if United want to bring in a new core of players, Fernandes may have to go."

      "United chiefs might find it difficult to turn down a huge offer from Al-Hilal and, in some ways, it would make sense to cash in considering the fee being mentioned for a 30-year-old player.",
      "That money could be reinvested and provide Ruben Amorim with a war chest to play with in the summer transfer window, but Fernandes is not an ordinary player and United cannot be trusted to reinvest wisely.",
      "United's shocking record in the transfer market does not inspire confidence that strong signings would offset Fernandes' departure, which is exactly why he must be kept this summer.",
      "Although the worst season in the club's modern history has just ended, there will be more pain if Fernandes leaves for Al-Hilal. Fernandes offers just as much away from the pitch as he does on it.",
      "He is an example to young players, he trains well and has tight relationships with all different kinds of staff at Carrington, so moral could be an issue if he departed.",

      "Justin Cochrane previously helped lead United's academy when Garnacho starred in the under-18s' FA Youth Cup victory in 2022. The then-17-year-old winger crowned that campaign by winning the Jimmy Murphy Young Player of the Year award, identifying himself as a future first-team talent.",
      "Cochrane, now a first-team coach at Brentford, noted the player's exceptional talent but also alluded to a mismatch between his conduct and prowess on the pitch. And while he refrained from being overly critical of the young talent, there were hints of possible issues with his behaviour.",
      "Talking to Goal in March 2022 about his efforts to keep Garnacho's ego in check, Cochrane said: \"I have a good relationship with Garnacho, and he knows that if he crosses the line, I'll come get him!\"",
      "The former QPR and Rotherham defender followed up by saying he and his staff were \"pleased\" with the player. However, the conversation again shifted to prioritising modesty, something that might not have come unless there were existing concerns.",
      "\"My job and the staff's job is to keep players grounded and keep their eyes on the prize,\" Cochrane added. \"Not just the youth prize, but the bigger prize of being in the first team and having a sustained career at a high level, so that's what we're focusing on with Garna.\"",
      "Amorim isn't the first United manager to have issues with Garnacho's behaviour. The Madrid-born star was previously chastised by Erik ten Hag after he 'liked' social media posts criticising his half-time substitution in a 2-2 draw against Bournemouth in April 2024.",
      "Ten Hag later revealed his player had apologised for the incident, suggesting they had put the matter behind them. However, Garnacho was subsequently dropped by the Dutchman in September 2024, shortly before he was sacked, for once again liking posts critical of the coach.",
      "Cochrane's comments from 2022 suggest a recurring pattern of behaviour that most coaches would prefer to avoid. And it seems Amorim has reached his limit, with the player apparently free to leave if an appropriate offer is made.",
      "Napoli have shown significant interest in the player during recent transfer windows. However, this potential move may be at risk due to reports suggesting Antonio Conte is ready to depart the club after just one season, having clinched the Serie A title.",
      "This could leave United in a rush to find a club willing to match their valuation for the player. But there's no confusion, it seems, that Amorim is ready to part ways should any outfit stump up the cash, with United supposedly wanting upwards of £60million."

      "Manchester United's season was not bookended by silverware, after all. After the Snapdragon Cup in pre-season, the Maybank Cup eluded them in the post-season tour.",
      "Neither would ever be housed in the Old Trafford museum or featured as attractions for picture opportunities as part of the stadium tour. Ruben Amorim looked uncomfortable enough to be standing behind the Maybank Cup at Tuesday's pre-match press conference.",
      "Amorim was in an invidious position. He would have dreaded hoisting a trophy barely befitting a Sunday League final yet United were beaten in a country they last visited for Michael Owen’s first appearance in July 2009.",
      "Friendlies can be an effective cure for insomniacs and this had all the hallmarks of unwatchable exhibition matches: A lack of goals, 27 players used by United alone, a light show and a Mexican Wave midway through the second half. Soccer Aid might be more competitive and dynamic.",
      "United first visited Malaysia 30 years ago and United at their very worst since relegation still drew a crowd: 72,550 was the official attendance in the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.",
      "True to form, United did not provide the game’s only goal as they went 1-0 down for the umpteenth time in the past 12 months. In the 84th minute, there was the familiar scenario of a United winger crossing into the penalty area only for the striker to be nowhere in sight.",
      "Five minutes later, Alejandro Garnacho abandoned selflessness but his shot was wayward. Bruno Fernandes looked at the heavens and his shoulders slumped. A familiar feeling. United got so desperate that Tom Heaton went up for an added-time corner.",
      "There was a Sergio Aguero in the ASEAN All-Stars line-up, but it wasn’t that one. Instead, Maung Maung Lwin wrote his name into Malaysian football folklore as the matchwinner against United.",
      "6,606 miles is an exceedingly long way to travel for a match you will learn nothing from. United have not pretended that the football is the priority on this commercial trip that will rake in £8million and the only positive was that some of their callow academy members were granted minutes.",
      "Garnacho briefly vanished down the tunnel during the first half, possibly to maximise the air conditioning. He was selected for the start of the second half and was cheered when he headed over to the far side. They were louder when Garnacho got the ball. Time will tell if it was the last time in the red of United.",
      "Eleven minutes into the second half, Garnacho was on his haunches, briefly overwhelmed by the humidity. The players had to peel their shirts off as though they had been stuck on.",
      "Andre Onana had his name aired for the first time in United colours. Harry Maguire was booed by casual spectators in Melbourne, Las Vegas and Dublin but here in Kuala Lumpur was cheered louder than ever whenever he received the ball.",
      "This was the first occasion that Maguire had captained United from the start since he was stripped of the captaincy in July 2023, extra validation for a player who had his contract extended earlier in the year.",
      "Fernandes inevitably generated the loudest chant upon his half-time arrival. Even Fernandes’ rabona - when a player wraps one leg around the other and pokes the ball forward - that went out for a goal kick drew widespread ‘ooh’s.",
      "The chanting briefly switched to \"Bruno stay, Bruno stay\". Fernandes could have clarified his future by now and has not done so. United have another press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday evening.",
      "The United fans were not entirely enthusiastic. An errant pass from Toby Collyer elicited jeers, with fans willing United to at least score.",
      "You work up a sweat just by sitting down in this part of the world. Fans were handed out to fans, it was that sweltering. Omar Berrada remained statesman-like, arriving in a club suit when he could have been forgiven for donning casual attire. Jason Wilcox is not in Asia ahead of the defining summer of his administrative career.",
      "When United were last in Asia in Bangkok three years ago, Jurgen Klopp played three different Liverpool outfield XIs against them. By the 20-minute mark at the Bukit Jalil, Shea Lacey, Jaydan Kamason, Dan Armer and Sekou Kone were already limbering up with the fitness coach Paulo Barreira.",
      "The quartet came on ten minutes later during a drinks break. Jack Moorhouse's maiden first-team exposure lasted 30 minutes. Casemiro, whose 19-month exile from the Brazil national squad ended with Carlos Ancelotti's appointment, gratefully traipsed off.",
      "Amorim was more drastic than Klopp. There were 11 changes at half-time, so Lacey, Kone, Armer and Kamason were not even afforded a quarter of the match. All but one of the second-half XI played 45 minutes.",
      "United used 27 players, overall. Altay Bayindir was the only unused matchday squad member, with Matthijs de Ligt, Joshua Zirkzee, Luke Shaw and Mason Mount all clad in leisure gear. United have another game in less than 48 hours, a four-hour flight away, in Hong Kong.",
      "They sang ‘Glory glory Man United’ in the stands. In a season that could not end soon enough for United, it goes on, on, on."

      "United’s favourite target for a while looked to be Ipswich’s Delap. They were among a host of Premier League sides who were willing to pay his £30million release clause, and it was even suggested they’d broadly agreed personal terms with his entourage, waiting for the green light from the striker himself.",

      "Paul Ince has revealed his opinion that an expensive Manchester United forward is “not ready” to play for the club as he feels they should allow him to leave and “find his feet.”",
      "United have some catching up to do in the Premier League. They finished 15th in the season just gone – their worst finish in the history of the competition.",
      "They will reportedly soon confirm the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolves, for £62.5million. The Red Devils will hope that the Brazilian fares better than other recent expensive attackers.",
      "Two years ago, United signed Rasmus Hojlund for £72million from Atalanta, and in 52 games in all competitions in his second campaign, he scored just 10 goals.",
      "Former United man Ince doesn’t feel he’s the right man yet for the club, and should be allowed to leave for a period in order to get his career back on track.",
      "“I feel sorry for Hojlund, because he’s not ready yet to play for Manchester United, he’s been thrown in the deep end. He needs that senior striker to take that weight off of him,” Ince said on talkSPORT.",
      "“I wouldn’t be averse to him going on loan for six months, to score goals, find his feet, and get a bit of confidence. People don’t understand that when you play for Manchester United, it’s about the mentality and dealing with the expectations.”",
      "Many believed United were overpaying for Hojlund, as he’d played a single season at Atalanta prior to heading to Old Trafford, in which he scored just 10 goals.",
      "The season just gone has shown that he has clearly not made the jump that United hopes he might, and that could lead to a transfer away.",
      "It’s believed one of the club’s directors has flown to Naples for a meeting with Napoli over a potential swap deal between Hojlund and Victor Osimhen.",
      "Interest from Inter Milan has also been reported for the Danish striker, so a return to Italy, where he played prior to United, looks the most likely course of action.",
      "Paul Parker feels a permanent transfer away would be best for Hojlund, as he has stated: “Rasmus Hojlund has to leave Manchester United for the sake of his own career. He needs a change of environment. Old Trafford chiefs will have to think about moving on Mason Mount too, he’s not athletic enough.",
      "“Ruben Amorim needs someone to play behind the centre forward, Man Utd have no player who runs beyond and that’s one of the things that might have helped Hojlund if he had someone who’d run to create more space for him.”",

      "We know he wants Champions League football, we know – according to the Guardian at least – that he does not want to play for a London club, and we know that Villa have agreed a £40m fee for Rashford but United would want more money from any other club.",
      "So where will he end up? These are the favourites for his home in 2025/26 according to the latest odds and reports:",
      "",
      "1) Barcelona\nThe ‘dream’, apparently. There was lengthy talk of a loan to the Spanish giants in January but they pulled other levers instead and Rashford is said to be keen to join ‘no matter what‘. The problem? Barcelona are said to be reluctant to pay £40m for Rashford, which is surely the very least that Manchester United will accept after he proved he is still a very effective and motivated footballer at Villa.",
      "The latest reports indicate that Barcelona will sign Rashford on loan next season.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United\nIs there a chance that he stays and is rehabilitated? It seems very bloody unlikely but it has happened before. Surely this is only a scenario if no Champions League club will pay £40m, in which case another loan seems rather more likely than being reintegrated by Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "3) Any Saudi Pro League club\nWe simply can’t see it. Surely even a reconciliation at Manchester United would be better than the desert.",
      "",
      "4=) Aston Villa\nHe’s there, he’s happy, he clearly has a good relationship with the manager and the club’s fans and he has played some excellent football for Villa as they reached the Champions League quarter-finals. But – and this is quite a big but – they are bound for the Europa League and Rashford, now more than ever, will feel like he is a Champions League player, which might lead him to…",
      "",
      "4=) PSG\nThe Champions League finalists – and conquerors of Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal – were said to be in ‘pole position’ for Rashford and that certainly makes a great deal of sense. They are long-time admirers, the £40m would be no issue and they are Champions League stalwarts. But would they really bring in Rashford so soon after forking out for the rather impressive Khvicha Kvaratskhelia?",

      "",
      "6=) AC Milan\nA throwback to the January move that never was, which was scuppered by Milan’s more pressing need for Kyle Walker. Milan cannot offer Champions League football so it feels like that particular ship has sailed.",
      "",
      "6=) Juventus\nAnother throwback to those January rumours, Juventus have not been linked ahead of the summer but they sneaked back into the Champions League, so they could be an option.",

      "32) 2003 – Juventus 0-0 Milan (2-3 on penalties)\nIt might seem reductive to consider the only goalless Champions League final as the worst, but the 2003 edition truly was a slog. It wasn’t without its moments – Andriy Shevchenko’s cruelly disallowed goal, Antonio Conte hitting the post and Andrea Pirlo striking the bar – but that second half in particular was a test of spectator endurance more than anything.",
      "Their Serie A meetings that season ended in a 2-1 win apiece but Old Trafford was treated to nothing of the sort. Even half the penalties were missed in the shootout as Dida ventured ever so slightly off his line.",
      "",
      "31) 2004 – Monaco 0-3 Porto\nTo prove that goals do not necessarily equate to a pulsating game, watch the 2004 Champions League final and retain your consciousness for the full 90 minutes. An audience not quite anaesthetised to the stylings of Jose Mourinho found that the novelty of two surprise success stories had worn off long before full-time as the Portuguese starved the occasion of any intrigue.",
      "Monaco failed to muster a single shot on target; Porto themselves only managed four as they registered less than 50% possession.",
      "",
      "30) 2010 – Bayern Munich 0-2 Inter Milan\nAs the BBC said at the time, it ‘might not have been one for the purists’. Mourinho was once at great pains to point out that he couldn’t properly empathise with Tottenham upon his appointment as manager in November 2019 because “I never lost a Champions League final”. This was a fine example as to why, as Inter channelled the determination and resilience of their semi-final victory over Barcelona to secure a remarkable Treble in unexceptional circumstances.",
      "It was also the first European Cup final to be moved back from a Wednesday to a Saturday, which remains one of the great first-world injustices of our time.",
      "",
      "29) 1993 – Marseille 1-0 Milan\nUEFA would perhaps rather the world forgot about the winner of its first revamped Champions League; the rest of the world would happily forget the final itself. Marseille reached it amid claims of corruption, bribery and much worse, while Milan boasted a side containing Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Gianluigi Lentini and Marco van Basten in his final game ever. They were kept at bay by Fabian Barthez, Marcel Desailly and Basile Boli, who scored the only goal shortly before half-time.",
      "",
      "28) 1996 – Ajax 1-1 Juventus (2-4 on penalties)\nA similarly sketchy final in hindsight again undeniably pitted the continent’s two best sides against one another, but the subsequent game was less than the sum of its numerous parts. Goalscorers Fabrizio Ravanelli and Jari Litmanen – both of whom capitalised on goalkeeping mistakes – would experience varying Premier League careers thereafter but even the former would struggle to conjure many memories besides his opener and lifting the trophy.",
      "",
      "27) 2021 – Manchester City 0-1 Chelsea\nWhile 19 points separated the two teams in the Premier League, Pep Guardiola helped bridge that chasm by turning his nose up at the idea of playing a holding midfielder. Thomas Tuchel welcomed the unexpected olive branch and a year after succumbing to a 1-0 defeat in the final with Paris Saint-Germain, the German engineered victory by the same scoreline thanks to Kai Havertz. But even Chelsea supporters would admit it was no classic.",
      "",
      "26) 2001 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Valencia (5-4 on penalties)\nThe all-penalty final saw Gaizka Mendieta and Steffan Effenberg trade spot-kicks in normal time, with Santiago Canizares saving from Mehmet Scholl, before Bayern triumphed in an eventual shootout. There were 28 shots so attacking football was not in particularly short order, but only goalkeeping fetishists would have truly enjoyed themselves.",
      "",
      "25) 2019 – Tottenham 0-2 Liverpool\nAn early goal can do one of two things to a match with such high stakes: galvanise the team that concedes and lead to a pulsating game; or encourage the scorers to become more defensive, resolute and frustrating as they seek to protect their advantage. The 2019 Champions League final was a prime example of the latter.",
      "Mo Salah put Liverpool in front in the second minute and while Tottenham were the better side thereafter, they never really recovered to the point where they threatened to equalise. Divock Origi provided the last slice of bread to a fairly mediocre sandwich just before the final whistle.",
      "After the ridiculous drama of the respective semi-finals, this was perhaps an understandable anti-climax and a case of the result being so very much more important than the performance.",
      "",
      "24) 2022 – Liverpool 0-1 Real Madrid\nThis final, moved to Paris from St Petersburg, is remembered most for the shambles which unfolded outside the Stade de France and the shameful cover-up that followed. On the pitch, it was the Thibaut Courtois final, with the Real Madrid keeper using his Mr Tickle arms to great effect, repelling everything Liverpool threw at him. After Vinicius Junior’s second-half strike, the belief slowly drained from the Reds with each stop Courtois made.",
      "",
      "23) 2000 – Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia\nThat both finalists came from the same country for the first time in European Cup history did not help the first showpiece of the new millennium. Real Madrid actually finished lower than Valencia in La Liga – fifth to third – but the nature of the destruction gave it an air of a typical domestic meeting rather than the biggest match of the season. Steve McManaman’s volley was lovely, mind.",
      "",
      "22) 2023 – Manchester City 1-0 Inter Milan\nThe expectation was perhaps this would be a poor final because it was such a mis-match between the best team in Europe and the third-best team in Italy, but the reality was that Inter did an excellent job of disrupting City, who rarely got into their stride. Rodri scored a belter but City barely bothered the Italians otherwise, and they found Ederson to be a stubborn opponent themselves. The result was historic but few will remember the game.",
      "",
      "21) 2007 – Milan 2-1 Liverpool\nA final can sometimes suffer for its lack of freshness. Milan and Liverpool, of course, had the unenviable task of living up to their incredible clash of just two years prior; they never really stood a chance. The three goals were little more than ordinary and partial Dani Alves alternative Jermaine Pennant was probably the best player, for Christ’s sake.",
      "",
      "20) 2017 – Juventus 1-4 Real Madrid\nMario Mandzukic’s equaliser, one of the three greatest goals in Champions League final history, deserved so much more. Juventus were primed to deliver as much as late as the hour mark as they were still level, but they simply could not keep up as Real feigned to help The Old Lady cross the road before pushing them into onrushing traffic.",
      "",
      "19) 2009 – Barcelona 2-0 Manchester United\nThere goes that curse of the early goal again, the bane of many a neutral. Samuel Eto’o scored in the tenth minute and Lionel Messi the 70th as a ludicrous Barcelona side were just a level or two beyond Manchester United, who had just one shot on target in each half.",
      "",
      "18) 1998 – Juventus 0-1 Real Madrid\n“The 1998 Champions League final was possibly the most important game in Real Madrid’s history,” winning captain Manolo Sanchis once suggested, their 32-year wait to be crowned European champions finally coming to an end in Amsterdam. It was an incredible moment, but a fairly ordinary game.",

      "17) 2016 – Real Madrid 1-1 Atletico Madrid (5-3 on penalties)\nIn terms of grit and battle, 2016 offered up precisely what one might expect from a Madrid derby helmed by Zinedine Zidane and Diego Simeone. A total of 42 shots and 34 fouls made for a titanic tussle that Real eventually edged in a shootout.",
      "",
      "16) 2020 – PSG 0-1 Bayern Munich \nThe only final played behind closed doors when Covid was acting the d*** could have been a drab affair in the absence of fans but PSG and Bayern put on a decent spectacle in Lisbon. Both sides had good chances in the first half, with PSG desperate for their first European crown, but Bayern’s Champions League know-how told when Kingsley Coman headed in a winner on the hour before the Germans absorbed everything Mbappe and co. could throw at them.",
      "",
      "15) 2024 – Borussia Dortmund 0-2 Real Madrid\nAnother final in which the predicted procession did an immense disservice to the underdogs and exposed the favourites. Dortmund were as excellent as Real were poor in the first half and the Germans really should have led. Karim Adeyemi will forever be replaying that chance when put through on goal.",
      "But Real weathered that storm and their individual quality eventually told as Vinicius Junior carried them further into this era of dominance.",
      "",
      "14) 1995 – Ajax 1-0 Milan\nThe absolute state of those teams. Edwin van der Sar, Danny Blind, Paolo Maldini, Frank Rijkaard, Franco Baresi, Frank de Boer, Alessandro Costacurta, Clarence Seedorf, Marcel Desailly, Edgar Davids, Ronald de Boer, Zvonimir Boban, Jari Litmanen, Marc Overmars and Patrick Kluivert. With two managerial legends in Louis van Gaal and Fabio Capello filling the dugouts, there might never have been a more stacked final in terms of talent. The game itself was no less captivating.",
      "",
      "13) 2015 – Juventus 1-3 Barcelona\n“Spectacular” was the word Luis Enrique used to describe Barcelona’s win over Juventus in the 2015 Champions League final. History is written by the victors, of course, but it seems a generous interpretation. Not that it wasn’t an excellent game: the continent’s best defence gave a supreme attack quite the scare before eventually succumbing to defeat.",
      "",
      "12) 2018 – Real Madrid 3-1 Liverpool\nStarved of possibly its best player after half an hour, the 2018 Champions League final did not provide quite the pulsating mesh of styles it had promised. Liverpool were understandably subdued and Real plodded through large portions before the rest was largely lost in a cloud of goalkeeping embarrassment.",
      "",
      "11) 2011 – Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United\nAs far as exhibitions go, they don’t come much better. But there was always a sense of Barcelona and Manchester United being a bit of a mismatch, even when Wayne Rooney equalised after half an hour. Lionel Messi and David Villa had secured a third European Cup in six seasons before Sir Alex Ferguson knew what hit him, while Rooney was left begging for mercy.",
      "",
      "10) 2012 – Bayern Munich 1-1 Chelsea (3-4 on penalties)\nThe late drama of two goals in the final seven minutes went some way to undoing the relative monotony of the preceding 80 or so. It does, however, remain hilarious that Bayern Munich had 20 corners and failed to score from any, while Chelsea had only one and managed to rescue themselves with it.",
      "",
      "9) 2002 – Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Real Madrid\nWere it not for an injury to starting goalkeeper Cesar, facilitating the introduction of Iker Casillas, an iconic moment in Champions League history might have been lost to the ether. As it was, Casillas made a string of impressive saves to preserve the lead Zinedine Zidane granted Los Blancos in spectacular fashion at Hampden Park. Few expected Leverkusen to make it so far but no-one could claim they didn’t contribute to a great game.",
      "",
      "8) 2006 – Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal\nWhile an early sending-off can so often inhibit a team and a spectacle, Arsenal seemed invigorated by the dismissal of Jens Lehmann in Paris in 2006. They took the lead through Sol Campbell and were 15 minutes from unthinkable glory before Henrik Larsson rewrote the script as only he could.",
      "",
      "7) 1999 – Manchester United 2-1 Bayern Munich\nWhen we finally drain the well of unoriginal content ideas and come to rank the greatest two-minute spells in Champions League history, Manchester United’s stoppage-time exploits against Bayern Munich in 1999 might well fare better. But there is a reason the Wikipedia summary of the first and second halves at the Nou Camp are offered as many paragraphs – three – as the entirety of injury-time.",
      "",
      "6) 2013 – Borussia Dortmund 1-2 Bayern Munich\nAfter their two Bundesliga meetings ended in 1-1 draws, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich did battle at Wembley to settle the matter beyond all doubt. Jurgen Klopp side started far better but fell behind after an hour, only to equalise eight minutes later. Arjen Robben then scored the winner in the penultimate minute to conclude an even and excellent game.",
      "",
      "5) 2014 – Real Madrid 4-1 Atletico Madrid (after extra-time)\nWhen one team so obviously prepares for 90 minutes, the unexpected and sudden addition of 30 more can lead to something of a damp squib. Atletico Madrid led for almost an hour before Sergio Ramos’ last-gasp equaliser, at which point Diego Simeone’s side was drained both mentally and physically and bereft of substitutions. Extra-time was an exercise in brutality; it had become difficult to watch by the time Cristiano Ronaldo was baring his triumphant, flabby chest.",

Milan were without a number of injured and suspended players but ruthlessly dismantled Barcelona all the same. It just would have been nice if the Spaniards had turned up.",

      "3) 2008 – Manchester United 1-1 Chelsea\nSome continental meetings between two teams from the same nation suffer for familiarity. The 2008 Champions League final was the antidote to that particular poison, as Manchester United and Chelsea freely traded blows like super-heavyweights knowing this would be their defining bout. Cristiano Ronaldo landed the first blow, only to be floored by Frank Lampard. The dismissal of Didier Drogba in extra-time might even have inadvertently decided the destination of the cup, as John Terry slipped 12 yards from glory before Edwin van der Sar kept out Nicolas Anelka.",

      "2) 1997 – Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus\nThe biggest surprise in Champions League final history benefited from an unexpected winner toppling a European superpower, a two-goal salvo from the uncelebrated Karl-Heinz Riedle, an understated backheel goal from Alessandro Del Piero and one of the finest examples of man-marking in the sport’s history as Paul Lambert shadowed Zinedine Zidane throughout.

      "“It’s still Ten Hag’s team which was built for a different style, so now you’re seeing what happens when you play people out of position or in a system that many of them aren’t comfortable.",
      "“But my fear is whether he can make that formation work in any case. United have never played three at the back in their history, and apart from Inter, all the best teams in the world play with that back four.",
      "“With a lot of that current squad, we’re not talking about bad players. Some of these players earn a lot of money, and regardless of the formation, they have to be playing at a level higher than they are right now. To be fifth from the bottom is absolutely disastrous.",
      "“They put all their eggs in one basket in terms of winning the Europa League and that performance was absolutely pathetic. Fans can understand performances dropping in the weeks before the final, but you have to show up, and they were diabolical. So the jury still has to be out.”",

      "Liam Delap choosing Chelsea is a massive blow for Manchester United – much more damaging than it would have been for the Blues had the 22-year-old snubbed them in favour of the Red Devils.",
      "Chelsea are an attractive club to play for right now; Manchester United are not. It’s not Delap or bust for Chelsea, but that feels very much the case for United.",
      "Delap was perfect: young; cheap; scores Premier League goals. And crucially, while United are terrible, they are definitely better than Ipswich.",
      "Not only do they not have European football as a draw, there’s also no light at the end of a tunnel which has grown longer under Ruben Amorim thanks to a philosophy and system almost laughably unsuited to the players in his squad. Any striker joining United this summer will wonder how long a contract might need to be for them to see a semblance of success at Old Trafford.",
      "History, a fading assumption that things must get better at Manchester United because This Is Manchester United and a promise of game time are about the only selling points Amorim and his recruitment team can use to lure players to the club this summer.",
      "That won’t be enough for Viktor Gyokeres, Benjamin Sesko, Hugo Ekitike or other top-level goalscorers United would previously have been vying to sign, and our struggle to come up with these seven striker options – most of whom still feel like unlikely additions for various reasons – shows just how bleak things are for Amorim in the search for anyone who can put the ball in the back of the net.",
      "",
      "Victor Osimhen (Napoli)\nNaming United’s director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves along with Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and sporting director Giovanni Manna in a report claiming a meeting has been held in Naples to discuss a swap deal for Osimhen adds a level of credence to a rumour we would otherwise have dismissed out of hand. Kudos to the reporter for their commitment to the clicks if it is indeed nonsense.",
      "Osimhen is a world-class striker who’s scored 36 goals on loan at Galatasaray this term and 100 goals in his last four seasons. He’s in that top rung of goalscorers currently available for transfer. And weirdly, despite being very available – Napoli are desperate to get rid of him with his contract expiring at the end of next season – there appears to be scant competition to sign him.",
      "Arsenal and Liverpool have turned their noses up for some reason, Paris Saint-Germain are no longer keen and even Chelsea appear to have gone off the idea of signing a brilliant 26-year-old striker for £65m on £200,000-per-week wages. Sounds good to us.",
      "And amid reports that, unlike other top strikers, Osimhen isn’t all that bothered about Champions League football, we wonder if the Nigerian doesn’t have something of a chip on his shoulder…a burning desire to prove doubters wrong.",
      "He can find a kindred spirit in that pursuit at Old Trafford in Amorim, and we’re sure (actually we’re not, but we hope) Osimhen would rather be scoring Premier League goals, even for Manchester United, than Saudi Pro League goals for whichever PIF club offers him a billion pounds a year to play in front of tens of people.",
      "",

      "Reports suggesting Mateta is open to a move as he looks to catch Didier Deschamps’ eye ahead of the World Cup in 2026 begs the question as to whether he’s more likely to do that by staying at Palace and playing in Europe or through moving to Old Trafford. We’re leaning towards the latter as for better or worse, Deschamps – like everyone else – will be very aware of what Mateta is doing if he becomes United’s new No.9.",
      "He could be great as well. He’s what Rasmus Hojlund should be – a bully who holds the ball up well with a decent touch, brings playmakers into the game, runs in behind and gets on the end of crosses. Another significant boon for Amorim is that Mateta has thrived for Palace in the 3-4-3 formation he is trying to make work at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "Ollie Watkins (Aston Villa)\nAnyone not watching Villa week in, week out, and actually a fair few who have, would claim this was something of a fallow season for Watkins. A fair point compared to last term perhaps, but a Premier League return of 16 goals and eight assists meant only four players – Mohamed Salah (47), Alexander Isak (29), Bryan Mbeumo (27) and Erling Haaland (25) – finished the campaign with more goal contributions than the 29-year-old, in what was his second-best top-flight season in that regard.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his INEOS team made a point of not wanting to sign players over the age of 25 when they took charge of football operations, in a bid to ensure their market values at least had a chance of increasing in their time at the club, rather than fading to nothing as has been the case for pretty much everyone signed in the last decade.",
      "The England international would have to hit the ground running and score goals at a fair lick to avoid his value dropping as he turns 30 in December, but needs must and United just need to find someone, anyone who can lead the line – as Watkins has done very, very well for Villa under Unai Emery – and score goals.",
      "",
      "Patrik Schick (Bayer Leverkusen)\nHis age (29) is about the only stick you can beat Schick with given his schtick this season has been scoring more Bundesliga goals (21) than anyone but Serhou Guirassy (also 21) and Harry Kane (26).",
      "Reports suggest Bayer Leverkusen would be open to bids of around £30m for a striker who could probably be tempted by a move to any Premier League team – with or without European football – such is his long-held desire to play in the English top flight.",
      "Meanwhile, Hugo Ekitike and Benjamin Sesko, who have been linked with the top-tier clubs looking for strikers this summer, have both had £80m-£100m price tags slapped on them despite scoring 15 and 13 Bundesliga goals respectively.",
      "Schick would be a relatively low risk, cheap option for United.",
      "",
      "Christopher Nkunku (Chelsea)\nTalking of risk, Nkunku might just be the most perilous option. He’s done nothing at Chelsea to suggest he’s got what it takes to be a Premier League footballer. He’s done plenty to suggest he’s not cut out for it. And yet… he is a very talented footballer – ‘there’s a player in there’ as they say.",
      "But while that player could perhaps be uncovered at Liverpool or another stable football club, Manchester United are not in a position to be lifting a footballer from a slump, while a move to Old Trafford will almost certainly see Nkunku scrabbling on his hands and knees at the cloying soil at the base of the hole he finds himself to find the rocks at the very bottom.",
      "",
      "Moise Kean (Fiorentina)\nHis signing is unlikely to be widely heralded by the United fanbase on the basis of a Premier League career which saw him score just four goals in 39 appearances for Everton having been seen as quite the transfer coup when Marco Silva persuaded him to join from Juventus in 2019. He was only a kid at the time though and has developed his game in the meantime to become a far more rounded striker.",
      "Kean scored 19 Serie A goals this season, behind on Mateo Retegui (25), including braces against Roma and Inter, and goals against Juventus, Atalanta and AC Milan.",
      "He has a €52m [£44m] release clause, which feels reasonable, and may well feel as though he has unfinished business in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "We won’t profess to have seen Burkardt in action enough to make a claim over his suitability to United in terms of style, but everything about a move for him feels pretty perfect besides an eye test which we’re 100% sure would lead us to insist he’s a better bet than Hojlund.",
      "He’s 24, a Germany international, has frequently played in a 3-4-3 and has a release clause of just €20m [£17m]. The not insignificant issue for United is that Frankfurt have supposedly made Burkardt their top target if Ekitike gets poached by one of the big boys, and they can offer him Champions League football. But United should absolutely be looking into this one at the very least.",
      "Man Utd director of negotiations Matt Hargreaves has flown to Italy for a ‘meeting’ with Napoli owner De Laurentiis over a potential swap deal this summer.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have ‘chosen’ their preferred striker signing after losing the Europa League final to Tottenham Hotspur.",
      "From the Premier League’s finest chaos merchant to the Gunners’ top transfer target, these are the 10 best strikers available this summer…",
      "12 of the top 100 most valuable footballers are almost certain to leave their current clubs this summer and we’ve predicted where they’ll end up.",
      "Wayne Rooney reckons Man Utd should look to sign two of Chelsea’s top targets this summer as they close in on their first deal.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have four strikers on their ‘shortlist’, with a former Premier League flop in a ‘renaissance’ among their options."

So Cunha could replace Bruno’s attacking output, at least in terms of goal involvements, if not in terms of creating chances for our non-existent strikers.",

This could be said to have cost us in the Europa League final in which he was otherwise anonymous (despite getting a Whoscored rating of 7.39). I always think he’s United’s Steven Gerrard but is he in fact our Coutinho?",

They have lived up to this promise and delivered more than I had ever dared hope Liverpool would achieve in a football landscape competing with the likes of City/Chelsea/PSG/Newcastle/Chinese-clubs-10-years-ago/Saudi-clubs-2-years-ago. They brought in Suarez, they brought in Allison and Virgil, they offered 120m for Felipe Caicedo, they are working on major deals this summer.",
      "FSG does not reinvest the club’s money into itself each and every year, though; the money is sometimes rolled over to future windows, and this upsets a lot of fans. These fans have either missed the fact that LFC has won two league titles in 35 years and both came in seasons when the club did basically nothing in the transfer window, or they simply care more about transfers than they do about effective football club management, who knows.",
      "It was always a mistake to interpret FSG’s general fiscal conservatism as a lack of ambition from club management/ownership, or as a sign of greed/them taking money out of the club. But it is also a mistake to interpret FSG loosening the purse strings for opportunistic luxury purchases like Suarez/Allison/Caicedo/Wirtz as the start of an era of Scouse Galacticos, rather than exceptions to the rule/approach which has served LFC so well over the last 15 years and will hopefully continue to see us with a club that we can be wholly proud to support.\nOliver (sidenote: if City’s FFP/PSR charges are confirmed, we could have already been talking about an FSG-led LFC dynasty in English football) Dziggel, Geneva Switzerland",

      "If they couldn’t deal with the pressure of the last few years, how is it going to be in this coming season – the 5th proper year of the Arteta project – where the expectations now shift from HOPING to EXPECTING to win a trophy? They’ll probably get that striker they need, but it won’t be the cure for all ills. They still lack squad depth. They still lack knowhow at the business end of the season. And Arteta doesn’t help with his paranoia and touchline histrionics.",
      "No, for me, this feels like a club coming to the end game of a project, not the start. Liverpool and Man City will definitely finish above them next year.",

And now, this afternoon, news is coming through they’re grabbing Delap from under the noses of Manchester United (lol, by the way) which surely represents an upgrade on the erratic Jackson.",
      "If they can now get a decent goalkeeper and a dominant centre back to supplement the quality of James, Cucurella, Enzo, Caicedo, Lavia, Palmer and (presumably) Delap, then you’re looking at a side that can surely only be heading in one direction and that is upwards. It’s easy to scoff at Chelsea these last few years – and a lot of it has been entirely justified – but you just get a feeling that something might just be starting to take off at long last.",
      "Please feel free to chuck this back in my face if Arsenal are 10 points clear at Christmas and Chelsea are looking like they fancy a return to Conference League football – but I’m confident that you’ll see a changing of the guard in London next season.\nAndy H, Swansea",

      "Brilliant as Brighton are, their transfer strength has been in identifying rough diamonds from faraway lands to polish and move on for considerable profit rather than spending big. Pedro might be the exception as Brighton could pretty much double their money on the Brazilian, but Rutter’s first season was underwhelming.",

      "The first two of those names left for nothing, so Burnley bucked the trend by at least securing a hefty profit for Wood. They will also make a few pennies on Amdouni after a decent loan spell with Benfica. Expect them to break that record again this summer as they attempt (likely in vain) to stay in the Premier League.",

      "There is a genuine case to say Fernandez is legitimately the best of those Chelsea signings, which reflects well on no-one. But Todd Boehly has continued that proud tradition of general waste, with £100m Moises Caicedo finally approaching his best form as the other half of a potentially sensational midfield.",

      "A ludicrous fact: not a single one of those signings was made by Roy Hodgson (nine transfer windows in charge). Crystal Palace presumably still regret giving Alan Pardew (four transfer windows in charge) quite so much pocket money.",

      "Fulham do like to use their regular Premier League promotions, or in the case of Mitroglou imminent relegations, to open new transfer doors. Though last summer they waited for the cash to arrive for Joao Palhinha before splashing out on Smith Rowe. The jury is out on whether he was worth the outlay.",

      "It took 20 months for Leeds to break their transfer record thrice from July 1999. It took 20 years for Leeds to break their transfer record once from November 2000. They took a chance on Rutter in 2023 that did not save them from relegation but did at least make a small profit when he became Brighton’s record signing.",
      "",

      "It is probably safe to suggest that Darwin Nunez has not activated enough add-ons to become Liverpool’s record signing just yet. That initial £64m fee paid to Benfica can rise as high as £85m, but not any time soon. That Van Dijk figure is likely to be blown out of the window by the £100m it will likely take to sign Florian Wirtz.",

      "As masters of the £50m transfer and really anything in that general ballpark, it seemed as though Pep Guardiola had rather unfairly cracked the art of the £100m move.

      "We suspect a lot of those Isak add-ons will have been met, and Newcastle would be more than happy to pay for a player now worth about twice as much. Will FFP ever allow Newcastle to break that record again?",

      "These are the 10 best wide forwards available in the 2025 summer transfer window. Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle and Chelsea should be taking notes…",
      "And here are the best available strikers.",
      "",
      "10) Jack Grealish (Manchester City)\nThere are younger options like Jamie Gittens, Antony, Kenan Yildiz, Johan Bakayoko and Tyler Dibling (that’s the honourable mentions out of the way), but we reckon Jack Grealish just edges them. Why? SEO, maybe. But also because he’s a Premier League-proven talent who, under the right manager, can still be one of the most dangerous wingers in Europe.",
      "We’re not sure if Grealish is the type of player who lacks confidence, but what we do know is that the freedom and eccentricity he once oozed has been stripped away under Pep Guardiola. He was electric at Aston Villa, prompting Man City to break the British transfer record to sign him, only to reinvent him as a risk-averse wide-midfielder who keeps the ball safe at all costs. Jeremy Doku, by contrast, has been given a free pass to run at full-backs like it’s a playground kickabout.",
      "Someone needs to get us the old Grealish back. We miss him dearly.",
      "",
      "9) Antoine Semenyo (Bournemouth)\nAfter racking up 11 goals and six assists in 37 Premier League games, Antoine Semenyo is a wanted man. He really does strike us as a future Tottenham Hotspur player, and with them back in the Champions League, the Ghanaian will surely be tempted – even more so if Daniel Levy swaps Ange Postecoglou for Andoni Iraola.",
      "Semenyo, still raw at 25, had a highly productive season. Bournemouth reportedly want £70million – which he’s definitely not worth. Fair enough for them to aim high, but thankfully for everyone’s sake, Manchester United can’t afford to get suckered in. Then again, they might lose the plot after Liam Delap chose Chelsea.",
      "",
      "8) Takefusa Kubo (Real Sociedad)\nThere’s a £50.2million release clause in Kubo’s contract, with Real Madrid due 50% of any sale – meaning they could bring him back for a bargain £25m if they wanted. But Los Blancos already have more attacking depth than they know what to do with. Arda Guler and Brahim Diaz barely get a look-in as it is.",
      "Kubo was one of Europe’s top take-on artists in 2024/25, even if five goals and zero assists in 36 La Liga games is bleak. Still, Alexander Isak only got six in his final season at Sociedad, and he’s done alright since.",
      "The Japanese winger is a menace in possession, with progressive carry and foul-winning numbers that compare well with Mo Salah, Raphinha, Lamine Yamal and Vinicius Jr. He’s also one of the best defensive workers among that group. There’s a serious Premier League player in there.",
      "",
      "7) Marcus Rashford (Manchester United)\nAre we naïve to keep convincing ourselves he’s still a potentially elite forward? Possibly. But Marcus Rashford’s brief resurgence on loan at Aston Villa reignited that belief. Confidence and happiness make all the difference, and for the first time in ages, he looked like he was enjoying himself.",
      "Playing for Manchester United could make Mr Tumble miserable these days. It’s a graveyard for players. McTominay, Antony and Rashford have all escaped and immediately thrived elsewhere. Actual Scott McTominay has been named Serie A’s best player, for crying out loud.",
      "Wages are the stumbling block. Only a few clubs can afford his wages, and many might think twice. Did Rashford down tools after signing a big-money contract extension, or was he just another victim of the Old Trafford malaise?",
      "Either way, the Villa revival has been massive. A move abroad may be best, but don’t rule out an intra-Premier League switch.",
      "",
      "6) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nA free transfer makes Leroy Sane a very tasty proposition. He’s Prem-proven, which matters, but he hasn’t played in England since 2020 and is now 29 – just a year younger than a finished Raheem Sterling.",
      "He’s reportedly been offered to Spurs and is on Arsenal’s shortlist. As a freebie, his wage demands will be monstrous, and he’ll want a long contract well into his twilight.",
      "But if you can stomach the wages, there’s no transfer fee, and he remains a brilliant addition for a top club.",
      "",
      "5) Rayan Cherki (Lyon)\nCherki’s best position is still up for debate, but his ability to play anywhere across the front line makes him extremely appealing.",
      "His numbers this season were brilliant: 12 goals and 20 assists in 44 appearances, with 11 assists and 8 goals in Ligue 1 alone. He’s up there for key passes too, with 75 across the top five leagues.",
      "He’s already waved goodbye to Lyon fans, and the club desperately need a big sale. While some reports claimed a release clause of £18.9m, David Ornstein shut that down, confirming there isn’t one and that Lyon will want a much bigger fee.",
      "Borussia Dortmund are interested, and Manchester City are sniffing around as they prepare for life after Kevin De Bruyne – who will reportedly join Napoli on a free.",
      "",
      "4) Bryan Mbeumo (Brentford)\nTwenty Premier League goals this season says it all, really. At 25, Mbeumo is a proven scorer, versatile, and should be available for a cut-price fee with just one year left on his deal.",
      "He feels like a can’t-miss signing. Arsenal, Newcastle and Man United have all been linked.",
      "Newcastle need a right-winger despite Jacob Murphy’s freak season. Arsenal wouldn’t start him ahead of Bukayo Saka, but there’s a world where they co-exist, even if pushing either to the left isn’t ideal.",
      "Still, Mbeumo would improve any top side needing an X-factor.",
      "",
      "3) Nico Williams (Athletic Club)\nA £45m release clause for a player of Nico Williams’ talent is outrageous. But the full cost – including wages and bonuses – makes him an expensive project. Barcelona have walked away. Last summer, Arsenal and Chelsea didn’t bite the bullet.",
      "His Euro 2024 was electric, but five goals and five assists for Bilbao this past season didn’t boost his stock much. That said, the talent is unquestionable. He’s ready for a step up.",
      "",
      "2) Rafael Leao (AC Milan)\nIt feels like time for Leao to leave Milan. Chelsea are probably out – they’re welcoming Estevao and Kendry Paez this summer – but Arsenal’s need for a left-winger is glaring. How they let Khvicha Kvaratskhelia go to PSG without a fight is baffling.",
      "With Grealish likely off and Doku not fully convincing, City could come calling too. Newcastle or Liverpool would also make sense – the former especially, as Leao would be a major statement.",
      "",
      "1) Rodrygo (Real Madrid)\nIf Arsenal sign Rodrygo, it would have real Alexis Sanchez vibes. A genuine elite winger, an X-factor star, and the sort of player who deserves to be more than a supporting act.",
      "Real Madrid are all about Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Vinicius now. Rodrygo, despite being a proven match-winner with two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles, seems expendable.",
      "He should be one of the poster boys at a top club – and most English sides can offer him that. He might just be the best player available this summer.",

      "It is noted that ‘the fact his representative travelled to Riyadh is an intriguing twist’, especially considering ‘talks at the Four Seasons hotel are believed to have continued late into the night’.",

      "Manchester United finished the season in 15th place in the table, the club's worst-ever  Premier League finish; Ruben Amorim's side also lost the Europa League final, meaning no European football next season; Portuguese says Red Devils will not need a big squad as a result",
      "Wednesday 28 May 2025 12:44, UK",
      "Manchester United will invest in new players this summer, but without Champions League football next season, the club does not need a big squad, says Ruben Amorim.",
      "United recorded their worst-ever Premier League campaign after finishing 15th in the table, losing 18 games in the process, and defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League final means no European football next season.",
      "As a result of having fewer matches to play next season, Amorim - who is hoping to bring Wolves forward Matheus Cunha to the club - wants to operate with a smaller squad that will be easier to manage next season.",
      "\"We always prepare two plans,\" said the Portuguese at the start of the club's preseason tour of Malaysia and Hong Kong. \"With and without the Champions League. Without the Champions League, we also don't need a big squad.",
      "\"We can control the squad in a better way. Then we have a plan, that is to bring in some new players, but our big plan is to improve the team we have, to improve the Academy.",
      "\"It was the past, so it can be the future. It can't change much because of Financial Fair Play, we are not allowed to do much, even with the Champions League, so we are prepared.\"",
      "Having overseen a \"disastrous\" campaign at Old Trafford, in the manager's own words, Amorim says last season is now behind him as he and his players start to look forward.",
      "\"It was important to finish the season, we needed to close that chapter,\" he said. \"It's not fully behind us because I have one row of English journalists waiting for the hard questions, so I will rest from that when we finish the tour.",
      "\"To tell you the truth, I closed that chapter, I'm excited, I'm nervous, I want to work to the next season, I don't have that feeling that I need to disconnect, I had the feeling to close the season, but now it's a new season, so I am excited at the same moment.",
      "\"So, I don't need rest, I just need to prepare for the next season.\"",
      "While predicting there will still be some more hiccups to contend with along the way, Amorim also thinks there is light at the end of the tunnel.",
      "\"It's important to stick together,\" he said. \"We are going to struggle, it's not going to be everything right away, but I can see the team improving and that's the most important thing.",
      "\"Our target, I will not tell you now. If you want a target, it is to win the first game, then we will see. We have a lot to do during this summer, we have to prepare the team.",
      "\"Again, when are you are in Man Utd, people are going to expect us to be on the top, but we have to understand the context, so I do not want the team to think of a big target, just the small target of winning the first game, then we pass to the second game.\"",
      "Meanwhile, not participating in Europe next season could be a positive for United as Amorim looks to build team unity going forward.",
      "\"I have to say that for us not to be in the Champions League could be an advantage to perform well, to perform better the games, to build that core that we need for the future,\" he explained.",
      "\"So, it is a good thing for us to take advantage of not having European games.\"",
      "Amorim has also stressed the importance of keeping Bruno Fernandes at United this summer as rumours begin to circulate regarding his future at Old Trafford.",
      "Fernandes has recently been linked with a move to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal, which led to Amorim stressing that United should try to keep \"one of the top players in the world\".",
      "The United boss has now reinforced this point, saying: \"You can see by the performance, the leadership, the passion he has for the games. So it is really important, especially in these kind of moments.",
      "\"You could see that in the last game. I felt that the team was without pressure; they performed quite well and everybody wanted the ball.",
      "\"The team has different moments and in different moments, Bruno [Fernandes] is the one who really wants to take responsibility.",
      "\"He should be because he is the captain, so he's really important for us and really important for what we want to build with this team.\""
