      "Cristiano Ronaldo 'liked' Jose Mourinho's comments about him and Lionel Messi(Image: Yasser Bakhsh/Getty Images)",
      "Cristiano Ronaldo has liked an Instagram post of Jose Mourinho arguing in favour of the Manchester United legend over Lionel Messi. Since breaking through as two of the world’s most exhilarating talents in the mid-noughties, the football world has been divided into those who prefer Messi and those who believe Ronaldo to be better.",
      "Their rivalry was at its peak after Ronaldo left United for Real Madrid in 2009 and Messi still played for Barcelona. The pair were the standout stars of their respective clubs and regularly competed against each other for La Liga titles, golden boot awards and Ballon d’Or prizes, with the Portuguese claiming five while his Argentine rival Messi clinched a record eight.",
      "Today, they are considered well past their primes but Ronaldo, aged 40, is on his way to 1,000 career goals at Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia, though he is currently on strike. Meanwhile, Messi, 38, won the MLS Cup last year with Inter Miami.",
      "Even so, their respective fan bases still continue the eternal debate over which is actually football’s ‘greatest player of all time’. While Messi usually steers clear of such comparisons, Ronaldo appears more determined to cement his own legacy with his comments in interviews.",
      "The Portuguese forward has seemingly now sought to do so once more by liking an old video on social media of his compatriot Mourinho championing him at the expense of the Barcelona legend, while he still managed Ronaldo at Real Madrid. In the clip from 2012, Mourinho explains why it is more difficult to be Ronaldo.",
      "He says: \"I still say that it is more difficult to be Cristiano than Messi. Messi grew up in the team he plays for, with the team-mates he plays with. Cristiano arrived in England at a giant team in crisis, which was only losing. He had to grow over the last two years with this team under construction.",
      "\"Messi plays as a number 9 in about 50 square meters, closer to the goal and with less defensive work. Cristiano, on the other hand, is a winger. How can a winger score the same number of goals as a centre forward?",
      "Mourinho coached and defended Ronaldo at Real Madrid(Image: AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"A winger who defends, who ends a game in the 94th minute running after Pedro in a goal-scoring situation. A winger who, in set pieces, reaches his own area 20 times because he is very important to the defence. A player who is not protected by anything or anyone... It is much, much harder to be Cristiano, let's stop joking.\"",
      "Despite his obvious stance at the time, which may have stemmed from a certain amount of bias given his club and international affiliations, Mourinho has more recently refused to compare the two global superstars.",
      "In fact, in a move that would likely frustrate the ultra-competitive Ronaldo, he claimed in 2025 that neither player at their peak matched the skill and pure ability of the Brazilian Ronaldo, who played for both Barcelona and Madrid beforehand.",
      "Lionel Messi has more Ballon d'Or wins to his name(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Mourinho said: \"Ronaldo, El Fenomeno. Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi have had longer careers, they have remained at the top every day for 15 years.",
      "\"However, if we are talking strictly about talent and skill, nobody surpasses Ronaldo. Injuries killed a career that could have been even more incredible, but the talent that that 19-year-old boy had was something incredible.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Al-Nassr captain doubled down last year in his interview with Piers Morgan that he is a better footballer than Messi. He said: \"Is Messi better than me? I disagree. I don't want to be humble.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Michael Carrick has turned back time at Manchester United (Image: Simon Stacpoole/Offside, Offside via Getty Images)",
      "Michael Carrick is turning back the clock at Old Trafford. Rolling back the years to an era which became known as 'Fergie Time'.",
      "When Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson took advantage of a few extra minutes no-one knew were coming, to win games at the death. Carrick faces mission impossible when it comes to masterminding the success Fergie once had. No chance. It will never happen.",
      "But what Carrick has managed to achieve is get back that golden glow, for a football club which has sat under a dark cloud for longer than it cares to remember. For the time being, at least, United have that feel good factor running through the club's veins again.",
      "Football matches are being won in deserved but dramatic fashion. Supporters are off their seats, including those sat in the posh ones in the directors box.",
      "Fergie himself couldn't keep the smile off his face, when he watched United produce a win over Fulham that was from his very own vintage. Conceding an equaliser in stoppage time. Only to charge down the opposite end and snatch a winner.",
      "For Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ruud Van Nistelrooy, read Benjamin Sesko. For the second time in a week, United won a game instead of settling for a point.",
      "Carrick has shown in his substitutions he is proactive instead of reactive. He sent on Sesko with his side 2-0 up. It's the sort of attitude Fergie himself used to have.",
      "It sums up the parody of a place United has become, that an afternoon which started with a huge protest against the club's owners, ended in thrilling jubilation.",
      "While Sir Jim Ratcliffe & Co were getting hammered with dog's abuse, Carrick's name was being serenaded.",
      "Man Utd fans protest",
      "Manchester United manager Michael Carrick celebrates with Benjamin Sesko after his Fulham winner(Image: 2026 Visionhaus)",
      "Carrick is not one to get carried away, while the ownership issues are not his concern. But three straight victories since taking charge have left him in serious danger of getting the job permanently in the summer. And anyone who can get Sesko scoring world class winning goals, has to be some sort of managerial genius.",
      "There is still a long way to go, of course. This is Manchester United we're talking about. A bloody nose is never that far away.",
      "But if Carrick is handed the job full-time, the ownership of United will become his problem. It is one which hasn't been close to good enough or acceptable in recent times.",
      "Carrick deserves much better. But he will have to accept that there are some problems at Old Trafford even he cannot fix.",

      "Tyrell Malacia will remain at Manchester United(Image: Manchester United via Getty Imag)",
      "Tyrell Malacia is thought to be fuming with Manchester United after Jason Wilcox blocked a deadline day move away from Old Trafford. The 26-year-old has been overlooked with the Red Devils this season, with just one Premier League appearance to his name for 2025/26.",
      "As a result, speculation has been rife this month that the left-back could be on the move in the winter transfer window. While it is thought that Malacia was set to make his way to Turkey on Monday for a medical, insiders claim that he received a call from Wilcox just before boarding his flight to tell him that he would remain with his current club.",
      "The Dutch defender could also find himself a part of Michael Carrick's plans for the rest of the season, given United's stance on deploying him may have changed as a result of Patrick Dorgu's recent injury. Dorgu picked up an issue during United's 3-2 win over Arsenal last month, with reports suggesting he could be out of action for up to 10 weeks.",
      "While Carrick was recently unable to put a timeline on Dorgu's recovery, the interim head coach has conceded that he faces a spell away from playing. He said in a press conference: \"Pat, unfortunately, is going to be out for a period of time. We are still working through how long that is going to be.\"",
      "Retaining Malacia could be a move which proves problematic in a matter of months, given his current deal with the club expires this summer. As a result, he will be able to leave on a free should relationships fail to be mended.",
      "It comes as Malacia was included in a five-man 'bomb-squad' under Ruben Amorim prior to his sacking in January, alongside Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, Antony and Jadon Sancho. He was also the only player who failed to secure a move away from the club last summer.",
      "Jason Wilcox is reported to have blocked a deal for Tyrell Malacia(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Rashford is currently thriving on a season-long loan spell with Barcelona, while Sancho is enjoying a similar scenario with Aston Villa. Garnacho, meanwhile, secured a permanent transfer to Chelsea to the tune of £40million, while Antony joined Real Betis for up to £21.65m.",
      "It seems as though Carrick is happy to put his faith in his current crop of players for the second-half of 2025/26, with very little in terms of activity in the current transfer window - which slams shut at 7pm. The 44-year-old has been a breath of fresh air in his first three games at the helm of the Red Devils - overseeing a 2-0 win over Manchester City, a 3-2 win over Arsenal, and a 3-2 win over Fulham.",
      "However, speculation regarding his future at Old Trafford beyond 2025/26 remains. Given he is only on an interim deal until the summer, United have no obligation to keep him on, regardless of his performances this term.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Instead, they could opt to put their faith in a more seasoned head coach when they reassess their options in a matter of months, with Oliver Glasner, Roberto De Zerbi and Thomas Tuchel seeing their names brought up in conversation as of late.",
      "Up next for United is a Premier League clash with Tottenham Hotspur on home soil come Saturday, February 7 at 12.30pm. The club then travel to the London Stadium to take on West Ham on Tuesday, February 10.",

      "Manchester United are sending James Scanlon on loan to Swindon Town for the remainder of the season. United have already secured multiple exits for youngsters in an otherwise quiet January transfer window and Scanlon is set to be the next player to leave.",
      "The 19-year-old winger has got the green light to join Swindon’s push for promotion from League Two under manager Ian Holloway. Town sit sixth in the table, three points off the automatic promotion positions, and are keen to add attacking threat.",
      "Scanlon already has 20 caps and two goals for Gibraltar to his name and is ready for senior football, having been a regular for United’s academy sides. The winger has eight goals and five assists in 47 games for the under-21s, having been prolific for the under-18s after joining from Derby County in 2021.",
      "United’s connection to the academy has been strengthened in the past month following the departure of Ruben Amorim. Michael Carrick has been appointed as interim boss until the end of the campaign, with under-21s boss Travis Binnion among his coaching staff.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Scanlon is yet to make an appearance for the United first team and is behind the likes of Shea Lacey in the pecking order. The winger’s brother, Luca Scanlon, is a midfielder and was also previously in the United academy before leaving for Burnley last year.",
      "United have had a quiet January transfer window, having splashed over £200million to sign Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in the summer. The departure of Amorim – and the immediate improvement under Carrick – has prompted the hierarchy to hold fire on deals until the summer, when a long-term managerial appointment will be made.",
      "Instead, the club has prioritised exits of young players. Toby Collyer has been sent on loan to Hull City and Harry Amass to Norwich following previous loans at West Brom and Sheffield Wednesday respectively.",
      "James Scanlon is leaving Manchester United on loan(Image: Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Meanwhile, Rhys Bennett was sold to Fleetwood Town, Joe Hugill departed permanently for Kilmarnock and Sam Mather terminated his contract in order to join Turkish side Kayserispor on a free transfer.",
      "Carrick had left the door open for further deals when asked ahead of the 3-2 win over Fulham on Sunday. “Never say never. A lot can happen and situations can be thrown up,” he said. “Sometimes it is in our control, sometimes not. I am pretty calm. We have shown what we are capable of as a team.”",
      "He was also asked about the future of captain Bruno Fernandes. “We all want to win things. We all want to get better. We want to improve as a team,” Carrick added. “We want to be successful and that's something we've got to work towards together, but Bruno's been fantastic since I've been here. He was fantastic when I was here before, so I've got nothing but good things to say about him.",
      "“That's not to get too far ahead, you know. That's [his future] on the agenda a little bit, but my main agenda is getting through the game on Sunday with Fulham. Bruno's fully committed. There's absolutely no issues at all with that. Things further down the line [will be] addressed towards the end of the season or whatever. But now everything's positive at the moment.”",

Jacquet is understood to have been won over by the vision presented by Liverpool, with reports suggesting that he believes he will secure more opportunities at Anfield.",

      "Liverpool broke a transfer record in the January window for a former Manchester United target(Image: Liverpool FC, Liverpool FC via Getty Images)",
      "For Liverpool supporters, there are few sweeter moments than getting the better of Manchester United. Throughout the last decade, the pendulum in English football's fiercest rivalry has swung decisively in Liverpool's favour, with Virgil van Dijk's towering influence playing a major role.",
      "The Dutch centre-back joined from Southampton in January 2018 for a club-record £75million - then a world-record sum for a defender - and proceeded to revolutionise the team's defence. Yet astonishingly, he had come close to moving to Old Trafford just months before.",
      "His former Southampton colleague Charlie Austin revealed that Van Dijk was in serious discussions with United during the summer of 2017. However, the Red Devils opted for Victor Lindelof instead, a choice that allowed Liverpool to swoop in.",
      "FOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "Recalling a conversation with Van Dijk during his days at Southampton, Austin told talkSPORT in 2022: \"I remember at the back end of his Southampton career, we were sitting on the bench together at Chelsea away. I said to him, 'Come on Virgil, what's going on, surely Manchester United must have been in for you? They're a massive club in England.'",
      "\"He said, 'Do you know what Chaz, in the summer it was between me and Lindelof - and they went for Lindelof.' Nobody knows that. He told me on the bench and I couldn't believe it. I was gobsmacked.\"",
      "It is a decision that has tormented United in ways the club could barely have envisioned. Not only has Van Dijk flourished spectacularly on Merseyside but he is considered one of the greatest defenders of his era.",
      "Lindelof, in contrast, never quite fulfilled his potential during his eight-year stint at Old Trafford. The Sweden international was consistent but didn't deliver the same commanding presence and defensive solidity as Van Dijk has for Liverpool.",
      "Manchester United opted to sign Victor Lindelof in 2017(Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "Following their regret of not splashing out on Van Dijk, United proceeded to smash the transfer record for a defender by signing Harry Maguire from Leicester City in 2019. Yet Maguire also failed to match the Liverpool skipper for consistency.",
      "His performances swung dramatically, oscillating from reliable to catastrophic and being branded an expensive transfer mistake. Still at the club, the England international has since rediscovered his footing and partly restored a previously damaged reputation, though he is not held in the same esteem as his Liverpool counterpart.",
      "Van Dijk captained Liverpool to the Premier League title last season(Image: PAUL ELLIS, AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Van Dijk, meanwhile, has solidly cemented himself as one of Liverpool's finest ever players. He was instrumental in the club's 2018/19 Champions League and 2019/20 Premier League victories and became just the third defender in history to be crowned PFA Player of the Year in 2019.",
      "He also came second in the Ballon d'Or in 2019 and has clocked up well over 300 appearances for the club. He was named club captain in 2023 after Jordan Henderson's departure, guiding the club to a second Premier League title last term.",

      "Matheus Cunha was fouled by Jorge Cuenca of Fulham but outside the box",
      "Manchester United have been given a fresh verdict from Troy Deeney following their controversial penalty decision that was overturned by VAR during Sunday's dramatic win over Fulham. The Red Devils capitalised on the resulting free-kick to break the deadlock at Old Trafford.",
      "The controversy erupted when Fulham defender Jorge Cuenca went to ground and was initially penalised, although replays swiftly demonstrated that Cuenca had clearly won the ball before making any contact with the United player.",
      "The Spanish defender and multiple team-mates instantly protested, triggering a swift intervention from VAR. Match officials informed the referee that no foul had occurred inside the penalty area.",
      "Nevertheless, they spotted a shirt pull by Cuenca, with the infringement beginning outside the box, meaning the appropriate decision was a free-kick instead of a spot-kick.",
      "The referee announced the outcome to the stadium: \"After review, the Fulham 15 commits a holding offence outside the penalty area.",

      "Travis Binnion put Sesko and the other substitutes through their paces under the floodlights inside an almost-deserted stadium. A handful of stragglers and a few stewards were the only spectators present.",
      "The scene was a stark contrast for Sesko, who had sent tens of thousands of fans into raptures after scoring the 94th-minute winner. Yet, it shows the player's dedication and highlights his limited game time under Michael Carrick.",
      "Sesko had started six consecutive fixtures and netted three goals in his two appearances for Darren Fletcher before being an unused substitute throughout the win against Manchester City. The forward also featured for just ten minutes in United's victory over Arsenal after coming on for the injured Patrick Dorgu.",

      "Jeremy Jacquet is closing in on a move to Liverpool(Image: (Ramsey Cardy - Sportsfile/UEFA via Getty Images))",
      "Manchester United made a last-ditch attempt to hijack Jeremy Jacquet's transfer to Liverpool. News emerged late on Sunday night that the Reds had agreed a deal with Rennes to sign the centre-back this summer.",
      "The reigning Premier League champions have negotiated a pre-agreement worth an initial £55million plus £5m in add-ons for the 20-year-old, having held talks with the French side over the weekend. But according to journalist Florian Plettenberg, United tried to hijack the transfer on Sunday evening but were unsuccessful, as the defender already had an agreement in place with Liverpool.",
      "Chelsea had approached Stade Rennais earlier in January about a deal for Jacquet, but the French club were reluctant to sanction a departure midway through the campaign. That meant that Jacquet had a choice between Chelsea and Liverpool for whom he wanted to join in the summer, and he opted for the latter because he believes there is a better chance of regular first-team football at Anfield.",
      "Jacquet's move to Liverpool comes amid uncertainty around the future of Ibrahima Konate. The Frenchman is out of contract in the summer and is being linked with a move to Real Madrid.",
      "United, meanwhile, are set for a quiet end to the January transfer window, with their deadline day activity set to focus on securing exits for some of their academy graduates. Providing an update on Friday, Michael Carrick said: \"To be honest, I think we're just working through it. Never say never, of course, because a lot can happen and situations can be thrown up.",
      "“Sometimes it's in our control, sometimes it's maybe something that's out of our control that we've got to deal with. I'm pretty calm. I think we've shown what we're capable of doing as a team and we'll just have to see what the next few days bring, but I'm definitely calm about it.\"",
      "On the pitch, Benjamin Sesko’s stoppage-time winner saw United’s revival under Carrick continue in dramatic fashion as they moved back into the Premier League’s top four with a 3-2 win over Fulham on Sunday. Goals from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha had put United 2-0 up before Raul Jimenez and Kevin restored parity.",
      "But just moments later, United were celebrating again as substitute Sesko rifled the ball beyond Bernd Leno. Speaking after the game, Carrick said: \"There's a lot that went on today in the game. I was well aware of what a good team Fulham are going into the game.",
      "\"I was getting questions thrown at me about teams sitting back here, but I knew it was never going to be like that today.",

      "\"For Ben [Sesko] to come on and have a moment like that is huge. It was nice for him to get his moment in front of the Stretford End. There's not a better place to score a winner like that.",

      "Michael Carrick is braced for a climactic January transfer deadline day at Manchester United(Image: Ash Donelon, Manchester United via Getty Images)",
      "The January transfer window draws to a close on Monday evening and Manchester United continue to be associated with several 11th-hour deals. Interim manager Michael Carrick isn't anticipated to be particularly active during the final stages of the winter market, though there are a handful of rumoured moves with possibilities.",
      "All of this month's activity at Old Trafford thus far has involved departures. Nevertheless, with the side beginning to flourish under Carrick's stewardship, this could be the moment to strengthen the squad in a bid to capitalise on that positive momentum.",
      "One significant development that occurred earlier this month was the announcement that Casemiro will depart the club when this season concludes. While that separation won't happen until the summer, it might be sensible to begin preparations now.",
      "As previously mentioned, this month has predominantly focused on exits from a United standpoint. Five in total, with a collection of emerging talents departing, either permanently or via loan arrangements.",
      "Most recently, defender Rhys Bennett has been sold to Fleetwood Town, whilst striker Joe Hugill has also departed permanently after signing for Kilmarnock. Earlier in January, Sam Mather concluded his lengthy spell with the club and was permitted to terminate his contract in order to join Turkish outfit Kayserispor on a free transfer.",
      "Regarding temporary departures, Toby Collyer has been sent out on loan again and joined Hull City after his brief stint at West Brom was cut short. This follows left-back Harry Amass's earlier departure this month to Norwich City on loan, with a few more similar deals potentially in the pipeline today.",
      "Given the advanced stage of the January window, most prospective deals will carry an element of improbability. Nevertheless, United remain among that select group of clubs that cannot be discounted from pulling off something remarkable before the deadline.",
      "A pursuit of Barcelona midfielder Marc Casado would represent precisely that. The 22-year-old defensive midfielder has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford this month and is allegedly also on the radar of Spanish rivals Atletico Madrid.",
      "Marc Casado has been repeatedly linked with a move to Manchester this month(Image: Quality Sport Images, Getty Images)",
      "Casado has previously been praised as one of the more outstanding prospects to emerge from La Masia in recent seasons. But while he's been a regular feature in Hansi Flick's midfield setup this campaign, he potentially lacks the guaranteed starting role he desires at the Camp Nou.",
      "With Casemiro poised to leave, it won't be long before United lose the most dependable figure they have at the heart of midfield. Casado would represent the opposite end of the scale given he's still in the formative phase of his career, though acquiring him would enable United to allocate a significant portion of salary funds to other areas of the squad.",
      "Casado remains under contract in Catalonia until summer 2028 and it's been suggested his agreement contains a buyout clause valued at approximately £87million. A deadline day transfer would remain expensive considering Barca won't be enthusiastic about offloading anyone without the opportunity to secure a replacement, though Marcus Rashford could provide assistance if that's a transaction Barca would wish to finalise.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "Another prospective target to address that void in midfield is ex-Wolves playmaker Ruben Neves. The Portuguese star has been linked with a Premier League comeback this month following several seasons in Saudi Arabia, and United require someone fitting his specification.",
      "Newcastle have been cited as the alternative destination for the midfielder after suggestions Neves appeared poised to depart Al-Hilal. Yet it has subsequently transpired he now seems destined to pen a fresh contract in Riyadh.",
      "United target Ruben Neves looks set to sign a new deal at Al-Hilal(Image: Getty Images)",
      "According to reports, Neves is in the final phases of agreeing a handsome, new three-year deal with the defending Saudi Pro League champions. This would extinguish any hope United might have harboured in their pursuit of the midfielder.",
      "In numerous respects, Neves could have represented Carrick's perfect midfield reinforcement, whether this month or during the summer. He remains within the appropriate age bracket as he approaches his 29th birthday, possesses considerable expertise in English football and corresponds closely with what United seek in a deep-lying midfielder.",
      "The opportunity isn't completely closed just yet, and United might still be capable of proposing terms that would entice both him and Al-Hilal towards an agreement. Presently, however, it appears one of the club's finest chances in the January window has largely evaporated.",

      "Michael Carrick and his wife Lisa have been subject to comments from Roy Keane(Image: Photo by Anthony Devlin/Getty Images)",
      "Roy Keane has never shied away from voicing his opinions on Michael Carrick - or his wife for that matter. The 44-year-old was named Manchester United interim head coach earlier this month after Ruben Amorim's dismissal.",
      "It's been a remarkable beginning for the former England midfielder, who secured impressive wins against Manchester City and Arsenal in his opening two matches at the helm. Whilst some have suggested that Carrick's swift and positive influence on the team could put him in contention for the permanent role should the strong results persist, Keane hasn't joined that particular camp.",
      "The former United skipper controversially declared following the 3-2 triumph over Arsenal that he wouldn't hand Carrick the permanent position even if he won the remaining 15 fixtures of the campaign.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "\"Even if they do get into fourth, I still wouldn't be convinced he's the man for the job. Absolutely not. They need a bigger and better manager. But he has got the opportunity and what a chance for him, and you know what, he's taking it.\"",
      "Despite his earlier comments casting doubt on Carrick's credentials for the permanent role, he appears to have backtracked on those previous statements and now insists he wants him to land the position.",
      "Speaking on The Overlap's Stick to Football podcast earlier this week, Keane admitted: \"I hope they give it [the permanent job] to him. I hope they give it to him in the summer.\"",
      "However, he clarified that whilst he hopes Carrick gets the promotion, he believes it would be the wrong call from the United hierarchy. Speaking to Gary Neville, Keane added: \"I don't think it's the right decision, good luck with it.",
      "\"Yeah, but, I'm sticking to my guns. I've said my piece, I think that he's got the job, and if he gets it in the summer then you go 'listen, good luck to him', but as a caretaker manager, it's a different animal to being manager of United trying to win league titles over the next two, three, four, five years, whatever it might be.",
      "\"I think you can get a better manager than Carrick, absolutely. But I think he's doing a good job, perfect timing for him, and even if he doesn't get the United job, these results a bit like Ruud [Van Nistelrooy], he can get another job, probably another Premiership manager.\"",
      "Michael Carrick has enjoyed a superb start to life at Old Trafford(Image: Getty)",
      "It wasn't only Carrick who came under fire from Keane's remarks, but his wife Lisa as well, who became the target of a barb from the Republic of Ireland legend. The 54-year-old accused Lisa of having a \"big mouth\", saying: \"His wife can always come in [if Carrick doesn't do well], cause she's got a bit of a big mouth sometimes. She's probably doing the team talk.\"",
      "The remarks reignited a long-standing row between the two dating back to 2014, when Keane had directed his criticism towards Carrick. Following United's 2-0 loss to Olympiacos, Carrick gave an interview which Keane subsequently tore apart on television.",
      "The pundit said: \"That interview was just like the performance, flat. He should say a bit more, have a bit more urgency, even in the interview.\" Lisa didn't respond well to Keane's comments, taking to Twitter, now X, to write: \"Roy Keane what a ****, says anything to provoke a reaction.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "She subsequently expressed remorse for her message by removing it and added: \"Deleted my tweet... Emotions got the better of me.\" Carrick himself has also been vocal about Keane's judgements, maintaining that he 'isn't bothered' by what Keane and other ex-United players turned pundits have to say.",
      "\"They're not putting more pressure on me,\" Carrick said ahead of the Manchester derby. \"I don't feel that. There are plenty of opinions around, some positive, some not too much. It's totally irrelevant in terms of what I focus on.",
      "\"There's a lot that can be said, it's the way of the world. I'm not going to pay too much attention to that. For me, the players and staff, we focus on how we're going to succeed.\" When questioned directly about Keane, Carrick added: \"It didn't bother me.\"",

      "Carlos Baleba has previously revealed his stance on a potential switch to Manchester United. The Brighton midfielder has been on the club's radar since last summer.",
      "In a bid to back Ruben Amorim, United splashed out more than £200million during the previous transfer window, bringing in three high-profile signings: Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. Senne Lammens also joined as the new number one goalkeeper.",
      "Despite these reinforcements, Amorim couldn't hold onto his position and was dismissed after approximately 14 months at the helm, with Michael Carrick taking over. On the topic of exits, it has been confirmed that Casemiro will leave the club when this season concludes.",
      "The Brazilian's departure will leave a significant void in the centre of the park, making a replacement an obvious priority. United were strongly linked with Brighton's Baleba during the summer and whether through a surprise late deadline day swoop or a summer acquisition, the 22-year-old has already made his feelings about joining United abundantly clear.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "During last summer's window, United reportedly initiated preliminary discussions with Brighton regarding Baleba, but the Seagulls were said to have demanded a staggering £115million fee. This put United off making a serious move for Baleba, though numerous reports indicate he remains firmly on their list of targets.",
      "Some sources even suggest that this month, the club explored the possibility of a January switch, although any deal is more likely to materialise in the summer.",
      "The 22-year-old has been on United's radar since the summer(Image: Getty)",
      "\"I don't really think like that: playing for two or three years and then leaving. Me? I just work. In my head it's all about working and helping my club,\" Baleba explained.",
      "\"If I can help a team-mate, I will. If they can help me, I'll accept that help to push forward and develop. So, I just work to help my team and myself progress in the future.",
      "\"In return, everyone who helps me wants me to go to the highest level. And if there are big clubs who want me, it's not something that worries me or gets me excited.",

      "\"Everyone talking about you, singing your name? That just doesn't do it for me. It's not something that gets me running. I just prefer getting my head down and working on the pitch.\"",
      "Whilst this mindset doesn't necessarily aid United's pursuit of the determined Baleba, such characteristics are commendable and would only intensify their ambition to secure the Cameroonian's signature either now or in the coming months.",

      "Goals from Casemiro and Matheus Cunha had United 2-0 up and cruising on Sunday afternoon before Silva's side roared back. Raul Jimenez netted from the penalty spot after Harry Maguire's foul before Kevin curled a stunning finish into the top corner to equalise in the 91st minute.",
      "However, United went straight up the other end, with Bruno Fernandes picking out Sesko to score on the swivel in the box. His goal ensured United continued their 100 per cent record under Michael Carrick's management, but left Silva raging.",
      "United's opening goal came from a free-kick that was awarded following consultation from VAR. Initially referee John Brooks had awarded United a penalty for Jorge Cuenca's challenge on Cunha in the box.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page",
      "But VAR replays showed Cuenca had got the ball. Yet rather than overturn the penalty, Brooks changed his call to a free-kick outside the box because Cuenca had pulled Cunha's shirt. Fernandes curled a cross in and Casemiro planted a powerful header past Bernd Leno to open the scoring, with Silva subsequently receiving a yellow card for his protestations.",

      "He impressed at the Emirates but against Fulham on Sunday afternoon, he proved how difficult he will be to replace. For a defensive midfielder, Casemiro is not expected to be an elite header of the ball but bar Harry Maguire, he was the only man on the pitch you wanted to be on the end of a Bruno Fernandes free kick.",

Missing out on a January exit means Malacia is more than likely to be without first-team football for another six months or so which is gut-wrenching for him.",

Malacia was ready to fly to Istanbul on Monday morning to seal a switch away from Old Trafford, having made his desire to leave the club five months before his contract expires clear. The 26-year-old was hoping a deal could be agreed between a club showing interest from Turkey's Super Lig and United, with a loan move or a permanent switch believed to be on the table.

This is what I’ve wanted to do ever since I was a kid, play for Middlesbrough. And where we are in the league at the minute, as long as we just keep going, we feel confident. Winning promotion with Middlesbrough would mean everything to me. I don’t know how I’d be, but I know I’d be over the moon. That is the dream.",
      "MEN Sport understands youngster James Scanlon is set to join League Two's Swindon Town as they push for promotion to League One. United gave the green light this morning. Swindon's playing philisophy and chance to be part of a League Two promotion push considered a good fit.",

      "I know Cole Palmer's family quite well, I know his dad and his uncle. We (Man United) were close to getting Cole Palmer when he was about 16, believe it or not. He was umming and ahhing, and I knew he was a big United fan. He was at that age where you're allowed to leave, 16 is it? They were umming and ahhing, Man City, about it. I think City, in the end, made him a good enough offer, but really he was always a United fan, and it was close, I remember speaking. I think City needed to show him a bit more love and that kind of stuff. We never quite got it over the line, but it would've been nice if we did, wouldn't it?",
      "I think it all depends on what happens with Bruno Fernandes, he's obviously not getting any younger, if the Saudis come back in for a whopping £100 million plus, I think they may potentially think, 'okay, thank you and bring in Cole [Palmer]'. But I don't see why they'd bring in Cole and then have Bruno as well, both kind of the same position. Unless they're looking to drop Bruno a bit further deeper. But yeah, if you've got a player of that calibre saying, I'm unhappy and I want to come to your club or come back home, I think anyone is going to be, you know, the alarm bells are going to start ringing and maybe having questions about it because he's a fantastic player. Yeah, I would be surprised [if Palmer left] because I think Chelsea have kind of built a project, a lot of young players, for the past two seasons, been evolved around Cole Palmer. You would say that, obviously not in the league position at the minute, but maybe they're in a better place at present. So yeah, it would be a shock to see him leave to Man United.",

      "Earlier this month, an update claimed that the Catalan club is unwilling to pay the amount previously agreed for a permanent transfer and had offered two suggestions to United. One was signing Rashford for a lower fee, and the other was to re-sign him on loan for another season, with an obligation to buy in 2027.",

      "A little under 20 minutes later, the roar that greeted the final whistle was one of ecstasy mixed with relief. United did their best to throw away a routine win, but having rescued themselves with Benjamin Sesko's 94th-minute winner, it arguably made for a more enjoyable afternoon.",
      "Certainly, the United fans leaving the ground will remember the day more than they would have done had the contest finished 2-0, or even 2-1, after Raul Jimenez scored an 85th-minute penalty that set the mayhem in motion.",

      "\"It's the best feeling, I have to say. Some of the best moments here that I've been lucky enough to be a part of are when you get a moment of elation and excitement like that,\" he said of Sesko's dramatic winner, which came after Fulham had equalised in the first minute of injury time.",
      "\"There's no better place, in front of the Stretford End, and it ends up meaning a bit more. I think people leave here with more than just, you know, United win today, and it kind of puts layers on top of that and the connection and the feeling, the emotion, it’s why we all love it so much and especially the supporters, so it goes a long way.",
      "\"The excitement that's part of this club, it's not always the easiest way, but certainly when they come along, it's pretty special.\"",

      "But Carrick remained calm and after a brief chat with assistant Steve Holland, he tried to call back Leny Yoro from the celebrations to come on. He explained the differences between doing it as a player and a manager afterwards, revealing he always felt his team would get a chance to win the game.",
      "\"Yeah, slightly different,\" he said. \"I think when you're in the thick of it as a player, you're right in the moment and you obviously don't always see the bigger picture. You're a little bit different in terms of the attachment to the game. I was pretty calm all the way through.",
      "\"We were disappointed obviously with the second goal, but I was aware there was still eight minutes to go at that point when they scored. If anything, I was thinking there's a long time to go and we still had the players on the pitch at that point that could really make the difference for us. I was still really positive that I thought we'd find a moment.",
      "\"Listen, it's hard to hold your emotions together when the goal goes in like that, so I think we all celebrated when that went in. But, yeah, I did feel we'd have a moment. We tend to, in them type of games, you always have a moment, it's just whether you can take it, and Ben certainly did that from Bruno's great work down the right.\"",
      "It has been noticeable in Carrick's three-game reign so far that he is determined to project calm to his players. He rarely shows emotion on the sidelines, but admits it is about getting the balance right of when to let some emotion out.",
      "\"Certainly, that composure and that calmness for the players to be able to think clearly,\" said Carrick. \"It's getting the balance, and I think we've got the balance pretty well over the last three games of playing with that bit of fire and a bit of hunger, but making good decisions as well.",
      "\"I'm not sure we all made good decisions when that goal went in in terms of how we celebrated, but that's what you strive for, that's why we all love the game for moments like that, so when they do come, you're going to make the most of them.\"",

      "Sesko scored the winner vs Fulham.(Image: MUTV)",
      "Benjamin Sesko admitted he was \"emotional\" after scoring Manchester United's winner against Fulham in the Premier League on Sunday afternoon. Michael Carrick oversaw a third win on the bounce in the top-flight thanks to an injury-time goal from Sesko at the Stretford End.",
      "Fulham scored twice in quick succession to level the game in the 91st minute, but there was another twist when Bruno Fernandes found Sesko in the box with seconds to play. Sesko, who had been introduced from the bench, found the top right corner to secure a victory. The Slovenia international got off to a slow start in Manchester, but has improved in the last two months.",
      "Speaking to MUTV, Sesko said: \"It was emotional. It was amazing. It feels like a pleasure, helping the team, helping the fans and the club to secure the win. It's always nice to help the team and score goals.\"",

      "Describing how it felt to score the winner, he added: \"That was unbelievable. When I scored, I just didn't know what was going on. But yeah, what a moment. Amazing time to score it.",
      "\"It's quite high, especially in the Premier League when everything is way faster than in Germany. The goal is up there for me, even because it's a moment like this, that's why it's up there.",
      "\"We work as one. I mean, we always have done, but you know, it's bits by bits. And yeah, it just came together, especially off the ball. You can see the work rate from everyone.",
      "\"It's benefiting us with the ball and off the ball, and, in the end, also with the results.\"",
      "Carrick praised Sesko in his post-match press conference, saying: “Huge moment. I’m so, so pleased. Everyone in the changing room, players, staff, delighted for him, absolutely delighted for him and the reception he got when he came back in the changing room told us everything.",
      "\"Confidence, it wasn’t so much that. He’s been fantastic, we’ve worked with him a lot in different ways over the last couple of weeks. He’s bright in training, he’s looked dangerous, he’s done extra.",
      "\"The coaches have done a lot of bits on the side and Travis [Binnion], particularly, has done a lot of work one-on-one with him. Ben’s a big talent, he’s got so many positive things.",
      "\"And today’s a huge goal because that feeling as a striker to score a winner in front of the Stretford End late like that, it’s what you dream of. After missing the chance, which is what it is, strikers miss chances, to go again and put that away. Absolutely so, so pleased for him. He really deserved it.”",

      "Before the victory over Arsenal, Casemiro announced he would not be signing a contract extension and would be leaving United at the end of the season. And so began a long goodbye for the Brazilian.",
      "He impressed at the Emirates but against Fulham on Sunday afternoon, he proved how difficult he will be to replace. For a defensive midfielder, Casemiro is not expected to be an elite header of the ball but bar Harry Maguire, he was the only man on the pitch you wanted to be on the end of a Bruno Fernandes free kick.",

      "But he is more than just a source of goals this season for United. Alongside Kobbie Mainoo he dominated the middle of the park and restricted Fulham to half chances.",
      "After the break, some frustration could be heard in the crowd as United failed to break down the Cottagers. But there was Casemiro again, threading an impressive pass for Matheus Cunha to fire home.",
      "When he was eventually replaced by Manuel Ugarte, it was then that United were reminded of the transfer priority they need to resolve. The Reds lost control of the midfield without Casemiro and went from the comfort of a 2-0 lead to needing a moment of spectacular drama to win the game 3-2.",
      "The worry for United is that defensive midfielder's either cost the world or are not at the level required. Erik ten Hag allowed £42m to be spent on Ugarte in 2024 but he does not look to be capable of replacing Casemiro long-term.",
      "With United unable to rely on the Uruguayan, Ineos will need to be prepared to spend big. Monday marks January transfer deadline day and unless there is a remarkable change of heart, it should be a quiet one at Carrington.",
      "But on the eve of the big day, United were reminded of a huge deal they will need to make in the summer.",

And ex-Reds captain-turned-pundit Neville has explained on the Gary Neville podcast why Garnacho's performance was crucial to his team facing a shock home loss to their relegation-threatened opponents before they came back to win 3-2.",

      "Bruno Fernandes has just brought up six years at Manchester United",
      "When Manchester United were weighing up a move for Bruno Fernandes in 2019, they asked a former player for a reference. Cristiano Ronaldo was an international teammate of Fernandes at the time, and he vouched for the kind of player and character that United would be getting.",
      "The transfer that would see Fernandes follow the same path from Sporting to Manchester as Ronaldo would take another few months to come to fruition, United eventually making their move to sign him in January 2020. But boy, did it prove to be money well spent.",
      "The fee for Fernandes could reach £67million if all add-ons are met. In reality, he has been a £100million footballer for Manchester United since the moment he walked into the building six years ago yesterday. The club had done their due diligence on Fernandes and knew what they were getting. Not just an elite-level player, but somebody who was desperate to win and wouldn't think twice of calling out any slip in standards.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "It probably summed up his character that Fernandes played 90 minutes two days after signing for the club. That game against Wolves was six years ago tomorrow and a goalless draw was an inauspicious start. It didn't take long for his demonstrative side to appear. Now it is referees who tend to cop for it, but back then it was often his teammates, many of who just weren't on the same wavelength.",
      "The first time I remember being struck by Fernandes's force of personality was in his third appearance for the club. He started on the bench in a Europa League last-16 first-leg tie at Club Brugge, but was already showing that he was a leader. When he came on in the final nine minutes, United improved immediately, and on a couple of occasions, he scolded teammates for not getting the ball to him quickly enough.",
      "It was the kind of reaction that could cause concern in some dressing rooms, but speaking to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer afterwards, it was clear the United manager wanted more of it, rather than less.",
      "\"He’s another conductor and leader and winner,\" said Solskjaer. \"He wants to win, He doesn’t take 99 per cent as good enough and he’s impressed me. That’s something you see when you watch him but you don’t really know about until you have him in your group. He’s been absolutely top class.\"",
      "That is a description every United manager since would agree with. No matter how bad things got, there was always Fernandes to fall back on. He has rarely let his standards drop.",
      "His elevation to the captaincy in the summer of 2023 felt a long time coming. He had been the heartbeat of the team for a while and was already regularly wearing the armband, but now became the on-pitch leader. His ascension hasn't been without its faults and there has been discussion about his suitability for the role, never more so than after a stroppy second-half when losing 7-0 to Liverpool at Anfield in March 2023.",
      "The fact that came before he was confirmed as club captain showed that those inside Old Trafford never lost faith in Fernandes. That on-pitch demeanour might occasionally rile critics, but it comes from a position of being desperate to win. That hasn't happened often enough for Fernandes and United.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Speak to anyone who works regularly at Carrington and Old Trafford, and they will highlight the human side of Fernandes' leadership. Forget what happens on the pitch; he is a unifying force off it. Humble enough to treat every member of staff the same way and make sure that they are all happy.",
      "He wasn't alone in being stung by the redundancies implemented since Sir Jim Ratcliffe's arrival in February 2024, and he has always tried to help where he can. When staff perks were slashed ahead of the FA Cup final that May, he offered to pay for them out of his own pocket, a gesture that was rejected.",
      "That he has won just two trophies in his time at Old Trafford is a disappointing return. If anyone in the last six years deserves more, it is Fernandes. He is the only player in this period who would even be in a conversation about whether he would get in to the best and most successful United sides of the past.",
      "The Carabao Cup and FA Cup are a meagre return, and that won't change this season. Even if United get back into the Champions League, there will be no silverware at the end of this campaign. At that point, Fernandes will have a decision to make.",
      "He came close to leaving for Saudi Arabia in the summer and reopened old wounds recently by giving an interview in Portugal in which he said United wanted him to go but lacked the \"courage\" to tell him. He will again make a decision on his future this summer, probably after the World Cup, and an exit can't be ruled out.",
      "He has at least looked happier since Michael Carrick returned. Simplicity has been the hallmark of Carrick's first couple of weeks in charge and he has restored the Premier League's best No. 10 to a role playing as a No. 10. It has got the best out of Fernandes once more.",
      "He has been engaged by Carrick's decision to make training sessions shorter but more intense. He has a strong relationship with the 44-year-old, who was on Solskjaer's staff when he arrived at the club. Carrick believes Fernandes is in a good place at the moment.",
      "If United can secure a return to the Champions League, then perhaps Fernandes feels it is worth staying on. His time in Manchester deserves a fitting coda for what he has delivered. If he does wish to leave, it can't be held against him. Few players have given more for less in red in recent years.",
      "If he does stay, he will surpass Ronaldo as United's most-used player from Portugal. That is a record that would mean a lot for somebody whose affiliation with the club began when he used to watch Ronaldo playing here. His career in Manchester hasn't hit the heights of the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, but there is little doubt that, in a difficult period, he has been just as important to Manchester United as his countryman.",

      "We have answered your burning Manchester United questions this week",
      "The good times keep on rolling for Manchester United under Michael Carrick. The head coach followed a win against Manchester City in his first game in charge with a stunning success against Arsenal at the Emirates last weekend.",
      "While it's been a quiet month in the transfer market, that hasn't stopped the good vibes from flowing, given the uplift in performances seen under Carrick. United now sit fourth and firmly in the race for Champions League football next season.",
      "This weekend they face Fulham at Old Trafford in what will be a very different tactical test for United under Carrick. For the first time they will dominate possession and have to break down a low block. There are also a few days remaining in the transfer window and your questions on United are covered below.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "We run weekly question and answer sessions, so click here to submit your questions, and we'll answer them next week. Here are the answers to some of this week's questions:",
      "We need wingers",
      "More of a statement than a question but one that is difficult to disagree with. I don't think right-wingers are needed. Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu can all play on the right and I think all of them would prefer to play on the right.",
      "The problem is on the left. Dorgu has done well in that role in the last couple of weeks and you would expect Matheus Cunha to come in now. Mason Mount could also play there, but I don't think any of them convince.",
      "Cunha is better centrally, for me, and while Dorgu is an excellent squad player, I think you want another left-wing option, and probably a right-footed one. It's something United will look at this summer when the transfer window opens, although midfielders are the priority.",
      "Wingers weren't needed under Ruben Amorim and United are about to lose a couple of left-wingers this summer as well. Speaking of which...",
      "Will Rashford come back?",
      "I can't see it, too much water has gone under the bridge for this to happen, although it is probably true that if he was here now under Carrick, he would be playing regularly on the left wing.",
      "Rashford is loving it at Barcelona and he is having a good season at the Nou Camp, with nine goals and 12 assists in 31 appearances in all competitions. He wants to stay at Barcelona and Barcelona want to keep him, so I think a return to United is unlikely. For starters, it would annoy the player, and he would immediately return as the club's highest-paid player now that Casemiro is leaving.",
      "The issue will be financial. There is an option to make the deal permanent for €35million, but that feels unlikely to happen given Barcelona's ongoing woes. Especially when Rashford is on the kind of Premier League wage that the Catalan club is unlikely to be able to afford.",
      "Compromise will be needed on all sides but that feels more likely to happen than Rashford returning to United in a first-team role.",
      "Will Man United re-sign Greenwood?",
      "I can't see this ever happening, to be honest. Greenwood has had another productive season at Marseille but the optics of bringing him back are not good, especially when United have already tried to reintegrate him once.",
      "The attempt to bring him back into the fold in the summer of 2023 was poorly handled and ended disastrously. The club underestimated the backlash from supporters and in the end the right decision was made.",
      "United could still profit from Greenwood, with a sizeable sell-on in the deal with Marseille. He is playing well enough to get a move but the biggest transfer fee would come from the Premier League and I can't see any English club being willing to fight the PR battle to sign him.",
      "Kindly transfer updates",
      "You've asked very nicely, but I'm afraid there is little to offer. United have been adamant all month they won't sign anyone unless a long-term target becomes available. That was always unlikely to happen and with just a couple of days until the window closes, we can now consider it almost certain that no arrivals will be incoming.",
      "United will instead keep their powder dry until the summer, and if they return to the Champions League as well, that will be a major boost to their spending power. With a bigger transfer kitty, I would expect a couple of midfielders, a left-winger, a defender and maybe a new back-up goalkeeper.",
      "In terms of the final days of this window, there will be a few loan moves for academy players. The only first-team player in with a chance of leaving is Tyrell Malacia, who wants to move five months before his contract expires. He is desperate to go and play first-team football.",

      "United first showed interest in 2017, but the Germany international left Schalke for Bayern Munich rather than moving to the Premier League. Links to Goretzka have regularly reemerged during his time in Bavaria.",
      "Seven-and-a-half years later, this eighth season will be his last playing for Bayern. The club announced four days before the transfer deadline that Goretzka will leave at the end of this season rather than during this winter window.",
      "The player acknowledges clubs have been keen in January. However, Goretzka says: \"As much as I am honoured by the interest from international top clubs, I have made a clear decision for myself to remain at FC Bayern until the end of the season.",
      "\"At the same time, the club and I have decided in good and constructive talks that our successful time together will come to an end in the summer. As I have said before, this is also the right moment for me to open a new chapter once again, both as a footballer and as a person.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Bayern's sporting director Christoph Freund also confirmed Goretzka's impending exit. He said: \"In the last few weeks, we have intensified the talks and spoken openly about what his further path will be in the summer — in the summer, his time at FC Bayern will come to an end.",
      "\"By then, he will have spent eight years here, extremely successful, extremely strong in the way he has conducted himself as a person and as a player. But before that, he will fight with us so that we still have some good weeks ahead.\"",
      "United could now be one of several clubs interested in Goretzka this summer. Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur are the two other Premier League clubs credited with an interest in the 30-year-old this winter.",
      "However, there are also links to a whole host of clubs across Europe. Atletico Madrid and Barcelona are said to be keen in Spain, with the latter's head coach, Hansi Flick, previously working with the player at Bayern and with the Germany national team.",

      "Chido Obi retains huge potential.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Chido Obi took selfies with young Manchester United fans at Old Trafford last week. The striker scored the decisive goal in a 2-1 victory after dropping down to play in the FA Youth Cup against Derby.",
      "The teenager made his first Under-18 appearance in an on-record fixture for 11 months. United fastracked Obi after his arrival from Arsenal, and he made seven first-team appearances in the second half of last season, so it was interesting to see him be handed a start in a competition for U18s.",
      "On the surface, it may seem like Obi has regressed, given he dropped down to play U18 football again, but his inclusion in the team to face Derby was a signal of intent from Darren Fletcher.",
      "The Youth Cup is for players who are under 18 on August 31 of the current campaign. Obi celebrated his 18th birthday in November, making him eligible for the competition for a successive season.",
      "Ultimately, there are two factors at play when United decide which academy fixtures a young player should feature in. The first, and most important, is whether it's best for the player to partake in that game. Will they learn from the experience? Will it aid their development? Those conversations take place among coaches.",
      "The second consideration is the wider context. Will the team have a better chance of winning with said player? How will the team members complement each other? Is the team strong enough to compete?",
      "United academy sources have maintained the development of individuals is more important than results, but football is about winning at the end of the day. And United want their young players to win.",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FB PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "Obi pictured after playing in the Youth Cup last week.(Image: 2026 James Gill - Danehouse)",
      "It's a balancing act for staff to decide which academy players should feature in specific competitions across the age groups, and it was decided that Obi should start against Derby. How much he learned from the experience is debatable, but he scored the decisive goal, which vindicated the decision.",
      "The prestige of the Youth Cup was a factor in the decision to start Obi. United have won the competition more than any other club, and it's the pinnacle of academy football, which everyone wants to win.",
      "Obi fired the U18s to the final four of the Youth Cup last season, scoring seven goals in just four matches, but he was marked out of the semi-finals by eventual winners Aston Villa.",
      "Fletcher hopes his side can reach the final - and win it. The prospect of Obi and JJ Gabriel playing together in the competition is exciting, but there was a moment against Derby when they got in each other's way.",
      "It will be interesting if Obi is involved with the U18s when they play Oxford in the next round of the Youth Cup. On paper, Gabriel alone could provide United with enough quality to progress to the quarter-finals.",
      "It certainly won't do Obi any harm to help the U18s lift the Youth Cup this season, but his involvement does spark discussion about his development and what to expect in the next few years.",
      "Obi played 52 minutes for the first-team against Fulham in the proper FA Cup in March last year. That was his first taste of playing in front of a full capacity at Old Trafford, but there were just over 2,000 fans within the ground to watch the youngsters take on Derby in the Youth Cup.",
      "Obi and Gabriel are a force to be reckoned with in the Youth Cup.(Image: Manchester United)",
      "The truth is that Obi still needs time to develop. He was overexposed to senior football last term due to injuries, and staff agreed he needed to learn away from the spotlight in this campaign.",
      "That might have been a hard pill to swallow for Obi, considering he became the youngest player to start a Premier League game for United against Brentford before excelling during the post-season tour.",
      "Obi scored twice against Hong Kong, looking better than Rasmus Hojlund. The same comment had been made when Obi replaced Hojlund in the FA Cup defeat to Fulham a few months before that trip.",
      "The youngster started against Leeds in Stockholm - Hojlund was named on the bench - in the opening pre-season friendly of the summer, but only started one game during the United States tour.",
      "Since then, Obi has exclusively played in academy fixtures, and his only senior squad appearance came against Wolves, when the Premier League's worst side visited Old Trafford at the end of last month.",
      "United fans were desperate to see more of Obi in the first-team after some encouraging, albeit green, performances, however, he has predominantly played for the U21s this term.",
      "Obi has been challenged by senior opposition for the U21s, playing in the National League Cup and EFL Trophy, two competitions which pit academy players against senior teams. United academy coaches love those competitions because there is no place to hide against senior players.",
      "Obi pictured during the USA tour last summer.",
      "The 18-year-old has continued to score, netting seven in 19 games, but his output has slightly dipped after a freakish first campaign at the club, and there is still more to work on.",
      "Obi's decision-making and last ball in the final third need improvement, as does his work rate out of possession. United have felt academy fixtures are the best place for him to develop those aspects of his game.",
      "\"Because he's had exposure with the first-team, I think people expect performance levels that are really consistent and really high. You've got first-team players across the country who don't do that.",
      "\"The expectation on him is high, but he has to deliver the basics, and what he did from minute 30 to 80 when he came off is he pressed, he ran and he occupied two centre halves to give other players space on the pitch to exploit, which is why we dominated the ball.",
      "Chido Obi of Manchester United (Image: 2025 Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA)",
      "\"I'm really pleased with him and we haven't even scraped the top of the iceberg with him. He's got loads to come. That will come from how he sees the game, keeps working hard and recognises he has stuff to develop because that's always a challenge when you have that first-team exposure and then you go away and have to start working on things.\"",
      "Binnion continued: \"When you score as many goals as he has throughout his relatively short life, you can define yourself by goals. And we all know there's probably only two or three strikers in the world who get two goals in every three games.",
      "\"If you're used to scoring two goals in every game, then recognising what the role is, how you have to go around it takes a little bit of time. He is dying to be a footballer.",
      "\"He is hungry. And he's still learning the game, learning how to project himself and learning how to play within a team, the club's shape and system, so there's still lots for him to do. The key is he wants to play, he wants to do well and wants to train. He could train every day if he could.\"",
      "Obi hopes to return to the first-team by the end of the season. He's in safe hands to achieve that aim.",

      "Senne Lammens has doubtless never experienced anything quite like what he did at the Emirates on Sunday. The viral picture that did the rounds earlier this week, showing him surrounded by players from both sides, does a good job of explaining the test for goalkeepers against Arsenal.",
      "It was clear the Gunners fancied their chances of getting at an inexperienced goalkeeper at this level. Time and again, they crowded him out, blocked his path to the ball and looked to stick deliveries right into his six-yard box. It was a tactic that had worked against the last two Manchester United goalkeepers they have faced.",
      "Andre Onana was unconvincing in a Premier League defeat at the Emirates last season, and Altay Bayindir was found flapping at Old Trafford on the opening day of this season.",
      "Try MEN Premium NOW for just £1",
      "In contrast, Lammens looked unflappable. The trust his defenders have quickly developed in him was made clear by Harry Maguire's Instagram post on Monday. The image showed Lammens surrounded by at least 13 players and included the captain 'Come on Senne Lammens punch another one clear for us\".",
      "It was a calm and composed performance from a young goalkeeper developing a reputation for just those traits. Lammens is just 23, which is no age for a first-choice goalkeeper, and is also relatively inexperienced. He made just 68 appearances in Belgium's top division before signing for United for £18.2million this summer.",
      "That was a battle won by the club and the scouting department, particularly goalkeeping talent spotter Tony Coton, who liked the look of Lammens. It was a gamble to sign a goalkeeper from Belgium and throw him straight in at Old Trafford, but he has had a good season and has the longevity that Emiliano Martinez doesn't. The Argentine was the man that Ruben Amorim wanted in goal.",
      "Lammens was so composed on debut that he was serenaded with chants of 'Are you Schemichel in disguise?'. His work with the ball at his feet has been risk-free and he is commanding in his box. There have been none of the jitters that accompanied the sight of Bayindir competing for a high ball.",
      "Senne Lammens has impressed since joining(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "FOLLOW OUR MAN UNITED FACEBOOK PAGE! Latest news and analysis via the MEN’s Manchester United Facebook page",
      "He also exudes calm to those in front of him, unlike Onana. Lammens is an organised goalkeeper capable of making good decisions. With Onana, you were never quite sure what was going to happen next, and that kind of uncertainty can spread to a defence.",
      "As you would expect from any young goalkeeper, Lammens hasn't been faultless, but his errors haven't been as glaring as those committed by Onana and Bayindir. He didn't have a great game in the 4-4 draw with Bournemouth and could have done better with Everton's goal in their win at Old Trafford. Compared to what came before, these are minor quibbles.",
      "In fact, the best thing you can say about Lammens is that nobody is really talking about him, and for a goalkeeper, that is a good position to be in. If your goalkeeper is attracting a lot of attention, it is rarely good news.",
      "Lammens' name was prominent again on Thursday morning, but for his goalscoring rather than his goalkeeping. Anatoliy Trubin's dramatic header for Benfica against Real Madrid in the Champions League on Wednesday was a stunning moment, and Lammens knows how it feels to score against the Spanish giants, albeit at a slightly different level.",
      "He did just that for Club Brugge against Real Madrid's youngsters in the UEFA Youth League back in 2019. His header secured a point in a 2-2 draw. He has already been up for a corner for United this season, adding to the chaos at Tottenham when Matthijs de Ligt got an injury-time equaliser.",
      "Maybe one day Lammens can follow in the footsteps of Peter Schmeichel by scoring for United. For now, just trying to get close to the standards he set in goal for the club is enough.",

      "Kobbie Mainoo covered more ground than any other Manchester United player in the club's last two games. The midfielder left nothing out there, putting himself about like a player with a point to prove.",
      "Mainoo's stock took a hit during Ruben Amorim's tenure, but strong performances against Manchester City and Arsenal were reminders of the wonderfully talented player United have on their hands.",
      "\"I think part of a career is a few ups and downs and sometimes it goes in different trajectories, but I think we've seen last week what Kobbie can bring. It was great,\" said Carrick before Arsenal.",
      "Mainoo is posting United-related photos on his social media again. There had been a nine-month Instagram hiatus, but he's been brought back into the fold by Carrick, who has known him since he was a boy.",
      "The 20-year-old was disenchanted with life under Amorim, and he was set to push to leave on loan in the January window until the Portuguese was axed amid rising tensions with the board.",
      "It was criminal that Amorim could not find a way to fit Mainoo into his system. Amorim overlooked Mainoo in his first game against Ipswich, which set the tone. He experimented with Mainoo as a No.10 and up front. There were jokes within the squad about him playing as a striker.",
      "Amorim eventually settled on his role, deciding he would compete with Bruno Fernandes for a starting spot in midfield. \"He is fighting for the position now with Bruno. I changed two midfielders. I like Mason Mount there because we want to score a goal,\" said Amorim in August.",
      "\"And then when I changed it, I felt that the team needed to return to one holding midfielder. So he just needs to fight for the position with Bruno in training. Like it should be at Manchester United.\"",
      "Mainoo was fighting a losing battle from that moment onwards, but he remained committed to winning his place back, doing extra work during the international breaks and changing his chef at home.",
      "Mainoo took another step forward against Arsenal.(Image: 2026 Manchester United FC)",
      "Mainoo's frustration began to show by the end of Amorim's tenure, though. He liked a few ill-timed posts on social media about Amorim, and his half-brother paraded a 'Free Kobbie Mainoo' t-shirt at Old Trafford. United insisted that Mainoo knew nothing about the stunt from his sibling.",
      "The frustration was understandable, given he'd gone from starting at Euro 2024 to not getting a sniff of a league start, but Mainoo had little chance when his manager pitted him against Fernandes.",
      "Fernandes has been an ever-present in the starting team since his arrival from Sporting Lisbon. He'd only ever missed two United games due to injury until his recent hamstring issue.",
      "Amorim essentially said Mainoo would never start in the Premier League when he confirmed he was competing with Fernandes. The United captain is undroppable and kept Mainoo out of the team.",
      "Mainoo was the biggest winner from Amorim's sacking, but his departure was bound to be a negative for some others, like Mason Mount, whose relationship with Amorim was strong.",
      "Mount benefited from Amorim's formation, and United were a better team when he was in the starting line-up in the first half of the campaign. Mount delivered consistently strong performances, scoring important goals against Sunderland and Crystal Palace to finally have momentum behind him.",
      "\"He can defend, he can attack. It's the quality that when he touches the ball, it's really good. So it's not a surprise for me, but of course, we need to take care of him,\" said Amorim last month.",
      "Writing on social media when Amorim's sacking was announced, Mount said: \"Thank you, gaffer. All the best to you and your staff for the future.\" Unsurprisingly, there was no farewell message from Mainoo.",
      "Mount and Fernandes embrace at Selhurst Park.(Image: 2025 Manchester United FC)",
      "Carrick has switched to 4-2-3-1 and Mainoo has slotted perfectly back into a three-man midfield, but the tactical switch now means Mount is competing with Fernandes to start as the central attacking midfielder.",
      "Mount was introduced in injury time in the Manchester derby and was an unused substitute against Arsenal. It's too early to say he won't be used as much by Carrick, but he only needs to look at Mainoo's situation from earlier in the season to know what happens when Fernandes is the competition to start.",
      "The silver lining for Mount is that he was in a similar position in the summer when Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed, setting them up as the first-choice players in Amorim's No.10 roles.",
      "Speaking in pre-season, Mount reflected: \"Any opportunity you get, you've got to try and take it. And, yeah, I mean, I'll always back myself. I know what I can do. But we're a team and we're all working together in that.",
      "\"Obviously, with the new signings coming in, they (Cunha and Mbeumo) are going to elevate us to another level, and we all need to be at that level to really perform.\"",
      "Mount backed himself and successfully found a way to force himself into the side. That may be more difficult to do against Fernandes, but he's already shown the required talent and mentality to do so. It will also help that Mount could feature on the flanks in the 4-2-3-1. It would be stupid to write him off.",

      "Lammens made an impressive debut against Sunderland.(Image: Getty Images)",
      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Lammens celebrates against Sunderland. (Image: 2025 Ben Roberts - Danehouse)",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon pictured during his stint with Club Brugge (he now manages F.C.V. Dender).",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "A baby-faced Lammens playing for Club Brugge in 2021. (Image: 2021 BSR Agency)",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "Lammens in action for Royal Antwerp in 2024. (Image: Photonews 2024)",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "Three teams have been picked for more Premier League TV games than Arsenal, Liverpool and Chelsea this season. Manchester United, obviously, but also…",
      "Premier League clubs received a total of £2.83billion last season, which was comprised of six payments through the division’s ‘central revenue system’, something the Premier League says ‘ensures the most equitable distribution of funds of any major European league’.",
      "Liverpool were paid £174.9m as champions – short of Manchester City’s record £176.2m in 2022/23 – while Newcastle received just over £160m to chuck into their PSR black hole.",
      "Southampton were handed £109.2m for their efforts in finishing a distant bottom. It pays to be in the Premier League.",
      "Some of those payments are fixed. All 20 clubs automatically receive around £96.9m through an equal share distributed based on both the domestic (£29.8m in 2024/25) and international (£59.2m in 2024/25) broadcast deals – those TV rights are lucrative for a reason – as well as £7.9m each from central commercial revenue streams.",
      "The rest is variable, based on where clubs finish and how often their games are selected for broadcast.",
      "",
      "The Premier League merit payments are distributed on a sliding scale from 1st to 20th, made up of combined earnings from domestic and international broadcast deals.",
      "For the 2024/25 season, the difference in prize money was around £2.7m per position. Southampton were given as much for finishing bottom, all the way up to champions Liverpool receiving £53.1m. It basically helped pay for 97.4% of Giorgi Mamardashvili and Jeremie Frimpong.",
      "That can be expected to fluctuate with inflation and other factors – it was around £2.8m per position in 2023/24 – but it offers a rough guide as to what clubs should expect to earn this season.",
      "",
      "1st (Arsenal) – £53.1m",
      "2nd (Manchester City) – £50.4m",
      "3rd (Aston Villa) – £47.7m",
      "4th (Manchester United) – £45m",

      "20th (Wolves) – £2.7m",
      "",
      "The only other part of the prize money which is not fixed and shared equally are the facility fees, which are based on how many times each club has been selected for television.",
      "In 2024/25, Liverpool had 30 games televised in the UK, for which they received £24.9m in facility fees. Arsenal had 29 matches and were paid £24.2m, while Manchester United (28 games for £23.4m), Aston Villa (27 games for £22.6m) and Chelsea (26 games for £21.8m) were televised frequently and rewarded handsomely.",
      "Ipswich were shown on the fewest occasions and received £8.9m in facility fees for their 10 live televised UK fixtures.",
      "This can lead to discrepancies in terms of those variable payments. Manchester United’s prize money after finishing 15th last season was £136.2m, more than the four clubs immediately above them – West Ham (£130.9m in 14th), Everton (£131.8m in 13th), Crystal Palace (£136.1m in 12th) and Fulham (£135.5m in 11th) – as Ruben Amorim’s side were picked for far more live TV games.",
      "Spurs were another massive outlier, earning more in 17th (£127.8m) than Wolves did in 16th (£123.1m) in part because they had nine more games picked for live UK broadcast.",

      "One big change in Premier League prize money going forward is that the 2025/26 season represents the start of a new four-year TV deal cycle.",
      "A new record £6.7bn domestic rights deal will see the number of live games rocket up to 267 of a possible 380, with every Premier League game outside the protected Saturday 3pm kick-offs to be broadcast live.",

      "Overseas TV rights are worth more than £2bn per year to the Premier League with new deals signed with broadcasters in Japan and Mexico to go alongside lucrative packages in America, Scandinavia, Thailand, China, India and elsewhere.",
      "But the facility fee payments are tied to how many times a team is picked for broadcast by Sky and TNT, with both broadcasters having made their picks up to before Boxing Day. One game generally translates to roughly £0.83m but does fluctuate.",
      "Brentford, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Newcastle and Spurs were the biggest winners from the latest round of picks up to March 22 with three more games each.",
      "Aston Villa, Burnley, Crystal Palace and Fulham were only selected once more – on the March midweek when every team will be televised.",
      "1st) Manchester United (26 games televised live in the UK) – worth around £21.8m in 2024/25",

      "The Netherlands international, who joined Man Utd for around £12m in 2022, has been hampered severely by injuries after making 22 Premier League appearances in his first season at Old Trafford under Erik ten Hag.",
      "There were rumours of interest over the summer transfer window but he ultimately remained at Old Trafford and, with no chance of making any appearances, transfer expert Fabrizio Romano insisted earlier this year that Malacia “will leave the club” in 2026.",
      "READ: January Transfer Deadline Day – follow it LIVE with Football365",
      "Romano said on his YouTube channel in October : Tyrell Malacia, despite returning to training with the first team of Manchester United after a crazy window where he had several opportunities, Tyrell Malacia is not going to sign any new contract at Man United, and in any case, will leave the club for sure, 100% in 2026.”",
      "Just a few days ago, a report in the Netherlands insisted that a deal that would see Malacia leave Old Trafford is ‘likely to happen in final days’ of the transfer window.",

      "The Premier League title race is over yet again, and the shot in the arm of the relegation battle sadly did not last.",
      "",
      "Have they broken the record for the most Premier League titles declared both won and lost in the same season yet?",
      "Mikel Arteta is level-headed enough to let that infernal battle play out away from the Emirates. While the pundits deliver their latest hot takes and rivals line up to set up Arsenal for the ultimate fall, his reframing of this run-in as “fun” and something to “enjoy” after the nervousness which encapsulated the loss to Manchester United was wise.",
      "They will drop points again and there will be panic. But Arsenal responding to all three of their Premier League defeats so far with victory in their very next game is telling.",
      "Their closest rivals drew with a bottom-half side decimated by injury and lost at home to 10 men. The reaction to Manchester City and Aston Villa’s slips generated a fraction of the fume and mockery that met Arsenal’s recent wobble (of one defeat in nine games). Block out the noise and they will be fine.",

      "With his 14th and 15th strikes of an exceptional debut season, Ekitike burst past all three and fully embraced his responsibility as the club’s clearest and most potent attacking threat.",
      "It was a masterclass of movement and finishing from the highest-scoring new signing of the Premier League season so far. And a workshop in ingratiating oneself with the supporters too, considering his taunting of the club who sensed he might be capable of embracing Alexander Isak’s mantle.",
      "Fate transpired to pit Ekitike directly against Isak in the summer. On the evidence of the last few months, the most expensive player in British football history might need to start taking notes from the sidelines on a 23-year-old phenomenon.",

      "Fair play for taking it upon himself to test that absurd Roy Keane stance, also previously echoed by Gary Neville, that Manchester United should not appoint Carrick even if he wins every game from now until the end of the season.",

      "",
      "A fundamentally stupid and in many ways unimprovable institution.",
      "",
      "A first Premier League clean sheet since Dean Smith’s Norwich thrashed Claudio Ranieri’s Watford in January 2022.",
      "It eternally damns Crystal Palace that Gunn did not face a single shot on target on his Nottingham Forest debut as a half-time substitute for a team reduced to 10 men. He did have a couple of high balls to deal with but did so with relative ease.",
      "Those 45 minutes could be Gunn’s last at club level in a World Cup year after the signing of Stefan Ortega and introduction of Neco Williams to the City Ground goalkeeper pecking order. It might be enough to keep Craig Gordon out against Haiti, Morocco and Brazil.",
      "But that second-half performance fundamentally underlined how Dyche has these players on board and attuned to his demands. While his methods will never retain the full support of the fans as the effectiveness wears off over time and their entertainment value is automatically set at zero, they have been what Forest needed in the moment.",
      "Only five clubs have conceded fewer goals since he inherited the Premier League’s third-worst defence in October. If they stay up, there will be no mystery about how.",

      "",
      "Four more draws to simultaneously rack up 200 Premier League stalemates and overtake Arsene Wenger for the most ever overseen by a manager.",
      "If he doesn’t then immediately pull out a “that’s what I do, draw” in an echo of that wonderful first West Ham press conference boast, Moyes can definitively be declared a coward.",
      "It is also really good fun to see Everton rationing their goals so beautifully. The eight teams above them have scored at least eight more goals than the Toffees, who have still not had one player score more than a single goal in any game in all competitions all season.",
      "Beto and Thierno Barry are doing really well learning how to be patient and take turns.",
      "",
      "Play like that in the Championship and a strikeforce of Adam Armstrong and Che Adams will score 100 goals each, even before they spend £10m on Barry Bannan.",
      "",
      "It feels like Paco Jemez had his point ultimately proved a week later.",
      "“It’s a football situation where he tells me to do one thing and I tell him the substitution wasn’t bad, but I’d do it with someone else,” the West Ham assistant said of his touchline tiff with Nuno Espirito Santo, who sought to close out a win over Sunderland by reaching for his Max Kilman-shaped comfort blanket.",
      "It was the second consecutive win in which Kilman had been brought on in stoppage time to shore things up. While the Hammers held on in both games, half an hour with a slender lead away at a resurgent Chelsea felt like a sub-optimal time to introduce the goal concession magnet.",
      "There was no specific individual blame to hand out for either of Chelsea’s goals thereafter, but trying to soak up pressure for that long, against that team, in that stadium and those circumstances, was certainly a choice.",
      "It would have been risky for a manager who had orchestrated at least one solitary clean sheet since April 1. That Nuno has failed to do so in his last 32 games in charge of West Ham and Nottingham Forest could well prove terminal to their survival hopes.",
      "No club has dropped more points from winning positions this season than West Ham. Add just one third of the 18 they have squandered and the Hammers would be level with Forest and Leeds. Either the coach or the players need to learn how to manage a game properly.",
      "",
      "There it is.",
      "Oliver Glasner “would prefer not to be talking the day before the deadline about transfers”. His wish was “that everything had been sorted two weeks ago, so we could train and focus on development”. His belief is that Crystal Palace “are starting again from two years ago, having to teach them how we want to play and how we want to attack”.",
      "The Nottingham Forest draw was a difficult lesson in that regard: 45 chastening minutes being out-played by the side in 17th with 10 men cannot be entirely blamed on having to wait one entire day of January before spending £35m on Brennan Johnson.",
      "It just isn’t going to work. The resentment he still carries against a hierarchy identifying potential signings to both appease a coach who is leaving in a matter of months and to suit his successor is clear, and having an obvious impact on the pitch.",
      "Glasner feels they are “taking a step backwards” by recruiting players in mid-season and having to indoctrinate them in his ways while in the weeds of a 12-game winless run.",
      "But his rudimentary inability to coach against low blocks feels like a bigger problem: since the start of last season, Palace have had more than 50 per cent possession in 14 Premier League games, and won only three of them (with 55 per cent v Ipswich, with 53 per cent v Spurs and with 52 per cent v Wolves).",
      "With 67 per cent on the ball against Nottingham Forest, their issues – albeit without progressive ball players the calibre of Adam Wharton and Daichi Kamada – were laid painfully bare.",
      "",
      "Eddie Howe can pretend all he likes that “PSR is controlling what we’re able to do, and you’ll understand that gives us limited room to manoeuvre – to try to bring a player in who is good enough to elevate the group and to have a long-term future at the football club, with the finances we have available, is very difficult”.",
      "But it rings hollow when your bench at Anfield is occupied by two centre-forwards signed in the summer for a combined £120m, watching three wide forwards buzz around in an eternal 4-3-3.",
      "Howe has to find another way of coping, especially against this calibre of opposition. Newcastle have won a single game out of eight against the current top six; the only clubs with fewer points from matches against Arsenal, Manchester City, Aston Villa, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool this season than the Magpies (five) are the bottom three.",
      "This was meant to be the season Newcastle properly challenged the foundations of the elite, armed with a trophy, Champions League qualification and a record level of investment. Between last summer and this season, the sheer depths of that gap have only been emphasised.",
      "",
      "It feels like this is precisely what Unai Emery meant when he told everyone to shut up about the title and said Aston Villa “are still not being contenders” for the top five as “there are other teams with more potential than us”.",
      "One home defeat to 10-man Brentford with Tammy Abraham leading the line and two substitutions being made while chasing the game later, and Jamie Redknapp need no longer performatively pretend not to understand the point.",
      "If they’re not already ignoring the temptation to look up at Arsenal and instead stare down at a resurgent Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool, now is probably the time.",
      "",
      "No defender has been dribbled past more often per 90 minutes in the Premier League this season. Knee surgery, missing pre-season and facing Amad will do that to you.",
      "",
      "Is James Milner really worth sacrificing your job for?",
      "",
      "The only club to lose more than a single Premier League game by four goals or more this season – and both have been to the creative attacking black hole that is Arsenal.",
      "",
      "Stan Collymore always gets his man in the end.",
      "Kylian Mbappe is out of the blocks like a bullet in 2026. There are no Premier League players to be seen as yet.",
      "We bring you the early Ballon d’Or odds, with 2025 runner-up Kylian Mbappe the early favourite for the gong in 2026.",
      "Pep Guardiola bent the Premier League to his will at Manchester City to the extent that non-league sides tried to copy him. Now he is finding where he fits.",
      "Forget the league table, it’s all about the Premier League net spend table. And neither Man City nor Liverpool are in top five.",
      "Four Man Utd deals are on the cards but none of them are for Carlos Baleba and Cole Palmer, whatever they want you to believe.",
      "Who knew Gareth Barry would be so crucial to Brighton and the future of manager Fabian Hurzeler in 2026, almost three decades after he left for Aston Villa?"

      "“I’d expect them to agree a contract before a new manager is in. I would think that the Amorim block will go, and they will not take any chances with it, even if it means paying slightly more than they probably would have wanted to.”",

He beat Newcastle and Chelsea at Old Trafford this season. And in last season’s Europa League semi-finals, he smashed Athletic Bilbao 7-1 on aggregate.",

      "What Carrick has done effectively in his opening two weeks is the cliched Back To Basics thing. People often say managers must Go Back To Basics without actually knowing what that entails. Rondos and starting Kobbie Mainoo, apparently.",

      "On Sunday, Fulham faced Michael Carrick’s Manchester United as underdogs. It was the first time in three games the Red Devils were expected to win under Carrick’s watch, and they dealt with the pressure to pass a very important test by the skin of their teeth.",
      "United were absolutely not perfect, as the 3-2 scoreline suggests. They still gave up plenty of chances and conceded three times, one of which was ruled out by the narrowest of offsides.",
      "Carrick’s United are direct, even with Bryan Mbeumo up front by himself. They feed off second balls and counter effectively. Sometimes they defend well too. Other times, the club’s modern-day DNA comes through.",
      "Raul Jimenez’s late penalty set up a nervous ending and United did sh*t the bed as Kevin’s beauty levelled the scoring. But it was that good old United DNA that saved them as substitute Benjamin Sesko popped up with a fantastic 94th-minute winner.",
      "It was an important test for Carrick but also an important lesson. Chelsea and Liam Rosenior learned that resting your best players is dangerous, and Carrick learned that taking them off, even at 2-0, is also pretty dangerous.",
      "Casemiro, Ruben Amorim’s biggest success story, continues to impress and staked a claim for the club to extend his contract beyond this summer with a goal and an assist. However, the control United had was lost when he came off. The Brazilian has come a long way from that night at Selhurst Park, becoming an indispensable player who apparently can’t miss any minutes whatsoever.",
      "His goal was an outstanding back-post header from a Bruno Fernandes free-kick following a Jorge Cuenca shirt-pull on Matheus Cunha, which United initially thought was going to be a penalty after Cuenca’s sliding tackle on Cunha. The replays suggested a goal kick was more likely, and we’re sure Marco Silva will have something very interesting to say.",
      "Goal contributions aside, it was a commanding midfield performance from Casemiro. He and Mainoo provide a lovely balance in the middle of the park, and with Bruno Fernandes in front of them? Chef’s kiss.",
      "For Carrick, it has genuinely been a case of playing your best players in their best positions and standing in the technical area with your hands behind your back as a well-functioning XI do their thing. And from now on, he will play his best players for even longer. Amazingly, that is a better idea than bringing on Manuel Ugarte.",
      "While it was a scare for United and could have prompted a very different reaction from us, Carrick’s perfect start continued. It was comfortable for the most part against weaker opposition in good form, which tells us more about Carrick and United’s credentials than wins against the Premier League’s top two, especially when these were the fixtures the previous manager struggled with most.",
      "It’s two wins from two at Old Trafford and an away win against the league leaders, who hadn’t lost at home all season before United’s brilliant 3-2 victory. That also happened to be the first time Arsenal and their rock-solid defence have conceded three goals in a match since December 2023.",
      "Two whole calendar years without conceding three goals in a game is quite something. For all the talk of Arsenal capitulating, Carrick deserves huge credit for that victory, not just the brilliant start he has made.",
      "Aston Villa might want to look over their shoulder as Carrick’s United soar. The players look confident and settled. Everyone is contributing. The partnerships are working well all over the pitch. For once, it actually looks like a football team enjoying themselves and a group of players who genuinely like each other.",

It was criminal that Slot dropped him as soon as Isak was fit; that decision also coincided with our horrendous down turn in form but I suspect that correlation rather than causation. If he were to do so again then I think fans would riot. Hugo has earned that spot right now and it should be his to keep; everyone else in this team needs to find a place around him in my opinion.",
      "The Mo drop off is so sad to watch and so hard to understand. He was through and clear on goal and forgot to curve his run to bring him closer to goal. In the end Trippier just took it off him. Is he fully devoid of confidence or just downing tools until Slot is gone? His lack of output combined with Gakpo is probably why we have struggled so much this season. Today Gakpo had these flashes driving into space but then had zero output or clue of what to do every time. He seems so out of sync with the team; once he raced into the box and then to the byline and crossed it at chest level for a defender to clear when he could’ve rolled it on the floor two touches earlier into feet for a finish.",

I was badly wrong about Ekitike when I said he’d only ever be as good as Nunez, and right about Wirtz that he might well struggle with the physicality of the PL this season. But!

      "The giant Georgian just scrapes in having played five games when Alisson was injured and Liverpool were caving in after a flying start. Apparently, half of the 10 goals Mamardashvili conceded were saveable, but he performed above expectation on a third of the shots he saved.",

      "Raya has faced 52 shots on target, at least a dozen fewer than any other regular No.1, considerably fewer than any other keeper, but the fact the Spaniard is fifth for shots saved above expectation indicates he has been a reliable presence when called upon.",
      "A very mixed season for Sels after sharing the Golden Glove last term. Sean Dyche toyed with replacing the Belgian but Big John blew it.",
      "You can’t blame Vicario for looking unsettled behind that Spurs side but he has been caught up in the chaos too often, even if the stats suggest he remains one the Premier League’s better shotstoppers.",
      "The numbers suggest Pickford has been something of a contradiction. He has made the third-highest number of big saves and is fifth for shots on target saved, but he has conceded the second-highest number of saveable goals (14). Still England’s No.1.",
      "The Netherlands No.1 continues to catch eyes, with Bayern Munich and Tottenham both credited with an interest in the Seagulls stopper. Scrapes into the Premier League power rankings top 30.",
      "A very middle-of-the-road season so far from Henderson, who needed his best yet if he hoped to dislodge Pickford in the England goal in time for the World Cup. May get plenty of opportunities to impress before then since Palace have sold their captain and best defender.",

      "According to reports, Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes has made a new ‘transfer decision’ amid interest from European and Saudi Pro League sides.",
      "Fernandes has consistently been Man Utd’s best performer in recent years as he is arguably their sole world-class player.",
      "United‘s captain has carried the broken club on his back during their recent dark times, but it has been widely reported that he could be on borrowed time at Old Trafford.",
      "Last summer, it was reported that Man Utd were looking to cash in on Fernandes to fund their rebuild, so a move to Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal looked likely.",
      "Fernandes eventually decided to remain at Man Utd, but he hinted in a recent interview that he is not completely happy with the board’s treatment of him.",
      "This has fuelled fresh speculation regarding a possible exit from Man Utd, with Saudi Pro League teams and Bayern Munich mooted as potential destinations for the midfielder, who has sparkled in Michael Carrick’s first two games as interim boss.",
      "READ: Ballard, Stach to Man Utd: Ten Premier League newbies poised for pillaging",
      "However, a new report from Football Insider journalist Pete O’Rourke claims Fernandes’ latest ‘transfer decision’ is that he has ‘no plans to move to the Saudi Pro League at this stage of his career as he aims to continue playing at the highest level possible’.",
      "“I think he can definitely stay beyond this summer. He’s under contract until 2027, and there’s an option in that deal, as well, to extend it,” O’Rourke told Football Insider.",
      "“If he was to become available, there’s no doubt that there would be clubs interested in him.",
      "“We know that obviously there has been interest from the Saudi Pro League before, but I’m not sure that Fernandes is ready to move there at this stage of his career. He still wants to play at the highest level.“",
      "Man Utd legend Teddy Sheringham has admitted that he has concerns about Fernandes, even though it would be a “huge loss” if he moved elsewhere in the summer.",
      "“In terms of Bruno [Fernandes] you’re looking at two different things,” Sheringham told Bet MGM.",
      "“You’re looking at him as captain material and whether he’s an identity which is what the club stands for. I don’t think he’s that because he doesn’t lead by example in his manner on the pitch.",
      "“We’ve seen him throw his arms up in the air and all that which I don’t think is a good look and not something a captain should be doing.",
      "“Don’t get me wrong, the way he’s performed on the pitch over the last couple of years, he’s definitely a type of leader but I’m not sure he’s a captain.",
      "“There’s been a lot of speculation about his future. First of all, you don’t want to lose your top players and without a doubt, Bruno has been one of Manchester United’s top performers over the last two-and-a-half years in a team full of players who have been underperforming.",
      "“I don’t listen too much to speculation but, of course, he’d be a huge loss if he did move on at the end of the season.”",
      "According to reports, Real Madrid ‘want’ Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes and it’s claimed that he could replace Jude Bellingham.",
      "If you stop Bruno Fernandes, you go a long way towards stopping Man Utd. But the stats prove how hard it is to subdue the Red Devils captain…",
      "Man Utd would need an “astronomical offer” to convince Chelsea to sell Cole Palmer with transfer rumblings “getting louder”, according to reports.",
      "New information has emerged on Bruno Fernandes’ future at Manchester United, including a no-brainer decision and a ‘significant’ demand for a new contract.",
      "Arsenal’s 1-0 win over Man Utd in August gave a false perception of where each club was headed, so I have revisited ten of our conclusions from that game…",

      "Man Utd won't U-turn on the decision to allow Casemiro to leave when his contract expires in June despite improved Premier League form under Michael Carrick; the club are forward planning and expected to chase a number of midfield targets in the summer, with Elliot Anderson top of list",
      "Monday 2 February 2026 14:30, UK",
      "Manchester United midfielder Casemiro is in his richest vein of form since arriving at Old Trafford in a deal worth £70m in 2022. So why would the club let him go now?",
      "The veteran Brazil international, who turns 34 later this month, rolled back the years as Man Utd picked up another dramatic win over Fulham on Sunday, heading in the opener before setting up Matheus Cunha's goal with a sublime no-look pass.",
      "Casemiro has started all three games under Carrick, but made his impending departure official last month while Ruben Amorim was still in charge. United did hold the option to trigger a 12-month extension, but with a midfield overhaul planned for the summer it was decided that Casemiro would be allowed to leave.",
      "\"Manchester United are determined not to have a short-term approach to signings and managers. That's what has got them into trouble in the past. It's left a lot of big-name players on big wages who are not part of the plans.",
      "\"Casemiro is flying right now. Player of the match against Fulham. I can understand why a lot of fans are saying: 'we're trying to find a midfielder but willing to let Casemiro go?'",
      "\"He turns 34 later this month, he's one of the biggest earners at the club, £325k a week, and Man Utd know that can't go on forever. He's playing out of his skin right now but they have to have a longer-term plan.",
      "\"Casemiro will leave in the summer, they have done the big goodbye video and there is no going back on that.\"",
      "\"I think it is. He has done brilliantly well, playing with Kobbie Mainoo and Bruno Fernandes in there makes a difference.",
      "\"He's got to move on. He's 34 and before you know it, he's 35. He's been a top player; he's had a lot of unworthy stick because he hasn't got the legs to play on his own in midfield if Fernandes pushes forward.",
      "\"Mainoo has helped that a lot - common sense by Michael Carrick. But we're talking about the future of Man Utd and they are right to be doing what they're doing and letting him go.\"",
      "\"Midfield is where Man Utd feel they will focus the bulk of their spend in the summer.",
      "\"Carlos Baleba at Brighton is on their list, Elliot Anderson at Nottingham Forest, they like Adam Wharton, and Joao Gomes at Wolves so there's a number of options. They may even do two.",
      "\"Window by window, they are prioritising areas of the team. It's a very data-led approach. Last summer the priority was to score more goals so that's why they pumped £280m into three forward players.",
      "\"Now they are wanting to solve the next imbalance and are going to address midfield. I get the impression Anderson is top of the list but we're talking over £100m.\"",
      "The logic here is obvious. Casemiro is an aging midfielder, whose stamina has been questioned repeatedly over the past 18 months. Perhaps some of the blame lies at the door of previous manager Ruben Amorim, as it was clear to most that Casemiro no longer had the legs to be the heart of the engine room. The rebalance with Kobbie Mainoo has proved invaluable.",
      "Clearly, he's still got plenty to offer Man Utd between now and the end of the season, though. Maybe beyond. But time is against him and a recalibration of the wage bill is necessary if the club want to chase top targets in the summer.",
      "Still, Casemiro's worth can still be underlined by his numbers. He's scored as many goals as Fernandes (five) in the Premier League this season - also equal to Benjamin Sesko. His aerial ability makes him a huge threat from set-pieces, with four of those goals headers.",
      "Defensively he's made the most tackles (52) of any Man Utd player and recovered the second-most possessions in midfield (51), behind Fernandes. His duels won (107) can only be bettered by Patrick Dorgu. And his quality on the ball is undeniable.",
      "This latest upturn will ensure he gets a big send-off in May. But before then, he's proving a highly resourceful and reliable asset for Carrick to call upon.",

      "\"The first one is much more difficult to accept because of the feedback we got. All of the people in the stadium felt the penalty was given because of the tackle.\"",

      "It was easy street for Man City in the first half. They didn't need to get out of first gear at Spurs. The problem was they stayed there for the rest of the game.",
      "There's been a common theme regarding Pep Guardiola's teams and that is slow second halves after being 2-0 up.",
      "Against Wolves, Joao Gomes and Jorgen Strand Larsen should have pulled a goal back for the league's bottom side but missed chances. Victor Osimhen should have scored once or twice for Galatasaray in midweek. This dip at Spurs was one too many - and it felt similar to the two second-half goals conceded in the Manchester derby",
      "Guardiola said his City team suffered emotionally after the injustice of Dominic Solanke's first goal standing due to the Marc Guehi collision. Duels were missed, particularly out wide with the full-backs, he said - and it was seen in the equaliser as Nico O'Reilly and Nico Gonzalez got mixed up.",
      "And then the excuses from Guardiola start to come. Blaming the Guehi-Solanke incident follows similar complaints about not getting a penalty against Wolves and Diogo Dalot staying on the pitch in the Manchester derby. The reality is City have been struggling in the most important parts of matches.",
      "Is it a physical issue, with injuries catching up on them? Is it too many new players over the last 12 months? It all acts as a reminder that this is not a Manchester City of years gone by. How many times in the past would a Guardiola team kill a game off early and sit on a lead, maybe push for more?",
      "They need a fix to this second-half issue quickly, as it's Liverpool up next in the Premier League. The gap to Arsenal cannot afford to get bigger.Sam Blitz",

      "In his pre-match press conference ahead of the game against Manchester City, Thomas Frank said Xavi Simons needed to translate his Champions League performances domestically. He certainly did that.",
      "The Dutchman was the biggest beneficiary of the 3-4-3 system that was forced to turn to due to the injuries that have plagued the squad. With the wide wing-backs pushing up, it gave Simons ample space inside to operate in areas he is dangerous in.",
      "More often than not, he was the go-to for Spurs as they transitioned from defence into attack. His neat footwork was at times a joy and his weight of pass was more often than not, exemplary.",
      "Having said that, the most impressive thing was his tenacity. He never gave up a fight for possession. He showed the grit needed in tough and physical Premier League games, and lived to tell the tale.",
      "This was somewhat of a coming our performance for Simons, whose quality was never questioned, but was a case of if it was suited to English football.",
      "In perhaps one of the most difficult games Spurs will have this season with regards to the pressure they are under and the opposition they found themselves against, an unsung hero stepped up and epitomised what Spurs' comeback was all about.Callum Bishop",
      "Morgan Gibbs-White was named man of the match as 10-man Nottingham Forest held Crystal Palace to a draw but Elliot Anderson was an equally deserving candidate.",
      "The 23-year-old showed all sides of his game in a complete performance which underlined, again, his status as one of the Premier League's top central midfielders.",
      "His best work came in possession in the first half as he demonstrated his technical ability and passing range, sending Forest forward on the attack repeatedly.",
      "He continued to show his on-ball value even after Neco Williams' sending-off. No Forest player had more touches or made more passes over the course of the 90 minutes. Anderson even completed all five of his attempted dribbles.",
      "But he was just as influential defensively after the break. Anderson snapped into challenges and played a crucial role in frustrating Palace, working tirelessly, cajoling and instructing team-mates.",
      "In total, he won possession 10 times, the highest total by any player on either side. He was also successful in 12 of his 14 duels. An outstanding all-round performance from a player getting better all the time.Nick Wright",
      "The draw against Nottingham Forest extended Crystal Palace's winless run to nine in the Premier League and 12 in all competitions. Shelbourne were the last team they beat, all the way back on December 11.",
      "But while that is miserable, arguably more concerning is their struggles in front of goal.",
      "Across those last 12, they have scored nine, with three scored from the penalty spot. That equates to a goal from open play every other game.",
      "Even with the absence of Jean-Philippe Mateta - who was left out of the squad owing to the speculation around his future - Palace should probably have put more than an Ismaila Sarr penalty past Matz Sels - and half-time replacement Angus Gunn. Their hosts were reduced to 10 after a mindless handball from Neco Williams.",
      "But despite having 74 per cent of the possession after the break, they just couldn't. In fact, in the second half, they recorded only 0.22 xG and did not even muster a single shot on target.",
      "Right now, Mateta's future remains up in the air ahead of Deadline Day, but Palace have had a bid for Jorgen Strand Larsen totalling £48m accepted by Wolves. Providing that deal goes through without a hitch, they will need him to be firing from the off.Dan Long",
      "Aston Villa welcomed Douglas Luiz and Tammy Abraham back to the club this week and the duo went straight into the starting line-up against Brentford.",
      "This wasn't a nod to their talents, although both looked bright in flashes. It was evidence of the strain Unai Emery's squad is currently under.",
      "Captain John McGinn and top goalscorer Ollie Watkins both watched on from the stands due to injury, with Boubacar Kamara and Youri Tielemans joining them on the sidelines.",
      "Club-record singing Amadou Onana also wasn't fit enough to feature, despite being named on the bench.",
      "The injury crisis continues to sweep the club and faltering against the 10 men of Brentford highlighted that lack of depth.",
      "Arsenal know more than anyone how injuries can impact a team pushing at the top of the table.",
      "A seven-point gap to Liverpool in sixth remains after this defeat but moving forward, Villa might need to pay closer attention to those behind them rather than Arsenal at the top.Patrick Rowe",

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League weekend.",
      "This is one of those prices that makes you stop, wash your face with cold water and check you're reading it correctly.",
      "Aston Villa to win at 21/20 with Sky Bet feels very generous considering what this team have been telling us for months.",
      "Since going winless in their opening five Premier League games, Villa have been nothing short of elite. They've taken 43 points from 18 matches, title-challenger output no doubt and no side in the division have collected more points over that period. That's not a short hot streak either. It's a sample of results to respect. It's sustained excellence.",
      "Brentford, meanwhile, remain a side you want to oppose on their travels. Only bottom club Wolves have suffered more away defeats in the Premier League this season (8). Home win.",
      "There is no better attacker of a set-piece in world football than Harry Maguire. And in a Premier League season where dead-ball situations are being mined relentlessly for goals, Maguire is going to get his feed soon enough.",
      "Back in the Manchester United starting XI, Maguire is playing with an authority that has shone brightly in the last two performances. That confidence can translate to when he ventures forward. Maguire's old-school dominance remains a potent betting weapon and the 7/1 with Sky Bet for him to score is worth jumping on.",
      "There's a strong whiff of needle about this one. There's lingering animosity in the air after the summer legal battles which ended in Forest replacing Palace in the Europa League and when you layer in the relegation context, emotions are likely to be running hot. That's usually when the card markets come alive.",
      "One match-up in particular looks primed to deliver.",
      "Neco Williams is expected to lock horns with Ismaila Sarr, and that's a tough afternoon for any full-back. Sarr is relentless in one-vs-one situations, drives straight at defenders and forces decisions at pace. The data is damning from a defensive perspective as Sarr has drawn 21 cards from opponents since the start of last season, with only Bruno Guimaraes responsible for more in the Premier League.",
      "Williams looks a bet material at 100/30 with Sky Bet to be carded in an edgy game.",
      "There's no escaping the strange relationship between these two. Spurs have won seven of the last 12 meetings and Pep Guardiola has lost more Premier League games against Tottenham (8) than any other opponent. On paper, that history screams Tottenham.",
      "And when you see Spurs at 100/30 with Sky Bet, the temptation is obvious. But Spurs at home remain impossible to trust.",
      "Instead of fighting the uncertainty, the smarter route is to isolate a player who can still profit from Spurs doing some things right and that's where Dominic Solanke to score at 11/4 with Sky Bet comes to the party.",
      "He's become something of a forgotten man, but Solanke is built to score in the Premier League. Goals in back-to-back games is a reminder of his talents.",
      "There's also a bigger-picture motivation edge at play. With England's forward depth in focus, Solanke knows he's fighting to be a potential Harry Kane understudy this summer for England at the World Cup.",
      "Sunderland remain the only Premier League team unbeaten at home this season. That is wild.",
      "But trends do snap and, in betting, timing when to step in to profit from such a run ending is a key weapon to use when trying to profit in this game. It's 19/5 with Sky Bet to end here - a price on a Burnley win that is too big to pass up.",
      "The absence of Granit Xhaka is pivotal. We saw exactly how fragile Sunderland can be without their midfield reference point in their worst performance of the season away at West Ham. Without Xhaka's control, leadership and ability to dictate tempo, Sunderland lost structure, lost composure and were far too easy to play through.",
      "Burnley need wins now. So their approach will be positive and the market is dangling a very juicy carrot towards us regarding their win prospects."

      "Michael Carrick will go for a third consecutive win as Man Utd head coach against Fulham on Super Sunday and goalkeeper Senne Lammens has a big role to play; The Radar column also reveals the passing stats that set Aston Villa's Ezri Konsa apart",
      "Sunday 1 February 2026 07:04, UK",
      "",
      "🔴 Lammens brings calm to Man Utd💪 Konsa's passing under pressure🔍 A player to watch this weekend",
      "Manchester United beat Arsenal last Sunday with the help of two moments of brilliance from Matheus Cunha and Patrick Dorgu. But their goalkeeper played his part too, albeit in typically understated style. Senne Lammens continues to impress.",
      "The 23-year-old, an £18m signing from Royal Antwerp, has looked good value ever since his debut in October, when he kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford, instantly bringing a level of calm Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana lacked.",
      "Certainly, it is what Manchester United needed, and Lammens has brought plenty more besides. The various ways in which he has improved the side were neatly outlined at the Emirates Stadium as he helped Michael Carrick make it two wins from two.",
      "Firstly, there were examples of his shot-stopping ability, most notably in the first half, when he produced an outstanding reflex save to push Martin Zubimendi's close-range header over the bar. He later got down smartly to deny Bukayo Saka at his near post.",
      "The underlying data shows that, excluding own goals, Lammens has conceded 21 goals from chances worth an expected total of 23.74 since his arrival in the Premier League, giving him a chunky positive differential of nearly three goals prevented across 15 games.",
      "It is a considerable improvement on Bayindir, whose shot-stopping is deemed to be one of his stronger attributes but who had a negative differential for goals prevented across his six starts in the early weeks of the season, according to the same data.",
      "Lammens has proved useful with his feet as well as his hands, particularly over long distances.",
      "He sent 33 of his 36 passes long against Arsenal, having sent 11 out of 13 long in the 2-0 win over Manchester City. Overall this season, Lammens has sent the fourth-highest percentage of passes long among Premier League goalkeepers at 66.15 per cent.",
      "The increased emphasis on directness is a welcome change given the issues United previously encountered when trying to play out from the back under Carrick's predecessor Ruben Amorim.",
      "Lammens' passes, which are usually struck with precision and travel with flat trajectories, serve several functions, allowing Manchester United to bypass their opponents' press and secure territory higher up the pitch by winning headers or second balls.",
      "At the Emirates Stadium, Lammens was able to drop his passes over the top of Arsenal's defensive line repeatedly, meaning Gabriel and William Saliba had to contend with aerial duels and off-the-ball runs in behind simultaneously, often while back-peddling.",
      "Despite his relative inexperience, Lammens has handled the step up to a role once described by Neville as the most difficult in football impressively. He has gone from facing Beerschot and Westerlo to Manchester City and Arsenal in the space of a year.",
      "He had, of course, demonstrated considerable potential in Belgium. But if there was one area of uncertainty coming to the Premier League, it was how he might handle the aerial side of things.",
      "\"The most important and most difficult thing, especially as a goalkeeper, is the set-pieces,\" he added to Neville in December. \"That's unique to England, the physicality. They try to block you, they make it as difficult as they can for you.\"",
      "Lammens was beaten from one such set-piece against Arsenal, unable to claim Saka's corner before it was prodded over the line by Mikel Merino. But he otherwise stood up to the challenge well, confidently commanding his box in difficult circumstances.",
      "In fact, he finished the game having made more catches and punches than any other goalkeeper against Arsenal all season. His combined total of six was the fourth-highest by a goalkeeper in any Premier League fixture so far this term.",
      "It all adds up to a level of security in goal that Manchester United have not had since the departure of David De Gea. Onana made three errors leading directly to goals last season in the Premier League, according to Opta. Lammens, by contrast, is yet to even make one leading to a shot.",
      "Quiet reliability does not generate many headlines. Lammens is a calm character off the pitch as well as on it. \"I understand I might come across as boring,\" he said in an interview in Belgium in October, \"but that's the goalkeeper I want to be.\"",
      "And it is exactly the goalkeeper Manchester United needed.",
      "Ezri Konsa's second-half introduction from the bench helped Aston Villa come from behind to beat Red Bull Salzburg in the Europa League on Thursday. The centre-back brought his usual composure on the ball, completing all but one of his 20 passes.",
      "His reliability in possession is one of many strengths and it applies even in challenging circumstances. In the Premier League this season, Konsa has completed 448 out of 492 passes when under high-intensity pressure, giving him a higher accuracy rate than any other player in the division at 91 per cent.",
      "The 28-year-old is having an outstanding season, pushing his claim to an England starting spot alongside Marc Guehi at this summer's World Cup, helped by a level of technical ability and press-resistance to match his quality defensively.",
      "The last column examined the striker situation at Arsenal as Gabriel Jesus, Viktor Gyokeres and the returning Kai Havertz vie for the No 9 shirt, and explained why the latter is still top dog.",
