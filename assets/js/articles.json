      "Teenage sensation Cristian Orozco has posted a heartfelt message before jetting off to the UK for a visit to Manchester United - describing the opportunity as a 'dream' come true. The Red Devils have struck a preliminary deal to snap up the Colombian starlet from Fortaleza CEIF, although the transfer cannot be officially completed until next year when he reaches 18.",
      "Orozco will remain with Fortaleza CEIF until the switch can be rubber-stamped in July. However, the promising midfielder will make the trip to Manchester to get acquainted with his future surroundings and will be given tours of both Carrington and Old Trafford.",
      "On Friday, Orozco posted on Instagram, sharing a snap at the airport with scout Giuseppe Antonaccio and the message: \"With the great Giuseppe, on the way to a dream.\"",
      "United have broadened their youth recruitment strategy in recent years following post-Brexit rules, which limit clubs' ability to bring in players from Europe.",
      "The deal to secure Orozco from Fortaleza is understood to be valued at approximately $1million (£750,000). Last summer, United brought in Diego Leon from Cerro Porteno in a transfer worth £3.3million, potentially rising to £7m with performance-related clauses.",
      "Leon made a strong impression on coaching staff at Carrington and trained solely with the senior squad during pre-season preparations.",
      "United's captures of Orozco and Leon follow co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe's declaration that he prefers investing in emerging talent rather than splashing out on established stars. \"I would rather sign the next Mbappe rather than spend a fortune buying success,\" the club's co-owner said.",
      "\"It's not that clever buying Mbappe. Anyone could figure that one out. More challenging is to find the next Mbappe or next Jude Bellingham or next Roy Keane.",
      "\"It's not where our focus is, the solution isn't spending a lot of money on a couple of great players. They have done that, if you look at the last ten years, they have spent a lot of money on a couple of great players.",
      "\"The first thing we need to do is get the right people in the right boxes who are managing and organising the club. And make sure we get recruitment right, it is such a vital part of football today.\"",
      "United brought in five players during the summer window, with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens and Diego Leon all arriving at Old Trafford. The summer spending spree set the club back £236m.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Patrick Dorgu faces a one-match Premier League ban if he receives one more booking. The news comes after the defender apparently 'liked' a social media post ridiculing Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Dane's Instagram account interacted with a post criticising Amorim's use of Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro in a midfield pivot. The post, shared by 'mufcunion', contained a comment from X that read: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\"",
      "The caption of the Instagram post said: \"Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together,\" and was 'liked' by the 21-year-old left-back's account. Dorgu has his own problems to handle as he will have to be careful against Crystal Palace on Sunday.",
      "If the left-back receives a yellow card against the Eagles, then he will miss out on United's home fixture against West Ham on Thursday, December 4.",
      "Amorim has yet to speak on Dorgu's online actions, but many would argue he also has bigger fish to fry in terms of United's current run of form. The club are currently sat in 10th place after dropping down the league table due to a few poor results.",
      "United had been on a big upswing earlier in the season, beating the likes of Liverpool, Brighton and Sunderland to maintain a winning streak. However, draws against Tottenham and Nottingham Forest saw this form stumble and eventually nosedive after their 1-0 loss to Everton.",
      "Despite Idrissa Gueye being sent off in the 13th minute for an altercation with his own team-mate, Michael Keane, United couldn't capitalise on the one-man advantage and went down to a 29th-minute strike from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall.",
      "Now, a new challenge awaits in fifth-placed Palace, and United need to be at their best against last year's FA Cup winners.",
      "With the Red Devils fully focused on domestic football, given that they didn't qualify for any European competition this season, Amorim needs all his players available so he can concentrate on pushing the club back up the table.",
      "Speaking ahead of the Palace match, Amorim said: \"They are a different club [to us] and they are doing things better than us so that is quite simple.",
      "\"We play in a different way and they are just doing things better than us. They are doing things really well and they play more in transition than us. We have to look at all of these things when we compare our teams but of course, in every position, we can do so much better.\"",
      "When asked if his team hold an advantage given their lack of European football, the Portuguese boss said: \"I said the same thing last year when we were in Europe and I say the same thing this year: there [is an] advantage and disadvantage of not being in Europe. There are no excuses. We have to always win games.\"",

      "Matheus Cunha has reached out to Manchester United supporters on social media to express his gratitude for their backing while he recovers from injury. The Brazilian striker is currently sidelined after picking up a knock during training last week.",
      "The setback meant he was unavailable for the Everton defeat and will also rule him out of Sunday's encounter with Crystal Palace. \"I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham on Thursday], not this one,\" Reds boss Ruben Amorim confirmed during Friday's press conference.",
      "That evening, Cunha posted on Instagram with an image of himself working out on an exercise bike, writing: \"Thank you all for the messages, I haven't gone crazy yet. Despite the joke, thank you for your concern. Much love.\"",
      "Cunha, who sealed a £62.5million switch from Wolves during the summer transfer window, has made a strong impression at Old Trafford and his absence has been keenly felt. News of his injury first emerged when the 26 year old was forced to miss a Christmas lights switch-on event in Altrincham.",
      "\"Unfortunately Matheus Cunha has had an accident in training today and will not be able to attend tonight's Christmas Lights Switch on in Altrincham due to medical reasons,\" @VisitAltrincham posted on social media a week ago.",
      "Alongside Cunha, Benjamin Sesko continues to be out of action with a knee problem. Amorim indicated at last week's press conference that he anticipates Sesko returning to fitness before the Wolves fixture on December 8, though he acknowledged the forward might require additional recovery time.",
      "Meanwhile, United's skipper Harry Maguire will continue to be sidelined due to a thigh problem. \"It will take a little bit longer, and we are taking care of him. Harry, the same,\" Amorim revealed.",
      "The Red Devils will be back on the pitch this Sunday at Palace (12pm), aiming to recover from their defeat against Everton. Before that setback, Amorim's squad had enjoyed a five-match unbeaten run in the Premier League.",
      "This impressive streak included victories over Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton, along with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham.",

      "Manchester United's highly-rated youngster, JJ Gabriel, has been spotted training with the first team ahead of their upcoming match. The 15-year-old prodigy is one of five academy stars who have been given the opportunity to train with Ruben Amorim's squad.",
      "The Portuguese head coach is gearing up his team for Sunday afternoon's Premier League face-off against Crystal Palace (12pm). In the run-up to the game, he's taken the opportunity to assess some of his promising talents.",
      "The youngsters have been included in first-team training due to the intense schedule for the U21s, which includes behind-closed-doors matches. Gabriel participated in Thursday's training session, with the youngster taking to social media to share snaps of his participation.",
      "Despite his impressive performances for the Under-18s and making the step up in training, Gabriel won't be able to make his first-team debut until January at the earliest.",
      "This is due to Premier League regulations saying that a player must have turned 15 by August 31 to play this season. Gabriel only celebrated his 15th birthday last month,",
      "However, these rules don't apply in the FA Cup. The teenager could therefore potentially make his debut the third round of the competition in early January.",
      "Amorim might still have the opportunity to give another young player their big break - with the other players seen in training old enough to play in the Premier League.",
      "Forward Shea Lacey, 17 year old left winger Noah Ajayi, midfielder Jim Thwaites and centre-back, Godwill Kukonki, have all also been seen in training ahead of the clash against Palace.",
      "Lacey, 18, was included in the squad for Monday night's defeat to Everton. He remained an unused substitute, but earned his place in the matchday squad after Matheus Cunha picked up an injury in the lead-up to the fixture.",
      "Discussing the teenager ahead of the match, Amorim said: \"I'm really happy with him.",
      "\"He struggled a little bit with injuries, but they did a very good job balancing his body - and you can sense he can manage more load during training.",
      "\"He has a lot of talent, but when they come here they can sense the speed is completely different, so they need to spend more time with us to be prepared because our training is hard. In the Premier League games, that pressure is harder, so they need to be ready.",
      "\"When you call a kid up to the first team, they need to behave really well.",
      "\"This connection is really important. We are putting everything in place - a nutritionist for the academy starts now - in our club. That is something that should be basic.",
      "\"All these things we are doing, so I have more time with them and I'm more confident with them. When we put these kids in to play in the Premier League, they will struggle, but will struggle less I think.\"",
      "United's academy prospects may receive increased opportunities to make their mark in the coming months. The United squad will be more stretched with Amad, Bryan Mbeumo and Noussair Mazraoui all departing to feature for their countries at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).",

      "Ryan Giggs was proved right that Marcus Rashford is once again enjoying his football after leaving Manchester United. The 28-year-old last played for his boyhood club in December 2024 before he was banished from the first-team by Ruben Amorim just a month after the Portuguese manager's arrival.",
      "A loan move to Aston Villa was green-lit in the January transfer window. While his form did improve at Villa Park, which resulted in him being called up to Thomas Tuchel's first England squad, Unai Emery opted against making his temporary stay a permanent one.",
      "Although he returned to Old Trafford in the summer, it didn't last long as he secured a season-long loan to Barcelona. The forward has looked like the Rashford of old in Spain with 15 goals and assists in 17 games across all competitions so far.",
      "A move away from Manchester was one Rashford revealed he needed last year and Giggs admitted the choice to depart the Red Devils was the correct choice for him. The United legend, who turns 52 today, served as Louis van Gaal's assistant when Rashford made his United debut at the age of 18, back in 2016.",
      "The Welshman had a front-row seat as Rashford netted a brace on his full debut in a 5-1 home victory over FC Midtjylland in the Europa League. It was during Giggs' appearance on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast earlier this year that he said a return to United is not on the cards for Rashford when asked if the possibility remained.",
      "\"No. I don't think he looked happy at United,\" Giggs told his former team-mate. \"I think he looks happier now. I just don't. Which is a shame because obviously I'd seen him as a part of the staff when we'd given him his debut.\"",
      "Questioned on what he'd tell Rashford if he was working under Amorim, the former United captain called out the forward's work ethic and said the club's fanbase will not accept a player giving less than his all.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "\"First of all, he's got to work harder,\" Giggs said. \"I talked about no matter what position on the pitch you are, you sprint back as quick as you sprint forward, and aesthetically, it didn't look great. Especially if the team ain't doing well.",
      "\"Because fans will forgive you for missing a chance. They won't forgive you for not working hard enough. They just won't. Because they can do that. They can sprint. Everyone can. But then also, what I talked about, you know that he can play up there.",
      "\"He's done it everywhere. He's done it on the biggest stage. It's hard from looking outside to in. But it looked like he's not enjoying it. And you've got to enjoy it. Especially flare players, attacking players.",
      "\"Because that's your best moments. When your confidence is high, you're trying things. Don't always come off. But play instinctively and play like you did when you were younger. Freedom.\"",
      "Rashford may be playing his best football in recent years but it remains to be seen whether his relationship with Amorim could be patched up ahead of his potential return back in Manchester next summer.",

      "The 52-year-old spent over 20 years with the club, making 963 appearances, scoring 168 goals and assisting 271 times. The Red Devils icon won all there is to win in club football, including two Champions Leagues and a whopping 13 Premier League titles.",
      "However, Giggs was once a rising star at the club and faced off with Fergie on a few tense occasions. Speaking to beIN SPORTS's The Champions Club in 2020, he said: \"There was definitely fear, especially early on.",
      "\"He mellowed a little bit as he got older, but not a lot. Definitely early on, especially as a young player, he had this cough that you could hear. And if you heard that at our first training ground at The Cliff, you would very often turn the other way.",
      "\"You just didn't want to cross him at 18, 19, 20 because you never knew what sort of mood he was in. So there was definitely that fear but ultimately there was always that respect, whether he had a go at you or you just fell out with him.\"",
      "Reflecting on times he got on the wrong side of Ferguson, Giggs said: \"I fell out with him plenty of times. I mean the amount of times I would say over my career, six or seven times where it was a couple of weeks wages I was fined for talking back, for having an argument.",
      "\"At the time it's not very nice, you're in the dressing room, you've just got beat or you've had a bad performance. And I just couldn't help myself have a go back.\"",
      "However, Giggs noted that while Ferguson commanded respect in every sense of the word, he appreciated it when a young player would give a bit back in the dressing room. He added: \"He actually, later in his career, he told me he liked that, it meant that you cared.",
      "\"He'd still fine you two weeks because he wanted to show that he was in charge but he actually quite liked it, as long as it didn't cross the line or course.",
      "\"The good thing is, the next day it was finished. He would fine you two weeks wages, a week's wages. The next day he'd get you in and it was over with, let's move on.\"",

      "Former Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs is leading a vastly different life from his glory days at Old Trafford. The Red Devils legend turns 52 on Saturday and finds himself out of the game.",
      "The ex-United winger, who clinched an unprecedented 13 Premier League titles, left his position as Salford City's director of football in September, seemingly with ambitions of getting back into management. Giggs has not overseen a side since standing down as Wales manager in 2022 after being arrested on suspicion of assault.",
      "Giggs consistently denied allegations of assault and controlling or coercive behaviour towards his former partner Kate Greville and assaulting her sibling Emma. He was cleared after the Crown Prosecution Service dropped all charges before a planned retrial in 2023.",
      "While Giggs found a path back into the sport with Salford City, he received support from his girlfriend Zara Charles during his legal issues. The pair had a child together last year, with Giggs becoming a father again at the age of 50.",
      "Giggs has been romantically involved with lingerie model Zara Charles - who is 15 years younger than the football star - since 2021. The 37-year-old gave birth to their daughter Cora last November.",
      "A spokesperson for the former United icon said at the time: \"Ryan and his partner Zara are delighted to announce the birth of their daughter, Cora Giggs, who was born on Friday, November 1",
      "\"They extend their warmest gratitude to all the amazing staff, especially the midwives, at Wythenshawe Hospital.\"",
      "The surprise arrival marked Giggs' third child. He was already a father to Libby and Zach from his marriage to Stacey Cooke.",
      "The footballer found himself at the centre of a public controversy during his playing career when it emerged that he had been involved in an eight-year relationship with Natasha, the wife of his brother Rhodri. The revelation resulted in Rhodri and Natasha's marriage ending.",
      "Yet more than a decade later, it seems Rhodri still appreciates his brother's accomplishments on the pitch. The United legend secured 13 Premier League titles throughout his illustrious career and remains the competition's all-time leader in assists.",
      "Despite this, he remains absent from the Premier League Hall of Fame. Rhodri expressed frustration with his brother's omission from this year's shortlist. Giggs' former teammate Gary Neville has since become the most recent United legend to enter the prestigious 26-member group.",
      "Taking to social media, Rhodri wrote: \"13 Premier League medals, countless goals, and the record number of Premier League assists. #TheShamHallOfFame.\"",
      "When questioned about his current relationship with his brother following the affair controversy, Rhodri told one social media user: \"Mate, it was over 14 years ago and I've got two kids with someone else and made s*** load of money from it.\"",
      "He added: \"I buzz off it. It was 14 years ago and I made about £1million from it. Can't be on X and not expect a little bit of shrapnel coming your way. All part of the fun.\"",
      "Giggs has previously made clear his ambitions to get back into football management. The 52-year-old cut his coaching teeth at United, serving as caretaker boss and assistant manager, before taking charge of Wales in 2018.",
      "While his recent spell as director of football at Salford maintained his connection to the game, Giggs acknowledged his desire to return to the touchline. When asked last year about a managerial comeback, Giggs said: \"I loved managing Wales, obviously. I do miss it, so hopefully.\"",
      "Giggs was spotted working with Salford boss Karl Robinson throughout his time at the club. The United icon had been a co-owner at Salford until a recent takeover in May.",

The affair resulted in Rhodri and Natasha's marriage ending and fundamentally altered the family's relationships. Despite this, Rhodri has shown that he still respects his brother's accomplishments in a United jersey.",
      "In September, the Premier League announced a shortlist of 15 candidates, with two subsequently gaining Hall of Fame status. The list featured seven of Giggs' former Old Trafford colleagues, with Gary Neville later receiving the honour alongside former Chelsea star Eden Hazard, but Rhodri criticised the Premier League for repeatedly snubbing his brother.",
      "Sharing a compilation of Giggs' United career highlights, Rhodri posted on social media: \"13 Premier League medals and countless goals and the record number of Premier League assists. #TheShamHallOfFame.\"",
      "Despite Ryan's illustrious football career, the Manchester United icon's reputation has been impacted by various off-field scandals. He left his role as Wales manager in 2022 after being arrested on suspicion of assault.",
      "He always denied the accusations and was cleared of all charges after his former partner Kate Greville withdrew from the trial in 2023. He had been serving as Salford City's director of football but departed in September, reportedly with ambitions to get back into management.",
      "Giggs was interim manager and assistant coach at United before taking charge of Wales in 2018. While Ryan looks to make his return to the touchline, Rhodri has stated he holds no grudge towards his elder brother and even profited financially from their dispute.",
      "Responding to a social media user mentioning their history, Rhodri previously commented: \"Mate, it was over 14 years ago and I've got two kids with someone else and made s*** load of money from it.\"",
      "He continued: \"I buzz off it. It was 14 years ago and I made about £1million from it. Can't be on X and not expect a little bit of shrapnel coming your way. All part of the fun.\"",
      "While some might have found it surprising to see Rhodri publicly backing his brother, his objection to the Premier League Hall of Fame does have merit. Giggs' ex-team-mates David Beckham, Eric Cantona, Roy Keane, Wayne Rooney, Peter Schmeichel, Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand and Andy Cole had all been recognised previously, along with Sir Alex Ferguson.",
      "This year, Neville was added to the 26-man Hall of Fame. Other recent nominees with ties to United include Patrice Evra, Teddy Sheringham, Michael Carrick, Nemanja Vidic, Edwin van der Sar and Michael Owen.",
      "Giggs, a one-club man, made an impressive 963 appearances, netting 168 goals. His illustrious 24-year career saw him lift numerous major trophies, including 13 league titles, four FA Cups and two Champions Leagues.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Manchester United's five-game unbeaten run came to an end on Monday night at Old Trafford. Looking to continue their fine form, Ruben Amorim's side were stopped in their tracks by a solid Everton side who came away with a 1-0 victory, despite being down to 10-men for most of the contest.",
      "As is the case with the strength of the English top-flight, the schedule rarely gets any easier. United next travel to fifth-placed Crystal Palace on Sunday in a bid to return to winning ways.",
      "While United transformed their attack in the summer with the signings of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, a midfield signing was not acquired. It wasn't for the lack of trying given the club were interested in Brighton's Carlos Baleba but his reported valuation of £104million meant a deal didn't materialise.",
      "United's engine room is certainly in need of a revamp with Casemiro turning 34 in February and Manuel Ugarte's inability to adapt to the Premier League causing Amorim issues.",
      "According to a Spanish report, via TEAMtalk, the Portuguese boss is \"planning to submit\" a £105m bid for Real Madrid midfielder Federico Valverde. The 27-year-old has made 341 appearances for the Spanish giants in his eight-year spell at the club which has resulted in him winning 14 major honours.",
      "However, reports have been strife surrounding his unhappiness at Madrid under Xabi Alonso who has played the Uruguayan at right-back since October due to injuries to Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold.",
      "It hasn't been the best lead-up to the tough fixture against Palace in terms of injuries, with Amorim revealing that Harry Maguire, Cunha and Sesko will miss the match. Sesko, who cost United £74m this past summer, has started just six league games this season and has only two goals to his name.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",
      "The Slovenian was forced off in their 2-2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur with a knee injury and pulled out of international duty earlier this month. In Friday's pre-match press conference, Amorim said he'll remain without the services of his striker. The United boss said: \"Sesko is going to take a little bit more time, [Harry] Maguire again the same.\"",
      "Amorim's 3-4-3 system has received much criticism during his time in England, with the manager sticking to his guns. The placement of Luke Shaw as a left centre-back in the defeat to Everton, with Shaw traditionally a left-back, was subject to the ire of Gary Neville who questioned the decision.",
      "The trip to Selhurst Park on Sunday will see a battle of 3-4-3 systems, given Oliver Glasner plays the same formation. Unlike many, the Austrian defended his fellow manager's insistence on the system, admitting it's helped United in attack.",
      "The Palace boss said: \"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals. Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo. For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",

      "Ryan Giggs was once thrown under the bus by former Manchester United team-mate Nani in the middle of one of Sir Alex Ferguson’s infamous dressing-downs. Ex-Red Devils winger Nani found himself in hot water with the fearsome Scottish manager in 2010 following a 2-2 draw away at Fulham.",
      "United were 2-1 up at Craven Cottage during the August fixture when they were awarded a penalty in the 86th minute for a handball by Damien Duff. Instead of usual penalty specialist Giggs taking the spot-kick, Nani took it and had his effort saved by David Stockdale.",
      "To make matters worse, Fulham went on to equalise in the 89th minute thanks to Brede Hangeland’s header, leaving United to return to Manchester with two points dropped.",
      "That made for an extremely awkward journey home for Nani as he had to drive Sir Alex home afterwards, but not before deflecting the hair-dryer treatment onto Giggs, who turns 52 this Saturday.",
      "Nani told the UTD Podcast: \"[Ferguson] was my neighbour and we used to go to London by train. His wife or his family used to leave him in the train station so on the way back he had no driver to take him so he was looking for someone who lives close to him to give him a ride.",
      "“So I said, 'OK boss, I'll take you home!' But that day, it's so funny, believe me! The day I took him home was after a game against Fulham away, and I was on the bench.",
      "\"I was playing unbelievable with a lot of confidence. We won a penalty and it was Ryan Giggs who usually took the penalties. I felt confident and Giggs didn't say anything. I took the penalty and I missed! The penalty should have made it 3-2.",
      "“We are going back home that day and I say, 'Boss, I can take you home'. I drove him back home and he didn't talk to me in the car! In the dressing room he killed me! He said, 'Nani, who do you think you are?'\"",
      "The Portuguese tried to get himself out of trouble by pointing the finger at veteran Giggs. That then brought the Welshman into the firing line as Ferguson scolded both of them.",
      "Nani added: \"'Who gave you permission to take the penalty?! Ryan!' And then he killed Ryan Giggs, because he said, 'Ryan, why did you let him take the penalty!'",
      "\"Ryan said, 'He grabbed the ball and I let him.' Oh my god, that day was incredible. I took him home and I feel very uncomfortable driving home.\"",
      "Despite that incident and other examples of dishing out tough love, Ferguson thought of both players very highly, with the legendary manager still singing their praises in recent years and even reuniting with Nani.",

      "Marcus Rashford could finally fulfil his dream of playing at the Camp Nou this weekend. The on-loan Manchester United striker has previously spoken of his desire to play in front of Barcelona's fans at their iconic stadium after his career with the Spanish giants began at the Olympic Stadium.",
      "The Catalan side hadn't featured at the Camp Nou since 2023, instead staging matches at the Lluís Companys Olympic Stadium, whilst their home undergoes a massive £1.3 billion redevelopment scheme. However, the England international missed out on Barca's return last weekend due to illness.",
      "Barca enjoyed a successful homecoming at the Camp Nou as they defeated Athletic Bilbao 3-0, with Rashford forced to observe from the sidelines. Since Rashford completed the loan transfer to Barcelona he admitted that a significant factor in making the switch was the opportunity to feature at the iconic venue.",
      "He may now finally receive his opportunity with Barcelona welcoming Alaves in La Liga on Saturday afternoon. Upon joining Barca, Rashford said: \"It's a very nice feeling. It's a beautiful stadium and when it is full it's going to be unbelievable. Camp Nou was always one of my favourite stadiums and one I wanted to play in.\"",
      "He added: \"But to play on it for Barcelona is going to be a different feeling. I cannot wait to be on the pitch. I will enjoy it.\"",
      "The ground's renovation is scheduled for completion in 2027, when its capacity will expand to 105,000, making it the fifth largest stadium in the world. The Catalan giants have also lodged an application with UEFA requesting permission to move their remaining Champions League home matches back to the Camp Nou this season.",
      "Rashford has netted six times and registered nine assists in 17 appearances across all competitions so far this term, with Barcelona trailing Real Madrid by just three points in La Liga.",
      "The 28-year-old has adapted well to his fresh start after his Old Trafford exit turned sour following a deterioration in his relationship with United manager Ruben Amorim.",
      "The Spanish media have given Rashford a glowing reception, lauding both his performances on the pitch and how quickly he's adjusted to his new life in Catalonia. Rashford, for his part, seems to be relishing his time in Spain.",
      "When asked by ESPN whether he wanted to remain at Barcelona and secure a permanent transfer, he replied: \"Oh yeah, for sure.\"",

      "Former Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo believes ex-Red Devils midfielder Scott McTominay possesses precisely the qualities that manager Ruben Amorim desperately requires at Old Trafford. The 28-year-old netted a stunning opener during Scotland's 4-2 victory against Denmark this month and played a pivotal role in guiding the Tartan Army to their first World Cup since 1998.",
      "His remarkable bicycle kick capped off an exceptional 12 months for the midfielder. Following his departure from United to join Napoli in 2024, he secured the Serie A title and even received recognition with a Ballon d'Or nomination.",
      "Whilst United parted ways with the player, his outstanding displays may now have the club questioning their choice to offload him, particularly as Amorim is understood to be making a new midfielder his top priority.",
      "An attempted move for Brighton's Carlos Baleba collapsed during the summer window, whilst speculation continues linking the club with Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton, both targets who would command substantial transfer fees.",
      "Yet Ighalo, 36, is convinced the player United released possesses exactly what Amorim urgently requires at present. The Red Devils currently sit 10th in the Premier League standings following an erratic campaign.",
      "\"Scott McTominay is an interesting one because I think everything with him was just around timing,\" Ighalo told Ladbrokes at the launch of Ladisfaction.",
      "\"You know, he's doing so well since he left the club, but he had to leave because there were just too many players in his position around the place at the time.\"",
      "Highlighting four crucial qualities McTominay brings to the table, he added: \"It's funny because his style is probably something which Man United need now; he runs, he tackles, he works hard and he scores goals. He's a very humble guy who fits Man United's way of playing.",
      "\"His goal for Scotland last week was incredible... It's the kind of thing Cristiano Ronaldo does! What a goal; it was unbelievable. I can't say I ever saw him do anything like that in training at United, but he used to love to shoot and was always trying new things, so it didn't surprise me he scored it in that respect.",
      "\"He's the kind of player who will shoot from anywhere; he's so quick with his thinking and will happily take shots on first time, rather than controlling the ball and slowing things down.\"",
      "Much like McTominay, Ighalo unexpectedly became a beloved figure amongst United supporters. Arriving on loan from Shanghai Shenhua in January 2020, the Nigerian striker captured hearts at Old Trafford, largely due to his infectious personality.",
      "In his debut MUTV interview, Ighalo even disclosed that he accepted reduced wages to join United, such was his devotion to the club. The forward netted five times in 23 outings, earning himself a special place in supporters' affections with his name echoing around the Old Trafford stands.",
      "\"It's so hard to see this dream come to an end,\" Ighalo wrote when his loan spell concluded in January 2021. \"But I give God the glory for helping me fulfil this lifelong dream of putting on a Manchester United shirt as a player and represent this great club, it was indeed an honour I will forever cherish and be grateful for.\"",

      "Reports had claimed Sesko, 22, could be set for a lengthy spell on the side-lines after having a setback in his bid to return to full fitness. Ruben Amorim, meanwhile, said during his pre-Crystal Palace match press conference Sesko is going to take a \"little bit more time\" before making his return.",

About Europe, I've already talked about Europe and I said the same thing last year when we were still in Europe, and I say the same thing this year, the advantage and disadvantage of being in Europe so there is no excuses.

      "Cunha picked up a knock in training over the weekend, compounding the absence of Sesko, who picked up a knee injury in the 2-2 draw against Tottenham before the international break. Amorim was therefore forced to hand Joshua Zirkzee his first Premier League start of the season against Everton.",
      "It did not go to plan, with United failing to score past Jordan Pickford, despite playing the vast majority of the match against 10 men after Idrissa Gueye was dismissed for slapping his team-mate Michael Keane. Supporters had been hopeful that Cunha would return for the Palace game, after Amorim described his knock as \"nothing serious\", but that is not the case.",
      "\"Sesko is going to take a little bit more time,\" Amorim told reporters in his pre-match press conference on Friday. \"It will take a little bit longer and we are taking care of him. Harry [Maguire], the same. I expect to have Matheus in the next one [West Ham on Thursday], not this one.\"",
      "Centre-back Maguire also sat out of the Everton game with a hamstring injury after Cunha was injured in training - news that leaked because he had to pull out of turning on the Christmas lights in Altrincham.",
      "Speaking about Cunha's issue before the Everton game, Amorim said: \"It was a knock in training so I don't know how long he's going to stay out, I think it's nothing serious, but we cannot risk players. We have to show everybody, when you are not 100 per cent, we have a different player to cope with the demands of the game.\"",
      "United had gone five games unbeaten in the Premier League before Kieran Dewsbury-Hall secured three points for 10-man Everton on Monday. It was a terrible result for Amorim, whose side had 25 shots and 69 per cent possession without scoring at Old Trafford.",
      "\"It was really tough, the week was hard with this result, this defeat, but the process needs to continue and we need to go to the next game,\" Amorim said.",

      "Former Manchester United and Leeds star Alan Smith has revealed why he still has no feeling in three toes on his left foot. The ex-Premier League striker enjoyed a prolonged career with a total of 604 competitive appearances and 70 goals.",
      "Alongside spells at Old Trafford, Elland Road and Newcastle United, Smith is rather unfortunately well known for suffering one of the worst injuries Sir Alex Ferguson has ever seen. In an FA Cup clash against Liverpool, Smith broke his leg when rushing to block a powerful John Arne Riise free-kick.",
      "However, he has since revealed that he picked up an injury when playing for Newcastle that has resulted in worse consequences with him losing the feeling in three toes. The former England international, speaking via BritishGambler.co.uk said: \"It actually wasn't that one with Riise that made the ankle as bad as it was, because when I played in the derby for Newcastle against Sunderland, that’s when I did it again.",
      "\"I just got a tackle, Kieran Richardson came in, it was a bad tackle, but it wasn't malicious. He just came in and caught me on my standing foot, on my standing leg, but it was my left.",
      "\"He literally just went high on my ankle, and my ankle inverted, so the opposite of what it should and it just went inwards. That was worse because I already had all my metal work in there.",
      "\"I went to James Calder at the Fortius Clinic in London about it, because he'd done a lot of my surgeries after, and he basically couldn't tell what was new damage and what was old damage, and that's when I lost all the nerve damage in my foot, because I can’t feel the last three toes on my left side, I can't feel them.\"",
      "The 45-year-old discussed his leg break at Anfield from two decades ago and made it clear the injury was completely accidental. Smith said: \"Yeah, you're probably right I would charge and block the Riise free-kick again.",
      "\"When you look back at it, you know lads who have played and all ‘f****** put their bodies through all sorted, and they've all got ailments and can't walk and can’t do that, but that's what we were, that's what you do!",
      "\"Everyone says this and that about Riise, and I'm like, ‘f****** hell, he didn't do anything wrong!’ It wasn't a bad tackle. It was just unfortunate. You block it, you land, it goes underneath you, whatever it is.",
      "Despite such a big injury, Smith still plays casually and is also coaching in the United States. He has also kept active by taking up other sports.",
      "\"Yeah the body’s fine, because I don't really try and do anything to make it bad,\" he revealed when asked about his current state. \"Cycling, swimming... I think the key is to just try and keep doing something.",
      "\"It's trying to find that balance of doing something that doesn't make my ankle really bad so I'm struggling to walk, but doing enough to get movement in it. So it's doing okay.",
      "\"It’s just not stressing it too much because it's the inflammation then obviously the next day. I've been doing red light therapy on my ankle quite a bit and that's been helping it because it takes the inflammation down a lot. Just in the mornings when I'm getting going that I struggle with the ankle.\"",

      "Former Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has recalled an occasion when Carlo Ancelotti, then in charge of Everton, wandered into his technical area and told him he wouldn't want his job because it was \"too much pressure\".",
      "The Norwegian had just shy of three years in the role before he was given his marching orders. Solskjaer was the first ex-United player to be given the gig on a full-time basis following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement and enjoyed mixed results.",
      "Despite the team's fall in the post-Ferguson era there is still huge expectation on the Manchester outfit to perform. Ancelotti has led some of Europe's biggest names, the most noteworthy being Real Madrid. He's also been in charge at Bayern Munich, AC Milan, PSG and Chelsea.",
      "But Solskjaer claims he said on the spot that he wouldn't want the United job midway through a clash between Everton and the Red Devils.",
      "The 52-year-old told the BBC: \"I remember one game - Everton. Stood there in my technical area. Carlo Ancelotti comes across, so he's more or less in my technical area. Fourth official says, 'Carlo, you need to go back into your technical area, unless you want Ole's job.'",
      "\"And he said 'no, no, no, too much pressure. That job is too much pressure'. You know pressure is a privilege, he's always said that as well, and I felt privileged to be the manager of Man Utd, but of course, you're the face of everyone, everything surrounding Man Utd.",
      "\"But that pressure is a privilege because I was allowed to do that and I was allowed to deal with it in my way and that was having great staff around us, environment in and around the club was very positive, but in the end you need results. Unfortunately had a very bad six-week spell and that's too long at a club like Man Utd.\"",
      "Solskjaer had made strides forward during his United stint, but fell short of delivering a trophy, losing in numerous semi-finals and the Europa League final. It was a dire run that included a humiliating 5-0 loss to Liverpool at home which eventually led to his sacking. And the Norwegian claims that, given what he was up against, he couldn't have chosen a worse time to lead the club he played for.",
      "\"It's not about getting the credit,\" he said. \"It was the worst time to be manager of Man Utd. You have Jurgen Klopp with his Liverpool team and you have Pep Guardiola with his Man City team. The best managers in the world at the time, probably the best two teams in the world at the time. But we got second and third. So with the staff we had something going, but we couldn't take the next step.\"",

      "Marcus Rashford could be offered a new exit path out of Manchester United at the end of the season amid uncertainty over whether Barcelona will sign him permanently. The Spanish giants have a buy option of €30 million (£26m) next summer, but it's not yet clear whether that will be triggered.",
      "The England star has scored six goals for Barcelona and provided another nine assists across all competitions. An injury to Raphinha has meant Rashford has been ever-present in Hansi Flick's starting XI, and it's understood he has left a good impression among teammates and staff.",
      "After a short loan spell at Aston Villa last season, Rashford secured his dream move to Camp Nou in the summer. As part of the switch, a future permanent fee of £26m was agreed, which would see the 28-year-old leave Manchester United for good.",
      "However, there is still no clear indication yet whether they will trigger that option. It's believed that a decision will be made later in the season, depending on how Rashford's form plays out between now and May.",
      "Now, another twist has emerged, with Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo providing insight into Flick's summer transfer plans and their impact on Rashford. The report states that Barcelona sporting director Deco and Flick have agreed that a left-footed centre-back, a winger and a centre-forward will all be prioritised.",
      "With Julian Alvarez being monitored alongside Harry Kane, Barcelona are planning for life without Robert Lewandowski, who will turn 38 by next summer. However, it's Barca's ambition to reinforce a versatile winger that could derail Rashford's permanent move.",
      "Flick has hardly utilised Rashford as a centre-forward this season but Raphinha's return from injury could spark a change in his place in the Barcelona team. Erling Haaland has also been mentioned as a possible target.",
      "The United loanee is namechecked in the report, but AC Milan's Rafael Leao has been mentioned as a possible alternative. There is also the possibility that Raphinha could leave amid interest from Saudi Arabia.",
      "As a result, Rashford's future could be elsewhere, and Paris Saint-Germain are reportedly considering tempting him with a move to France. Mundo Deportivo have claimed that European champions are paying close attention to the England international and have set aside €50m (£43.8m) if they decide to move for him.",
      "Luis Enrique's side currently have one of most clinical forward lines in Europe with Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Desire Doue and Bradley Barcola impressing behind Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele. Rashford's ability play on the left and as a striker could see him be a valuable target for the Parisians.",
      "Rashford still has two more years left on his contract at Old Trafford and under Ruben Amorim, it's unlikely that he will be offered another chance to return to the United squad. However, having shown flashes of his best in Spain, the chance of finding a permanent buyer shouldn't be as tough as before.",

      "Juan Sebastian Veron has been banned for six months from all football activities following a major scandal in Argentinian football. Veron is club president of Estudiantes, who refused to give a guard of honour to Rosario Central after they were controversially declared champions.",
      "The Argentina Football Association decided to change the rules mid-season which benefited Rosario, who won their first title since 1987. The change sparked a huge backlash in Argentina, with rival clubs furious that the goal posts had been moved.",
      "Former Manchester United and Chelsea midfielder Veron allegedly decided to order the Estudiantes players to protest against the decision. Estudiantes refused to give a guard of honour before their recent match, with the players turning their backs as the opponents walked onto the pitch.",
      "It came before their Clausura last-16 knockout match on Sunday, which Estudiantes won 1-0. The action caused a stir in Argentinian football and has now landed Veron and his players in hot water.",
      "The AFA’s disciplinary tribunal found that the 50-year-old was responsible for creating “an attitude of open disapproval” which constituted “a form of symbolic violence and an affront to the values of respect and sportsmanship”.",
      "He has been given \"a six-month suspension from all football-related activities\", while the players who \"engaged in the reprehensible conduct\" have each been suspended for two games, while captain Santiago Nunez has also been banned from wearing the armband for three months.",
      "Estudiantes’ players will serve their suspensions in the next tournament and at different times so it \"does not affect the integrity of the current competition\". It means they can feature in the Clausura quarter-final against Central Cordoba on Saturday.",
      "The controversy stems from the AFA’s call to change things around. Previously, the team with the highest points total only earned a place in the Copa Libertadores. But this time Rosario were declared champions after accruing a combined 66 points in the Apertura (opening) and Clausura (closing), the two tournaments that comprise the Primera Division. That was four more than the next best side, Boca Juniors.",
      "Bizarrely, it means that, despite being crowned champions, Rosario’s season has now come to an end following their 1-0 loss to Estudiantes. The season is continuing, though, with Estudiantes still in the Clausura knock-out stages.",
      "Whichever side wins the Clausura will face Apertura champions Platense in the end-of-year Champions Trophy, which previously crowned the champions of Argentina.",
      "Estudiantes said in a statement they are “analysing the sanction received in detail, in order to take the appropriate measures to defend the interests of the institution and its members. In this context, the board of directors expresses its full support for its president Juan Sebastian Veron, Santiago Nunez and the entire professional squad.”",

      "Marcus Rashford's hopes of securing a permanent switch to Barcelona could be dashed by the club's ongoing money troubles. The Manchester United forward is currently flourishing at the Catalan giants on a season-long loan deal, having been frozen out by Ruben Amorim at Old Trafford.",
      "So far this campaign, the 28-year-old has notched six goals and provided nine assists across 17 outings. With Barcelona possessing an option to make his switch permanent next summer for a fee around £30million, it appears straightforward if his present form continues.",
      "Yet La Liga commentator Terry Gibson has warned how the club's financial difficulties could scupper any deal. Other top players in his position, such as Raphinha and Lamine Yamal, also look set to play a role in his future.",
      "Gibson said: \"I think he's benefited from the fact that Rafinha's been injured and Yamal's been injured, [Robert] Lewandowski's been injured, Ferran Torres has been injured.",
      "\"So out of those four or five players, he's the only one that's been fit for every game this season - and he's benefited from that. He's played, he's been able to get up to speed, get some confidence, and he looks like a Barcelona player now.\"",
      "\"So I don't see any reason why they wouldn't sign him. You can't just rely on three. I think it's a push for him to be the first choice with those three. I think it's a given.",
      "\"Lewandowski up front, Yamal and Raphinha. I think after what they did last season, it's obvious that they will be the front three. But it doesn't always work out that all three are available.",
      "\"It doesn't work out because they're playing 60 games a season. And I think it's pretty certain, I think, that Barcelona will pay the fee to make that permanent.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the ex-United and Spurs midfielder admitted securing the necessary funds to permanently sign Rashford might prove challenging for Barcelona. He said: \"Well, it's not as easy to find £30m for Barcelona as it is normally.",
      "\"But back in the new stadium now, charging a fortune for tickets at the moment, 45,000 at the weekend, it's going to keep creeping up. And then Barcelona, before long, will be back on a familiar financial footing. And they'll be setting their sights very high to bring back in superstars at Barcelona.\"",
      "Reports emerged last month revealing Barca had accumulated a worrying transfer debt of approximately £138million following the publication of their 2024/25 financial accounts, sparking concerns about the club's long-term viability",
      "The figures also suggested the Catalan giants must settle £121million of that amount before the campaign concludes to remain financially stable. Such financial uncertainty could serve as a significant warning sign for Rashford in the long term, particularly as his prospects at United appear increasingly bleak.",
      "He might also raise concerns about supporter discontent at the club, particularly regarding ticket prices at Camp Nou, which is currently undergoing extensive renovation but has recently reopened with a reduced capacity of approximately 45,000.",
      "To put this into perspective, the most affordable ticket listed on the club's website for their fixture against Alaves on Saturday, November 29 costs £95.51 (€109), whilst the cheapest option for their encounter with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, December 2 stands at £148 (€169).",
      "Nevertheless, Rashford appears to have been impressed during his recent time in Spain. Speaking in September, he said: \"Playing for Barca is an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona.",
      "\"We want to win as much as possible. One hundred per cent I'm full of excitement. I'm very motivated and determined. The quality we have in the team excites me. It's so refreshing to play with these players.\"",

      "Heading into Friday's press conference there was hope among Manchester United fans of Matheus Cunha being available for the trip to Crystal Palace. The Brazilian may have only scored once for the Reds so far this season, but he offers a focal point at the top of the attack when playing a strikerless system.",
      "He was missing against Everton, as was Benjamin Sesko, so Ruben Amorim decided to take a chance on Joshua Zirkzee. Sesko has been the first choice for United this season if he wanted a recognised striker up top. If not, Cunha was pushed up and Zirkzee was seen as an afterthought.",
      "That is why his inclusion raised eyebrows and the chance was there for the Dutchman to prove Amorim was right to back him. Instead, we saw why the United boss has been picking Sesko ahead of him all season. It has been said plenty of times before but it is worth repeating - Zirkzee is not a No.9.",
      "His effort for the team cannot be questioned and he did test Jordan Pickford on a couple of occasions with headers. But for the most part, Zirkzee did not offer an outlet for United as James Tarkowski and Michael Keane dealt with him easily.",
      "Amorim could decide to repeat his tactic from Monday night but having seen it not work, the United boss could opt to give another overlooked player in Kobbie Mainoo a chance instead. Mainoo has yet to start a Premier League match for United this season given Amorim's desire to play Bruno Fernandes deeper. What could work to satisfy both midfielders is to play Mainoo alongside Casemiro and allow Fernandes to push up into a No.10 role.",
      "It has been a while since United's captain has played as an attacking midfielder but this is clearly the position where you can get the best out of him. When watching Fernandes, you can see he excels when building attacks and he will receive more opportunities doing that further forward.",
      "You could even play the captain as the false nine but the strongest formation in Amorim's set-up would be to play him as a No.10 and allow Bryan Mbeumo to lead the line. The Cameroonian has done it for Brentford previously so it shouldn't be too big a change for the club's top goalscorer.",
      "With Cunha expected to be fit to play in midweek when West Ham travel to Old Trafford, the opportunity for Mainoo to gain more minutes will slip away until next month when the AFCON players leave.",

United have a preliminary agreement to sign the Colombian from Fortaleza CEIF, though the move can only be completed next year when he turns 18.",
      "Orozco will continue to play for Fortaleza CEIF until the transfer can be finalised in July. In the meantime, the young midfielder will travel to Manchester to familiarise himself with the area ahead of the move and will also be shown around Carrington and Old Trafford.",
      "On Friday, Orozco took to Instagram, sharing a picture at the airport with the scout Giuseppe Antonaccio alongside the caption: \"With the great Giuseppe , on the way to a dream.\" United have expanded their academy recruitment in recent years following Brexit regulations, which restrict clubs from signing players from Europe.",
      "The agreement to bring Orozco from Fortaleza is believed to be worth around $1million (£750,000). Last summer, United welcomed Diego Leon from Cerro Porteno in a deal worth £3.3million, rising to £7m with add-ons.",
      "Leon impressed coaches at Carrington and trained exclusively with the first team during pre-season.",
      "United's signings of Orozco and Leon come after co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe made it clear that he wants to sign the next superstar rather than an established talent for big money. “I would rather sign the next Mbappe rather than spend a fortune buying success,\" he said.",
      "\"It’s not that clever buying Mbappe. Anyone could figure that one out. More challenging is to find the next Mbappe or next Jude Bellingham or next Roy Keane.",

      "\"When you look at other teams like Tottenham and [Arsenal] at the Emirates Stadium, United are still the biggest club in English football. In my opinion, they need to go and raise the bar so wherever the new stadium was going to be won't distract players, they still have that profile.",
      "\"If you look at the last turnover they published, it was in the £600m-mark without winning a trophy. To still generate that kind of interest tells you [how big a club it is]. United will always be attracting players whether they are winning or losing - it doesn't matter where they are going to play.",

      "Amorim addressed the team's persistent poor away record in the Premier League, stating he does not know the exact cause of the issue, as the team has won only one of their last 11 away fixtures. Amorim emphasised that his players must learn how to better control and \"finish games\" to secure vital wins on the road and achieve Champions League qualification. Read here >>>",

      "Luke Littler has demanded Manchester United sign Antoine Semenyo. And after the Bournemouth star followed Littler on social media, the darts sensation joked that it's down to the recruitment chiefs at Old Trafford to get a deal done.",
      "The Nuke called on United to trigger the 25-year-old's release clause, which is reported to be in the region of £65million in January. It comes amid a selection headache for Ruben Amorim, with both Amad (Ivory Coast) and Bryan Mbeumo (Cameroon) set to join their international team-mates for the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco next month.",
      "Morocco's Noussair Mazraoui will also depart for duty with tournament regulations stipulating that clubs should release players two weeks before their respective openers. It would mean that the trio would depart around their trip to face Wolves at Molineux on December 8, while reports suggest that the club are trying to delay sanctioning exits.",
      "Littler posted to Instagram a series of stories regarding the prospect of losing Amad and Mbeumo. The 18-year-old shared a video, titled, 'The solution to our AFCON worries?', which was footage of the United pair celebrating before it showed highlights of Semenyo's goals.",
      "The darts sensation wrote: \"Activate the release clause [wink emoji] gonna miss Amad and Mbeumo massively.\"",
      "He followed it up with a screenshot of his notifications centre on the social media platform showing Semenyo followed him. He captioned the story: \"Step one [tick emoji] I've done my job, now it's down to you Reds [wink and laughing emoji].\"",
      "Reports suggest that Semenyo – also a target for Liverpool – is on the radar as a transfer target for United. The Athletic reported that Bournemouth had 'reluctantly accepted' that they could sell the 25-year-old ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "Semenyo, who signed fresh terms with the Cherries in the summer until 2030, is said to have a £65million release clause in his contract, but there is a time limit to allow Bournemouth to find a viable replacement.",
      "Littler's demands come with the January transfer just under a month away with the threat of losing two key components of Amorim's side until Janaury 17, at the latest.",
      "As it stands, they will miss clashes against Newcastle United (December 26) and Wolves (December 30) but could also be absent for earlier showdowns with Bournemouth and Aston Villa on December 15 and 21, respectively.",
      "Depending on the progression of the Ivory Coast and Cameroon, they could miss encounters against Leeds, Burnley, the FA Cup third round and the Manchester derby against City on December 17.",
      "Amorim said earlier this month that discussions would take place with the respective federations.",
      "He said: \"We have the rules for when we have to release the players [but] we are trying to have the players a bit longer.",
      "\"It is not just in our hands. We will see. We will try to arrange something with the federations.\"",

      "The first is of him holding the hand of his two-year-old son Enzo at what appears to be Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. Another shows him watching the fifth and final season of the television series Stranger Things.",
      "A fourth image shows off a painting that depicts half of him as the comic book superhero Batman. The other half shows him in a Chelsea home shirt with smudged makeup on, akin to that of the supervillain Joker. Garnacho also references Batman in his 20th and final picture.",
      "The image is a still from the film The Dark Knight. It shows actor Christian Bale looking at Batman's suit, and added to the photo are the words \"No Risk No Story\".",
      "The post also features the Manchester United shirts of Amad and Kobbie Mainoo laid out on a bed. The pair swapped shirts with him after United beat Chelsea at Old Trafford in September.",
      "Several of his former team-mates also liked the post, including Bruno Fernandes, Patrick Dorgu and Manuel Ugarte. Alvaro Fernandez Carreas, whom he played with in the club's academy, also commented with two fire emojis.",
      "United sold Chelsea the Argentina international three months ago, two days before the summer transfer window closed. That move was the first of his professional career, having never previously played outside of Madrid before joining United's academy in October 2020.",
      "He has played 11 times since the switch, scoring twice and assisting another two goals for his team-mates. Those assists came in his last Premier League outing, a 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge against Wolverhampton Wanderers.",
      "After that match, his head coach, Enzo Maresca, spoke at length about the player. He said: \"Garna played a fantastic game on the ball, but he was also top without the ball. Pedro Neto was exactly the same, and this is what we need from our wingers.",
      "\"He [Garnacho] arrived here from another club where he was not training 100 per cent, so his physical condition was not good. Slowly, slowly [we have worked on that] and now it's better.",
      "\"He is doing very well on the ball and is doing well off the ball. He knows that, to play with us, he has to be good on the ball and off the ball. We are very happy with him in this moment.\"",
      "Ruben Amorim bristled when asked about Garnacho before his return to Old Trafford earlier this autumn. He said: \"Garnacho is not our player.\"",
      "Asked again, Amorim added: \"Guys, I'm not concerned about that. I just want to win games. I don't care who plays for the opponent, what people are going to say in the end, or if the other player is going to play well. They are good players, and they will play well if things happen. I'm just focused on winning the game. That is my only concern.\"",

      "Patrick Dorgu faces a one-match Premier League suspension if he picks up another yellow card. It comes as the defender seemingly 'liked' a social media post mocking Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim. The Denmark international's Instagram account engaged with content criticising Amorim's decision to deploy Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro as a midfield partnership.",
      "The post, published by 'mufcunion', featured a comment from X stating: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\"",
      "The Instagram post's caption declared: \"Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together,\" which received a 'like' from the 21-year-old full-back's profile. Dorgu must now navigate his own challenges as he treads carefully ahead of Sunday's clash with Crystal Palace.",
      "Should the left-back be shown a yellow card against the Eagles, he would be ruled out of United's home encounter with West Ham on Thursday. Amorim is yet to address Dorgu's social media activity, though many would suggest he has more pressing concerns given United's current form.",
      "The Red Devils currently sit in 10th position after sliding down the table following a series of disappointing results. United had enjoyed significant momentum earlier in the campaign, defeating teams such as Liverpool, Brighton, and Sunderland during an impressive winning streak.",
      "However, stalemates against Tottenham and Nottingham Forest halted this progress before it completely collapsed following their 1-0 defeat to Everton.",
      "Despite Idrissa Gueye receiving his marching orders in the 13th minute following a confrontation with team-mate Michael Keane, United failed to make the most of their numerical superiority and succumbed to a 29th-minute effort from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall.",
      "A fresh test now lies ahead against fifth-placed Palace, with United needing to deliver their finest performance against last season's FA Cup champions. With the Red Devils entirely committed to domestic matters, having failed to secure European qualification this campaign, Amorim requires his full squad at his disposal as he seeks to guide the club back up the league standings.",
      "Ahead of the Palace encounter, Amorim said: \"They are a different club [to us] and they are doing things better than us so that is quite simple.",
      "\"We play in a different way and they are just doing things better than us. They are doing things really well and they play more in transition than us. We have to look at all of these things when we compare our teams but of course, in every position, we can do so much better.\"",
      "When asked whether his side possessed an edge due to their absence from European competition, the Portuguese manager added: \"I said the same thing last year when we were in Europe and I say the same thing this year: there [is an] advantage and disadvantage of not being in Europe. There are no excuses. We have to always win games.\"",

      "Manchester United and Manchester City are expected to lock horns over some big names in the January transfer window. Ruben Amorim and Pep Guardiola are both said to be in the market for a new midfielder, and, naturally, there will be some overlap.",
      "At Old Trafford, Kobbie Mainoo still faces an uncertain future, having fallen out of favour with the Portuguese boss. Meanwhile, Casemiro has entered the final year of his contract, and he's yet to put pen to paper on new terms.",
      "At the Etihad Stadium, Bernardo Silva finds himself in a similar position, with his deal set to expire in June. At the end of the season, Phil Foden, Mateo Kovacic, Rodri will each only have 12 months left on their contracts.",
      "According to the Daily Mail, City are ready to launch a bid for Elliot Anderson. The 23-year-old midfielder has been heavily linked with numerous Premier League clubs this season, including United, following his impressive performances for Nottingham Forest.",
      "The report claims that higher-ups at the Etihad Stadium are 'big admirers' of Anderson, whose contract at the City Ground expires in June 2029. It's said that City have even had scouts in the East Midlands to monitor his development.",
      "It is believed Forest will look to reject all advances from potential suitors in January, even they they receive bids in the region of £100m. The likes of City and United, among other English top-flight outfits, believe a fee in excess of £80m will be enough to sway owner Evangelos Marinakis.",
      "Fortunately for Ruben Amorim, who's in the market for a new midfielder, Pep Guardiola's immediate priority is thought to be a winger. Antoine Semenyo, valued by Bournemouth at £65m, has been considered by City in what could lead to a sensational £165m double swoop.",
      "According to The Daily Briefing, as quoted by Caught Offside, United have contacted the representatives of Vinicius Junior ahead of a potential move in the January transfer window. The 25-year-old winger faces a somewhat uncertain future at Real Madrid, having recently entered the final two years of his contract.",
      "City are reportedly 'likely' to rival the Reds in the race for Vinicius Jr's signature if he decides to leave the Santiago Bernabeu.",
      "Contrary to reports in England, Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo has claimed the Brazil international has actually agreed to reduce his wage demands during talks over a new deal with Los Blancos.",

      "United sources confirmed Cunha had suffered a knock in training. The issue was described as minor, but it was serious enough for him to miss the Everton game on Monday night.",
      "Maguire was absent against Everton due to the hamstring injury he picked up against Tottenham before the November international break. The defender was brought off in the 72nd minute of that game.",
      "Benjamin Sesko remains sidelined with a knee injury. Amorim confirmed at last week's press conference that he expects to have Sesko available again before Wolves on December 8, but he said the striker may need more time.",

      "United's undefeated run of five games was ended by Everton earlier in the week. The Toffees played 77 minutes with 10 men at Old Trafford but were still able to claim a victory.",

      "Amorim confirmed he will be missing Benjamin Sesko as expected for the game at Selhurst Park. Matheus Cunha is also out but could be fit in time for the midweek fixture against West Ham.",
      "Harry Maguire is also out of the game as he takes further time to recuperate from the injury he received at Tottenham. Amorim was also quizzed about the comparisons that can be drawn between United and Palace as they both play the same 3-2-4-1 system.",
      "The topic of signing wing-backs was also mentioned but Amorim was keen not to delve too deeply into replacing specific positions. Meanwhile, questions were asked about the club's away form and what can be done to improve that.",
      "Take a look back at everything Amorim had to say in his press conference below:",
      "That is all from the first part of Amorim's press conference. Those first quotes have been tidied up now.",
      "We need time to improve the characteristics of the team. I say that in the last year and to give an example, the last game, we should have had enough with the right foot to put on the other side to play against ten men. It is these kind of characteristics, with time, we will try to get to be a better team so are we the perfect set-up to play in this way? Not yet but like every team we need time to put the right characteristics into every position to prepare them.",
      "I don't know how you read data [on Palace wing-backs] maybe they play more games, more minutes so you can't compare the data. We make a lot of substitutions and sometimes we change because we know that is a different position or you want to change the feet with Dalot and Patrick. Sometimes we start with Amad in front but most of the time if we need to win the game, I put Amad on the right. Amad changes position all the time and that can change all the data and you see different things. But again, they are doing the things really well. They play more in transition than us. The opponents see it in a different way so all of these things we have to look when we compare teams. But in every position we can do so much better.",
      "We play a different way and you can understand that by data but it is hard to explain everything. It is a different club and they are doing that better than us so that is quite simple but you don't say all 4-3-3 play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in different space and we try to attack in a different way and they are just doing things better than us.",
      "I play against him [Glasner] at Frankfurt with Sporting so I know the players. I take inspiration from everyone. When I have two weeks for national teams, I watch all the managers and try to take all the inspiration that I can take. I have six years as a manager and I am always trying to learn to improve my team.",
      "The same things that we need to do to show to the players why we lost control of Forest why we lost control against Tottenham. And if you look at those games they were there to win. Sometimes a small detail can change everything. Then I felt this year when we play at home the intensity is higher and I felt in this game at home the intensity was not at the same level so I think it is something that we need to work on. It is hard to point at one thing why we are not winning away. There is a lot of issues that we are improving. Like I say, we have advantage in the away games but we need to know how to finish the games in order to win.",
      "If you look at the game we can play better. Everything that happened in that game, we should have won that game, we have to feel that urgency of winning games. We know what happens around the club if we do not win games. If we know that, let's do everything in the right way but again, we lost that one. We cannot change that, let's focus on the next one.",
      "Sesko is going to take a little bit more time, Harry [Maguire] the same. I expect to have Matheus back in the next one not this one.",
      "No, no, no setback [for Sesko]. We are taking care of the injury.",
      "It is to start again and it was really tough the week as it should be. It was hard after this result, this defeat. But the process needs to continue and we need to go for the next game and we have to understand, especially in our league this year, everything can change really fast so let's go again and focus on the next one.",
      "In our club it is the same thing because last year we had to win every game all the time and we took a lot of criticism because we are not winning. So in our club there is no excuses.

      "Amorim has just started speaking to the United press pack at Carrington. Remember the press conference is embargoed until 1.30pm but we will get you the quotes as soon as we can!",
      "Amorim surprised many of us on Monday when he chose to start Zirkzee as the No.9 against Everton. Before that game, he had only played 90 minutes over five appearances but it was a show of confidence from the manager to throw him in. Sadly, the risk did not work and the United boss could be asked questions over where he sees Zirkzee starting at Palace.",
      "Here is what we expect Amorim to be asked about and speak on in his press conference this afternoon:",
      "We are just one hour away from Amorim's press conference being broadcast. The Portuguese head coach will be speaking to the media at 1.15pm with the embargo being lifted at 1.30pm. Stay tuned for the updates from Carrington right here...",
      "United believes the chance to host the FIFA 2035 women's World Cup is a \"brilliant opportunity.\" United and the city region have been aligned with the aim of bringing significant fixtures at the World Cup in 2035 to the stadium, including the final of the tournament. United withdrew Old Trafford from the list of venues for the 2028 men's European Championship because they were considering its future and could not commit to being a host venue. However, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has earmarked the 2030/31 season for United to move into the new 100,000-seater Old Trafford.",

      "Teenage midfielder Cristian Orozco is set to travel to the United Kingdom ahead of his move to Manchester United, who have a preliminary agreement to sign the Colombian. Orozco, 17, plays for Fortaleza CEIF and has captained Colombia's Under-17 team. The defensive midfielder helped Colombia reach the final of the U17 South American Championship in the spring, and United have identified him as an exciting young talent with first-team potential.",

      "Another game, another potential United audition in the opposition ranks. This time it is the turn of Palace's Wharton to take centre stage as the Reds continue to have an eye on midfield options. MEN Sport has taken a look at why the audition may not necessarily be a ringing endorsement for signing the England international.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "In an interview with DAZN Portugal this week, Amorim admitted he is willing to change his tactic despite criticism he is too wedded to the 3-2-4-1 system. The Portuguese head coach could be quizzed on this in his press conference later and it will be interesting to see how he responds.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Heading into today's press conference we can expect to hear about the latest on the injury issues affecting United. Sesko is likely to be overlooked considering Amorim put a timeline of 'a few weeks' on his potential return. Cunha and Maguire have more chance of being fit for Sunday. Maguire was training at Carrington during the international break but his recovery needed longer. Cunha's injury was deemed 'nothing serious' on Monday night so there's a chance he could play Sunday.",
      "United are looking to bounce back this weekend against Palace after the dismal display vs Everton. Their best chance of doing that would be to have their strongest line-up available to them for the trip to Selhurst Park. However, our United writer Steven Railston believes the club needs a double injury boost to be able to do just that.",
      "Read more here>>>",
      "Welcome to our live press conference blog. Amorim will address the media today and we will have his quotes at 1.30pm.",
      "Amorim's attitude today will be interesting after his players put in a poor performance in the defeat to Everton on Monday night. The Reds desperately need a response on Sunday to show the result was merely a blip after a good run of form.",

      "Hansi Flick revealed the form of Ferran Torres was one of the reasons why Marcus Rashford was on the Barcelona bench for their Champions League clash against Chelsea. The Manchester United loannee was absent for their La Liga win over Athletic Club this past weekend because of illness with that also playing a part in Flick's decision.",
      "Even without Rashford, Barca strode to victory back at the Camp Nou for the first time in a few years by scoring four goals while also keeping a clean sheet.",
      "Torres grabbed a brace in that game and Flick therefore rewarded him for that by naming him in the starting XI for their trip to Stamford Bridge",
      "Flick, as quoted by Mundo Deportivo, said: \"Ferran scored two goals on Saturday, and Marcus had been out for three or four days due to his injury, but he’s ready to play at any moment.\"",
      "That latter phrase was confirmed by Flick at half-time with Rashford coming on for Torres, who had missed a great opportunity in the first half, before things unravelled for his side. A Jules Kounde own goal and Ronald Araujo red card saw Barcelona a man and goal down at the interval.",
      "Rashford struggled to get into the game with Chelsea able to extend their lead through a dazzling Estevao Willian strike and clinical Liam Delap finish.",
      "The 28-year-old is unlikely to be judged for his display in west London given the challenging circumstances with Flick a big fan of Rashford as he made perfectly clear when asked about his return to the fold.",
      "He said: \"I'm really very happy [he is back]. We will decide tomorrow [Tuesday] if he plays from the beginning or if he comes in from the bench. But as I said, I'm happy to have him in our team.",
      "\"Last time when we played Newcastle, I also said this. I have followed him, I think, his whole career. I was impressed about him, with his quality, what he is doing in the box, what he is doing in front of goal.",
      "\"He has also showed it in Barcelona, which is really good. But for him, this change to live in another culture. The people in Barcelona are fantastic, we have nice weather. For me, it's amazing.",
      "\"You can see now he is also smiling a lot, and if he can enjoy the atmosphere we have, it is also good for him.\"",
      "The decision to sign him permanently from United is unlikely to be made by Flick but 13 goal contributions this season shows he is putting himself in a great position to have the £26million buy-option in his loan switch activated.",
      "Ruben Amorim could certainly do with Rashford at the moment after his side failed to score against 10-man Everton on Monday evening.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko missed the game through injury with the latter set to miss the next few weeks. Bryan Mbeumo will also be absent for a period across the New Year as he competes in AFCON for Cameroon.",

      "\"It could be difficult for him as a new player coming into a club where there are a lot of new players and transferring his skills across from Crystal Palace, but a move to Old Trafford would be good for him and the club.\"",
      "Sagna continued: \"It will be difficult for Palace to keep hold of him, and it’s the right moment for him to move if he wants the test of playing for one of the biggest teams in the Premier League.",
      "\"He's not a young player anymore and it might be one of the last moves of his career, so he will probably push for it if the opportunity arises.\"",
      "Mateta has been at prolific for Crystal Palace over the years and his vast Premier League experience could make a real difference at Old Trafford, if a move was to come to fruition in the future, following their interest in the summer.",

      "Despite the early sending off, Everton were the better side and deserved to draw first blood through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who beat Senne Lammens from the edge of the box. United pushed for an equaliser but couldn't find a breakthrough as Jordan Pickford denied Joshua Zirkzee with an excellent late save.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Should have done better for Dewsbury-Hall's strike. His starting position made it difficult for him to get across to his left-hand side. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Didn't commit to the challenge when Dewsbury-Hall picked up the ball on the edge of the box, which proved costly. 5",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Was caught out of position a few times when Everton looked dangerous in the first half. Didn't have much to do after the break when United finally started to ask a few questions. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Made an excellent challenge at the beginning of the second half and tried to rally his teammates as Everton held onto their one-goal advantage. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Didn't offer much going forward in the first 45 minutes and was hooked at the interval in a tactical tweak from Amorim. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "Although Casemiro has become an influential figure again this season he looked like a 33-year-old and was passive. It wasn't a surprise to see him substituted in the 58th minute. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His passing was sloppy at times and he resorted to shooting from distance in an effort to get United back into the contest. Wasted a big chance from close range with 20 minutes remaining. 4",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Looks low on confidence and was poor again at Old Trafford. He missed a decent chance in the first half - his end product must improve - and is likely to be replaced by Dalot at the weekend. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "The international break had the potential to disrupt Mbeumo's momentum. The 26-year-old showed determination on a night when United weren't at the races for large parts. 5",
      "Amad",
      "Was probably the pick of a bad bunch in the first half. Amad relocated to right wing-back when Mazraoui was brought off and he was still involved in most attacking phases of play. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "The highlight of Zirkzee's first half was his heated exchange with James Tarkowski. The Dutchman made his first start of the campaign and didn't do much until drawing a late save from Pickford. 4",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made a difference when he came on. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "An improvement on Dorgu. 5",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Tried his best. 5",

      "Gueye was sent off for slapping teammate Michael Keane in the 13th minute of the game. The Premier League said on the decision: \"The referee’s call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane.\"",
      "Despite playing most of the contest with 10 men, Everton were able to secure three points thanks to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's strike in the first half. Amorim was asked whether he was embarrassed about the result, and responded: \"It was also 11 v 11, the first moments you can feel it.\"",
      "He explained that he disagreed with the sending off, saying: \"Fighting is not a bad thing, it doesn’t mean they don’t like each other. I don’t agree with that sending off, we can fight with teammates.",
      "\"I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other. They cannot be a sending off, but my players show many games that we can do it. Today we didn’t manage to do it.\"",
      "Amorim added on the display: \"When you have more players with different characteristics, you have more options to score goals, especially against low blocks.",
      "\"We could lose the game, but with a different intensity. The other team fight each other and we didn’t understand the moments of the game and that is my fault, I need to explain every moment.\"",
      "\"If nothing happened, I don't think anyone in the stadium would have been surprised,\" said Moyes. \"I thought the referee could have taken a bit longer to think about it.",

But there's another side to it: I like my players fighting each other, if someone didn't do the right action. If you want that toughness and resilience to get a result, you want someone to act on it.",
      "\"I'm disappointed we got the sending off. But we've all been footballers, we get angry with our teammates. He's apologised for the sending off, he's praised the players and thanked them for it and apologised for what happened.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim waved his arms and screamed as Manchester United attempted to win the ball back from Everton. Amorim insisted after each win in October there was plenty more work to do and he was right.",
      "Everton had won just once at United in the Premier League in the past 32 years, a 1-0 triumph in 2013 under Roberto Martinez when David Moyes was managing in the home dugout.",
      "Moyes had not won at Old Trafford in 17 attempts as a visiting manager, so history was stacked against Everton, but he oversaw an unlikely victory with just 10 men on the pitch.",
      "Amorim made two changes and both were enforced, with Harry Maguire and Matheus Cunha dropping out of the squad due to injury, opening the door for Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee to start.",
      "The tactical battle was an interesting one in the opening exchanges. Everton played a high line and pressed with purpose. They wanted Senne Lammens to kick the ball long because they have the height to win aerial balls.",
      "James Tarkowski pushed Zirkzee to the floor in an off-the-ball incident. Zirkzee came close to squaring up with the defender, but referee Tony Harrington gave both a warning.",
      "There must have been something in the air because tensions then boiled over between Everton players. Idrissa Gana Gueye was unhappy with Michael Keane, and he slapped his own teammate in a moment of madness. Gueye was shown a red card and was red in the face as Jordan Pickford held him back.",
      "Bruno Fernandes stood yards away from the incident and couldn't believe what he was watching. The Everton analysts who were sitting in the press box looked equally dumbfounded.",
      "United had kept just one clean sheet in the league, which came against Sunderland, before the visit of Everton, but the sending off handed a huge opportunity to record another.",
      "That's without mentioning that Everton's strikers can't score for toffee. Thierno Barry was goalless in 11 league appearances but was given the nod to start, which meant Beto (one goal in 11) was on the bench. However, Iliman Ndiaye looked threatening at times and Jack Grealish was involved on the left.",
      "United started so badly that Gueye's sending off didn't stop Everton from being on the front foot. The travelling Evertonians chirped and erupted when Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall opened the scoring.",
      "\"Hit it,\" shouted the Everton analyst. Leny Yoro didn't commit to the challenge and Lammens should have done better. The goalkeeper's starting position was poor and the shot was saveable.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Lisandro Martinez returned to the squad after recovering from their respective injuries, although the latter's return was more significant given the length of his lay-off.",
      "Martinez had been sidelined for nine months with a cruciate ligament injury. It was great to see him back in the squad and he received a warm reception when he emerged to warm up.",
      "There was further applause for youngster Shea Lacey, who was named in a senior squad for the first time, reward for delivering consistently strong performances in academy fixtures. Lacey has a high ceiling and his squad inclusion is expected to be the first of many.",
      "Mani from The Stone Roses sadly passed away this month. United played \"I Want To Be Adored\" as kick-off approached, and \"This Is The One\" carried more meaning as the players walked out.",
      "The first half performance was reminiscent of last season. United must brush teams like Everton aside at home if they want to secure Champions League qualification next season. November started with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, but Everton was a much bigger setback.",
      "Most of those in red shirts looked disinterested in the first half, and Amorim hooked Noussair Mazraoui at the interval. Mason Mount was introduced and Amad relocated to right wing-back.",
      "Patrick Dorgu had another game to forget and was hauled off before the hour mark. The problem is his replacement, Diogo Dalot, has also been unconvincing from the left this season. The huge cheer for Mainoo as he replaced Casemiro showed what fans think about the handling of him.",
      "Amorim was widely praised after an excellent October, but United have not entered the winter as they would have liked. The games come thick and fast, and they must find another response.",
      "There were joyous scenes in the Everton section at the full-time whistle. Yoro slumped to his knees and Fernandes complained. The United captain should look at himself first after such a poor display.",
      "Moyes claimed an away win at Old Trafford on his 18th attempt. He'll argue it was worth the wait.",

But most grassroots football teams don’t have a medical team on site, which is why it’s critical anyone who plays amateur football – at any level – knows how to perform CPR and use a defibrillator.",
      "“Too many people still think you have to be a medical professional to step in, but that’s simply not true. Anyone can learn these lifesaving skills and if someone collapses, you need to have the confidence to act. “And that confidence comes from training. That’s why I’m urging everyone in grassroots football to take 15 minutes to learn CPR and defibrillation with the BHF’s brilliant free online tool, RevivR.”",

      "Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have revealed how they were once consulted over some potential transfer arrivals to the club in a secret meeting.",
      "The pair claim it happened during a spell when Ryan Giggs was named as the interim manager, which occurred during the 2013/14 season following the dismissal of David Moyes.",
      "At the time, Manchester United were looking to rebuild following the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era, with plenty of big-name transfers following in an attempt to get the side back in the Premier League title picture.",
      "With that in mind, the executive vice-chairman at the time, Ed Woodward, sought out some help from Scholes and Butt to discuss transfer targets, with a four-man shortlist proposed to the pair.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, the United legends were asked about how that meeting with Woodward led to Paul Pogba's return.",
      "Butt responded and said: \"I just remember Ryan [Giggs] took control of the club for four or five or six games at the end of the season... then me and Scholesy did it [the meeting] with him and Phil as well.",
      "\"And I remember obviously they were looking for the right manager to come in and take the job, so they obviously needed targets to go and get in the summer.",
      "\"So I had left the training ground and got called back, and there was a meeting with myself, Scholesy, Ryan, and Ed Woodward, and I think Ed Woodward was on a Zoom call; it wasn't so much face-to-face, I think he was in London, and it was like 'Who would you get?'",
      "\"And he gave us a list of midfielders, I know Pogba was one, Kroos weren't you saying? Fabregas might've been one.\"",
      "Scholes added: \"I think Fabregas might've been one as well, I think even Modric might've been one as well.\"",
      "Butt continued: \"I remember we were all discussing pros and cons to them all, and the end of the conversation was 'go for both of them, Kroos and Pogba, because we're Man United and we need to get back to the top'.",
      "\"And if you get one, it's like yin and yang, we mentioned it a while ago, about if you get centre-backs, with Harry Maguire, and you need a footballing player next to him, it's a bit of the same with midfielders.",
      "\"We're not all the same, and you need a bit to complement each other, and that was how it was left, and then they went all-out for Pogba.\"",
      "United went on to re-sign Pogba in August 2016, in a deal from Juventus that could have reached up to £93m with all of the add-ons included.",
      "The French midfielder went on to make 233 appearances for the club, scoring 39 goals and assisting 51 times for his teammates, before leaving in 2022 on a free transfer.",
      "Pogba's career is often reflected on in different ways, with many remembering the magic he could conjure up, while others believe he never found it consistently enough to match the large fee paid for him.",
      "Perhaps the addition of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, or Cesc Fabregas alongside him could've changed those fortunes, with the former pair impressing at Real Madrid for many more years to come, while the latter had a spell back in England with Chelsea, before featuring in France and then Italy.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 65% off select items.",

      "Former Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood has been backed to play for England again on one condition as he would solve “many problems”.",
      "Greenwood has spent the last 18 months playing in Europe as Man Utd decided to offload him after he faced charges relating to attempted rape and assault.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service eventually discontinued the case against the 24-year-old as the withdrawal of key witnesses significantly reduced the chances of a conviction.",
      "Greenwood spent the 2024/25 season on loan at La Liga outfit Getafe before joining Marseille for around £26m in this summer’s transfer window.",
      "He has eleven goals and four assists in his 17 appearances for Roberto De Zerbi’s side this season, but it has been widely reported that his past ensures he has little chance of playing for England at next summer’s World Cup.",
      "Greenwood is likely too much trouble than he’s worth for head coach Thomas Tuchel, who would be wise to avoid the headache provided by his return.",
      "READ: Revealed: The next five new winners of the Ballon d’Or, including next Messi v Ronaldo rivalry",
      "Despite this, former Premier League striker Troy Deeney thinks the FA could set a “dangerous precedent” if they deny Greenwood a return as he should play for his country again on one condition.",
      "“In truth, he does not owe an explanation to football supporters. It is his friends and family he must prove himself to,” Deeney said in his column for The Sun.",
      "“But, if he wants an England return, he must address it in public – prove he is worthy of wearing the England shirt, show he can be trusted.",
      "“Rebuilding trust is the only way this can ever happen and it is an incredibly hard thing to achieve. It would be taxing on Greenwood himself having to face such justified scrutiny.",
      "“That is the only way England and the FA would allow Greenwood, who has just one cap, to come back into the Three Lions fold.",
      "“If Greenwood can face that and come through it. he deserves a second chance with England. If there was to be no way back whatsoever, the game is setting a dangerous precedent. Sending a message that any mistake in your personal life rules you out for good. Whether he wants that chance is another question altogether.”",
      "Deeney has also explained why he thinks Greenwood would solve “many problems” for England and Tuchel.",
      "“If he were a bang average player there would be no need for a debate. But he is phenomenal and that can create a problem for England.\nLooking at the current England squad, he would solve a number of problems for Thomas Tuchel,” Deeney added.",

      "“Greenwood could play anywhere across the forward line and be a real threat from any of those positions. There would no longer be worries about what happens without Harry Kane, Greenwood starts.",
      "“A number of players who have made squads recently would no longer be in consideration if they were up against Greenwood.",
      "“The awkward truth, too, is that should he come back – many would not care. If England are ruthlessly looking for any way to win, they would bring him back into the fold.",
      "“Were Greenwood to return in March, face all the noise but contribute and impress, there would be every chance he goes to the World Cup. What, then, happens if Tuchel turns to him in a World Cup final, and Greenwood scores the goal that wins it for England. Would fans celebrate? Of course they would.”",

      "“If I was Antoine Semenyo, I would stay at Bournemouth until the end of the season,” Sagna said.",
      "“As a player, moving clubs in the January transfer window can be disruptive; it’s much better to stay until the summer and then make a decision, and integrate into the team properly – rather than joining midway through a campaign.",

      "Third, how the hell can the board sack a man who won the league last season? I don’t care about Klopp’s team blah blah blah – He took that team to the top of the league and on an excellent run in the Champions league – not to mention Carabao cup Finalists.",
      "Furthermore to my last point, if the board do part ways with him they must be firmly aware that if the incorrect choice in replacement is made and it fails; which I suspect it would, the fans would turn fully against them. The trues red supporters are far from stupid and blind",

      "This week we saw an impressive team display by a team from Merseyside where they showed a clear collective desire to fight for the good of the team, working tirelessly in that regard whilst having a clear incisive plan about how to attack the opposition – it’s just a shame to me that the team in question wore blue ( .. a genuine congratulations to the toffees for a performance that they can be rightly proud of against Man Utd).",
      "Which leads me to the crux of this mail – where is the collective fight to overcome adversity within this Liverpool team that we are watching this season?",
      "I have always felt across my many decades of supporting Liverpool that the collective spirit/battling qualities are part of our DNA and therefore a given. Recent viewings appear to be bringing this into question.",
      "That is not to say that if we solve that particular aspect that everything else will just fall into place – it feels to me that there are many layers to our current malaise (layers may be the wrong term here … perhaps a tangled ball of wool is more apt).",
      "Let me briefly comment on one or two (but not all !) of those key aspects as I see it:",
      "From a squad balance perspective there appears to have been a questionable prioritisation of transfer funds across the summer that has led to a situation where we are too thin in defensive areas. I can’t complain about the purchase of Wirtz as he looks to be an incredibly gifted footballer, but one who is struggling to adapt to the pace and physicality of the premier league as things stand (still feel he’ll likely come good though). What would also help is him having a clearer role in the team in terms of where he plays – I am not saying we have to build the team around him, but it does feel like the opposite has happened with Slot’s decisions to shunt him around to different positions.",
      "You won’t get many Liverpool fans complaining about Ekitike, but the manner in which the Isak saga played out after his signing just feels that we got suckered into a ‘whose got the biggest d*ck’ contest with Newcastle and ended up spending top dollar for an ingredient that we may not have explicitly needed – as others have pointed out, there appears to have been no winners as things stand from that soap opera of a signing.",
      "So that’s £125m that could perhaps have been repointed to other key areas, namely defensive spine, and I include the No6 position in that.",
      "We have a scenario at the moment where our CB’s are not performing individually / collectively to the standards previously set, yet there appears to be no consequence to them for that – they effectively know that they are going to be starting the next game. Quite what Gomez has to do to get a start in the prem is beyond me – Slot says he is not match fit / sharp, yet fails to enlighten us as to how he can solve that whilst giving him no game time.",
      "I very much hope that Marc Guehi ends up being a Liverpool player, the sooner the better.",
      "Liverpool’s midfield have been off it this year – lacking aggression and togetherness – and providing a weakened shield to a more troubled defence (= goals against).",
      "I have said it in previous mails that I would like Liverpool to get a decent No6 to improve our options and add a bit of needed steel (Ederson from Atalanta would be an ideal).",
      "… but the summer money was spent elsewhere.",
      "Lastly, thoughts about how the team is being led currently.",
      "I’ve previously said that Slot has tried to integrate too many different new ingredients into the team stew whilst expecting the overall outcome to taste the same – previous experience both inside and outside the club should have told him that was perhaps a little naïve.",
      "He appears to be quite stubborn in some of his continued selections of certain new players who appear to be struggling form wise (eg. Kerkez), when I feel an alternative blanket approach should have been adopted, namely that each new player should have come to the club on the broad understanding that they had to earn their place in the team. Robertson should have played ahead of Kerkez until form dictated otherwise. Bradley (when fit !) should start at RB.",
      "The one new player who answered that form call in spades is Ekitike, and he finds himself marginalised in favour of a more expensive and currently less effective alternative (sigh).",

      "If the club hierarchy cherish Alonso as they appeared to in the run up to Klopp departing, they may have the patience to wait to see how the current arrangement at Real Madrid plays out and see if there is a possibility at the end of the season (nothing immediate).",
      "Iraola really interests me and clearly has something about him – there is plausible potential for that to happen mid-season, unlike Alonso, so if Liverpool decide to let Slot go mid-season it will be very telling if they seek a temporary manager until the end of the season (which will indicate favouring Alonso) or whether they go all out to get a permanent replacement in.",

      "I want to reply to this comment from Micky P, ‘I don’t think the Jota situation has ever been seen anywhere in elite sport – a player in his prime dying suddenly.’ I would refer him to the 2020 season when Kobe Bryant died. While not all of the players and staff at the Lakers had played with Kobe and he wasn’t in his prime I’m sure the shadow of his loss stretched over the season. How did they respond? They won the championship. IF Liverpool were flying right now I am sure that would be the narrative. The ‘this means more’ drum would be beaten, the team would be speaking about it in the press. Instead it appears poor squad building as much as anything has disrupted their season. I’m not discounting the impact of grief. I am sure it plays a part in the situation but to write of the season seems a bit much for the ‘mentality monsters’ of LFC.\nHanKolo, Vietnam",

      "Mikey P, Cardiff brings up good points about the impact of Diogo Jota’s death on the Liverpool team, and while he felt there weren’t any other case histories in elite sport where the untimely death of a beloved teammate has had a profound effect on performance of the team, I can share two from American major league baseball history.",
      "So the Pittsburgh Pirates were a dominate team in the early 70s. They won their NL division three years consecutively with records of 89-73 (1970), 97-65 (1971) and 96-59 (1972), and won the 1971 World Series (I know…it’s called what it’s called).",
      "Then on Dec 31, 1972, Roberto Clemente, a true talisman for the Pirates who had been at the club for 18 years, died in a plane crash while on mercy mission to deliver aid and food to Nicaragua after a massive earthquake. He chartered the airplane himself and packed it with emergency supplies. I’ll let the good people at Wikipedia fill you in:",
      "“Clemente visited Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, in late 1972, while managing the Puerto Rico national baseball team at the 1972 Amateur World Series. When Managua was affected by a massive earthquake three weeks later, on December 23, 1972, Clemente immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.",
      "The airplane which he chartered for the New Year’s Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel (the flight was missing a flight engineer and a copilot), and it was also overloaded by 4,200 pounds (1,900 kg). It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure.",
      "It would be an understatement to say Clemente was baseball GOAT conversation material from an on-field performance perspective and a saint of a humanitarian.",
      "What happened to the Pirates? Well the club and his adopted city of Pittsburgh were devastated. Many of Clemente’s teammates traveled to Puerto Rico to be with his family and his buddy Manny Sanguillén even personally went to the crash site and literally dove in the water to participate in recovery efforts.",
      "And the aftermath: the Pirates tanked in 1973, going 80-82 and finishing 3rd in the NL East after winning the division 3 years in a row. In 1974 they returned to winning ways topping their division in 1974, 1975 and 1976, and capped off a productive decade by winning the World Series in 1979.",
      "There is another baseball player, the New York Yankee’s Thurmon Munson, who also died in an airplane crash in August of 1979 – won’t share the whole story – but the Yankees had won their AL division and consecutive World Series in 1977 & 1978, but finished 1979 in 4th place in their division, way out of contention.",
      "MLB baseball teams play 162 game seasons, so that’s a lot of datapoints to establish trends of causative and correlative relationships.",
      "It’s no revelation that personal grief impacts humans in profound ways, but the sudden loss of a beloved teammate and “brother in arms” has happened before in elite sport and while it’s difficult to calculate/quantify the effect from a human perspective, you can see it on the pitch/baseball diamond, and it’s real.",
      "There are fans in Pittsburgh and New York still alive and old enough to remember the trauma of losing Clemente and Munson…and they probably would assume YNWA is a rap band, but YNWA is felt in spirit by the many who love their sports teams and have been through a grieving process similar to yours. Hang in there Liverpool.\nRussell. Birmingham, Alabama",

I get that the name of the game is to score goals, but a team with over 70% possession and a 21 shot edge on their opponents is not being outplayed, let alone dominated. They are missing their shots. (a similar thing happened to Man city as well).",
      "It’s not Amorin’s or Slot’s fault that these players misfired so often. A coach with the quality at his disposal of these two teams should expect that they will win, nearly always, if the team dominates the stats that much.",
      "These types of results if they are infrequent are just par for the course. It happens to all teams. If they are consistent, surely the players deserve a huge part of the blame? I mean, what are we proposing as a means to blame the coach. Is it that players on these teams never get practice shooting? Of course they do.

I would slightly disagree with Ian Wright that it is solely racially motivated when black players are criticised. I think the UK press has, on the whole, an issue with people, black/white/ whatever, that they perceive as above their station, too big for their boots, especially where they think that station feels like it has not been fully earned (same papers will have no problem with the royals mind). It is something inherent in the British press’s mindset to tear those people down in my opinion and it is beyond racially motivated.\nGarret (LFC Doldrums), Ireland",

      "Nottingham Forest are hoping to get around £100million for Elliot Anderson after Manchester City put him at the top of their midfield shortlist, according to reports.",
      "Anderson has been one of the best midfielders in the Premier League this season, leading the division in ball recoveries (98).",
      "He is also third for fouls won (25), fifth for passes completed (734), and third for progressive passes (100).",
      "Anderson’s form has been a rare bright spot in a difficult season for Forest.",
      "The City Ground club are already on their third manager of the campaign after replacing Nuno Espirito Santo with Ange Postecoglou, who only lasted eight games before being replaced by Sean Dyche.",
      "While Forest, who are 16th in the Premier League, have struggled, Anderson has been fantastic under all three managers.",
      "Unsurprisingly, his form has caught the attention of several top clubs.",
      "One of those clubs is Manchester City, who are seeking a long-term replacement for Rodri.",
      "Rodri has struggled to stay fit this season after missing the majority of 2024/25 with an ACL injury, and his deputy Nico Gonzalez has failed to impress so far.",
      "Gonzalez is definitely improving, and any midfielder is a downgrade on the 2024 Ballon d’Or winner, but Pep Guardiola will have expected more from the £50million January signing.",
      "Anderson is Premier League-proven and looks the real deal. Not only has he been terrific for Forest, but he has also established himself as a regular in Thomas Tuchel’s England starting XI.",
      "He’d be a top signing for City, and according to the Daily Mail, Guardiola’s side are ‘ready to make Anderson one of their top targets in 2026’ and are now ‘ahead of’ Manchester United in the race for his signature.",
      "City’s director of football, Hugo Viana, and Guardiola are huge admirers of the 23-year-old and have sent scouts to watch him this season.",
      "It’s believed Forest ‘will reject any advances in January’ and think they can hold out for £100m after the World Cup. The minimum expectation is £80m for Anderson, who appeals to City because he can play as both a No.6 and No.8.",
      "Crystal Palace midfielder Adam Wharton has also been targeted by City, but they are now more interested in the Forest star.",
      "There is also interest from Liverpool and Manchester United, while £80-100m is deemed too much by his former club Newcastle United.",

      "Elliot Anderson against Liverpool. 🔝 pic.twitter.com/mcItXwOwRd",
      "— Nottingham Forest (@NFFC) November 24, 2025",
      "Newcastle will be absolutely gutted that they let Anderson go, but they were correct to do so at the time.",
      "Anderson’s pathway into the starting XI was blocked by Bruno Guimaraes, Sandro Tonali and Joelinton, while Eddie Howe also had Lewis Miley and Joe Willock at his disposal.",
      "The midfielder wasn’t pushing to leave but wanted regular football. When the opportunity to join Forest arose, he took it, and the Magpies were happy to oblige.",
      "His exit was regarded as nothing more than a PSR sham, with Greek goalkeeper Odysseas Vlachodimos moving in the opposite direction in a separate deal worth ‘£20m’.",
      "Anderson’s transfer fee on paper was £35m, but it was effectively a £15m move when you accounted for the Odysseas deal.",
      "At the time, £35m looked laughable. Now he’s worth around triple that.",
      "Not only would Anderson be perfect for this disjointed Newcastle team, with Joelinton declining, Miley showing little progression, and Ramsey and Willock injury-prone, but they will be devastated to have let a £100m midfielder, who came through their academy, leave for £15m.",
      "They absolutely f***ed it. But nobody thought they had at the time. And Newcastle’s hands were tied by the Premier League’s financial rules; they felt they had little choice but to cash in for pure profit.",

      "“But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he’s almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "“He’s done really well at Chelsea, don’t get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I’m not sure.",
      "“Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford’s a big pitch. It’s a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "“I’d say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don’t like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "“He’s come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I’d like to see all three of them.",
      "“I’d probably say I’d go Wharton. I still don’t think they’re any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they’re more the style of football these days.",
      "“I just think Wharton’s got a little bit more quality. That’s tough saying that. I think he’s got more quality than Baleba.",
      "“Baleba’s got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It’s close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I’d just pick Wharton.”",
      "The new midfield recruit looks set to push Kobbie Mainoo – who’s yet to start a Premier League game this season – further down the pecking order, and Scholes is frustrated by the England international’s lack of game time under Amorim.",
      "He added: “Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he’s not played. You could expect that.",
      "“One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team.",
      "“We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it’s not quite happened for him. The manager doesn’t seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "“But the manager’s just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that’s something he has to deal with.",
      "“I think he’s dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "“As I’m frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don’t have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "“He [Amorim] possibly doesn’t trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn’t the most physical, but he’s streetwise. He knows the position, he’s done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he’s got that experience.",
      "“Kobbie hasn’t quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he’s going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don’t do that.",
      "“They’ve got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he’s got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "“You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage past at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 16th despite a ropey set of results on matchday five, while all three of England’s Thursday night warriors also look set for play-off rounds at worst.",
      "Total points: 97.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",
      "",
      "Missed out on an extra place this year, but that does make each individual win worth that little bit more this time. And so far there have been plenty of wins.",
      "Total points: 69.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Bayern Munich (UCL), Borussia Dortmund (UCL), Bayer Leverkusen (UCL), Eintracht Frankfurt (UCL), Freiburg (UEL), Stuttgart (UEL), Mainz (UECL)",
      "",
      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and at serious risk of losing half their Champions League teams before the knockouts with Napoli and Juventus currently looking over their shoulders in 20th and 22nd.",
      "Total points: 67.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Inter (UCL), Atalanta (UCL), Napoli (UCL), Juventus (UCL), Roma (UEL), Bologna (UEL), Fiorentina (UECL)",
      "",
      "Only having five teams but a couple of them being very decent means Portugal are prone to starting deceptively well here, with any wins your Sportings and Portos pick up being worth a chunky 0.4pts apiece. But will inevitably slide down the table, especially with Santa Clara failing to reach the Conference league stage and Benfica unlikely to make the knockouts in the Champions League.",
      "Total points: 47.000\nTotal teams: Five\nTeams still active: Four\nLeague stage: Sporting (UCL), Benfica (UCL), Porto (UEL), Braga (UEL)\nEliminated: Santa Clara (UECL)",
      "",
      "All four of Poland’s European representatives have wound up in the Conference, but the fact they’re all still standing and racking up points that only need to be divided by four means a strong early total.",
      "Total points: 37.500\nTotal teams: Four\nTeams still active: Four\nLeague stage: Rakow Częstochowa, Jagiellonia Bialystok, Lech Poznan, Legia Warsaw (all UECL)",

      "Premier League • England",
      "Manchester United are planning an ambitious raid on Real Madrid for one of their best players who is reportedly not happy under manager Xabi Alonso, according to a report in the Spanish media, but TEAMtalk has analysed why he is very unlikely to move to Old Trafford.",
      "It has been well-documented that Man Utd are on the hunt for a new midfielder in 2026. With Ruben Amorim’s side aiming to finish in the Premier League top four this season, signing a new player for the middle of the park is the utmost priority for the Red Devils.",
      "TEAMtalk understands that Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest is Man Utd’s top midfield target in 2026.",
      "Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton, Brighton and Hove Albion ace Carlos Baleba and Wolves dynamo Joao Gomes also feature in the Red Devils’ wishlist.",
      "E-Noticies has now thrown another name into the mix, reporting that Man Utd want to sign Federico Valverde from Real Madrid.",
      "Man Utd are said to be ‘planning to submit an offer that would exceed €120million (£105.2m, $139m) for Valverde, who was described as a ‘machine in midfield’ and ‘one of the most dynamic and complete midfielders in world football’ in Breaking The Lines in July 2025.",
      "The report comes amid claims in another section of the Spanish media that the Uruguay international is not happy with Madrid manager Alonso.",
      "According to journalist Arancha Rodriguez of COPE, Valverde is one of six Madrid players who are ‘unhappy with Xabi Alonso’.",
      "Valverde has been a very reliable player for Madrid over the years, with his all-round display in the middle of the park making him hugely popular among the Santiago Bernabeu faithful.",
      "However, the 27-year-old Uruguay international, who has won LaLiga thrice and the Champions League twice with Madrid so far in his career, has failed to make a huge impact in Alonso’s system and has also been forced to play at right-back because of injuries.",
      "IN DEPTH 🔴 Ranking all 25 midfielders Man Utd have been linked with and why Premier League star should be No. 1 target",
      "E-Noticies is a Catalan news outlet, so the report about Valverde and Man Utd has to be taken with a pinch of salt, given the intense rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid.",
      "However, in fairness to E-Noticies, it has noted that Madrid have not made ‘a definitive decision’ on the future of Valverde and are ‘remaining cautious’",
      "While ‘there will be no drastic moves in January’, if Valverde gets back to his best by the end of the season, then Madrid will ‘close the door without hesitation’.",
      "This is not the first time in the Spanish media that rumours linking Valverde with Man Utd have emerged.",
      "In September, a report claimed that Man Utd were so keen on Valverde that they were ready to include Kobbie Mainoo in a deal.",
      "At the time, TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, noted that Valverde will not drop down a level and join Man Utd.",
      "Jones said on September 22: “There feels pretty much no chance Man Utd will sign Valverde – even as the noise grows that they want to.",
      "“That’s the message I’m getting from people close to the Spanish end of this story, and it’s not really surprising.",
      "“He’s been around the club for almost 10 years now and has become a brilliant, crucial and adaptable player for them.",
      "“There is no need for him to drop down a level to join Man Utd, and that’s truly what it would be.",
      "“His profile would be great for Man Utd, but it just seems too ambitious to me.",
      "“The clubs may be on a similar level in terms of global status, but Madrid’s current team is in a much better place than Man Utd’s, and he is a key part of it.”",
      "It is late November now, but it is hard to think that Valverde’s stance on a potential move to Man Utd has changed.",
      "Meanwhile, Man Utd are growing in ‘optimism’ about their chances of signing a Brazilian midfielder, whose club are now ready to sell him.",
      "A Man Utd defender is ready to leave Old Trafford despite having only just arrived at the Premier League club.",
      "And finally, sources have told TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, about the chances of Man Utd agreeing a new contract with Harry Maguire."

      "Manchester United’s redemption has taken Ruben Amorim out of immediate contention, with Vitor Pereira a clear frontrunner before Wolves decided to get rid.",
      "That put Nuno Espirito Santo and West Ham in clear and present danger of both seeking their third appointment of the season already, but he’s pulled off a couple of wins to ease those fears. Even Nottingham Forest have been a different beast under Sean Dyche, and it all leaves Daniel Farke under the harshest glare of the Sack Race spotlight.",
      "Meanwhile, here are possible replacement managers currently between jobs.",
      "",
      "An earlier version of this oft-updated piece speculated on what might happen to Mikel Arteta should Arsenal suffer from their Nightmare Start. What if they lost a few early games? What then? We concluded this:",
      "It’s far likelier that Arsenal emerge blinking into the autumn sunshine broadly unscathed from their nightmare horrors. No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",
      "Arsenal emerged duly unscathed, and have already cashed in on the shift to easier fixtures of their own alongside much tougher ones for Liverpool to take top spot in the Premier League.",
      "Only question that remains, therefore, is what Arsenal do from here. We are absolutely certain that it either involves p*ssing the league by 10 points or a complete and total meltdown. Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",
      "READ: Who will be the next manager of Arsenal if Mikel Arteta is sacked?",
      "",
      "A sacking remains out of the question despite last season’s (relative) struggles. There hasn’t been a Premier League manager since Fergie in his pomp with more credit in the bank than Pep.",
      "But is there still a distinct chance Guardiola decides he’s had enough and simply walks away? We reckon there is, and it’s always worth remembering that we’re talking Next Premier League Manager To Leave here, and that the traditional ‘Sack Race’ shorthand is a bit misleading.",
      "Still, though. Almost no chance at this point that any of that could happen swiftly enough for nobody else to have been canned first. Even if defeat at Newcastle does raise the serious prospect of a second consecutive season without a meaningful title challenge.",
      "",
      "One of the key early-season imponderables for 25/26 was just how big and what kind of impact the Club World Cup might have on the way Chelsea and Man City start the season. Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been three wins from three since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously second in the league.",
      "",
      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",
      "",
      "Among the least sackable managers in the top flight, and the only club we could really picture trying to lure him away this summer was Spurs and that’s now safely off the table.",
      "It was a difficult summer for Bournemouth but Iraola had masses of credit in the bank that can get him through things like getting inexplicably pumped 4-0 at goal-shy Villa without too much fuss.",
      "",
      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",
      "Still, though. Top six after 12 games is fine work whichever way you slice it.",
      "",
      "Won’t be sacked, obviously, because Palace are absolutely punching with an elite-level manager who is quietly delivering astonishing results in trying circumstances.",
      "But with reports he was willing and ready to walk out if Marc Guehi was sold without a replacement point to new strains on a relationship that is bound to be tested in the weeks and months ahead.",
      "Nailed it in the Community Shield, but as ever for clubs on Palace’s level there’s a positive-and-negative scale to be balanced by your manager catching the eye so conspicuously. Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",
      "We’d imagine the significant lowering of the threat level for a Ruben Amorim Sack at United has eased some nerves at Selhurst Park considerably.",
      "",
      "The continuity candidate in the summer, and looked to have received the ultimate hospital pass. How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",
      "With Newcastle added to Liverpool and Manchester United on the list of Gtech victims this season, it’s an undeniably impressive start in trying circumstances.",
      "",
      "Seven points from three games against Newcastle, Burnley and Bournemouth leave things looking far comfier than might have been expected for a manager who, when the Magpies took an early lead at the London Stadium, looked to be heading for a second sack of the season long before the Christmas decorations went up.",
      "",
      "Funny old season for Emery already. Began the campaign right at the outside of this market with your Artetas and – unlikely as it now sounds – Slots. Then jumped right up to third favourite when Villa’s rankling disappointment at how last season ended leaked into a six-match winless start to this campaign.",
      "But then along came four Premier League wins in a row to thoroughly lift the mood at a club where a few short weeks ago it really did feel like they’d come to the end of something special without ever getting the definitive moment of success it deserved.",
      "That run is now six wins in seven Premier League games and has lifted Villa right through the mid-table slop and up into the top four. Three wins in four have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",
      "We could all learn something from that, but we won’t.",
      "",
      "Sounds preposterous, but there really is a non-zero chance Moyes gets punished for easing Everton’s immediate relegation fears and they seek some more enterprising football from a squad that is, in fairness, capable of that. Does feel like a very familiar Everton story, though, and one that ends with them 16th, chastened, and bringing in another firefighter.",
      "We are treating the Brendan Rodgers links with mountains of salt.",
      "",
      "Just when you think the Sword of Damocles has been lifted, they are abject in defeat at home against 10-man Everton.",
      "",
      "Has done more than could ever have been expected given the chaos he walked into. That epic pants-pulling at Anfield surely leaves Dyche as safe as any manager ever can be in Mr Marinakis’ lair.",
      "",
      "A simply huge and wildly unexpected win over Manchester City. Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",
      "",
      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",
      "But for all the talk of an encouraging fight from the promoted teams this time around, two of the three now find themselves in the bottom three after a run of three straight defeats. And that quickly builds pressure.",
      "",
      "It is still early days and still too early to tell which way a vaguely-promising-but-not-flawless start eventually breaks for Frank and Spurs. But it’s starting to look likelier it breaks the wrong way for the manager.",
      "He arrived to a club and squad with an awful lot of mess to sort out at history’s funniest ever Champions League qualifiers. He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big London derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires. The fact almost no manager in Premier League history has managed to understand what this job requires is cold comfort at this time.",
      "READ: Ten reasons why it’s going wrong for Thomas Frank’s Spurs – and it’s going to get worse",
      "",
      "Backed in to a hot favourite as the whispers began before the international break. And it might be time to accept something is fundamentally broken here as a relegation fight bubbles up in what’s shaping up to be a really bad season to lose your mid-table mojo.",
      "Still think both club and manager would live to regret parting ways, but it’s a dicey time.",
      "",
      "Impossible to avoid the conclusion that Slot’s reaction to Liverpool’s mini-crisis becoming actual-crisis was poor. He went Full Klopp with his salty loser behaviour when Manchester United committed the crime of altering their tactics to give themselves the best chance of success against Liverpool, and the headloss continued after another chaotic and unstructured performance led to a 3-2 defeat at Brentford.",
      "Having ticked ‘opposition doing tactics wrong’ off his rattled manager bingo card, he can now add ‘losing his mind over entirely uncontroversial refereeing decisions’ with his response to both the Cody Gakpo non-penalty and Virgil van Dijk penalty at the Gtech.",
      "It has to be a worry for Liverpool that Slot has for the first time in his Anfield career found himself under any kind of pressure after a chastening run of defeats, and has suffered severe and instant headloss as a result.",
      "Funny to think of a manager who’s just beaten Real Madrid in the Champions League being under threat, but defeat at the Etihad was miserable before Nottingham Forest came along and achieved the amusing feat of being the first team to shut Liverpool out in the Premier League at Anfield since Nottingham Forest.",
      "Liverpool are now, hilariously but unacceptably, in the bottom half of the table only a few short months after completing a run of five straight wins to begin the season. They, and Slot, just look unbelievably rattled.",
      "And then there was a new nadir against PSV. That really was very, very bad.",
      "",
      "Surely doomed now, and the hard-nosed yet valid argument persists that Leeds could and perhaps should have taken drastic action in the summer. It would have made Spurs’ decision to sack Europa League-winning Ange Postecoglou look positively kind, Leeds – and Burnley for that matter – might now be better off had they thanked the managers who secured 100 Championship points and got them back into the big time and then sent them on their way.",
      "Farke had a dreadful Premier League record of only six wins and 26 points from his 49 games in charge of Norwich, a team he twice led to promotion from the Championship with 94 and 97 points.",
      "As well as fighting his own record in this competition, Farke faces the added burden of expectation levels very different to those at just about any other club that could possibly find itself promoted into the Premier League in this current era where that represents the most bittersweet of successes.",
      "Defeat at Burnley was honking, but bouncing back to win another six-pointer against West Ham eased the stress significantly before a paddling at Brighton and events elsewhere – including West Ham themselves – left Farke desperately short of immediate cover before a desperately poor show in a six-pointer at Nottingham Forest.",
      "Another painful defeat having gone in front, against Villa this time, sees Leeds drop into the bottom three ahead of a brutal run of games, with Man City and Chelsea next before some hope of respite against mid-table Liverpool.",
      "Could Unai Emery replace Arne Slot at Liverpool? The Mailbox reckons the Dutchman needs to fix his side’s most ‘baffling’ problem to save himself…",
      "Scholes has made his midfield ‘pick’ from three possible Man Utd signings and hit out at Ruben Amorim for the “most disappointing thing” he has done.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United chiefs are having ‘doubts’ about head coach Ruben Amorim as they prepare to block an ‘elite’ January signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are still backing Ruben Amorim as they are preparing to let eight players leave and make four priority signings.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are about to step up their efforts to keep three players set for the African Cup of Nations for an extra game.",
      "Ruben Amorim earned himself a little time with an unbeaten Manchester United run, but that defeat to Everton was rotten."

      "Vinicius Junior has informed Real Madrid president Florentino Perez that he is not of a mind to extend his Real Madrid contract beyond 2027 owing to his fraught relationship with manager Xabi Alonso.",
      "After shaking his head in disgust and muttering “always me, I’m leaving the team” after being substituted in the 72nd minute of El Clasico last month, his exit may in fact come sooner than that, with The Athletic revealing that tensions between Vinicius and Alonso ‘have only grown’ as the season’s gone on – ‘it is a topic of daily debate inside and outside the club.’",
      "The question Vinicius and his representatives must now be asking is which clubs in world football could offer the £150m likely required to sign him, at least match his £350,000-per-week wages and be comfortable with the reality of him having to be The Man at their club for fear of him throwing a hissy fit if that’s not the case.",
      "The smart money would be on the mad money coming from Saudi Arabia, but what about his Premier League options? We’ve ranked the Big Six on their chance of signing him.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham",
      "Oh to be a fly on the dressing room wall as Thomas Frank explains to Vinicius the importance of timing his runs to get on the end of long ball flick-ons that Richarlison never wins.",
      "“Can’t we play through the lines, gaffer?” Vinicius says, to suppressed chuckles from the Spurs masses.",
      "“No, but look at our stadium,” Frank replies.",
      "",
      "5) Chelsea",
      "A Brazilian front three at Stamford Bridge would be fun, but spending big on ready-made stars isn’t part of a Chelsea plan based largely upon resale value and the key difference between Vinicius, Joao Pedro and Estevao is the Blues pair’s outstanding work off the ball as well as on it.",
      "There’s also a very good and highly amusing possibility that the Blues hierarchy may deem Vinicius a bit too old for them. At 25 he would be the fifth-oldest player in the squad.",
      "Would be well worth it purely to see Vinicius’ reaction to teammate and compatriot Estevao winning the Ballon d’Or ahead of him.",
      "MAILBOX: Estevao touted as new Neymar as Maresca hailed for keeping him on a leash",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City",
      "“Vinicius is… wow,” was a Pep Guardiola press conference snippet that’s predictably been cited as evidence of the Manchester City manager’s interest in signing the Brazilian by some outlets.",
      "But it was midway through an answer on the excellence of Jeremy Doku and how “incredible” Liverpool right-back Conor Bradley endured a nightmare against him in the recent 3-0 City win over the Reds having coped very comfortably indeed with the problems posed by Vinicius a few days.",
      "Guardiola did say in that same press conference that Doku “will never be a top, top scorer” and City could really do with some goals from their forwards beyond Erling Haaland’s contribution that Vinicius would provide. It could happen under Guardiola, but strikes us as a far more post-Pep panic move from a state-owned football club looking to sell shirts as they suffer a legacy boss comedown.",
      "",
      "3) Liverpool",
      "It would very New Liverpool for Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards to look at their alarming issues in defence, their stunning dip in midfield dynamism and the general lack of cohesion in a squad on the back of signing £420m-worth of big-name talent and think the best fix to be signing a famously stroppy, high-maintenance winger to play on the left over someone to play on the opposite side to replace their in-situ stroppy, high-maintenance winger.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United",
      "Any teenager would think it mad that Vinicius Junior would even consider a move to Manchester United. Most of them won’t remember the last time they won the Premier League title in 2012 and will be relying on tales of their exasperating greatness from parents, grandparents or millennial friends and family in order to fathom why members of an Amazonic tribe are still wearing Nike AIG Cristiano Ronaldo No. 7 shirts.",
      "Vinicius would have just turned eight when Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez were leading the line for United in the 2008 Champions League final win over Chelsea. They weren’t just one of the biggest teams in world football then, they were actually one of the best. Chances are they would have been somewhere near the top of a Vini Jr dream football club list.",
      "Amid reports that a sponsor will ‘cover the cost’ of his transfer for Manchester United the immediate thought is that INEOS are doing things a bit differently to their predecessors. No whopping contracts for quick-fix superstars. Not buying British but buying British based at least; achieving some success in doing so with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "But we must never discount the nagging Manchester United need to occasionally prove to the world that they are indeed Manchester United and can still attract the very biggest names in football, even when they’re not what they need in any way and are actually quite likely to undo the slight and evidently brittle improvements they’ve made under Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "1) Arsenal",
      "It doesn’t reflect at all well on Vinicius that a team as impeccably well-drilled and brilliant as Arsenal has to be able to cope with having him in the team. While the quality he would provide in attack may not be enough to offset his lack of contribution in defence for others in the Premier League, Mikel Arteta’s side may just be at a stage in his ‘process’ where they can afford a defensive passenger who can make such a difference in the final third. They’re ready to ‘break the bank’ as ‘favourites’ to sign him.",
      "Riccardo Calafiori has looked very comfortable on that left side of defence for Arsenal and Declan Rice can always shift across and defend when necessary as an all-round midfield master.",
      "Leandro Trossard was given his dues in the form of people who haven’t given him his dues saying others haven’t given him his dues after his excellent performance against Tottenham, but let’s be absolutely clear, Arsenal are still very much in the market for a new left winger.",
      "And with eyes on the Champions League either on top of the Premier League in 2026 or after it in 2027, it would be useful to have a guy who’s won it twice and scored in both of those finals.",

      "Liverpool ‘could ask’ Jurgen Klopp to make a ‘dramatic return’ soon and sort out this Arne Slot mess after the German’s ’emphatic response’ to a slump.",

      "“I don’t think he is leaving because I don’t think the club can afford to let him go, but if he never gets minutes, he has to leave for his own sake,” Parker told MyBettingSites.",
      "“He must be feeling horrible at the moment, because he knows the manager has taken away his opportunity to go to the World Cup.",
      "“He must be furious at Amorim. He has to be. There is no chance of him going, and his name won’t even be mentioned.”",
      "Parker has also revealed that he is “worried about his future” as it would be a “very bad story” if he leaves.",

      "“I don’t think he would have made a massive difference at Man United at this moment in time, but you can’t have another one of those stories coming out.",
      "“It would be terrible if Mainoo leaves and all of a sudden does very well, because then everyone will question Amorim and the club.”",
      "“He is a player and a person I hope the best for. He is a wonderful young lad and his talent is immense. He is one of the best products that have come out of Man United for many years, so they have to find a way for him to get into the team and perform.”",
      "He added: “He is a massive talent. Does he always make a difference? Maybe not, but he hasn’t been given the time and you are only as good as the people you are surrounded by. I definitely worry about his future.”",

      "Barcelona decided to take a punt on Rashford after missing out on Nico Williams and Luis Diaz, while his versatility and return to form for Aston Villa last season were also in the forward’s favour.",
      "And Rashford has surpassed all expectations at Barcelona this season and has had a more prominent role than initially expected. He has six goals and nine assists in 17 appearances for the La Liga giants this term.",

      "This result leaves Barcelona 15th in the Champions League standings with two wins, one draw and two defeats, while they are second in La Liga after 13 matches.",
      "In recent months, the consensus has been that the Spanish side are increasingly likely to sign Rashford permanently as a £26m deal would be a bargain given his current form.",
      "But a report in Spain has taken the first opportunity to kick Rashford and Barcelona in a story that should be taken with a pinch of salt.",

      "‘The impact of these lapses extends far beyond the pitch. According to sources close to the club, Rashford has created tension in the dressing room, with some players feeling that the effort of others is not matched by the Briton’s attitude. Although he continues to receive playing time and opportunities, his image within Barça is being seriously damaged.’",

      "Hugo Ekitike? Not a back-up. Another Liverpool forward soon to be mentioned? Very much a back-up.",

      "But Ramsdale is also just an obviously good keeper whose career extremes have made it difficult to identify his true level. He might not be the Champions League-adjacent Premier League runner-up he became at Arsenal, yet he clearly isn’t the sort of player who should have been relegated in his last three seasons away from the Emirates.",

      "Mainoo has played 260 minutes all season, starting against only Grimsby in the League Cup, but the narrative has largely moved on. A starter for England in the Euro 2024 final will play no part in the conversation over the 2026 World Cup squad. Largely because he is apparently not as good as Manuel Ugarte.",

Then by the time he came back from six months at Nottingham Forest, it was Mauricio Pochettino calling the shots. A season and a half with Strasbourg later, Enzo Maresca was presiding over a quite ridiculous squad.",

      "Chiesa was initially omitted from the club’s Champions League squad and ranks fifth for the most Premier League minutes of any player yet to start a game in the competition this season. That is a list Mainoo tops ahead of Ethan Nwaneri, Omari Hutchinson and Vitaly Janelt, and not one a 28-year-old Italy international wishes to find himself on in a World Cup year.",

      "",
      "In his first 22 games of a half-season after he joined Manchester City in January, Marmoush scored eight goals and assisted three. Fourteen appearances have followed, in which he has both scored and assisted only once each.",
      "A player whose performances seemed to imply a level of talent able to embrace at least some of the burden placed on Erling Haaland’s shoulders has come to represent Manchester City’s collective impotence without the Nordic goalbot.",

      "United are doing better than they did last season. Indeed, they finished 15th in the Premier League, beating the eighth-placed finish the season prior for their worst in the competition.",
      "They have flirted with the top four this term – they’re currently 10th in the league but only three points off fourth-placed Aston Villa.",
      "While there’s been much-needed progress under Ruben Amorim, there are still some shortfalls. Casemiro’s resurgence in the midfield has been welcome, though he’s still not the most consistent performer, and he’s playing alongside Bruno Fernandes, who should be playing further up the field.",
      "Beyond that pair, Amorim does not seem massively fond of Manuel Ugarte or Kobbie Mainoo and could instead sign James Garner.",
      "Links with a number of star Premier League midfielders have surfaced in recent months, with it known that’s the area they’re likely to prioritise next.",
      "But the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba are unlikely in January as they’ll cost huge sums, and each will have a lot of interest in the summer.",
      "The links with Garner, as per talkSPORT, could mean for a welcome transfer for no fee at all. Garner is out of contract at Everton at the end of the season and Everton are said to be stepping up contract talks.",
      "But United, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa are all said to be keeping tabs on the situation, in case a renewal does not come to fruition.",
      "Should United land Garner, he’d be returning to the club he played his academy football for – where he was a star, but then played just seven times in the first team before being sold to Everton for just £15million.",
      "If United are able to bring him back on a free, they’d not have the embarrassment of paying a huge sum for a former academy player they let go, as was the case with Paul Pogba.",
      "Garner showed the Red Devils first hand his effectiveness as Everton beat them 1-0 on Monday night – the midfielder assisted the only goal of the game, while he also made three interceptions and one clearance, per SofaScore.",
      "United could certainly do worse than bringing the 24-year-old back, particularly if it’s for no fee.",
      "Liverpool spent more than £400m and have ended up with a Like A New Signing upstaging them all, while Carabao chances were taken at Brighton and Chelsea."

      "Manchester United may need to remodel their left side, especially if Ruben Amorim is sticking around, while two midfielders must be replaced…",
      "Much of Amorim’s first summer in charge at Old Trafford was spent trying to shift players he did not want or saw no future for. It will be a similar story next year if United are serious about a rebuild.",
      "As Amorim marks a year since his first game, here are five players who ought not to be around in 12 months…",
      "",
      "It has been a rough week for Shaw, who bore the brunt of Gary Neville’s frustration on Monday night.",
      "Neville, irked by United’s lack of intensity while chasing the game against Everton, might have been venting but he wasn’t wrong. Shaw was ‘ambling’.",
      "It is an apt description of the former England defender who seem to have become more and more one-paced since entering his 30s. His defending can be passive and though he doesn’t get the same opportunities to bomb on as part of a back three as he might as a wing-back or full-back, you would have to question if Shaw is still capable of that.",
      "At least he is available. He has started all 12 games, compared to just 16 starts over the previous two seasons. Only once in the last four seasons has he started more than half of United’s Premier League games.",
      "Next summer, Shaw will have turned 31 and be entering the final year of a contract that makes him joint fifth among United’s highest earners. Those numbers don’t add up when it comes to INEOSonomics. They already decided the last one was a mistake in 2023.",
      "",
      "We have all held our hands up and admitted we were wrong to write off Casemiro. Some did so more forcefully, disrespectfully than others. This season, the Brazilian has once more become one of United’s most important players.",
      "It is safe to assume, though, that there is little longevity in that status. He will be 34 in February and in the last four months of his massive contract at Old Trafford.",
      "If INEOS were p*ssed about Shaw’s contract, Casemiro’s terms left Sir Jim Ratcliffe apoplectic. The Brazilian is the highest earner at the club, on a salary it is hard to envisage United ever offering again on Ratcliffe’s watch.",
      "More to the point, United desperately need a top-class central midfielder, maybe two. If Casemiro is still the first-choice no.6 next season, we know something has gone terribly wrong with their recruitment.",
      "",
      "Speaking of terrible recruitment…",
      "Ugarte, unfortunately, is damned by Scott McTominay’s stunning success at Napoli. United sold the Ballon d’Or nominee and put that money towards the £50million sent PSG’s way – presumably, much to their astonishment – in an effort to replace Casemiro.",
      "It is perhaps an unfair comparison, but hard to ignore given the trajectories of the two midfielders. McTominay has made himself one of Europe’s most wanted; Ugarte can’t get a game for a team in dire need of his supposed profile.",
      "It takes time to adapt to the Premier League, but it’s been almost a season and a half now. This was the season he needed to step up. And Ugarte looks further away than he ever did.",
      "Having worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, it was thought that Ugarte would be one of the main beneficiaries of the manager’s appointment. But Amorim has been left stunned at the difference in player he bossed at Sporting Lisbon compared to the one who sits on his bench. “He is struggling in the moment,” said Amorim. “He needs to improve, especially in training.” That last part is damning indeed.",
      "Alarm bells were ringing immediately after United signed Zirkzee when no one could really identify what he was. When the question was put to the man himself he admitted that he was neither a no.9 nor a no.10. “I am what I call a false striker. Not a No 9, not a No 10. I am a 9.5.”",
      "It is bad enough when United sign players for positions that are not a priority, but signing a player in a position that does not actually exist was a new low.",
      "So it can come as no surprise that Zirkzee has struggled to adapt. A year after his arrival, United felt it necessary to buy a whole new strikeforce, which left the Netherlands forward in no doubt over his prospects.",
      "Injuries to Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha gave Zirkzee an opportunity to lead Amorim’s line against Everton. “He did alright,” said Amorim, damning the 24-year-old with the faintest of praise. It is not an opportunity he is likely to get again any time soon, assuming Cunha is back for the trip to Palace on Sunday.",
      "",
      "All we’re prepared to commit to here is that if United are to persist with wing-backs, they need a new one for the left flank.",
      "Neville effectively wrote off the entire left side as an attacking threat against Everton, and he wasn’t wrong. Which makes the looming AFCON all the more worrying for United since they will lose Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo, the two players that make their right side so much more potent.",
      "On the opposite side, Amorim seems to favour Dorgu but it’s a close-run thing since neither the Dane nor Dalot have been able to pin down the role as their own.",
      "That’s maybe more understandable in Dalot’s case since he is right-sided. Even if he starts high and wide – not his natural habitat – he is only ever going to drive inside into traffic. Dalot’s versatility has come in useful for numerous managers now since Jose Mourinho signed him while telling the world the Portuguese could be United’s right-back for 10 years. Almost eight years later, he’s not that.",
      "Dorgu, 21, is still a relative rookie having joined United from Parma less than a year ago. But in that time, in 32 appearances, he has as many red cards as assists (one) and no goals.",
      "Beyond the numbers, it is hard to recall any contribution of note. Just a run, a cross, a shot. Anyone?",
      "Dorgu seemed a strange signing given he was a relative rookie and the importance of wing-backs in Amorim’s system. Already, they need another.",
      "Are Liverpool about to sack Arne Slot? They actually really might be after that absolute sh*t-show against PSV.",
      "Three of the last four Ballon d’Or winners have been first-time champions. This five will be the next to follow your Benzemas, your Rodris and your Dembeles.",
      "Manchester City are using their women’s stadium to power an academy which has already developed Foden, O’Reilly and Lewis, with sustainability at the core.",
      "Liverpool ‘could ask’ Jurgen Klopp to make a ‘dramatic return’ soon and sort out this Arne Slot mess after the German’s ’emphatic response’ to a slump.",
      "Arne Slot needs to try something different to help a Liverpool side clearly missing Trent Alexander-Arnold. But grief apparently cannot be used as an excuse.",
      "Is the title race over before the Christmas decorations go up if Arsenal win at Chelsea? And what next for Liverpool and Spurs? It’s a Big Weekend, all right."

      "Friday 28 November 2025 16:38, UK",
      "Ruben Amorim says Manchester United need another attacking wing-back like Amad Diallo to become better playing in his system.",
      "The United boss came under fire for refusing to adapt in Monday's dismal defeat to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford, bringing his 3-4-2-1 formation back into the spotlight ahead of Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace, who have enjoyed success playing in the same shape.",
      "Amorim, chasing a goal against Everton after Idrissa Gueye's red card, replaced left wing-back Patrick Dorgu with Diogo Dalot, naturally a full-back, in a like-for-like change that left United devoid of any attacking threat down that side.",
      "Palace's attack-minded wing-backs, Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell, have been a cornerstone of Oliver Glasner's success, while United only have Amad Diallo in that mould and Amorim admits that will have to change for the team to improve.",
      "Asked if wing-back is an area he wants to strengthen, Amorim said: \"We need time to improve the characteristics of the team. I've said that over the last year.",
      "\"To give an example, in the last game [against Everton], we should have an Amad with the right foot to put on the other side to play against 10 men.",
      "\"It is these characteristics that in time we will try to get to be a better team. If we are the perfect set-up to play in this way, not yet. But like any team, we need time to put the right characteristics into every position.\"",
      "The United boss dismissed direct comparisons with Palace ahead of Sunday's game but acknowledged Glasner's side are outperforming them at the moment as they sit in 10th.",
      "Although Palace are fifth in the table, they are only two points better off than United, who could go above them with a win at Selhust Park.",
      "\"We play in a different way. You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",
      "Palace possess a top wing-back in Daniel Munoz, and the Colombia international has previously spoken of his desire to play for Manchester United.",
      "Speaking earlier this month to AS, he said: \"I think there's a lot of talk about one club or another. For me, it would be a dream to play for one of those clubs, whether it's Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester United.",
      "\"I think I'm working towards that; every day I give it my all so that maybe one day I can catch the attention of these clubs.",
      "\"Right now, I'm focused on my club, on doing things well at Crystal Palace. I'm not really aware of what's being said; I don't have any information about whether these teams want me or are interested in me.",
      "\"We'll see when the winter transfer window approaches.\"",
      "Glasner defended Amorim's system ahead of the game and said he had seen an improvement in United this season.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front. Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Amorim admits he would have preferred to bring on a more attacking alternative to Dalot at Everton with no other options available on his bench, but stuck with the same shape nonetheless.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he said. \"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Luke Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "At Sporting, Amorim's wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table? It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Friday 28 November 2025 08:06, UK",
      "Just when there was a bit of momentum at Manchester United, and doubts about Ruben Amorim's much-maligned formation were vanishing - then came the loss to Everton.",
      "It was a game that put the Amorim project back to square one in terms of how much faith there is in this specific era. Gary Neville said the complacency shown by United will erode confidence in the team - but there was just as much criticism about the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Despite playing over 75 minutes with an extra player after Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Amorim chose to stick with his preferred formation - keeping three centre-backs and two wing-backs on the pitch.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" asked Neville, while Jamie Carragher added: \"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that. You don't need three [centre-backs] there.\"",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Crystal Palace, where Oliver Glasner has made a success of that 3-4-2-1 formation. The Eagles sit in the top five - where United want to be - having won a trophy via the FA Cup, which has eluded Amorim in his year in charge thus far.",
      "Glasner's formation has even survived the departures of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, highlighting how the system thrives on more than a few top-level players - it is a collective structure that works. How United need that at the moment.",
      "\"We have found a system where we are very balanced, where we can threaten the opposition goal and also be very consistent in our defence,\" said Glasner last month. \"That's why we stick to it.\"",
      "So why does it bring success for Palace, but less so for Man Utd? Using the Palace boss' own words, we take a look at Glasner's formation from back to front.",
      "The back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi have marshalled things brilliantly in front of Dean Henderson - one of the statistically best goalkeepers in the division.",
      "Palace have the Premier League's second-best defence in terms of goals conceded - and are one of only two backlines to let in a single-digit goal tally after a dozen Premier League games. The other team is league leaders Arsenal.",
      "The central areas are the most important part of the pitch for Glasner, as it is the most vulnerable area for any side. \"The centre determines the game. It starts with the back three - you're talking about the core,\" he says.",
      "One of the reasons three centre-backs is a good system in the modern Premier League era is the way wide centre-backs protect the 'half space'.",
      "It is the area where most dangerous attacks emerge from via defence-breaking passes or runs - these areas are also described as the 'pockets'.",
      "As Glasner says: \"The half runs, which is where most of the assists are coming from, in defence you have to protect these areas.\" And Palace appear to have the right profiles in those centre-back positions.",
      "No Premier League defender has more interceptions this season than both Richards and Lacroix, while only six defenders have won more possession in the defensive third this season than Palace captain Guehi.",
      "Even Neville spoke about the importance of positioning the three centre-backs on Monday night against Everton. \"Matthijs de Ligt is much more dominant and certain in that central role,\" he said. \"When Harry Maguire plays, De Ligt goes into the right channel where he gets caught out and doesn't look comfortable.\"",
      "Palace have perfected their back three, but on the basis of recent displays, United need a bit more work.",
      "The four in Palace's midfield are divided into two areas: the wing-backs and the two sitting midfielders.",
      "The flying wing-backs of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell are critical to this Palace team because of the intensity they bring.",
      "Munoz is the most intense player in the Premier League, clocking nearly 14.5km per game at high intensity this season - nearly 1.5km more than the next-best player.",
      "It is not a singular thing to Munoz, it is part of Glasner's instructions. That's because Mitchell, on the opposite flank, sits fifth for current Premier League players in the same metric. Palace are the only team in the Premier League with two players in the top dozen top-flight players in this category.",
      "What is more striking is how Palace's wing-backs compare to Man Utd's wing-backs. For example, Munoz runs further per game at high intensity than Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai combined.",
      "Meanwhile, Mitchell is streets clear of what United's left-wing-back options, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, produce.",
      "Then comes the importance of the two sitting midfielders - rotated between Adam Wharton, Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma - who set the tone for Palace's play.",
      "\"The central midfielders, we call them the quarter-backs,\" says Glasner. \"They are responsible for the speed of our attacks, if we go forward or keep possession. So they are important.\"",
      "Palace and United's midfield set-up is similar. In Wharton, the Eagles have their own version of Bruno Fernandes - a player who sits and tries to break the opposition's lines.",
      "\"That's why the manager wants me there,\" said Man Utd captain Fernandes on Monday night. \"To have more of the ball and control the tempo of the team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] knows I can run a lot, press high and get my body back there when we need to get to the box and defend.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the other sitting midfielder - Kamada for Palace or Casemiro at Man Utd - sits and shares defensive duties with the other player.",
      "For Palace, the system works defensively as well as offensively. Kamada sits in the top five midfielders this season for tackles won per 90, with a slightly better record than Chelsea's Moises Caicedo.",
      "But for United, how Casemiro and Fernandes cope in midfield as a two has been much-maligned. They were cut wide open at times against Everton on Monday, with Gueye showing signs of frailty within the opening minutes.",
      "But even after the Everton midfielder's red card, the Toffees still had joy playing around United's midfield two - with the winning goal coming from direct passing through the middle of the pitch.",
      "But it is not just Palace's sitting midfielders who play Glasner's side progress the ball centrally - the two No 10s also help to create overloads in the most important area of the pitch.",
      "\"We try to play with the two No 10s narrow, with the striker - so we can maybe have eight players in the centre to combine together,\" says Glasner. Those eight players being three centre-backs, two sitting midfielders, two attacking midfielders and one striker.",
      "\"You can't pass with one touch if players are 30 or 40 yards away from each other in the distances,\" Glasner added. \"You need connections on the pitch.\"",
      "The two No 10s, normally Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino in this Palace team, are helping them to break through the middle of the pitch by creating a four-man box with the sitting midfielders. No matter if you face a team with two or three in midfield, you will always have an overload.",
      "But they also assist in pinning opposition teams back. \"Some teams mark our No 10s with their No 6s [defensive midfielders] - so they're pretty much playing with a back six,\" says Glasner.",
      "If a busy striker like Jean-Philippe Mateta can occupy multiple centre-backs at once - as he tends to do - then the two No 10s need to be marked by midfielders. If they aren't, the likes of Sarr and Pino have more space.",
      "All those eight players being central can create a very congested area in the middle of the park, but Glasner has plans for that. \"If the opposition closes the middle, then somebody can drop out and you can overload the wing,\" he says.",
      "Palace's front three is a perfect system set up by the right profiles. \"You need pocket players, you need runners - the mix makes it,\" he says. The pocket players are Sarr and Pino, the runners are Munoz and Mitchell.",
      "It allows Mateta to do what he does best - be physical and hold the ball up. Mateta ranks top for the number of hold-ups in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"You need the right players for it,\" says Glasner about his attack. \"You can't ask all the players making runs in behind if they are used to playing in the pockets.\"",
      "United tried to address these forward areas in the transfer window, forking out big fees for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They fit the United structure in places, as has been seen this season in bright attacking moments. But any injuries - such as Cunha and Sesko's this past week - and there are holes. And they are holes that Palace do not seem to have."

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and sees Newcastle slipping up on the road again at Everton.",
      "To have picked up 13 points from a possible 18 at home despite facing a tough fixture list of Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Aston Villa is an excellent barometer of the work Keith Andrews is doing at Brentford. There's been no ripping up of the tactical blueprint. No reinventing of any wheels. Just smart coaching and decision making that is utilising their strengths.",
      "Meanwhile, there's good intent, plenty of promise, lots of neat build-up at Burnley, but when the big moments come, the Clarets too often are brushed aside. Over 2.5 goals has landed in every one of their six away days so adding that line to a Brentford win results in a 5/4 shot to attack with Sky Bet.",
      "When a price looks wrong, it's usually because the market has failed to adapt to a change in circumstances. And in Rayan Cherki's case, the assumption is that the Premier League will treat him the same way Ligue 1 did when it comes to being fouled.",
      "The algorithms that price the \"fouls won\" markets are still feeding on French data, where he averaged 1.4 last season - it's a figure that is on the rise. He's been fouled two or more times in three of his four starts for City, where he is picking up the ball in the heart of the midfield battle, to an average of 1.9 fouls per 90. The 7/4 with Sky Bet for him to be fouled twice again is a lovely chunk of value.",
      "Sometimes the numbers don't whisper, they scream at you - and Bournemouth's away data is doing a full-blown fire alarm routine when it comes to backing goals in this encounter.",
      "Let's start with the headline stat: 3.85 goals per game in the last 20 Bournemouth's away fixtures.",
      "That isn't a trend, that's a lifestyle choice from Andoni Iraola, whose philosophy of how to play the game mirrors that chunky goal return. And when 18 of those 20 games on the road have sailed over 2.5 goals, you can stop calling it variance and start calling it what it is: a profitable betting theory when the prices are right.",
      "You don't hit overs in 18 of 20 by accident. Jump on the over 2.5 at 10/11 with Sky Bet. It's the bet of the weekend.",
      "Newcastle are about as reliable away from home as a toddler walking past a puddle.",
      "Dating back to last season, Newcastle have no win in eight Premier League away games - their worst run since December 2021 - and across all competitions they have lost four on the spin away from home sweet St James' Park.",
      "The energy, the press, the sharpness, everything that has made Eddie Howe's team a Premier League force, all goes down a gear on their travels. They have looked leggy, stretched and noticeably flatter in defeats at West Ham and Brentford of late.",
      "And, this game is of course their third game in eight days, too. Everton will be licking their lips.",
      "Newcastle away from home have a problem and Everton at home are a problem for them - just like Brentford and West Ham were - and the price hasn't quite caught up that fact. The 7/4 on offer from Sky Bet for a home win looks the smart play.",
      "Fulham to have 13 or more shots at 10/11 with Sky Bet has got my attention. Spurs are facing 12.7 shots per game this season. That's a marker of a team who are struggling to dominate territory and one which is happy to soak up pressure.",
      "And the teams clearing the 13-shot bar aren't exactly a who's who of juggernauts. Burnley, Bournemouth, Bodø/Glimt, Monaco and Leeds have all walked into Spurs matches and hit the magic 13 or more number.",
      "Also, Cristian Romero's suspension bodes well for a Fulham shots play.",
      "From a 23-game sample in the Premier League, Tottenham concede almost five more shots per match without their influential defender. A huge number. That's not a wobble, that's a structural collapse - one that Fulham can exploit on their way to a victory.",
      "Strip the names away, hide the crests and if this was Team A hosting Team B then Crystal Palace would be odds-on.",
      "Because every measurable facet of Palace's game carries more structure, coherence and repeatability than anything Manchester United are serving up right now. This is why the 13/10 on offer for a Palace home win is dripping in value.",
      "This isn't about history. It's about now. And right now, United play football that resembles a flickering lightbulb: occasionally bright but one bad moment away from plunging a room into darkness.",
      "Palace, under Oliver Glasner, are the opposite. They look like a team. A functioning one. A confident one. A side that knows how to create, how to control.",
      "You're getting a fantastic price here on a better-drilled side, the clearer identity, the team whose game has weight and repeatability, not a historical brand propped up by recreational money in the markets. Home win.",
      "The value doesn't live in the traditional markets here as Aston Villa are rightly dominating across the board - it's hiding where Wolves under Rob Edwards are on the improve and that's their set piece output. His teams work set plays meticulously.",
      "His Luton team ranked as the best team in the Championship from set piece goals scored and expected goals output in both spells in that league while his Forest Green side ranked second for expected goals from set pieces during their promotion from League Two.",
      "We've already seen signs in one game that Wolves are taking set pieces more seriously after creating 0.77 worth of expected goals from those scenarios in the defeat to Crystal Palace. Ladislav Krejci, who has had 10 shots in his last 10 games, was the main threat and first contact from corners last weekend. He looks a tasty bet at 12/1 with Sky Bet to score.",
      "If there's one thing betting teaches you, it's that bad beats are difficult to stomach no matter how long you've been in this game for. And last week's angle, Brentford on the double chance at Brighton - still lingers like a stubborn hangover. The logic was right, the bet looked to be cashing, right up until those football gods decided that Brentford would throw away a 1-0 lead with 10 minutes to go and Igor Thiago would miss a penalty with the final kick.",
      "But here we are again, staring at a very familiar setup. And, yes, I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct, who turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 34 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only two of 16 games otherwise. Forest played 26 per cent of passes long vs Liverpool last week and a similar approach puts them in a great spot of getting another result with the 10/11 on the draw no bet standing out.",
      "Virgil van Dijk has made nine fouls in his last five games. The imperious, sometimes untouchable defender has gone missing and been replaced by a far scruffier version that is making more mistakes and committing more fouls.",
      "It took 11 games for Van Dijk to reach five fouls at the start of last season - now it looks like he can make five in one game.",
      "That player who glided through matches without needing to lay a glove on anyone is suddenly hacking, grabbing and stepping into late challenges like a man trying to put out fires with a watering can. Playing next to Ibrahima Konate can do that to a player.",
      "His direct opponent Callum Wilson is clever at tempting defenders into awkward contact and picking up soft fouls. Go back two seasons ago and Wilson was drawing 1.6 fouls per 90 in the Premier League and has won five fouls in four starts under Nuno Espirito Santo, who seems to trust him now to be the focal point.",
      "The price of 11/2 with Sky Bet for Van Dijk to make at least two fouls is massive - best price of the season territory. Take the value before the market catches up.",
      "This game stinks of caution.",
      "Those anticipating that one of these teams are going to play \"statement-making football\" could end up disappointed as these games can turn into an exercise in risk management, especially when you consider the hectic schedule both teams are facing at the moment.",
      "Enzo Maresca and Mikel Arteta are cut from the same cloth when it comes to control and not taking unnecessary risks, especially Arteta in these types of games away from home. Last season, Arsenal won just once away in their eight games with top nine opposition, drawing five of those matches. They've been beaten at Anfield this season and came through in gritty fashion at Newcastle in a very nip-and-tuck encounter.",
      "Arteta plays these games like a draw is just fine in the grand scheme of things - and he's not wrong.",
      "Both teams know that a point keeps the narrative intact. Nothing is lost, everything remains possible. The stalemate, the bet no one wants to back, is the shrewdest way to approach the outright market with 21/10 on offer with Sky Bet."

      "Scholes did it all in the middle of the park. He partnered the greats in a traditional 4-4-2, spent a spell as a shadow striker and in the latter days, relied on a superior reading of the game to drop into a deeper role.",
      "While his career spanned over nearly two decades, it was an era that rarely referred to the number like today, instead, characteristics and traits defined your position.",
      "\"I go back to Brian Robson, Roy Keane, Nicky Butts, [they] are capable of doing everything,\" Scholes says, reeling off names cast into United's successes of the past.",
      "\"You have to be capable of doing that. The game's changed. There's a holding midfield player, there's maybe two attacking midfield players.\"",
      "Perhaps United's issue is that the club lack the all-rounders Scholes is eulogising about. Have the discernible roles harmed United's midfield? Or will United be able to find a happy medium?",
      "\"I think it [the Man Utd midfield] has got better. Casemiro's been really good this season.",
      "\"Are you going to win the league with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in a central midfield partnership? I'm not too sure, it still seems a little bit away from that. But on the whole, the midfield has looked a little bit better.\"",
      "But while marginal improvements are evident, United's midfield seemingly feels aeons away from what it needs to be to close the proverbial gap on the league challengers. Is the answer closer to home?",
      "Kobbie Mainoo emerged as a key player for Erik ten Hag when he made his debut in 2023. That 'Everton debut' that fans reminisce about didn't see him deployed as a No 10, nor as a No 8. Instead, an 18-year-old Mainoo was United's deepest midfielder when he impressed.",
      "An England debut followed in the summer, where at the 2024 European Championship, England's performances improved when Mainoo started alongside Rice as a No 8 as the competition drew on.",
      "Mainoo started the Euro final for England but just two camps later, found himself hurled into the shadows as Rice's partner gained new suitors. Now 20, Mainoo is now on the periphery of United's first team plans, yet to start a Premier League game this season. It's the apparent stunting of a talent that hits Scholes personally.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he's not played. You could expect that.",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team,\" Scholes admits.",
      "\"We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it's not quite happened for him. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with.",
      "\"I think he's dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "\"As I'm frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don't have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] possibly doesn't trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn't the most physical, but he's streetwise. He knows the position, he's done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he's got that experience.",
      "\"Kobbie hasn't quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he's going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don't do that.\"",
      "\"They've got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he's got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "\"I think he's clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn't seem to think he's the answer at the minute.\"",
      "Unfortunately, United don't have two Fernandeses. Much to the delight of Premier League officials. So United's problems remain. How have United both unsuccessfully and to some avail solved their conundrums in the past? A flashy new toy, a transfer for fans to enjoy for as long as they feel they are performing.",
      "So if given the choice, who would one of United's most esteemed performers choose as the club's midfield saviour?",
      "\"I think all three of them are really good players. Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they?",
      "\"But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure.",
      "\"Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford's a big pitch. It's a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "\"I'd say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don't like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "\"He's come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I'd like to see all three of them.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days.",
      "\"I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.",
      "\"Baleba's got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It's close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I'd just pick Wharton.\"",
      "Hypotheticals were something Scholes rarely dealt in as a player. A fully functioning midfield was part of the furniture for many years at Old Trafford. Unfortunately for him, his ideal United midfield man remains just an if, but and a maybe.",
      "One thing is for certain, though, United will continue the season, waiting for the midfielder that \"can do everything\".",

      "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner has come to the defence of Ruben Amorim's infamous system but highlights the key difference in his side.",
      "Glasner uses the same 3-4-2-1 formation as Amorim, yet Palace sit fifth in the Premier League heading into the weekend after an impressive start to their season.",
      "Meanwhile, following a dismal display and result against 10-man Everton, United have slumped to 10th in the league having gone three games without a victory, with Gary Neville among the critics over Amorim's approach.",
      "Palace welcome Amorim's side to Selhurst Park on Sunday, having beaten United on three of the last four occasions. It's a run against United that included a 2-0 win at Old Trafford last season when a Jean-Philippe Mateta brace sunk Amorim's side.",
      "Despite United's poor recent form and a staunch critique of Amorim's formation, Glasner has pointed to the underlying numbers to defend the United boss.",
      "\"It's really funny talking about the 3-4-3 system, and I think United have the highest xG in the Premier League for scoring goals,\" Glasner said.",
      "\"Their team has changed. Especially in attack. They needed more goals and they invested £200m, buying three players up front.",
      "\"Also, now they have players who can play very intense like [Bryan] Mbeumo.",
      "\"For me, it's impressive to see. We compared it [their last meeting] to where they are now. I think their work-rate is much higher than it was last year and then they get the reward.\"",
      "Palace also rank among the top clubs for expected goals this season, however, Glasner suggests his deployment of the 3-4-3 formation allows his side to defend better, with the Eagles second only to Arsenal with the fewest goals conceded.",
      "\"We're playing the same system,\" Glasner added.",
      "\"So it looks like it's a good attacking system. Also, as we show it, you can have a very good defensive structure with it.",
      "\"So it's all about what you do with the system and how fluid you are in attack and how creative you are. I'm really looking forward to the game.\"",
      "While the formation is the same, Amorim believes the two interpretations are different. United's Portuguese boss admitted that Palace are better at performing their system.",
      "\"We play in a different way,\" Amorim said.",
      "\"You can understand that by data. It is hard to explain everything. They are a different club and they are doing things better than us. That is quite simple.",
      "\"You don't say that all 4-3-3 teams play in the same way. We play in a different moment, we defend in a different space, we attack in a different way. They are just doing things better than us.\"",
      "Asked if he is inspired by Glasner, Amorim added: \"I played against him in Frankfurt with Sporting, so I know the players. I take inspiration from everyone. When I take two weeks for an international break, I watch all the managers and try to take all the inspiration I can.",
      "\"I have six years as a professional manager, so I am always trying to learn.\"",
