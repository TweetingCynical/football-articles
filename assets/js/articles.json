      "Brentford have told Manchester United to cough up at least £60million for Bryan Mbeumo, who Newcastle have cooled their interest in. Mbeumo, 25, has indicated that he wants to sign for the Red Devils, despite their lack of European football next season.",
      "The Cameroon international soared to the top of United's wish-list after a 20-goal season in the Premier League with Brentford. Mbeumo enjoyed his most productive campaign to date, also registering eight assists.",
      "Now the forward is in the final 12 months of his contract, having spent the last six years with the Bees. Although Brentford have the option to extend his deal until 2026, they accept that he can leave and United are confident that a deal will be done.",
      "But Thomas Frank's side won't let him go on the cheap. The Times report that Brentford will demand at least £60m for his services, a club-record fee.",
      "Talks between United and the Brentford hierarchy are set to commence, with Newcastle no longer as big of threat after they deemed him too expensive - but not because of the fee. The Magpies were regularly linked with Mbeumo throughout the season, as Eddie Howe plans to recruit a winger.",
      "The Chronicle explain that Newcastle were willing to negotiate a fee north of £50m with Brentford but Mbuemo's wage demands, coupled with his desire to join United, have left Howe looking at alternative targets. The 25-year-old's representatives had told potential suitors, including Arsenal and Tottenham, that he wanted to more than quadruple his current £45,000-a-week wages.",
      "Those demands are said to have raised eyebrows at St James' Park, as Newcastle cooled their interest alongside the north London duo. The Magpies don't want to break their existing wage structure, despite having additional funds thanks to qualifying for the Champions League.",
      "United, on the other hand, were willing to bend to Mbeumo's wishes, with their efforts to sign him described as frantic. The French-born attacker is expected to earn upwards of £180,000 if he completes a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Brentford aren't standing in his way but they've got their own demands. Frank suggested as much after the Bees' last game of the season. \"It is clear that if he is to be sold, it must be for a nice, nice amount,\" the Brentford manager said.",
      "\"It is a lot. Mucho. Really a lot. \"How many wingers score 20 goals for a mid-table club? And then with seven assists plus his work ethic. And his character. All these things mean that he has a lot, so he is a good player.\""

      "There's hardly a Manchester United fan out there who isn't aware of the value Bruno Fernandes adds on the pitch. But while the focus of much of the attention around him concerns his level of performance, many might be unaware of the morals he promotes away from the field.",
      "With Ruben Amorim's side failing to secure a place in Europe for next season, speculation has been rife that Fernandes could head for the exit. Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal have been fervently linked with the player's signature, not to mention they possess the funds to at least tempt United into a sale.",
      "But the Portuguese has decided to reject a move to Saudi Arabia, seemingly committing to Old Trafford, although rumours about his future are likely to continue until the transfer window slams shut at the end of the window.",
      "Fernandes, who turns 31 in September, is the captain at United but previously attracted criticism for his method of leadership. United icon Roy Keane infamously referred to the current squad as \"f***ing imposters\" in February and lumped much of the blame at Fernandes' feet for not coaxing more from his team-mates.",
      "Former Red Devils manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer saw a different side of the player, however. And it wasn't long after Fernandes' arrival at Old Trafford in 2020 that he gave an anecdote revealing the grounded, humble approach of a player that set him apart.",
      "\"It was off the field as well as in training,\" said Solskjaer on the High Performance Podcast back in July of that year. \"He demands off me. He demands off his team-mates.",
      "\"The first day he was in the club, he shook everyone's hand. He didn't come in here thinking, 'I'm the big shot.' No, he shook absolutely every staff members' hand.\"",
      "It's testament to a player who had just completed a £67million transfer to one of the biggest clubs in the world. Needless to say many would not and do not behave with such modesty in similar positions.",
      "Fernandes' qualities on match days are undeniable, as his award for United's Player of the Season this term will attest. He has also won the Premier League's Player of the Month award on five occasions, just two fewer than record-holder Sergio Aguero, who played in England for a decade compared to Fernandes' five-and-a-half seasons thus far.",
      "In the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, great talents have come and gone at United, some with only disappointment to show for their efforts. But signing those with true grit and the kind of intangibles Fernandes often exhibits has proved more rare.",
      "One could argue seeing those leadership qualities leave would be even more damaging than losing Fernandes' on-ball ability. Genuine fighters are seemingly few and far between at Old Trafford right now, and the Portugal ace is likely the best example in the current squad.",
      "In the event Fernandes does leave this summer, his new club will be gaining a paragon of professionalism, as well as an elite footballer. And as United's transfer history over the past decade and more goes to show, that's something money can't always buy."

      "The French-born forward made the switch to London in 2019, with the Bees signing him for a then-club record fee of £5.8million. Mbeumo hit the ground running, scoring 16 goals in his first campaign as they were thwarted in the Championship play-off final by Fulham.",
      "Redemption would be had 12 months later when Brentford were promoted to the Premier League by way of the play-offs, and the winger came on leaps and bounds in the top flight, going from wing-back to talismanic winger.",
      "With marksman Ivan Toney departing ahead of the 2024/25 season, Mbeumo stepped up to assume a starring role, and his 20 Premier League goals have caused a string of suitors to surround him as the summer window opens.",
      "It has been suggested that the Red Devils are the party who have taken Mbeumo's fancy, and his manager Frank has previously opened up about the impressive work rate and commitment that will be arriving at Old Trafford should a deal be completed.",
      "According to The Athletic, Mbeumo has decided that United are the team he wishes to join this summer, with Arsenal, Newcastle and Tottenham all interested. Talks are now expected to open between Brentford and the Red Devils, as the 25-year-old looks set to bring his goal-scoring prowess to Manchester should he get his way.",

      "Praise for Mbeumo has long been offered up by the Danish manager, who, the year prior, with Brentford still in their Premier League infancy, lauded the forward's brilliance.",
      "\"It's brilliant, I must say,\" admitted Frank, speaking after a Mbeumo hat-trick gave his side a 4-1 FA Cup win away at Port Vale. \"He's been brilliant for us this year in the Premier League.",

      "Manchester United can’t lose amid the Bruno Fernandes transfer saga, according to Gary Neville. The Portuguese playmaker’s future has been up in the air since he conceded after the Europa League final defeat to Spurs that he could be offloaded this summer, despite being United's standout player during an abject campaign.",
      "Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal have been pushing to sign Fernandes ahead of the Club World Cup. The playmaker was reportedly seriously considering accepting a £700,000 per week deal. Al-Hilal were also said to be prepared to pay up to £100million for the 30-year-old, cash that could have been ploughed into the much-needed revamp of the squad.",
      "However, according to fresh reports, Fernandes has rejected Al-Hilal’s interest and looks set to remain at Old Trafford, having consulted with his family.",
      "Neville said: “I’m torn on this one because if the £100million fee is right and United get that, I don’t think it’s a bad fee. In fact, I think it’s a great fee for someone at that age. United have had great years out of him. But I also think, if he stays, [he’s saying] ‘No, I want fight this out and turn it around’. I also think that’s a great thing as well.",
      "“So I’m 50-50 in what I think about it. The £100million United need to rebuild the squad. On the other hand, they need players with personality and quality, and they haven’t got that many. In fact, he’s the only one they’ve got. For me, it's a no-lose situation.”",
      "Fernandes captained United as they rounded off their post-season trip to Asia with a 3-1 friendly win against Hong Kong. Asked whether that might have been Fernandes’ last appearance for the club, Amorim said: “I don’t think so.",
      "“I don’t know for sure, nobody knows, but I don’t think so. I think he is seeing us taking some actions to change all the things and I think that is all that he asked. I think he wants to stay.",
      "“He’s saying no to a lot of things, but it shows that he wants to win and I think he’s really young, he’s really good. He needs to be in the best league in the world.\"",
      "A fee of £100m would help fund this summer’s much-needed rebuild as United navigate PSR. Pushed on whether United could turn down such a figure, Amorim said: “Yes, yes. We can find another way to earn money.”"

Sancho spent the season on loan from United in west London and the Blues had an option to make it permanent for £25m, but talks with the winger have been unsuccessful.",
      "The 25-year-old returned five goals and 10 assists in 42 appearances across all competitions for Chelsea in the 2024/25 season. He helped Enzo Maresca’s side finish fourth in the Premier League and win the Conference League and had been expected to join the club permanently.",
      "Ruben Amorim has made it clear that Sancho is not in his plans for next season and United are desperate to offload their fringe players in the summer transfer window to fund a squad overhaul. Sancho has not enjoyed himself since signing for United from Borussia Dortmund in 2021 for £73m and will now have to search for a different exit route.",
      "Chelsea entered talks with Sancho and his representatives following the 4-1 win over Real Betis on Wednesday, in which the winger scored. But negotiations have now been called off, according to The Athletic, with Sancho now set to leave the Blues when his loan deal expires on June 30.",
      "Despite his modest returns on the pitch, Sancho integrated well at Chelsea and Maresca spoke glowingly of his contribution after lifting the Conference League trophy in Poland. But he will now have to search for a new club this summer, with a return to parent club United not suiting either party. The report states that Sancho has options in England and elsewhere in Europe.",
      "He has been linked with a return to Germany, where he starred for Dortmund, with Bayer Leverkusen reportedly interested. Leverkusen will be flush with cash this summer, with Florian Wirtz in talks to follow Jeremie Frimpong to Liverpool, but there is a stumbling block to a move for Sancho.",
      "The German side have appointed Erik ten Hag to replace Xabi Alonso, who joined Real Madrid, and the Dutchman does not have a good relationship with Sancho from their time together at United. It was a falling out with Ten Hag that prompted a loan spell to Dortmund in January 2024.",
      "It appears as though Amorim has taken a similar approach to Sancho, having bluntly dismissed him when asked earlier in the season. “I’m just focused on my players and my problems,” he said. “Sancho is not my problem.”",
      "The £5m fee owed by Chelsea for backing out of the deal for Sancho will come as a timely boost for United. However, it does mean they now need to find a new buyer for the unwanted winger, who has just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for the club over four years – a stark contrast to the 40 goals and 47 assists in 118 appearances for Dortmund.",

      "The former AC Milan star's current terms expire next summer and talks over an extension have already taken place with the club, who have tabled a proposal.",

For Amorim, despite the huge transfer fee and the fact Fernandes turns 31 later this year, the decision was a simple one for the club: Don't sell. Keep our captain. Build from there.",
      "Amorim's wish has been granted. Not by club chiefs, who, while publicly they'll insist they never wanted to sell, may have felt £100m was a figure they couldn't turn down, particularly given the £100m Champions League revenue lost in the Europa League final defeat to Spurs. But instead by Fernandes, who has decided that leaving the Premier League for the relative backwaters of the Saudi Pro League isn't for him just yet.",
      "That continues a pretty good start to June for the United boss, who saw No.1 transfer target Matheus Cunha complete his switch from Wolves on Sunday. The Brazil international has sealed a £62.5million move and taken a pay bump to £200k-a-week after United triggered his release clause at Molineux.",
      "That will not be the end of United's spending as they look to put their worst-ever Premier League season firmly behind them.",
      "Amorim has made clear his belief that there are players at the club who simply aren't fit for what he wants and has spent six months refusing to budge from his philosophy. He won't change, so the personnel at his disposal needs to. Now the hierarchy are pushing ahead with giving him what he wants.",
      "That means, next up, Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo, fresh from a standout season in 2024-25. The South Africa international scored 20 Premier League goals last term and is precisely the kind of reliable finisher that United just don't have.",
      "Newcastle United have been pushing hard to land him, while Liverpool also hold long-standing interest. Crucially, the latter aren't interested in a move this summer, as they push for Florian Wirtz, while Newcastle's hopes of a £60m deal are all but over, after Mbeumo informed them he only wants to move to Old Trafford. Sources close to Newcastle insist he'll be getting paid above their pay scale by choosing not to join their Champions League fight next term, but they weren't interested in breaking their salary structure.",
      "The Fernandes decision means the pressure is on to sell others to pay for more incomings.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho, told he has no future at the club, will go. Marcus Rashford and Antony too. The question on the trio is how much United can get for them?",
      "Jadon Sancho may be dumped back in United's lap too, with Chelsea gearing up to spend £5m to NOT turn their loan deal permanent. Amorim will need to decide what to do with a player that fell out with Erik ten Hag.",
      "Christian Eriksen, Jonny Evans and Victor Lindelof have already departed on free transfers, freeing up space when it comes to salaries, while Tyrell Malacia, who has been on loan at PSV, will be moved on.",
      "Then there is Kobbie Mainoo, the England international who broke through under Ten Hag and was seen as the future, but who Amorin doesn't see as a natural fit in his line up. Chelsea hold a big interest and there will be no shortage of suitors if United intimate he can go. He may just be the biggest sale of the summer.",
      "Then there are the strikers. Rasmus Hojlund looks set to return to Italy, with Champions League finalists Inter Milan pushing to take him to San Siro. Joshua Zirkzee showed fleeting moments of quality and is likely to stay albeit as back up to a new No.9.",
      "United missed out on Liam Delap but Victor Osimhen remains admired and is an option, particularly as Napoli eye Garnacho. But the question is whether the finances, both with Napoli and the player, can be made to work.",
      "The Nigeria international is wanted by clubs in Saudi too, and while he didn't want to go there last summer, a hugely successful year in Turkey could have worked to either embolden his view or changed his mind. Make no mistake, he would be ideal.",
      "And in midfield, with Fernandes due to drop into a deeper role next term for the most part, there is a spot to be filled, where both Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte have been used.",
      "The Brazilian is 33, on big money, and while Amorim has been hugely impressed by him, club chiefs would like to get him off the wage bill if possible. As for Ugarte, he's had good moments and some that have been decidedly less stellar as he adapts to life in England.",
      "One player club scouts and bosses have watched extensively and are high on is all-action Atalanta midfielder Ederson. United are among a list of top European clubs to have held talks with the player's agent, Andre Cury, in the past few months and with Gian Piero Gasperini leaving Atalanta for Roma, Ederson too is ready to now leave the 2024 Europa League winners.",
      "At £50million, he could give United the kind of dynamism and physicality that Amorim is desperate to add to his midfield. There's Al Hilal interest too, but a switch to one of Europe's biggest clubs is understood to be at the forefront of the Brazilian's mind.",
      "Four signings, potentially 10 exits and one captain's decision. All in, that'd certainly give Amorim something he can work with next term to ensure he keeps to his post-season vow that \"better days are coming\".",

      "Manchester United are chasing Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo in a move which could have a knock-on effect for rivals Liverpool. United had wanted to sign Ipswich striker Liam Delap alongside Wolves’ Matheus Cunha, but are now looking at a £50million deal for Mbeumo.",
      "Delap is heading to Chelsea in a £30m transfer having snubbed United and Everton, prompting a re-think at Old Trafford. Mbeumo enjoyed a wonderful campaign for Brentford, registering 20 goals and eight assists in 38 Premier League matches, and is poised to change clubs in the summer transfer window.",
      "United are understood to be ‘confident’ of landing Mbeumo, who has previously been linked with Liverpool, as well as Newcastle. Arne Slot’s side have also been busy in the early stages of the summer transfer window, signing Jeremie Frimpong for £29.5m while chasing the signature of his former Bayer Leverkusen team-mate Florian Wirtz.",
      "Mbeumo plays in the same position as Mohamed Salah on the right wing and has a similar style, often cutting onto his left foot to shoot at goal. It had been suggested that the 25-year-old Cameroon international would therefore make a solid long-term successor to Salah.",
      "Salah signed a new two-year contract with Liverpool back in April, but with the Egyptian star now 32 years old – and with a move to the Saudi Pro League still on the cards in the future – there is a need to plan ahead. If Mbeumo chooses to move to Old Trafford then it would seem that Liverpool will need to go back to the drawing board.",
      "United are facing a crucial summer transfer window after finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final. Ruben Amorim wants to overhaul his underperforming squad and the capture of Mbeumo – alongside Cunha, who is joining in a £62.5m move – would be a statement of intent.",
      "Brentford manager Thomas Frank has worked with Mbeumo for six years and has seen him blossom into one of the Premier League’s most effective forwards. He knows that, despite finishing 10th, five places above United, the Bees will struggle to hold onto Mbeumo, who can command much higher wages elsewhere.",
      "“I always knew he was a goalscorer. Now he’s now just a more consistent goalscorer. His hold-up play is even better, his assist play or link-up play, his work ethic is fantastic. So very impressed.”",
      "Asked if he will remain a Brentford player next season, Frank replied: “Let’s see. We all love him. I watch him every day, he comes in with a big smile, trains with a big smile. He loves to be a Brentford player but let’s see.”",

      "Manchester United have sensationally been told to sack Ruben Amorim for Liverpool legend Jurgen Klopp. Amorim endured a woeful first season at Old Trafford since replacing Erik ten Hag.",
      "He led the club to 15th in the Premier League - their worst finish of the modern era - while they also missed out on a spot in the Champions League after losing the Europa League final against Tottenham. That rotten form has left Amorim clinging on to his job.",
      "And former Arsenal defender Martin Keown believes he has the perfect replacement already lined up: Klopp. Explaining the controversial move on talkSPORT, Keown said: “I’m still concerned that maybe this isn’t the right manager for Manchester United.",
      "“Just look at the number of games they’ve lost. It’s going to be a very interesting start to next season for them but they could do a lot worse than go and get Jurgen Klopp to manage their football club.",
      "“I’m not trying to sensationalise. I believe he could do an incredible job there and I believe they need somebody with more experience than the current manager.”",
      "Asked to elaborate, he added: “Why not? He’s done a rebuilding job before [at Liverpool].” Amorim still has two years left to run on his original deal, with the option of a further season. It now appears very unlikely that he will be moved on.",
      "While the prospect of him being sacked looks unlikely, the prospect of Klopp moving to Old Trafford looks closer to impossible. The German is currently serving as Red Bull’s Head of Global Soccer and has hinted that he may never return to the dugout.",
      "Meanwhile, his ties to United’s bitter rivals Liverpool make a move even more unlikely. That is despite Klopp having held talks over a switch to Old Trafford in the past.",
      "He previously revealed he turned down a move ahead of Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. Klopp said: \"We spoke. We spoke not a lot but, for me, it was a lot. It was a big honour, the whole talk, to be honest. But I could not leave Dortmund.",
      "\"You are in April and you are in the middle of the planning for next season. You have this player and this player who are coming but then you are not there anymore? That doesn't work. Not in my life.",
      "\"I didn't hear about a real offer [from United] but, if there was, I could not have done it. I first had to finish the job with Dortmund and then think about other things. Maybe that is not smart but that is my way. It was the same at Mainz.\"",

He has been aware of the monstrous money he could make by moving to the Middle East, as well as the effect the £100m could have on United, especially since there will be no European football at Old Trafford next term.",

      "Joe Hugill",
      "The striker had two loan spells this season, starting the campaign in League One with Wigan Athletic but ending it in League Two with Carlisle United. Hugill struggled for game time at Wigan, with the 21-year-old playing a full 90 minutes in the league just twice, and returned to United after notching two league goals.",
      "He then joined Carlisle in a bid to help their relegation fight, but scored two goals in 17 league games as they finished second bottom. Hugill was a prolific goalscorer at youth level, but has yet to find his feet in senior football and another loan spell next season is likely.",
      "Tom Wooster, Elyeh Harrison and Tom Myles",
      "The three goalkeepers spent four months out on loan before being recalled early by the club. Wooster kept four clean sheets in 11 games for National League North side Farsley Celtic, while Harrison kept six in 18 for Chester.",

      "Jack Kingdon",

United are also confident of landing Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo in a £50m deal, fending off interest from Premier League rivals Arsenal, Newcastle and Tottenham.",
      "It's hoped that those two attacking additions will transform Ruben Amorim's frontline and it's why Neville sees the aforementioned quartet leaving Old Trafford. Rashford, Sancho and Antony were all loaned out last season while Garnacho was the subject of interest from Chelsea and Napoli in January.",
      "But one academy product who Neville doesn't want the Red Devils to sell is Kobbie Mainoo. \"On these five I'm pretty certain,\" he began on the It's Called Soccer podcast. \"Marcus Rashford has to leave for him and the club. I think that ship has sailed and he needs to find himself another club.",
      "\"I would worry that Aston Villa haven't announced that they're keeping him already because I think that could have been an easy deal to do with United if they were going to keep him, so it sounds to me like Villa aren't going to keep him. I would say for Marcus' sake and for United's sake that it feels like that path has come to an end.\"",
      "On Sancho, the ex-United defender continued: \"I feel a little bit similarly with him as I do with Marcus. I'd be a bit concerned that Chelsea haven't made the noises that they're going to keep him.",
      "\"Again, Manchester United have to make sure they part ways with him and, from Jadon's point of view, he has to make sure that he parts ways with Manchester United.\"",
      "Neville feels that Antony's loan spell has been different, labelling Real Betis and La Liga the 'perfect' destination. \"I can imagine he was absolutely going under while he was at Old Trafford,\" he explained.",
      "Who else do Manchester United need to sell this summer? Let us know your picks in the comments section.",
      "\"He's gone to Spain and having seen a couple of players that I played with not do it Old Trafford but do it in Spain… I think he's suited down to the ground and it's been proven. Over there, there's a different tactical awareness, there's a different technical ability and there's a way of playing that's just more suited to players.",
      "\"The players I'm referring to are players like Kleberson or Diego Forlan. It just didn't quite happen for them but they had really good careers and I think there are players like that who just aren't suited to a league.",
      "\"I think Antony is perfect for Spain and, again, somebody who Manchester United should facilitate leaving. It's best for Antony and best for the club.\"",
      "Regarding Garnacho, whose future was thrust into the spotlight after being named on the bench for the Europa League final, Neville said: \"I think if players are taking on the manager and if players are questioning the manager in public through social media or through other means, the manager has to win.",
      "\"If the manager doesn't win, the manager has to leave and I don't think that's going to happen this time. That's happened far too many times before. I think Garnacho will leave purely because of that, I think they've had enough.",
      "\"Garnacho can play in the Premier League, no doubt, but I think he'll love it in Spain, he'll thrive over there, he'll score goals. He'll probably be someone next season that we’re all looking back on thinking, 'Why didn't Manchester United keep him?', that type of thing will probably happen, there’s an element of that, but I think he has to go.",
      "\"That's not me throwing my toys out the pram and saying, 'Get him out the club'… no, for him and the club, I think it's right that he goes. Those four players should leave, not just because Manchester United should let them go, but because they should go and find themselves a place in their lives where they can go and play football because it's not at Old Trafford.\"",
      "But the thought of selling Mainoo - who's been at United since the age of six - is too much for Neville, despite Amorim also benching him for the last month's 1-0 loss to Tottenham in Bilbao. \"Mainoo, no. That's a step too far,\" Neville affirmed.",
      "\"If we can't give Kobbie Mainoo a job in that two in midfield… I look at Mainoo and the way he plays football and I think a top club would want him. Why can't we make him a top player? If he's one of ours and he's shown talent.",
      "\"I don't know what's gone on there in the last few months. He's obviously had some injuries which has caused him a problem so he needs to stay fit, but I'd like to think he could be one of that two in midfield that Ruben Amorim plays.",
      "\"It's probably not Casemiro as his partner and it's probably not [Manuel] Ugarte as his partner, it's probably someone else in there who is better than those two, if I'm being honest. But we should be building around Kobbie Mainoo in central midfield and not because he’s come through the ranks.\""

The report states that Amorim plans to play the 26-year-old as either one of the No.10s - a role he operated often at Wolves - or in a 'more defensive' role in midfield, potentially starting deeper, looking to pick up the ball in front of defence before driving it forwards.",

      "Since moving to Old Trafford in a deal worth more than £70million the young striker has struggled for goals. He looked to have plenty of potential during his time at Atalanta and a return to Serie A could allow him to rediscover his best form following a barren spell in Manchester.",
      "Hojlund's profile as an Inter target is 'advancing', reports Calciomercato, which is partly due to the healthy relationship his agents have struck up with the hierarchy at the San Siro. Despite struggling for goals the Italian side remain keen as they eye a rebuild.",
      "The same news outlet claims that the 22-year-old is unhappy on the red half of Manchester and is looking to find a new environment this summer. Inter believe, due to his major decline since moving to England, that they can secure his services in a cut-price deal.",
      "Hojlund's struggles have been well documented since he arrived at the beginning of last season. The summer signing needed until Boxing Day before he scored his first Premier League goal. This term his numbers have again dropped, scoring just 10 times - with only four coming in the league",
      "Concerns were raised over Hojlund's suitability to lead the line at such a tender age whilst he still had to prove himself. The player has confessed \"it would have been nice to have a bit of support.”",

The Red Devils are growing increasingly confident of being able to lure the forward to Old Trafford after the striker indicated he wanted to move to the club.",
      "United will be required to fight off interest from the likes of Newcastle and Arsenal to secure the Cameroon international. Ruben Amorim is said to be keen to make Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals in the Premier League in 2024/25, an integral member of his team.",
      "The Red Devils have returned their attention to Mbeumo after missing out to Chelsea for Ipswich Town Forward Delap. The 22-year-old former Man City youngster is primed to be announced as the Blues' newest signing after undergoing his medical, with Chelsea having agreed to pay his £30m release clause.",
      "United will hope to continue to strengthen Amorim's hand after announcing their first deal of the summer of the weekend. The 13-times Premier League champions confirmed a deal for Matheus Cunha after agreeing a £62.5million deal with Wolves.",
      "The Brazil forward was present in Manchester over the weekend before departing for international duty. The club want to replenish their front line after failing to see a member of their squad reach double figures in the Premier League's goalscoring charts.",
      "But United's attention turning to Mbeumo also appears to suggest an emphasis on targeting Premier League talent. That would appear to see the club taking a different approach to recent seasons.",
      "Last summer saw some heavy spending as the likes of Leny Yoro, Manuel Ugarte, Matthijs de Ligt and Joshua Zirkzee were brought in from abroad and the season before that saw only Mason Mount arrive from England's top-flight. And in 2022/23, the signings of Antony, Lisandro Martinez and Casemiro stole the headlines, though United did take advantage of Christian Eriksen being available for free",
      "It perhaps comes as little surprise that the club would look from within the division after struggling to 15th in 2024/25. And United's issues were all the more evident domestically, as they earned their way to the final before coming unstuck against British opposition in Tottenham.",
      "United boss Amorim has previously highlighted why he believes issues have been found when playing more familiar opposition. \"When you play against any team in England, the physicality is there,\" he said.",
      "\"If you don’t have physicality, you will struggle a lot. Antony is so much better now in Spain. There are many factors, but I guarantee you it’s physicality.\"",
      "And bringing players in who already have Premier League experience, and have thrived in the environment, such as Cunha and Mbeumo, would not only improve the team but potentially require less time to adjust. After a dismal start for Amorim, he will hope such players at least offer part of the answer.",

      "The most surprising aspect of Manchester United's early transfer business this summer is that it is coming in the area of the pitch where they are arguably strongest.",
      "If they get a deal over the line to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford following the acquisition of Matheus Cunha to Wolves, it will add more No. 10s to Ruben Amorim's squad. Given the money spent on the proven Premier League performers, they will surely be starters next season.",
      "They join a growing list of options for those positions, which for now includes Bruno Fernandes, Mason Mount, Amad, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo. Garnacho's expected departure will create some leeway for transfers, and Mainoo's future is hardly secure just yet.",
      "Mount enjoyed his best spell of football for United towards the end of last season and is an Amorim favourite, but he hasn't done enough to warrant being a first-choice in that position. Fernandes certainly has, and his decision to turn down Al-Hilal's advances should mean another year of consistent performances at Old Trafford, but his future could lie more often in a deeper midfield role. He played that position regularly last season without any real impact on his contribution in the final third.",
      "Cunha is clearly an ideal fit for the position, having excelled there in the same system under Vitor Pereira at Wolves. He brings an understanding of the role and more creativity and goal threat than someone like Mount.",
      "Mbeumo spent last season playing on the wing for Brentford, but could slot in as a No. 10. He has played centrally previously and, like Cunha, would significantly add to the attacking threat in a United squad that has struggled for goals.",
      "The 25-year-old could operate as a striker as well, although he might not be an ideal fit for what Amorim wants from a No. 9. Instead, his close control and dribbling ability could make him a better option between the lines. He also brings balance, something Amorim reflected on in December when he first moved Amad into a No. 10 role, after initially using him as a wing-back.",
      "\"He can be a good player in that position,\" Amorim said. \"We need left-footed players in this team to play that role. In the first half, he was coming for the ball too much. He needed to play near the opposition defence more. He will improve in the future for sure.”",
      "That comment came after United's win against Viktoria Plzen and signalled an almost permanent shift to Amad operating as a No. 10, but the interest in Mbeumo could yet signal a change of plan there.",
      "Given his impact last season, Amad is almost a guaranteed starter in 2025/26, which either means Mbeumo plays centre-forward or Amad drops into right wing-back.",
      "He has proven he can play the role under Amorim, and his dribbling is an asset there. He can come inside to link play and offer an overload centrally or go down the outside on his right foot. That is the type of attacking threat Amorim wants from players in those positions.",
      "This summer is clearly going to be transformative for United. Adding goals and creativity to the team is vital for Amorim, and bringing Mbeumo in as an attacker and shifting Amad to wing-back fulfils that brief.",
      "It will also offer the head coach versatility. Mbeumo could play as a No. 9 and a No. 10, and Amad could play wing-back and No. 10. There are options there, for Amorim has also prioritised players who can operate in a couple of different roles for his system. A move for Mbeumo would deliver just that."

      "In an interview with Danish broadcaster TV 2 Sport, Eriksen discussed his plans for this summer and said: \"Right now, there is nothing. There is interest all around, but there is nothing that I am close to signing. My focus will be to play international matches and then have a good summer holiday.",
      "\"Then we will see how long the holiday will be. I would rather get away from the Premier League. I feel I have had my turn in the Premier League, so I am looking outside the English borders",

I've been there for three and a half years again since then, so you can never say never, but the priority is for me to leave.\"",

      "Both matches against Hungary (Friday, June 6) and Algeria (Tuesday, June 10) are scheduled friendlies, so naturally the striker will be taking care with his health amidst the possibility of a summer transfer, perhaps to the Premier League.",
      "A huge part of United's summer transfer strategy is to sign a striker. Ipswich Town's Liam Delap had been their top target, though the 22-year-old is now on the verge of signing for Chelsea with his £30m release clause paid and formalities underway.",

      "United are hampered by a lack of Champions League football next term and the financial rewards that brings, to split the budget wisely. £62.5m has already been committed to the acquisition of No.10 Matheus Cunha, who will sign a five-year deal upon arrival from Wolves, and £50m-rated Brentford attacker Bryan Mbeumo is being targeted.",
      "In any bid to reunite Amorim with his former Swedish striker, it would appear competition from Premier League rivals Arsenal will be strong.",
      "As a potential boost, however, Gyokeres' agent, Hasan Cetinkaya, has outlined that it was the chance to work under Amorim that helped the decision to move to Portugal over any Premier League side in 2023.",
      "\"Everyone was waiting for Viktor to sign with a Premier League club,\" he said. \"And the answer to that question is that I brought Viktor to Sporting for just one reason, and this is also something I said to Mr Amorim when I saw him for the first time, and I said it before I even said hello to him: I only brought my player here because of you.",

Both are seasoned Premier League performers with very good scoring records, and at the right age.",
      "\"He's into the last year of his contract, so if his price can be negotiated down, Mbeumo would be a very good upgrade for Man United. Get it done before June 10th and ship out both Bruno and Onana to the Saudi league before that.\"",
      "Mbeumo is on commenter Verdad's forwards wishlist too: \"Amad is one of the league's best and fits the managers system perfectly. He defends as good as he attacks. Mbeumo would be a game changer if they get him signed. Cunha would be a game changer and he has been signed. Just need 1 PROVEN Striker.\"",

The Saudi Pro League were said to have turned their attention to the Portuguese after failing in their efforts to sign Mohamed Salah from Liverpool.",
      "It has been claimed that Al-Hilal, who boast the likes of Ruben Neves and Aleksandar Mitrovic in their ranks, had tabled a lucrative financial package as they look to add reinforcements before their Club World Cup campaign, which begins on June 18 against Real Madrid. However, no contact had been made between both clubs but it is thought that the United captain rejected their proposal.",
      "Fernandes' intention to remain in Europe poses as a big opportunity for United to bounce back from their turgid season, last time out.",

      "Zirkzee posted to his story shortly after news broke surrounding Fernandes' future.",

      "Rashford might have helped Unai Emery's side into the Champions League if he didn't pick up a hamstring injury in April. Rashford looked back to his best before sustaining that issue and might have been able to make a significant difference during the final weeks of the Premier League season.",
      "Aston Villa choked at Old Trafford on the final day of the campaign instead and they will not play in Europe's premier competition next season. Rashford could still pop up in the Champions League, though.",
      "The reports linking him with a move to Barcelona are not going away and their sporting director, Deco, went on record about Rashford when he spoke to BBC Sport this week.",
      "Deco insisted Barcelona will \"not sell our best players\". He said Barcelona were in the market for \"two, three or four signings\", without needing to enter the market \"like crazy\" thanks to a solid base.",
      "And when asked if Barcelona's plans included the option of signing Rashford, or Liverpool forward Luis Diaz, he added: \"We have been focusing on renewing contracts, after that, we'll discuss players to come.",
      "\"Of course, these two players, like you mentioned, they are good but have contracts in their clubs, so we won't speak because it's not fair. But when you decide to go to the market, for sure, we find some names. In my opinion, we don't need to bring many players.\"",
      "Deco continued: \"When I speak with the agents of the players, everyone wants to come or stay. So this is important. The image of the club is still good. We are proud because Barcelona is still such a big club, and the way we are playing football makes players want to come.\"",
      "The former Barcelona midfielder also denied the Catalan club are in financial trouble, although reading between the lines hints they don't have a war chest to splash in the market.",
      "That's why Rashford will tick a lot of boxes for Barcelona. The 27-year-old is available for £40m this summer and he is certainly worth more than that when he is playing his best football.",
      "Barcelona's situation means they must place informed bets in the transfer market, and they will feel Rashford is worth a punt. He proved his well-being during his loan at Villa Park, looking excellent against PSG in the Champions League, and has considerable upside for a £40m transfer.",
      "Manchester City paid £53m to sign Matheus Nunes from Wolves, Tottenham paid £50m to sign Richarlison and Chelsea paid £47.m for Raheem Sterling. They are just a handful of examples that suggest £40m for Rashford is reasonable.",
      "Barcelona can't break the bank in the transfer market, but they have enough to stump up £40m for Rashford, and it feels like a move that could be agreed sooner rather than later in the window.",
      "There is a lack of interest elsewhere in Rashford. Barcelona and Villa are the only clubs sitting at the table of interested parties, and it's obvious where Rashford would prefer to play.",
      "United will not particularly care where Rashford ends up this summer as long as they can bank a fee for the academy graduate, who is set to become one of their biggest-ever sales.",
      "The money raised from Rashford's sale will also be important for Ruben Amorim to strengthen."

      "According to our sister title the Liverpool ECHO, the likelihood of United coming back 12 months later has lessened after their failure to qualify for Champions League football but the player still has admirers at Old Trafford, while interest from Tottenham Hotspur, whose Europa League final victory over United secured a spot in Europe's top competition, is believed to be serious.",

Among those selected ahead of him so far, Levi Colwill and Dan Burn are set to compete in the Champions League next season with Chelsea and Newcastle United, respectively, while Marc Guehi will also be playing in Europe after Crystal Palace's FA Cup victory.",

      "Undoubtedly their worst and most difficult season since Pep Guardiola turned them into a trophy-gobbling machine, and the problem for City now is that doubt exists where no doubt existed before.",
      "Maybe they come back next season and win the league again. Maybe. But there’s no certainty anymore. You can’t even say with great conviction they’ll be in the title race.",
      "That itself is a wild situation to be in when you’re talking about a team that had won six of the last seven league titles before this season.",
      "They really were worse in just every way as well this year. Their fewest wins since 2015/16, most defeats, and fewest goals scored. The 44 goals they conceded was their worst since 2009/10 and the world was a very different place for City back then, right at the start of their journey to world domination.",
      "The team that won the lot is breaking up. Kyle Walker is gone, Kevin De Bruyne is gone. There are huge doubts over whether Guardiola himself has the drive or inclination or will to push through with the regeneration and build another great side. And if he doesn’t, what then?",
      "It’s all doubt and guesswork where previously there existed absolute certainty. And they’ve got to play in the Club World Cup.",
      "‘Oh no we didn’t win any trophies and only finished third and have to play in a Club World Cup’ are among the more first-world footballing problems imaginable, sure, but these things are all relative and this is a situation that City simply haven’t faced for several years now.",
      "",
      "18) Manchester United (15)\nAn absolute basket-case of a club who’ve just suffered the twin indignities of finishing an unthinkable 15th in the Premier League and losing an actual cup final to actual Spurs, but there’s no denying that their early summer transfer business is at the eye-catching end with Prem-proven arrivals confirmed (Cunha) and imminent (Mbeumo) from the sort of teams that have, uncomfortably, now become United’s direct rivals.",
      "Those are important moves not because they are good players who dramatically and necessarily improve United – although they are that – but because they serve as proof that for the time being at least this remains Manchester United Football Club We’re Talking About.",
      "United – or at the very least United wages – still have a pull that transcends their current status. And that offers meaningful hope that this absurd beast of a football club can still be brought to heel despite itself.",
      "The clock is ticking, though. We’re not entirely sure just how long United will remain a name that resonates so with players, but we do know that time is finite.",
      "We’ve already seen the United Will Get The Job Done In A Final myth utterly busted in Bilbao, but there’s no denying this swift summer foray into the transfer market is providing some repair to a deeply damaged brand.",
      "",
      "17) Arsenal (9)\nMust reluctantly accept the mantle of Banter Club and also acknowledge that they have largely brought it upon themselves.",
      "Finishing second again need not be disastrous, but there was definite regression and losing out to Liverpool rather than Man City makes life far harder for that particular breed of fan who refers to the club as ‘The Arsenal’ and believes they represent some bastion of class and heritage and history rather than just being another very rich football club that spends lots of money.",
      "The big problem for Arsenal is that they didn’t win anything. Again. The bigger problem is that somehow – ludicrous and ridiculous a freaky fluke as it may be – Spurs did. And that has shifted the dynamic of the north London scene, for now at least.",
      "It’s not fair, it’s not big and it’s certainly not clever but Arsenal have no choice but to swallow at least a year of ‘Worra trophy’ every time they start mouthing off about beating PSG on xG and such. They really are just going to have to take it, and while we are always reluctant to judge any fanbase by its most conspicuous online gobshites, it would massively help if they stop being very sniffy indeed about Spurs winning a competition – for a third time no less – that Arsenal themselves have never managed to win.",
      "The whole ‘who’s had a better season?’ debate is facetious and largely in bad faith. There’s a very coherent argument to make that neither Spurs nor Arsenal should want to swap with the other. After 17 years, a trophy moved the needle for Spurs in a way that no amount of process-trusting second-place finishes ever could, while there remains still the sense that Arsenal are building towards something big in a way that Spurs shithousing a European pot in their worst domestic season for over 40 years absolutely does not.",
      "But until and unless Arsenal arrive at their destination – and there are never any guarantees you’ll get there until you do – then they live in Banter Town. Only one road out of there, lads.",
      "READ: Man Utd, Man City and Arsenal fell so far short of every single target",
      "",
      "16) Brentford (12)\nDid some madly entertaining things this season, with the whole ‘winning all our home games but losing all our away games and then switching that around for no real reason’ bit one of our very favourites from this season.",
      "The run of home games late last year that produced five straight wins by scores of 5-3, 4-3, 3-2, 4-1 and 4-2 was sensational, as really was the fact that 4-2 win (over Newcastle no less) was in fact Brentford’s last home win for four months.",
      "All those lads from about eighth to 12th were good value this season, and the only real criticism of Brentford is that they so rigidly confined their sense of fun to league matters when they looked every inch the sort of side that could and should have put together some kind of run at at least one of the cups. Especially the way this season panned out for rogue winners of cups.",
      "Overall, though, an excellent season with good vibes. But while Brentford’s business model is one that doesn’t just cope with the loss of key assets but positively thrives on it, the idea of losing both Bryan Mbeumo and Thomas Frank in one summer would appear to be something that might stretch that beyond its elastic limit. The very real possibility of this coming to pass has to harsh the buzz a bit.",
      "",
      "15) Burnley (-)\nPerhaps the most interesting of the promoted teams. Think we all kind of know what to expect, to some degree, from the other two. Leeds should give it a proper go as one of few teams outside the now Settled Seventeen with the requisite heft to muscle their way into the closed shop. Sunderland should go down and suffer frequent heavy punishment for their Icarus-like ‘promoted a season too early’ folly.",
      "But what of Burnley? They are so different to the last Burnley team to come up, who did it playing glorious football that simply didn’t survive contact with the rarefied Barclays air. Now, though, they are a team led by Scott Parker, a man so haunted by a 9-0 humiliation at Liverpool when in charge of Bournemouth that he has simply vowed to never concede another goal ever again, even if that means – and last season it very often did – not scoring any either.",
      "Now the last couple of years have been filled with chat about the hubris of promoted teams, about their failure to be sufficiently humble to take their medicine and accept that what got them here can’t keep them here. That the way teams like Brentford or Brighton adapted to survive the transition to the far, far higher level is apparently now too much to ask of teams like Southampton, and especially Vincent Kompany’s Burnley.",
      "But what about this Burnley? They’ve sufferballed their way in, so could they now sufferball their way to 15th? It does feel more likely than trying to Temu Man City their way there like Kompany or Russell Martin.",
      "Yet at the same time it does also feel like they might just end up like Homer Simpson when he gets in the ring with Drederick Tatum. Premier League teams might not get tired. That cactus is right!",
      "",
      "14) Sunderland (-)\nAnother thrilling Championship play-off final, another big club with a proud history getting itself foolishly promoted when it is visibly and palpably unready.",
      "But those are concerns for far later in the summer. Let us not sully their celebratory moment with talk of it being another great chance for Derby to get their names out of the record books at long last.",
      "That kind of chat is for August, or perhaps late July. For now, the best advice for Sunderland would appear to be go Full Forest and sign a bunch of players and worry about the rules later. The alternative paths for a team that finished 24 points behind the other promoted teams are simply too ghastly to think about for long.",
      "",
      "13) Fulham (11)\nWe love Fulham. They have carved out a niche as the Premier League’s most reliable ‘can beat anybody, can lose to anybody’ team and it’s a tremendous way to go about 50-odd point-securing mid-table comfort.",
      "They are a team that often manages to get themselves on the edge of European talk around February or March only to be nowhere near it by May without anyone really noticing or complaining about how they fell off. Seems a nice way to live.",
      "Even the way this season ended was perfectly on brand, their European hopes fading away in accordance with the prophecy as they lost six of their last nine league games after a heavy FA Cup defeat to Palace.",
      "Obviously one of the nine games they didn’t lose was a 3-2 win over the champions – and this was at the start of April, weeks before Liverpool had officially wrapped up the title and gone full beach/flip-flop/cigars.",
      "Fulham this season managed to lose to Wolves, West Ham, Everton, and Manchester United, draw with Tottenham, Southampton and Ipswich (twice) and beat Newcastle (twice), Nottingham Forest (twice), Chelsea and Liverpool.",
      "Never change, lads. Never change.",
      "",
      "12) Bournemouth (8)\nUltimately finished second in the tremendously fun eighth-twelfth mini-league of enormously entertaining mid-table teams as Brighton pulled clear in the closing weeks to claim first place. Well, eighth place. But you know what we mean.",
      "Bournemouth, though, remain our favourite of this gaggle of teams that also contains Brentford, Fulham and Palace. There’s something similar going on at all these clubs, who have become the Premier League’s affluent and aspirational middle-class over the last couple of years as the league’s wealth has grown and their own status within it solidified.",
      "All of them are doing fine work in the crucial field of making mid-table life fun by being capable of going on wild runs of startling form at both ends of the spectrum, but Bournemouth are the ones for us who most conspicuously pass the eye test.",
      "There are two versions of this Bournemouth team under Andoni Iraola. The one that goes on 11-match unbeaten runs that includes smashing top-seven teams to absolute pieces in back-to-back games, and the team that wins one match in nine trying to remember what they were doing in the first bit.",
      "Bournemouth’s best football this season has been alarmingly close to the best football played by anyone this season, and that’s a wonderful thing. We’re not sure Iraola and this team will ever crack the code entirely and be able to turn those spells of seemingly effortless flow-state brilliance into an entire season but imagine if they did. Wouldn’t that be something, eh?",
      "",
      "11) Everton (7)\nNot as giddy now as in those early days of David Moyes’ return, but still far happier with their on-field lot than could possibly have been predicted halfway through the season.",
      "What makes Everton so hard to place now is how to weigh up the emotional wrench of leaving Goodison Park after over a century of memories and history versus the excitement of moving into their new ground and all the potential that brings.",
      "So what we’re going to do at this point is simply avoid that kind of complicated brain-melter altogether and simply put them right there in the middle. And there’s nothing you can do about it.",
      "",
      "10) Brighton\nFinished the season like an absolute train to finish one place and in the end just four points behind a stumbling Nottingham Forest. Always bittersweet when you end a season like that.",
      "Sure, it’s never a bad thing to end on a high note and approach the summer with confidence for the next but at the same time Brighton ended the campaign sufficiently clear of their fellow entertaining mid-table chums (your Bournemouths, your Brentfords, the Fulhams of this world) and sufficiently close to the European spots that you can’t help but look wistfully at things like drawing six (and losing the other two) in an eight-game run around Christmas last year or even April’s failure to secure more than a single point from three games against Palace, Leicester and Brentford.",
      "Overall, though, eighth place in the Premier League and genuine reason to believe Fabian Hurzeler’s second season can be even better than his first with that vital year’s worth of experience means the vibes on the south coast are very good indeed.",
      "",
      "9) Nottingham Forest (2)\nAh, the cruelty of shifting expectations. Let’s be real here, it’s still been an extraordinary season for Forest, who went from relegation battlers last season to spending much of this campaign on the fringes of the title race before falling away on the finishing straight to end ‘only’ seventh.",
      "It’s just human nature that doing it that way doesn’t feel quite as good as surging up to pinch seventh and a European spot after spending most of the season in 12th.",
      "But while there will be some fans for whom only being in the Europa Conference represents the sky falling in, the vast majority of fans will, we suspect, see the bigger picture here. Not least the fact they now find themselves in a competition that offers a huge chance of adding a new chapter to a storied European history at the City Ground.",
      "",
      "8) Wolves (13)\nWere briefly and giddily the best team in the land for a while there, winning six straight games between mid-March and the end of April, at which point a far loftier mood position appeared on the cards with Vitor Pereira getting an absolute tune out of what turned out to be a far more talented squad than Gary O’Neil had made us all think,",
      "But one point from their last four games is a familiar damp squib of a season end for a team that has history for allowing the way one season ends to bleed into how the next begins.",
      "Another slow start and more managerial uncertainty in the early months of next season really would be annoying when it looked like they really might hit the summer with proper momentum.",
      "Losing Matheus Cunha is no shock to anyone, but a massive blow nonetheless. Especially with him making such a sideways move to Man United.",
      "",
      "7) Aston Villa (5)\nSimmering resentment over the manner of missing out on Champions League qualification on the final day should ultimately give way to acknowledgement that sixth probably represents a fair enough reflection of their overall league season and is a decent enough effort when combined with a fine run on their return to European football’s top table.",
      "They have got their feet back under the table now as a big deal in the Premier League and there is an obvious silver lining for any good Premier League team that finds itself narrowly missing out on the Champions League and finding itself instead in the Europa: that is now an enormously winnable trophy, and one that needn’t be a massive drain on the first half of your season given the fact even Spurs and United were largely able to coast into cosy top-eight finishes.",
      "A quick glance at the current confirmed qualifiers suggests precious little to fear for a team coming off an impressive Champions League run, let’s put it that way.",
      "We understand why, obviously, clubs want to be in the Champions League for the money and the prestige and did we mention money, but if you’re a fan of a club like Aston Villa then the idea of a proper run at winning the Europa has to appeal.",
      "",
      "6) Chelsea (14)\nCompleting the new full set of European trophies and becoming the first team to do so is a neat result for completionists everywhere.",
      "Being the first to do something is always a buzz because while others can eventually match the achievement, nobody else can ever be first. And probably nobody will match it for ages anyway; who knows how long it might be before Man United can lift themselves back to the level of qualifying for the Conference League to have a crack themselves?",
      "If winning the third-tier European comp was a bit of a penalty kick and in fact the only way to avoid embarrassment in that competition, getting themselves back in the top four after some difficult Premier League campaigns was something with a bit more bite, even if the title challenge promised in the early months of the season faded away to nothing in the end.",
      "We are still in the realm of bare-minimum achievement for a club that has spent such hilarious amounts on compiling their squad, but it’s also a bare minimum that has not been met for a while now.",
      "We remain powerfully unconvinced by Enzo Maresca, but it’s hard to view the season just gone as anything other than one that has demonstrably placed Chelsea closer to where they ought to be and for his first year that was enough. It wouldn’t be enough next season, though, and having to actually deploy first-team players throughout a European campaign obviously represents a fresh challenge.",
      "",
      "5) Leeds (-)\nPromoted in often scintillating style and, whether anyone else likes it or not, are one of vanishingly few Championship clubs for whom a meaningful stab at breaking open the Premier League’s Settled Seventeen represents a realistic ambition and not just a hopeful pipe dream.",
      "Still need a big and busy summer to have anything like a squad ready to cope with what the Premier League has become even since their last crack at it, but a real sense that Leeds are ready to give it a go.",
      "Very much still in the celebratory partying stage of the Premier League promotion cycle and while The Fear will kick in for them as it does for everyone at some point, how Leeds go next season does feel like it’s an important barometer of the wider health of the upper levels of the English football pyramid; if Leeds disappear without a trace then the question becomes who, if anyone, won’t do that?",
      "And if the only viable answers there become Birmingham, or Wrexham, then you’re really just raising further uncomfortable questions.",
      "Tits to all that for now, though, yeah? Leeds are back. They’re pretty chuffed about it, and don’t really care whether anyone else is.",
      "",
      "4) Liverpool (6)\nSome fans deciding to be a bit weird about Trent Alexander-Arnold is so not rainbow rhythms and the fact Liverpool didn’t win another game after confirming the league title is all at the same time a) funny b) largely irrelevant but also c) slightly annoying.",
      "We’re all of us bedevilled by recency bias and while of course Liverpool fans are mainly still celebrating their first league title in front of fans since 1990, there’s a part of all of us that knows were we in their position we’d still be slightly narked about the four-game winless run to end the season even though logically we shouldn’t give a sh*t.",
      "This is very small beer, though, especially with the club already making statement moves in what is going to be a huge summer that will reveal whether Arne Slot can be as successful with his own side as he was with Jurgen Klopp’s.",
      "Jeremie Frimpong and especially the seemingly imminent Florian Wirtz are hugely exciting moves. Wirtz in particular is a massive statement of intent and indicator of how big Liverpool’s pull now is. If you’re not getting giddy about that one, you’re in the wrong game.",
      "",
      "3) Newcastle (1)\nNewcastle absolutely should not, will not and do not care one jot, but it’s very funny to us that the English football media collectively wanked themselves so entirely dry at Newcastle finally winning a trophy only for two other conspicuous pot-dodgers to collect two even bigger prizes before the season was out.",
      "Like we say, though: amusing to us, irrelevant to Newcastle. The cathartic release of all those long-awaited trophy wins was magical for those involved, and there really is no need for anything so gauche as comparisons or guff about who it meant more for.",
      "Newcastle backing up that emotional Carabao success by claiming fifth place and with it Champions League football next season places this at the summit of Newcastle seasons in the modern era and there really is no obvious reason why it shouldn’t now be just the start of something even greater.",
      "The mood is good, is what we’re saying here. Or it was until they realised they still couldn’t beat Manchester United to transfers.",
      "",
      "2) Crystal Palace (4)\nFifty points and an FA Cup win? They really are glad all over. We know we’re probably the only ones on earth who would put those achievements in that order, but we’ve been very invested in the Palace 50 points story for the last couple of years and are absolutely delighted to see them do it.",
      "But even we can acknowledge that getting 50 Premier League points in a season for the first time is not quite as good as winning major silverware for the very first time.",
      "In a season of remarkable drought-ending trophy success, nothing was greater than Palace’s. These were supporters with powerful reason to think this was a day that might never come, at least not in their lifetimes.",
      "The appointment of Oliver Glasner already merits discussion among the most astute managerial appointments any Premier League club has ever made. He came to a club with some compelling raw materials but has had a transformative effect few could have predicted.",
      "Are we still talking about FA Cup wins or are we back banging on about getting 50 points? We prefer not to speak.",
      "",
      "1) Tottenham (20)\nThey really are That Club, ending the trophy drought but absolutely not their banter era in the single most Spurs way imaginable.",
      "It is ridiculous to even imagine a team that finishes 17th qualifying for the Champions League, but when you do give it any kind of attention it immediately becomes clear only one club could possibly do it and that’s the one that didn’t qualify for the Champions League when they finished fourth.",
      "Only Spurs could achieve something like that after a decade of agony and then get about 10 days to fully enjoy and revel in no longer being the butt of everyone’s jokes – a mantle which, to make things even better, passed immediately to Arsenal – before going ‘Hang on, what do we actually do about a manager who won a trophy but also finished 17th?’",
      "Other clubs just aren’t like this.",
      "The genius of this Spurs season is just how long it’s been so clear that it had only two possible end-points. The miracle is which one has actually happened. We said this in March and apart from failing to mention Palace in the FA Cup it still captures the essence of the absurdity that is Tottenham’s 24/25 season:",
      "There remains, somehow, the small but decidedly non-zero chance that Postecoglou pulls an absolute Homer and wins the Europa League. It’s impossible to overstate just how much that transforms everything about this season.",
      "It might not be the most important thing about it, but we do think there are only two places Spurs can end the season in these rankings, and those two places are first and last.",
      "This is a season that for Spurs really does appear to have crystallised and distilled down to two possible outcomes. First, and most likely, their worst season since before the Premier League And The Invention Of Football. When you consider just how utterly crap Spurs were for much of the nineties and early noughties, that’s a staggering achievement.",
      "But not as staggering as the only alternative which is an end to their own trophy drought and with it qualification for the Champions League, which would genuinely make this Spurs’ best season for at least 40 years.",
      "Spurs’ existential despair over that albatross of a trophy drought has already been exacerbated by Newcastle exorcising their own demons, and with every chance of Villa, Bournemouth, Forest, Brighton or somesuch also joining the ever-growing list of clubs to win a trophy more recently than Tottenham there is a profound sense that while it’s always true that whatever happens in football the joke is always on Spurs it may never have been more true, the joke never more entirely on them, than it has been this season.",
      "Unless, of course, they can somehow defy history, logic and reason to land an unlikely punchline of their own. Mate.",
      "And lo, it came to pass. And now we have to get this out quick before Spurs make a confirmed final decision one way or the other on Big Ange and p*ss off half the fanbase either way."

      "Mikael Silvestre has admitted Manchester United will need ‘more than two or three years’ to emerge from their slump, as he gave his verdict on what needs to happen next with manager Ruben Amorim and captain Bruno Fernandes.",
      "The United boss is under huge pressure after failing to make a positive impact since succeeding Erik ten Hag as United boss last November, with defeat against Tottenham in the Europa League final providing a miserable footnote to the club’s worst season in a generation.",
      "United appear to have gone backwards since Amorim’s arrival and the Portuguese tactician has given public hints that he is willing to walk away from the club if the owners have lost faith in his abilities.",
      "Yet Silvestre, who won the Premier League title four times and also the Champions League during his time as a United player, has insisted Amorim should not be the fall guy for United’s demise.",
      "“These questions about Amorim’s future are complete nonsense because he took over in November and this is not his team,” Silvestre told Football365 with Esports Insider.",
      "“He has not had any time to influence his philosophy and how he wants to play and these are not the players he wants.",
      "READ: Man Utd signing £365m Premier League sextet now inevitable after Cunha, Mbeumo transfers",
      "“They are not his players. The only player they signed in January was Patrick Dorgu and now Amorim has to be given the time and the financial backing to strengthen the squad.",
      "“After that, we can judge what he doing. It will always be the results that decide what happens to a manager, but you cannot decide after half a season when he has not had a transfer window to fix it. We can only stick with him for the future.”",
      "Silvestre went on to express his hope that rumours linking United captain Bruno Fernandes with a move to the Saudi Pro League will evaporate, as the Frenchman insists the club need to hang on to their best player.",
      "Fernandes’ body language on the field has been criticised by former United players like Roy Keane, but Silvestre offers up a different verdict on the impact of the Portuguese playmaker.",
      "“There is no argument about Bruno’s commitment and level,” stated Silvestre. “The amount of football he has played this season shows a level of dedication and he has been their best player, for sure.",
      "“I hope Bruno stays because it is important that the top players are there to maintain the level and allow others to grow.",
      "“You look at someone like Kobi Mainoo and who is he going to look up to? It’s Bruno. He will learn from his movement and his passing. So it is really important that Bruno stays.”",
      "Silvestre went on to suggest United’s dramatic fall from grace has been hard to watch, as he admits last season’s FA Cup final win against Manchester United papered over cracks at the club, as he hinted they will many years to find a solution.",
      "“It’s shocking to see United where they are,” said Silvestre. “You do not expect a club of that stature to finish in this position in the league, but this has been coming. It has been mismanaged for many years and eventually it catches up with you.",
      "“When you ask how long they need to put it right, I’m going to say many years. I’m going to say more than two or three years. United have been standing still for too long and everyone else has been getting stronger.",
      "“Let’s see what Amorim can do. He needs at least three transfer windows in the summer to see if he can build a team, but it is a long time before they start to move up the ladder again.",
      "“The FA Cup final result (beating Manchester City) last season disguised the real position, but I still feel this team had more in the tank to finish a lot higher than they did this season.”",
      "Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes has decided to ‘reject’ Al-Hilal and stay at Old Trafford ahead of next season, according to Fabrizio Romano.",
      "Amorim has made Mainoo a promise if he extends his Man Utd deal as the Red Devils ‘line up’ a £70m replacement for Bruno Fernandes.",
      "Bruno Fernandes may leave Manchester United but it will not be because he attended a birthday dinner with his friend…",
      "Should Man Utd sell Bruno Fernandes? The fans are split. We also have views on the new Man Utd manager, Spurs and more.",
      "Man Utd are prepared to sell another starter to Saudi Arabia this summer amid interest in Bruno Fernandes, according to reports.",

      "Having essentially signed no-one last summer, Liverpool are in a very good position to spend big as champions, and the imminent arrival of Florian Wirtz will be striking fear into their rivals that this may be the start of a period of Premier League dominance.",
      "And teams don’t typically get transfer windows right after winning the title. We’ve ranked every champion this century (with the season they won in brackets) by their summer transfer windows after lifting the trophy.",
      "We have the top 10 signings by Premier League champions here as we warm to the theme…",
      "",
      "25) Leicester (2015/16)\nNampalys Mendy (Nice, £13m), Ron-Robert Zieler (Hannover 96, £2.6m), Luis Hernandez (Sporting Gijon, free), Raul Uche Rubio (Rayo Vallecano, undisclosed), Ahmed Musa (CSKA Moscow, £16m), Bartosz Kapustka (Cracovia, £7.5m), Islam Slimani (Sporting, £29.7m).",
      "It’s fair to say Mendy didn’t quite rise to the unreasonable challenge of replacing N’Golo Kante and actually, none of this bunch of misfits really rose to the challenge of playing Premier League football.",
      "",
      "24) Chelsea (2009/10)\nYossi Benayoun (Liverpool, £5m), Matej Delac (Inter Zapresic, £2.7m), Tomas Kalac (Sigma Olomouc, £5m).",
      "This sorry trio makes the decision to sack Carlo Ancelotti at the end of the 2010/11 season after finishing second, a year on from the double, all the more absurd.",
      "",
      "23) Manchester City (2011/12)\nJack Rodwell (Everton, £12m), Scott Sinclair (Swansea, £8m), Maicon (Inter Milan, undisclosed), Richard Wright (Preston North End, free), Matija Nastasic (Fiorentina, undisclosed), Javi Garcia (Benfica, £16m).",
      "City were really quite sh*t at transfers before Pep Guardiola and Txiki Begiristain arrived.",
      "",
      "22) Manchester City (2013/14)\nFernando (Porto, £12m), Bacary Sagna (Arsenal, free), Willy Caballero (Malaga, £6m), Eliaquim Mangala (Porto, £32m), Frank Lampard (New York City, loan), Bruno Zuculini (Racing Club, £1.5m).",
      "See, terrible.",
      "",
      "21) Manchester United (2012/13)\nGuillermo Varela (Penarol, £1m), Marouane Fellaini (Everton, £27.5m).",
      "David Moyes was on a hiding to nothing.",
      "",
      "20) Manchester United (1999/00)\nFabien Barthez (Monaco, £7.8m)",
      "He was essentially proof of United being so good that even a liability for a goalkeeper couldn’t knock them off course.",
      "",
      "19) Chelsea (2016/17)\nDanny Drinkwater (Leicester, £35m), Davide Zappacosta (Torino, £23m), Alvaro Morata (Real Madrid, £60m), Willy Caballero (Manchester City, free), Antonio Rudiger (Roma, £34m), Tiemoue Bakayoko (Monaco, £40m), Ethan Ampadu (Exeter, free)",
      "Rudiger is a big reason why Chelsea won a second Champions League, but Drinkwater and Bakayoko have got to be up there with pound-for-pound the worst midfield signings in Premier League history and Alvaro Morata’s Premier League goals cost Chelsea just shy of £4m each.",
      "",
      "18) Chelsea (2014/15)\nPedro (Barcelona, £21.4m), Baba Rahman (FC Augsburg, £17.7m), Asmir Begovic (Stoke, £8m), Kenedy (Fluminense, £6.3m), Nathan (Atletico Paranaense, £4.5m), Papy Djilobodji (Nantes, £2.7m), Danilo Pantic (Partizan Belgrade, £1.25m), Michael Hector (Reading, Undisclosed), Radamel Falcao (AS Monaco, Loan).",
      "We would suggest the excellent addition of Pedro from Barcelona was counteracted somewhat by them signing Baba Rahman for nearly as much money, putting him on £90,000 per week and then inexplicably extending his contract after three years, meaning his seven-year stay at Chelsea cost them nearly £33m. He made 23 appearances.",
      "",
      "17) Manchester City (2023/24)\nSavinho (Troyes, £21m), Ilkay Gundogan (Barcelona, free).",
      "Signing a £50m player from themselves for £21m hasn’t worked out as well as many hoped/feared and Gundogan hasn’t been the Gundogan which left for Barcelona, and crucially, not a Rodri.",
      "",
      "16) Manchester City (2022/23)\nMateo Kovacic (£25m, Chelsea), Josko Gvardiol (£77m, RB Leipzig), Jeremy Doku (£55.5m, Rennes), Matheus Nunes (£53m, Wolves).",
      "Kovacic has been fine and Gvardiol’s probably been the best left-back in the Premier League across his two seasons at the club, but Doku hasn’t lived up to his early promise and there’s been no promise of a positive sort from Nunes.",
      "",
      "15) Manchester City (2020/21)\nJack Grealish (£100m, Aston Villa), Karky (£9m, Fluminense).",
      "We’re guessing the majority would say Grealish has not been a success as Manchester City, but surely a treble is worth far more than £100m and we don’t think they would have done it without him.",
      "",
      "14) Manchester United (2007/08)\nDimitar Berbatov (Tottenham, £31m), Zoran Tosic (Partizan, £5m), Ritchie De Laet (Stoke City, £200k).",
      "Adding Berbatov to a striker canon of Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Danny Welbeck was just plain greedy and speaks to a squad built to the point of not needing to sign anyone.",
      "",
      "13) Manchester United (2008/09)\nAntonio Valencia (Wigan, £16m), Michael Owen (Newcastle, free), Gabriel Obertan (Bordeaux, £3m), Mame Biram Diouf (Molde, undisclosed).",
      "A window saved by Valencia, who was an inspired addition.",
      "",
      "12) Arsenal (2001/02)\nGilberto Silva (Atletico Mineiro, £4.5m), Pascal Cygan (Lille, £2m).",
      "Gilberto was a lovely footballer; Cygan less so.",
      "",
      "11) Liverpool (2019/20)\nKostas Tsimikas (£11.7m, Olympiakos), Thiago (£20m, Bayern Munich), Diogo Jota (£41m, Wolves).",
      "Jota has largely been excellent when fit but Liverpool surely wouldn’t have signed him had they known he would miss 99 games though injury in five years at the club. The definitely wouldn’t have signed Thiago, who missed over 100 games in four years.",
      "",
      "10) Manchester City (2017/18)\nRiyad Mahrez (£60m, Leicester), Philippe Sandler (£2.25m, PEC Zwolle), Daniel Arzani (undisclosed, Melbourne City).",
      "We love Mahrez so, so much and will continue to bat for him being named among the Premier League’s greatest ever wingers. He makes our greatest 10 signings made by Premier League champions list.",
      "",
      "9) Chelsea (2004/05)\nMichael Essien (Lyon, £24.5m), Shaun Wright-Phillips (Manchester City, £21m), Asier Del Horno (Athletic Club, £9m), Lassana Diarra (Le Havre, £3m).",
      "Essien proved himself well worth what was seen as a massive transfer fee for a midfielder. Wright-Phillips never quite made the grade and Del Horno is best only remembered for charging at a 19-year-old Lionel Messi and being sent off while both of them rolled around on the floor.",
      "",
      "8) Manchester United (2010/11)\nDavid De Gea (Atletico Madrid, £17.8m), Phil Jones (Blackburn, £16.5m), Ashley Young (Aston Villa, £16m).",
      "Four Player of the Year awards makes De Gea arguably one of the best indicators of United’s demise – you don’t want a goalkeeper to be your best player – but it also obviously means he was a successful signing, as was Young, and Jones too, despite a career of wholly unfair p*ss-taking.",
      "",
      "7) Chelsea (2005/06)\nAndriy Shevchenko (AC Milan, £31m), John Obi Mikel (Lyn, £16m), Khalid Boulahrouz (Hamburg, £9m), Ashley Cole (Arsenal, £5m), Salomon Kalou (Feyenoord, £1.5m), Michael Ballack (Bayern Munich, free), Hilario (Nacional, free).",
      "Cole and Ballack for a combined £5m is very good going and Kalou was a snip too. Plus we had the whole Mikel in a Manchester United shirt before signing for Chelsea story arc, which was a joy.",
      "",
      "6) Arsenal (2003/04)\nManuel Almunia (Celta Vigo, £3.5m), Robin van Persie (Feyenoord, £2.75m), Mathieu Flamini (Marseille, £400k), Arturo Lupoli (Parma, £200k).",
      "Incredible that Almunia cost more than Van Persie. Flamini for less than half a million isn’t bad going either.",
      "",
      "5) Manchester United (2000/01)\nJuan Sebastian Veron (Lazio, £28m), Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV, £19m), Roy Carroll, (Wigan, £1.5m), Luke Steele (Peterborough, £400k), Laurent Blanc (Inter, free), Kieran Richardson (West Ham, free).",
      "Veron was the British record transfer at the time and didn’t work out, but they recouped a decent wedge of that fee by duping Chelsea into signing him two years later. Van Nistelrooy entirely made up for that misstep and then some.",
      "",
      "4) Manchester United (2002/03)\nCristiano Ronaldo (Sporting, £12m), Kleberson (Atletico Paranaense, £6.5m), Eric Djemba Djemba (Nantes, £3.5m), Tim Howard (MetroStars, £2.5m), David Bellion (Sunderland, £2m).",
      "Quite possibly the worst transfer window of any club ever without the 936-goal elephant in the room.",
      "",
      "3) Manchester City (2018/19)\nZach Steffen (£7.2m, Columbus Crew), Angelino (£5.3m, PSV), Rodri (£62.8m, Atletico Madrid), Joao Cancelo (£60m, Juventus), Scott Carson (loan, Derby), Pedro Porro (£11m, Girona), Ryotaro Meshino (£900,000, Gama Osaka).",
      "A middling window without the signing of the current best footballer on the planet as they made a tidy profit on Angelino and, before the Guardiola fallout, Cancelo was arguably the best full-back in the Premier League. But Rodri makes it brilliant, particularly given all the doubts as to how they would ever replace Fernandinho.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United (2006/07)\nAnderson (Porto, £27m), Nani (Sporting, £25m), Owen Hargeaves (Bayern Munich, £17m), Carlos Tevez (West Ham, loan), Tomasz Kuszczak (West Brom, £4m).",
      "Not at all surprising that United won the Premier League three times in four years after this window.",
      "",
      "1) Manchester City (2021/22)\nErling Haaland (£51m, Borussia Dortmund), Stefan Ortega (free, Arminia Bielefeld), Kalvin Phillips (£45m, Leeds), Sergio Gomez (£11m, Anderlecht), Manuel Akanji (£16.7m, Borussia Dortmund).",
      "They could have signed a team of Phillips’ and this still would have been one of the best. Haaland and Akanji from Dortmund is surely among the best double transfer window swoops in history."

      "Liverpool will hope Florian Wirtz can become one of the finest signings made by a Premier League champion, but Manchester United will take some budging.",
      "And no, we don’t mean that time they signed Michael Owen.",
      "",
      "10) Erling Haaland\n“We cannot replace him, we cannot,” said Pep Guardiola through tears induced by Sergio Aguero’s farewell match, in which the Argentinean inevitably scored twice from the bench.",
      "The Manchester City manager had lied equally absurdly a month or so before, stating that “because of the economic situation in the world right now, we are not going to sign a striker next season”.",
      "Haaland arrived in a £200m package soon after and is now within five places of Aguero on the club’s all-time top scorer list after just three seasons. Although it somehow remains unclear whether Manchester City are better without a Proper Striker or not.",
      "READ: Liverpool can easily make top five first transfer windows for Premier League champions this century",
      "",
      "9) Ruud van Nistelrooy\nNot even a mess of medicals could prevent Manchester United from eventually pushing through the British record capture of Van Nistelrooy, the player Sir Alex Ferguson believed would help translate domestic dominance into consistency on the European front.",
      "In his five seasons, Manchester United’s Champions League performances in chronological order were: semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16, group stage. It did not work as planned.",
      "But three trophies for 150 goals in 219 appearances is a neat summary of how a phenomenal individual thrived in a slightly less functional team. Manchester United won three consecutive titles before Van Nistelrooy arrived, with Dwight Yorke’s 20 goals in 1999/2000 the most any player mustered in any of those seasons. The Dutchman beat that tally in three campaigns, equalled it in another and only fell short once because of injury.",
      "Yet Van Nistelrooy left with just one Premier League title, an FA Cup and a League Cup, matched with the solitary Golden Boot he managed to snatch away from arch-nemesis Thierry Henry.",
      "",
      "8) Freddie Ljungberg\nArsene Wenger felt compelled to make an exception for Ljungberg, a player he had never seen in person before sanctioning his purchase from Halmstad in 1998.",
      "“I saw Freddie Ljungberg giving a hell of a lot of problems to Martin Keown while watching him on television as he played for Sweden against England. I decided to buy him then,” the legendary Arsenal manager once said of a Euro 2000 qualifier in which Keown categorically did not feature.",
      "Whoever was tormented by a prodigious Ljungberg, it was to Arsenal’s ultimate benefit. The forward became an Invincible, the club’s second-highest Champions League appearance maker, a winner of five trophies and a wearer of lovely pants.",
      "",
      "7) Riyad Mahrez\nPerhaps the most ludicrously underappreciated Premier League player ever, Mahrez was the first signing Manchester City made as champions under Pep Guardiola. The Algerian figured they would be “successful over the coming years” and it is difficult to argue with his reasoning.",
      "Mahrez scored 78 goals and assisted 59 across five seasons at the Etihad, winning 10 trophies including a Treble and seasonal domestic sweep, and missing penalties with weird frequency.",
      "An inability to replace his productivity and knack for stepping up in the biggest games has played a significant role in Manchester City’s recent plight. Jeremy Doku wishes he was as good as peak gloves Mahrez.",
      "",
      "6) Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\nOne Irish newspaper at the time of a transformative summer for Manchester United wrote that ‘along with Karel Poborsky and Jordi Cruyff, Scandinavian duo Ronny Johnsen and Ole Gunnar Sloksjar signed for a combined fee of £2.7 million’ to ‘make up Fergie’s team of flash continentals’.",
      "Poborsky was a throwback major international tournament signing and Cruyff had the name if not the genetic brilliance, but it was the Norwegian pair of Johnsen and Sloksjar who would move the needle considerably at Old Trafford.",
      "While Johnsen was a crucial cog in the machine, Solskjaer became an adopted Mancunian for life with a surname impossible to misspell. Manchester United paid £1.5m for 366 games, 126 goals – among which was the most important in their modern history – and a sense of loyalty so strong he probably still refuses to use his old manager’s parking space.",
      "",
      "5) Ashley Cole\nBy the time Cole left Chelsea for Roma after winning seven trophies in eight years, the pawn in the controversial move which saw him swap a fading force for one just establishing itself was retiring from the game completely.",
      "Arsenal wanted £25m for their starting left-back at the start of summer 2006; they eventually relented and settled for £5m plus William Gallas.",
      "It was preposterously good business for Chelsea, who had been routinely rinsed in the market as selling clubs formed an ordinarily queue to see their exploitable riches coming a mile off. They certainly benefited from a situation of their own making with Cole, whose bridges back to Arsenal had been summarily torched, but still.",

      "",
      "4) David de Gea\nIt might not be entirely accurate but it does feel as though De Gea single-handedly prevented Manchester United from enduring as catastrophic a season as their most recent on multiple occasions over a 12-year tenure.",
      "He was the original Bruno Fernandes, a tangibly better player than most if not all his teammates yet bizarrely keen to sacrifice the best years of his career to a failing institution. Once that fax machine faltered in 2015 it seemed as though De Gea just accepted his fate as a Manchester United lifer.",
      "The club never was going to show that same loyalty as soon as the Spaniard became dispensable and their handling of his exit was amateurish. But there was a time – after a rough initiation period – when Manchester United almost accidentally possessed the finest keeper in the world.",
      "",
      "3) Rodri\nWith all things being even, it remains the case that a fit, available and peak Rodri guarantees a title win for Manchester City.",
      "The hope is that theory can be properly tested next season, but four Premier League trophies in a row have been sandwiched by a chastening first year spent learning how to foul, and a campaign entirely ruined by a knee injury.",
      "Manchester City collapsed without Rodri in 2024/25 and ongoing negotiations over a substantial pay rise suggest they know precisely how important a role he plays.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho has been told by Amorim that he has no future at the club, while Fernandes is in talks over a big-money move to Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal having offered to fall on his sword at the end of the season.",
      "A report on Monday claimed United are ‘lining up’ Sporting’s Pedro Goncalves to play in one of the No.10 spots in Amorim’s system alongside Cunha, but Ornstein has revealed a massive boost in their bid to sign Mbeumo from Brentford.",
      "It was claimed last month that United were planning to test the Premier League club’s resolve by putting in a £50m bid for the winger, who got 20 goals and eight assists this season, with Brentford “open” to selling the 25-year-old, who is entering the last 12 months of his contract.",

      "He replied: “I would say yes, even if they (the owners) have never sold in a hurry. Haste, in this case, could make potential buyers procrastinate, influencing the negotiations, so I believe that the objective (a sale) will be achieved, even if not easily and in a short time.”",

      "But a report on Monday claimed Mainoo ‘will be given the chance to return to his favoured central midfield role even though Amorim previously had trust issues if he is persuaded to sign on the dotted line in the coming months’.",
      "It’s claimed he’s ‘on course to be one of the first names on the teamsheet’ if he extends his contract, with Amorim planning to use him in one of the two central midfield positions in his 3-4-3 despite deploying him further forward in his debut season in charge.",

      "Is there a curse on Premier League transfers above £70million? Arsenal’s record signing Declan Rice has helped to buck the trend and the improvement of Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez has improved this list – but it’s still pretty grim.",
      "Including an alarming number of flops, we have ranked the 17 Premier League signings who cost £70million or more.",
      "",
      "17) Romelu Lukaku to Chelsea\nChelsea bought Romelu Lukaku for the second time in 2021, splashing out £97.5m on the Belgian, who was handed another chance to make his mark at Stamford Bridge. He had spent time on loan at West Brom and Everton during his first spell, playing the best football of his Premier League career for the latter.",
      "After a successful permanent move to the Toffees, Lukaku joined Manchester United for big money (more on that soon), before moving to Inter and then returning to Chelsea. Many – F365 included – expected him to be the signing of the season, but he flopped disastrously, digging his own grave by publicly begging Inter to re-sign him.",
      "An ill-advised interview with Sky Italia effectively ended his Chelsea career. He at least earned a loan back to Inter in 2022/23, spent 2023/24 at Roma, and finally departed for good last summer when he signed for Napoli for around £20m.",
      "",
      "16) Jadon Sancho to Manchester United\nManchester United have made some absolute howlers in the transfer market, and Sancho is among the worst. The Red Devils chased the England winger for over a year while he was at Borussia Dortmund before eventually landing him for £73m in 2021.",
      "Fast forward four years and Sancho is finished at Old Trafford. After a productive loan spell back at Dortmund, he joined Conference League winners Chelsea on loan for 2024/25. United stand to make around £25m from a sale.",
      "Arguably the most costly example of ‘Bundesliga tax’, Sancho never found his rhythm for United and any hope of revival disappeared after a public fallout with Erik ten Hag.",
      "MORE: Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Alexis, Antony in bottom two, Solskjaer buy top",
      "",
      "15) Antony to Manchester United\nAntony cost a ridiculous £80m during Ten Hag’s first summer at United, with Ajax pocketing a huge fee after the Red Devilsleft it late in the 2022 window.",
      "Known for his flair and his wand of a left foot, Antony scored on his debut against Arsenal, but it was downhill from there. He has more yellow cards (14) than goals (12) or assists (5) in 96 appearances for the Red Devils. Even without the numbers, he’s looked nowhere near a £70m+ player.",
      "His value has crashed to £16.6m on Transfermarkt, and United would’ve been lucky to get even that before his successful loan at Real Betis. Nine goals and five assists in 26 games have raised his stock, but United will still make a massive loss when he inevitably moves on this summer.",
      "",
      "14) Darwin Nunez to Liverpool\nDarwin Nunez is definitely at the right club in terms of fanbase. Liverpool supporters embraced him from day one, making him one of their own. On the pitch, though, he has often looked lost.",
      "Roberto Firmino wasn’t a prolific scorer but made Jurgen Klopp’s side tick – something Darwin has not done. At 26, time is still on his side, but he remains frustratingly raw. Arne Slot appears to have run out of patience, and a summer exit beckons.",
      "",
      "13) Kepa Arrizabalaga to Chelsea\nStill the most expensive goalkeeper of all time, Kepa joined Chelsea for a staggering £72m in 2018.",
      "Since then, he’s lost his Spain place, been replaced by Edouard Mendy – who was signed for around £56m less – and briefly regained his spot, only to lose it again. At one point, it looked like his Chelsea career was over.",
      "Somehow, he found himself as Real Madrid’s No.1 for part of 2023/24 and then shone at Bournemouth this term. He’ll likely join the south coast club permanently. He never justified his fee, but he has at least salvaged his reputation.",
      "",
      "12) Nicolas Pepe to Arsenal\nPepe cost Arsenal £72m in 2019. There was talk that Unai Emery preferred Wilfried Zaha, but was handed Pepe instead. This Arsenal fan was thrilled at the time. Poor, yet devilishly handsome, sod.",
      "Pepe is widely seen as a flop, but he did have moments. He was crucial in the 2020 FA Cup win, contributing in the semi-final and final. Eighteen goal contributions in his debut season wasn’t awful, just not what you’d want from a big-money signing.",
      "In 2020/21, he hit 21 goal involvements – including 10 league goals – and came second in Arsenal’s Player of the Year vote. But the Gunners finished eighth, so, yeah. He returned to France with Nice, and his contract was terminated in 2023 after no Saudi takers emerged.",
      "",
      "11) Harry Maguire to Manchester United\nSigned for £80m from Leicester in 2019, Maguire did well enough under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to be handed the captaincy – which only added to the pressure already weighing him down.",
      "That pressure might explain his struggles. His resurgence in 2023/24, after being stripped of the armband, suggests as much. £80m was clearly too much, but he hasn’t been that bad.",
      "",
      "10) Paul Pogba to Manchester United\nWhat a player on his day. Pogba returned to United in 2016 for a world-record £89m after being released by the club four years earlier.",
      "His first season was actually very good – nine goals, six assists, and two trophies under Jose Mourinho. He scored in the Europa League final win over Ajax. But that was as good as it got.",
      "He posted decent numbers in 17/18 and 18/19 but injuries and inconsistency plagued his second stint. He left again for free in 2022 and is currently a free agent due to a doping ban. A strange, often frustrating career.",
      "",
      "9) Wesley Fofana to Chelsea\nChelsea chased Fofana for a while before finally coughing up around £70m. There was even talk of him breaking Maguire’s record fee for a defender.",
      "He made just 17 Premier League appearances in 2022/23 and missed all of last season with yet another serious injury. After a promising start to 2024/25, he got injured and dropped down the pecking order behind Trevoh Chalobah and Levi Colwill.",
      "He hasn’t played since March and has only featured twice in 2025. Injuries are absolutely ruining his career.",
      "",
      "8) Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United\nBetween Chelsea stints, Lukaku found himself at Old Trafford after United paid £75m following his prolific Everton spell (87 goals in 166 games).",
      "He never looked a good fit, but 55 goal contributions in 96 games isn’t terrible. And being sold for just £8m less than he cost keeps this spell off the disaster list.",
      "",
      "7) Kai Havertz to Chelsea\nChelsea paid £72m for Havertz and got a Champions League-winning goal out of it. That’s enough to secure his legacy, but the rest of his time in blue was underwhelming.",
      "They somehow sold him to Arsenal for £65m – a miracle, given his numbers. He’s found form again as a striker under Mikel Arteta, but in terms of Chelsea value for money, he just about breaks even.",
      "",
      "6) Enzo Fernandez to Chelsea\nBritish record signing Enzo Fernandez joined in January 2023 for a reported £107m. He didn’t do much wrong – but didn’t do much, full stop – until Enzo Maresca arrived.",
      "After starring at the 2022 World Cup, Fernandez struggled under multiple managers, but 2024/25 saw him thrive. He’s still not quite justified the fee, but he’s well on the way.",
      "READ: Top 10 Premier League transfer overpays of all time includes two Man Utd players",
      "",
      "5) Josko Gvardiol to Manchester City\nCity usually nail transfers, especially big ones. Josko Gvardiol arrived as one of the best young defenders in the world, though early struggles led some to believe Nathan Ake was still first choice.",
      "But the Croatian adapted quickly and was arguably the Premier League’s best defender in the second half of 2023/24. He dipped slightly after that, but so did all of City. No cause for concern.",
      "",
      "4) Jack Grealish to Manchester City\nCity paid £100m for Grealish, which is still eye-watering. He took time to adapt to Pep Guardiola’s system, and goal numbers remained modest – but he was vital in their Treble-winning season.",
      "Sixteen goal contributions in 2022/23 doesn’t tell the full story; he was key. However, after a disappointing 2024/25, a summer exit feels likely.",
      "",
      "3) Moises Caicedo to Chelsea\nCaicedo’s debut performance against West Ham could be described as catastrophic and it set the tone for an uncertain first few months.",
      "But slowly, Caicedo grew into the role. By the end of the 2023/24 season, he was a dependable, all-action midfield presence – and under Enzo Maresca, he’s been a revelation. His energy, tactical awareness and ball-winning ability make Chelsea tick, and while £115m still looks wild on paper, he’s been brilliant this season. Easily one of the best midfielders in the league.",
      "",
      "2) Declan Rice to Arsenal\nDeclan Rice has been sensational since joining Arsenal for £105m in the summer of 2023. Signed as a statement of intent, the England international has done more than justify the fee – he’s become the heartbeat of Arteta’s side.",
      "Whether deployed as a deep-lying six or a box-to-box eight, Rice has delivered elite performances. He reads the game superbly, breaks up play, leads by example and chips in with big goals – including a few belting free-kicks. His consistency and mentality have lifted Arsenal a level.",
      "This is the kind of transfer clubs dream of. No drama, no adaptation period, no regrets. Just class.",
      "",
      "1) Virgil van Dijk to Liverpool\nThis was never in doubt. Liverpool spent £76m on Virgil van Dijk in January 2018 and got one of the greatest defenders the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "His impact was instant. Liverpool went from leaky and flaky to serious contenders overnight. Within 18 months, they’d won the Champions League. Then came the Premier League title. Van Dijk became PFA Player of the Year, UEFA Men’s Player of the Year and finished second in the Ballon d’Or.",
      "More than the trophies or individual accolades, it’s the sheer authority he brought to Liverpool’s backline that stands out. Calm, dominant, and impossibly consistent – he remains the gold standard for defensive signings.",

      "",
      "19) Roony Bardghji (FC Copenhagen)\nHe’s been injured for almost as long as he has been linked with Tottenham.",

      "",
      "17) Tariq Lamptey (Brighton)\nWolves, Fulham and Sporting Lisbon have all been interested in the pocket rocket.",
      "",
      "16) Alex Meret (Napoli)\nWon Serie A as Napoli’s first-choice goalkeeper and so the smart money is on a two-year extension.",
      "",
      "15) Cristiano Ronaldo (Al-Nassr)\nRonaldo reportedly wants the club to sack their manager, director and presumably half the players; he’s the Saudi Pro League top scorer but he has only one trophy to show for two-and-a-half years in the desert. He is hot property ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "",
      "14) Mario Pasalic (Atalanta)\nSpent six years at Chelsea without playing a single game but has played almost 300 matches for Atalanta. Neither club nor player is likely to call an end to that in the summer; an extension is very likely.",
      "",
      "13) Kenny Tete (Fulham)\nAfter a one-year extension was triggered last summer, there is talk of the can being kicked even further down the road.",
      "",
      "12) Josh Brownhill (Burnley)\nThere are links to a West Ham move that sound like the most West Ham move ever.",

      "",
      "10) Neymar (Santos)\nHe’s back in Brazil after his contract in Saudi Arabia was terminated. His idea is to get fit and then return to Europe; Santos’ idea is to milk this for all it’s worth and persuade him to stay until the World Cup in 2026. The problem? He is perma-injured.",
      "",
      "9) Kyle Walker-Peters (Southampton)\nHe has more than served his dues and a whole host of mid-table Premier League sides should be interested after he exits the club following a second relegation.",
      "",
      "8) CG Egan-Riley (Burnley)\nA mainstay of one of the meanest defences in Championship history, and it looks like it might earn him a move to Strasbourg.",
      "",
      "7) Dominic Calvert-Lewin (Everton)\nInitially reluctant to commit himself to the unstable Toffees and will likely have his pick of mid-table Premier League clubs on a free transfer. Tottenham are said to be very predictably interested.",

      "6) Lionel Messi (Inter Miami)\nApparently set to sign a new one-year contract and potentially play in the World Cup at the age of 38/39.",

      "",
      "4) Olivier Boscagli (PSV)\nThe ball-playing centre-half looks bound for Brighton despite some interest from Inter.",
      "",
      "3) Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City)\nThe departure has already been announced for perhaps Manchester City’s greatest player. MLS seems a likely next career move, though there is some cheeky talk of Liverpool, which we absolutely love.",
      "",
      "2) Leroy Sane (Bayern Munich)\nThe talk from Munich was that Bayern would not make Sane a new contract offer until March/April because his performances lacked consistency. And he’s since been named Bayern Player of the Month for March. But the two parties are far enough apart to apparently alert Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham.",
      "",
      "1) Jonathan David (Lille)\nWould have been an excellent signing for Manchester United but somehow remains at Lille despite being one of the top scorers of 2024. Could he sign for Manchester City as an Erling Haaland back-up? Or could he be the missing striker link at Arsenal or Liverpool? Tottenham Hotspur, Juventus, Napoli, Newcastle United and Aston Villa have all been linked and it seems that Napoli may emerge top of the pile.",
      "Including an alarming number of flops, Virgil van Dijk and Declan Rice, we have ranked the 17 Premier League signings who cost £70m or more.",
      "Trent Alexander-Arnold has finally been confirmed as a Real Madrid player, but the fee they will pay to land him for the Club World Cup has been disputed.",
      "Liverpool have confirmed that they have ‘accepted an offer’ from Real Madrid to allow Trent Alexander-Arnold to join the Spanish giants early.",

You sell marginal, fringe, surplus to requirement and/or underperforming players to raise additional funds to sign quality players to complement, support and play with your best players.

They should have let Ten Hag go last summer but they didn’t and now it feels like the same mistake all over again.",

United need to punch above their current financial might, that is another Rafa specially. I don’t even think the United fans could hate him after the shitshow of finish 2 places above relegation and losing the worst European final in living memory to “Lads, it’s Spurs”.",

Look at what he achieved at Chelsea with the fans booing him every game… Imagine what he could achieve with the squad United have, the support they have and the Stadium they play in. It’s a stone cold fact.",

      "Ronaldo is out of contract in Saudi Arabia at the end of June, and he recently hinted that his Al Nassr journey is coming to an end.",
      "He wrote on social media: “This chapter is over. The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.”",
      "There have been strong links to clubs competing in this summer’s Club World Cup, with Brazilian side Botafogo and Mexican outfit Monterrey – where ex-Real Madrid team-mate Sergio Ramos currently plays – reportedly serious contenders.",

      "Transfer journalist Jorge Nicola reported that the 40-year-old has been offered “a percentage of shares”, with Textor eager to sign the Manchester United legend ahead of the Club World Cup.",
      "“This offer includes the possibility of becoming a partner with John Textor in his clubs,” Nicola said.",

      "What the hell were Manchester United doing in Malaysia? Are they mad? They should all be lying down in a dark room, trying to forget how bad they’ve been. It’s like they’re just pretending everything is normal when it’s an absolute bin fire. This is no way to run a business and certainly not a football club.",
      "It doesn’t take the wisdom of Solomon to realise a) earning £7.8million from a trip to Malaysia is peanuts which they routinely fritter away on poor players and which they could surely drum up through a commercial deal for United-endorsed pressed duck feet or something, b) they’ll ruin the brand further by losing games and playing poorly, c) the players will be exhausted and humiliated by being beaten, which means they’ll not be rested or inspired for a new season, meaning more failure, and d) there’s a limit to how much you can charge to see such a terrible team, putting off more fans than they can attract, making them feel resentful towards the club. Things are going downhill and fast, aided by Airhead Jim’s lack of basic business acumen.",
      "The club clearly sees the players like donkeys at the beach, forgetting that they are actually human. Does anyone think the best way to get over an appalling season is to get booed off in Malaysia? Actually booed off in Kuala Lumpur by people who had paid up to £260 to witness these sweating bodies being hopeless. These have been loyal followers, prepared to pay to see the club, even in the knowledge it likely won’t be the first team.",
      "That is no way to enhance your brand, to say the least. Do you think they’ll keep buying merchandise in these circumstances? You do, don’t you, Ratcliffe, you fool.",
      "Only a mean, insensitive cretin like thick-as-a-brick Jim would think this is a good idea. The manager obviously doesn’t have any confidence, saying, “We don’t have it in us not to choke in every exercise, in every game – that is what happened. I always feel guilty for the performance of the team since the first game I was here,” as he continues his ‘please sack me’ campaign in earnest.",
      "This sort of overseas tour fails to see that every season is just one part of every year; what you do in the summer influences what happens in the new campaign. Players don’t just reboot in mid-August and start fresh again and I really don’t think this is appreciated. Given that pre-season will start in mid-July and internationals are in the second week of June, they’ve all got about four weeks’ rest, unless Stupid Wurzel has got another trip planned, probably to the Arctic to play Eskimos.",
      "They obviously need a good rest and a re-set, not flogging even harder. They’re no good and don’t play well together, but it’s not a lack of games to blame. The football matters. It should be at the core but it seems almost incidental. Losing to sides you should easily beat just makes everything, on all levels, worse. Just playing terribly in more games isn’t going to make them improve. Even winning occasionally has proved to be nothing but a blip in a long-term trend.",
      "Failure is endemic and needs correcting from the boardroom to the pitch. And to do all this just after the season ended seems more akin to punishment. And don’t forget, players need to be sold and desperately. Given how mediocre they are, exposing their inadequacy is probably a bad idea if you want to get rid of them (and why wouldn’t you?) and want to get a decent price for them.",
      "They already have little or no leverage as it is; getting beaten in Malaysia just makes it easier for buyers to drive down the price, giving them less money to replace them with. How did this stupid actually become a billionaire?",
      "These things don’t take a degree in Business Studies to work out. It seems there is no limit to some people’s ability to see black as white as they go about their business, doubtless wondering who broke all the china in the shop and sh*t up the walls, completely unaware it’s them.",
      "It’s clear the people involved in driving this juggernaut don’t know where they’re going, haven’t even got a driving licence and are wearing a blindfold. Put more prosaically, they’re sh*te. The trouble is, they don’t realise, even as they plough the juggernaut into the sea. They think they’re great and can do no wrong, even as the once-great edifice crumbles to dust at their feet. Their delusion is total. But you can’t tell stupid people they’re stupid because they’re too stupid to understand.",
      "Their obsession with generating money is making them worse and effectively crippling them. I repeat, £7.8 million, that’s all they’re generating by doing this. That’s 10% of an Antony. It’ll pay a player’s wages for approximately four months. In return they get a knackered, demoralised squad and a devalued, reviled brand. Is it worth it? Only a fool would say yes. But that’s exactly who is in charge. Shambolic."

      "But at the same time he has absolutely earned the right to fail on his own terms now and the fact Levy seems so determined to let all the air out of the balloon so soon after Spurs fans got the one thing they have craved above all else for at least a decade is just maddeningly yet entirely Spurs.",

      "Man Utd lost out on the signing of Liam Delap to Chelsea; they are at risk of losing Bruno Fernandes to Al Hilal; but have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves; can Ruben Amorim offer something of a clean slate with signings suited to fit his style - or is the clean-up job simply too big?",
      "By Laura Hunter",
      "Tuesday 3 June 2025 08:51, UK",
      "Manchester United's peak powers of persuasion have long faded - but has the erosion been so protracted and so damaging that they have now lost all sense of appeal for players searching for their next big move?",
      "Back in early May, Man Utd were the club in pole position to sign sought-after striker Liam Delap from Ipswich. There were positive noises from Delap, too, thought to be open to playing under Ruben Amorim.",
      "But there was a catch. Delap's final decision was likely to be swayed by the glitz and glam of Champions League football, something Man Utd could not offer.",
      "In his own words, the forward, whose release clause is a modest £30m, chose Chelsea because of their style of play, as well as ambition to win things. Ouch.",
      "A bright, young English talent like Delap, who has connections to Manchester having spent five years at Man City, preferring to join Chelsea because the project has better immediate appeal will hurt Man Utd bosses. And so it should.",
      "Perhaps it's a timely reality check.",
      "United's place in the pecking order has tumbled over the past decade. Christopher Vivell and Jason Wilcox, the club chiefs shaping the recruitment strategy, are not permitted to fish in the same talent pools their predecessors once were. Economically and commercially, the club have fallen on much tougher times, no longer considered the destination club.",
      "Gone are the days where Europe's best players would scramble to sign for Man Utd. To represent one of the biggest, most successful footballing dynasties used to be a statement. A confirmation of elite.",
      "But modern-day Man Utd, the kind that finishes 15th in the Premier League and loses European finals to Tottenham, previously trophyless for 17 years, does not attract nor retain world-class talent.",
      "Former captain Roy Keane has been bullish in his belief that Man Utd's pulling power has all but disappeared: \"I think the days of everyone wanting to go to Manchester United are gone,\" he said in May.",
      "\"What are the positives with this team? You look at United and go, they're not really good at anything.\" Again, ouch.",
      "Bruno Fernandes being approached by Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, whether a deal is struck or not, is symbolic of how far the Premier League's former leading force have fallen.",
      "If Fernandes were to leave, Amorim would not only lose his best player, but his captain too. And perhaps the only individual to emerge from this campaign of catastrophe with any grace. Few could have shouldered the turmoil with such defiance and poise.",
      "As Amorim has acknowledged: \"We need more Brunos.\" Imagine the impact of fewer?",
      "Of course, Man Utd have been beaten to big-name signings before. Eden Hazard famously chose Chelsea over Man Utd back in 2012 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge, albeit he was nearing the end of his reign. Delap's snub won't define this next era. But recent market mishaps might.",
      "United have signed plenty of young talent in recent windows, all for inflated fees despite having no obvious competition for the player. Jadon Sancho, Antony and Rasmus Hojlund can all be categorised similarly, costing a combined total of £226m. They are worth a fraction of that now.",
      "The signing of 19-year-old defender Leny Yoro, widely considered to be one of the brightest young talents in the game, and pursued by both Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain, seemed to buck the trend last July.",
      "But that was before another season - their worst since suffering relegation in 1973/74 - unravelled so publicly. Attempting to replicate the same transfer coup has surely become infinitely harder, if not impossible.",
      "Amorim has been reluctant to sound the panic alarm, trying to rally with honest and heartfelt rhetoric, but even he looks drained by the monotony of underperformance and the turbulence that carries. Finding players suitable to the manager's requirements has got to be the overriding focus this summer. And yet, such a targeted approach to fit a very precise style brings with it its own risk.",
      "\"I'm not worried about the money, we are a big brand,\" Amorim said ahead of the Europa League final loss to Spurs.",
      "Surely Man Utd's status as a 'big brand' is under serious threat, though? This is a club unrecognisable from its Sir Alex heyday. Only a few weeks ago it was reported that INEOS boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns a 29 per cent stake, had seen his personal wealth drop by £6.5bn (a 25 per cent loss) since investing 18 months ago. This downward trajectory shows little sign of reversing.",
      "Amorim's firmness with Marcus Rashford meant United spent the second half of the season without their most experienced Premier League scorer. His 20-year United career looks to be finished. Sancho wants out permanently. Alejandro Garnacho has used social media to underline his determination to leave too.",
      "Ultimately, the hollowing out of United's core has been happening for years. There is nothing new about instability on the pitch or off it, nor player-manager spats that have further served to undermine - one might circle back to the Erik ten Hag vs Sancho saga, or Cristiano Ronaldo's messy exile before that.",
      "And yet, throughout all the upheaval and unrest, there are glimmers of promise. Man Utd have signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves. A good move on paper. Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo is reportedly open to the project too.",
      "There is still time for Yoro, and Manuel Ugarte and even Hojlund to come good.",
      "And they still possess one of the game's most highly thought of young coaches. Amorim has the unenviable job of knitting the past and present together to create something coherent before Man Utd can hope to make any real progress.",
      "A job easier said than done, but the alternative does not bear thinking about."

      "\"You'll remember that Cunha signed a new contract with Wolves in February, but that included this £62.5m release clause.",
      "\"Not only was there a release clause, there were conditions attached to it as well and it meant any club who met the clause had to pay it in three instalments.",

      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off the cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",

      "Following the news Wolves' Matheus Cunha has completed his move to Manchester United, Adam Bate analyses what the Brazilian forward could bring to Old Trafford, reflecting on conversations with the man himself as well as Cunha's team-mates at Molineux...",
      "Monday 2 June 2025 12:20, UK",
      "Speaking to Matheus Cunha at Wolves' training ground last summer, it was a chance to ask him how important it is for him to feel like he is having fun on the football pitch. \"I do not want to go on the pitch and be a robot,\" he replied. \"I want to enjoy it.\"",
      "Watch Cunha play and that approach to the game shines through. At times, he can appear to wander where he chooses, making decisions off-the-cuff. But those decisions are often thrilling. He is a maverick in a sport that feels more and more coached.",
      "In the context of Gary Neville's comments about April's Manchester derby being \"boring\", and the confirmation of the forward's move to Man Utd, it all makes Cunha one of the more intriguing transfer stories of the summer window.",
      "Why? Because on one level Cunha makes perfect sense in one of those No 10 roles within Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. He already played there for Wolves. He can score goals but also create them for others. His £62.5m release fee offered clarity for United.",
      "On the other hand, there are questions about his temperament and while Cunha, who turned 26 in May, is at the right age to make the big move of his career, some will ask if he can adapt to the demands and deliver consistently within an organised pressing structure.",
      "For example, one alarming statistic that has been picked up on is the fact that the Premier League tracking data reveals no outfield player spends a higher percentage of their time walking than Cunha. He is an outlier, someone who does things differently.",
      "\"I am an emotional guy.\" Cunha was self-aware enough to say that during our conversation. But it has not stopped him serving two significant suspensions since then, losing control after a defeat to Ipswich and during an FA Cup tie at Bournemouth.",
      "Cunha has been outspoken in calling out local journalists and even bloggers in Wolverhampton following criticism during the 2024/25 season. He was a popular figure with fans but one head coach Vitor Pereira says needs to feel the love from those around him.",
      "United may have had a few of those in their history, but being high maintenance at Wolves is one thing, being that way at Old Trafford is another. Even so, Cunha has the talent to become a folk hero. He is still a significant upgrade on their forward options at present.",
      "Gomes adds: \"He is a very creative player. Sometimes he has the ball and a lot of players around him but he can go and create a chance and make an assist and make a goal. It is very good to have a player like this because any minute he can score a goal.\"",
      "While Gomes talks of Cunha's \"shooting and passing\" as well as his \"intelligence with the ball\", speak to Wolves captain Nelson Semedo, who has played with both Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and he offers a fascinating assessment of Cunha as a human being.",
      "Semedo does not doubt the talent. \"He is Brazilian! It is natural.\" And sees a player coming towards his peak years. \"In his prime, I would say.\" Most interestingly, he tells a tale from the game between Wolves and Manchester United at Molineux in December.",
      "\"I think he is the kind of player who is never, ever happy with what he has, he always wants more, more, more. That is why sometimes we have to calm him down because I remember something from that game against United when we were winning 1-0.",
      "\"We were managing the game, not attacking every time, just being compact sometimes. He had a chance. I cannot remember who he gave the ball to but he was waiting for a pass back into the space for him to go.\" The pass did not come. \"He just got upset.\"",
      "Semedo explains: \"I think what we needed in that period of the game was just to be [compact]. But this [reaction] is because he wants more, because he is so ambitious. That is really good. It is why he is this good. I am pretty sure he will get even better.\"",
      "He tips Cunha for \"big things\", acknowledging that as Wolves' star player he found himself targeted - \"everywhere we play, they have an eye on Cunha\" - before making another pertinent point. \"And he is a very specific player,\" says Semedo. That is the crux of it.",
      "There are not many players like Cunha out there, a ball-carrier who operates across the front line, with the frame of a target man but the pace and trickery of a winger. At the moment, Amorim is forcing the pieces to fit. But there is a place for Cunha.",
      "He is at his best operating as a wide forward in that left channel. From there, he can play angled passes, cut in or run around the outside. Importantly, as he has demonstrated over the past two seasons, he can score goals from those zones to support the striker.",
      "Gary O'Neil attempted to convert Cunha into a striker himself in his first full season at Wolves, a necessity given the lack of options at his disposal. It was a challenge because those instincts did not come easily to him. He is unlikely to be United's answer as a No 9.",
      "Speaking to O'Neil about this issue at the time, he outlined the problem. \"He obviously has some fantastic individual attributes that can unlock things and get you up the pitch, but every time the ball is crossed I need my No 9 to be a threat. You have to be,\" he said.",
      "\"If you use [Erling] Haaland as the best example, he can go minutes without touching the ball but he is constantly making runs threatening the back line, making space for others, and you know that as soon as the ball comes across he is going to be sliding in.\"",
      "O'Neil tried to hammer home these points to Cunha. \"People actually watching the game will see that he came off the front, did a little turn, popped it to the winger. Great. But how many goals has he got? How many assists has he got?\" He had some success.",
      "The numbers improved, Cunha even scoring a hat-trick away to Chelsea. But he has remained a player who prefers the ball to feet rather than gambling on the ball falling his way inside the six-yard box. Pereira actually moved him further from the goal.",
      "With Jorgen Strand Larsen the reference point, Cunha often picked the ball up deeper, on that half turn with space to run into. United had another glimpse of that when he won the free-kick from which Pablo Sarabia scored the winner at Old Trafford.",
      "More striking was his player-of-the-match performance in the game there in the previous season, one United won 1-0 nevertheless as Andre Onana escaped punishment for what looked like a clear foul on Sasa Kalajdzic inside the penalty box during stoppage time.",
      "In a sense, that one evening against United highlights the Cunha conundrum in microcosm. He was outstanding, illustrating perfectly what the home side were missing. But when O'Neil substituted the tiring forward late in the game, he handled it badly.",
      "He admitted as much in that conversation last summer. \"One of my best games was against United at Old Trafford and he changed me. I started to think, 'Oh my god, this season will be hard with this coach. It is my best game and he is changing me, what can I do?'\"",
      "When Wolves were beaten in the next game, it proved too much for Cunha. \"I did not have a good reaction after two games and started to do crazy things saying training was not the best and Gary came to me and said, 'I am with you, I am not your enemy.'\"",
      "O'Neil talked Cunha around and the rest is history - culminating in two strong seasons that have earned him acclaim, a new contract and a big move too. Man Utd will be getting a special talent. But definitely no robot."

      "Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho, Jonny Evans and Amad Diallo were among 11 changes at half-time with the score locked at 0-0, but Maung Maung Lwin netted a 71st-minute winner for the South-East Asia XI to inflict another defeat on Amorim's struggling side.",
      "United were booed in parts for their lacklustre display by those in attendance and, reacting to his side's reception in the Malaysian capital, Amorim said: \"I'm always guilty of the performance of the team, no matter what. Since I've been here from the first day, I am guilty. The boos from the fans is something that we need, maybe. Because every game we lost in the Premier League, they [fans] were always there [supporting].",
      "\"It's like the way of playing, if they see that it's not working, they will change the way they behave. But I felt when we finished and walked away, the supporters were with us. But, again, let's wait for the next season.\"",
      "Amorim described United's season as \"disastrous\" after they finished 15th in the Premier League and lost to Tottenham in the Europa League final - and their poor form continued at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.",
      "Garnacho played the entire second half amid doubts over his future at the club, as did Fernandes, who has attracted interest from Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal.",
      "A host of academy youngsters were given minutes which will be seen as the only positive from the defeat in front of a crowd of 72,550, more than 6,000 miles away from Old Trafford.",
      "United will play another friendly in Hong Kong on Friday for their final fixture of the tour which is reportedly set to earn the club £8m.",
      "Chief executive Omar Berrada said before the friendly defeat that United will balance \"ambition\" with the need to be \"prudent\" in the transfer market.",
      "United's defeat to Spurs meant they missed out on silverware and Champions League qualification worth an estimated £100m, and the club have wasted little time trying to improve Amorim's side with Wolves forward Matheus Cunha set to sign.",
      "It could start a busy summer in terms of incomings and outgoings at Old Trafford, with chief executive Berrada confident about United's plans.",
      "\"I can't talk about specifics, but I can say that we've been planning for many months now,\" he told MUTV. \"We were ready for all the different scenarios, so now we know what we need to do.",
      "\"We have a very clear idea of where we need to invest in the squad to improve, so (technical director) Jason (Wilcox), his team, Ruben have been in talks for many months.",
      "\"Now it's a question of executing that plan and doing it in a way that is prudent but at the same time with ambition.\"",
      "United's defeat in Malaysia came a week to the day since their Europa League final loss in Spain and just three days on from beating Aston Villa 2-0 in their Premier League finale at Old Trafford.",
      "Amorim told fans that \"the good days are coming\" as the head coach apologised for a wretched campaign during an impassioned end-of-season address.",
      "United chief executive Berrada said: \"Ruben spoke really well on Sunday and he's right: the past is the past.",
      "\"It's important to learn. Now we need to stay together, stay united and I can only say again thank you to the fans.",
      "\"The owner has also been very supportive in this transition year and now we just need to work really hard and do everything we can to bring the club back to the top.",
      "\"I'm very excited about what's coming ahead of us. Like Ruben said, now we just need to work really hard as a unit, as a club and I'm sure the good days will be back, as he said.\""
