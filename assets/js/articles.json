      "Two-time Premier League champion Joe Hart has admitted he \"never had a conversation\" with Carlos Tevez during their stint together at Manchester City. The former England shot-stopper confessed he never engaged in any meaningful dialogue with the Argentinian unless he was \"having an argument.\"",
      "Hart, 38, arrived at the Etihad from Shrewsbury Town in 2006 and had already established himself as City's No. 1 when Tevez made the controversial switch from Manchester United in 2009. But Hart revealed all on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet, including how their relationship was strictly business for the most part.",
      "One might expect a squad capable of such historic success to be incredibly close-knit, with strong relationships forged away from the field. However, that wasn't quite the reality for that legendary City team, particularly between Hart and Tevez, who had previously been rivals in the Manchester derby.",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "\"I always wanted to get on with everyone,\" said Hart. \"It's only when I look back and I laugh and I think, like I had nothing to do with the strikers unless I was having an argument with them, having banter. Knew nothing about them personally.",
      "\"And Carlos is a great example, Tevez. I was in a recent golf event with him, and I've never been slightly nervous to see someone again, because I've always got on with people. And Carlos, don't me wrong. [But] I never had a conversation with him.\"",
      "It's extraordinary to consider two team-mates could spend four years at the same club without engaging in any substantial dialogue. A language barrier certainly didn't help matters, particularly as Tevez has admitted he deliberately avoided learning English.",
      "Beyond their Premier League triumph together, Hart and Tevez also clinched the FA Cup one season prior in 2011. However, despite any apprehension Hart might have harboured about their eventual reunion, those concerns swiftly melted away in what proved to be a \"nice moment\" for both men.",
      "\"I worked with him a long time, but he didn't really have a conversation with many people,\" he continued. \"Because he was just focused, and I don't hold that against him. You don't have to be best friends.",
      "\"I was actually thinking, 'When I bump into him, is he even going to remember that we played together?' And then I bumped into him, and he couldn't have been more welcoming, delighted.",
      "\"And I was like, 'Carlos, I didn't even know if we were going to say hello. I remember you, you just said when I played, when I play, that was how I was.' He was just a totally different person. And it was quite a nice moment actually.\"",
      "Hart and Tevez were a bit of a culture shock in the City squad, hailing from two distinct eras of the club's history. Tevez was one of the big-ticket purchases made shortly after Abu Dhabi took over, while Hart was one of the few remnants of the pre-Abu Dhabi era who managed to keep his place in City's plans.",
      "It's understandable there was a difference in stature between the two, with Tevez being a much bigger star by the time he arrived at the Etihad. However, as it turns out, being on conversational terms isn't always necessary for achieving greatness together.",

      "Former Manchester United flop Antony dodged being shown a red card despite the Real Betis star appearing to headbutt an opponent in the Europa League on Thursday night.",
      "The La Liga side were taking on Dutch outfit Utrecht in Europe and Antony looked to have an unsavoury moment with their left-back Souffian El Karouani. The duo had several scuffles in the lead up to the incident, which occurred after 21 minutes.",
      "On this occasion they were battling for possession and El Karouani looked to grab hold of the winger, who clearly took issue, with footage showing that Antony appeared to take a look at the defender before aiming a headbutt in his direction.",
      "El Karouani immediately went down clutching his head, but Antony was not punished. The referee made no decision on the pitch and, even after VAR intervened to have a second look, his antics were cleared.",
      "Antony already knows he's facing one suspension after being sent-off in the final minute of their 1-1 draw over Girona last week - which means he will now miss the Andalusian derby against Betis' fierce rivals Sevilla this weekend.",
      "Utrecht will have been further angered by Antony's reprieve when he laid on Betis' opening goal of the night, scored by Cucho Hernandez. The Spanish side were without leading light Isco but still managed to maintain their unbeaten start in the Europa League as they sit in the qualification spots.",
      "Betis doubled their lead through Abde Ezzalzouli in the 50th minute and even though Utrecht pulled a goal back with an stunning strike from the halfway line courtesy of Miguel Rodriguez, it was still the Spaniards who picked up the three points.",
      "Antony will be glad he dodged a second red card in five days having been given his marching orders after kicking a Girona player in the face as he attempted an overhead kick. The winger, who made his move to Betis a permanent one in the summer, was initially shown a yellow card by the referee which was then upgraded after VAR recommended an on pitch review.",
      "Betis have attempted to appeal against Antony's three-match ban, but that was waved away and the club are now thought to be considering an appeal with to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.",

      "Every Premier League fan knows their home jersey inside out, from stitch to stitch. They probably know all of their rivals' home kits too.",
      "But what about those rarely-seen third strips? There are some beauties released this year - but also some absolute shockers.",
      "The City third kit was designed with the lovely Mancunian weather in mind. With a neon trim and unusual rain droplet design, this shirt has been criticised heavily by fans and rivals alike.",
      "The brightness of the neon paired with the dreary grey rain background has landed City at the bottom of the table - somewhere they are definitely not used to in recent years.",
      "£60 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "The Bees' third kit features a bright blue background with a brown and pink stripe across the breast of the top. The club's badge is centered in the middle of the chest with just a small brown and pink trim at the collar of the shirt.",
      "While the club's original colours are featured in this rare shirt, the placement of said hues do nothing to flatter the wearer and are rather mismatched across the entire design.",
      "£65 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Brighton had the bright idea to stop the overconsumption of football merchandising by using last season's away kit as this year's third kit.",
      "The away kit has already been seen many times over the last year, which includes a yellow design with black vertical stripes and the club's badge standing out on the breast.",
      "While this kit is not unappealing on the eye, it is not new from last season so it lands low down on the list.",
      "£65 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Tottenham's third kit for this season pays homage to the 1982 FA Cup winning team, with a vibrant yellow base and blue detailing around the chest and shoulders to give it a retro feel.",
      "However, the old-fashioned design is paired with the new sponsors and a disappearing neckline - as well as the surprise blue block of colour on the back - which makes it feel like a poor attempt at an old classic.",
      "£84.99 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "The 2025/26 third kit for Bournemouth is a pastel pink number with purple accents. Pink kits are coupled with success in the Cherries' recent history.",
      "They famously beat the likes of Newcastle and Crystal Palace away in the 2015/16 season to stay in the Premier League as fellow Championship hoppers Leicester City won the title that same year.",
      "It is relatively basic so isn't any higher on the list for this reason.",
      "£65 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "West Ham's alternative kit is a new take on a pretty plain classic. The badge is enlarged and features only the two famous hammers which are synonymous with the club.",
      "Other than this unique feature, the rest of the shirt is not exceptional with gold accents and a split collar.",
      "£67.50 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Newcastle's strip is a throwback to their European adventures in the late 1990s. The kit, which features a navy blue base with orange accents, is inspired by their 1997 Champions League season.",
      "This season featured a famous 3-2 win against Barcelona and a 2-0 win over Dynamo Kyiv too. However, it isn't anything special so is midtable in this list.",
      "£84 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Nottingham Forest have followed the Adidas trend of the slim bars down the sides of the kit giving a feel of the iconic strips from the 90s. This third shirt is a navy blue and black design with red hems in a smart colour contrast.",
      "However, as with many of the midtable strips, this isn't exactly blowing anybody's socks off.",
      "£75 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Everton went more out of the box with their third kit design that stands out among the rest - but not exactly for the best reasons. The black base features yellow and blue zigzag patterns in a horizontal fashion across the entire top, which is said to be inspired by the areas surrounding the new Hill Dickinson Stadium.",
      "While it is admirable that the Toffees have branched out more in their third kit design, a lot is left to be said for the choices made.",
      "£48 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Leeds United are another team who went all or nothing with their alternative strip. The blue, yellow and black design, created by Adidas, is said to mimic the raucous home support at Elland Road.",
      "It gives more rave or DJ vibes than a football strip but credit must be given for the creativity of the design.",
      "£45.50 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "FA Cup winners Crystal Palace have gone back to basics with their third strip and it is unlucky not to be higher on this list. The red and blue stripe straight down the middle coupled with one red and one blue sleeve topper is easy on the eye and a cool choice.",
      "The only thing that docks points off this kit is the amount of sponsors on the sleeves and front of the shirt that ruin the look. A no sponsor version would gain about five places in this list alone.",
      "£86 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Aston Villa's alternative kit gives shades of the Japan cherry blossom jersey. The shirt is said to be inspired by stained glass windows and features a white base with shades of blue and purple across the shoulders.",
      "The long-sleeved version is much cooler than the short sleeve and is a pretty nice one in this list.",
      "£59.50 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Anybody else get Wetherspoons plate vibes here? The Wolves third kit is a lot to look at but it is a beautiful shade of ocean blue.",
      "This design is said to be inspired by the energy and spirit of Brazil, and fans sure are hoping the football begins to replicate some tiki-taka skills soon enough.",
      "£60 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "This is a trend that begins at seventh place and it is that black kits automatically get a major pass.",
      "Burnley's third strip is similar to one another in this list but is one place lower due to the unusual gold specks that adorn the shoulder and hip of the shirt.",
      "It is an interesting kit but nothing too special to climb up the rankings further.",
      "£48 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "And here we have the other black-and-gold kit on this list. Fulham's alternative strip is clean and fresh, with a black base and gold piping all around the edges of the top.",
      "While it is plain, it does the job and could be swapped with any other club's badge to work seamlessly.",
      "£68 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "A shirt with a collar as unusual as this deserves its spot in fifth place. The Chelsea third kit is a middle badge, blacked-out piece of beauty.",
      "The white neck trim that mimics a wide collar is perhaps the most interesting part of the strip and pulls it up to a higher place on the list than initially expected.",
      "£84.99 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Many will be surprised that this kit isn't higher given the fan reaction. The Liverpool alternative top is a bright blue-green colour and features a vintage club badge that complements the shirt beautifully.",
      "Once again, the long-sleeved version is a much more appealing view than the short-sleeve, so it is docked points for that reason.",
      "£52 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Arsenal rarely miss when it comes to kit releases and the 2025/26 season is no different. This third kit is designed to celebrated 20 years since Arsenal's last season at Highbury and is another strip with an alternative badge.",
      "Featuring just the iconic cannon of the Gunners, this kit is white with a traditional collar and red accents with some gold smuggled in.",
      "£85 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Manchester United may have some chaos on the pitch, but their kits always seem to hit the spot. The Red Devils third top pays homage to the iconic 1993-95 away shirt, also known as the 'Cantona Kit'.",
      "The black-out kit with blue and yellow edges gives the top a fresh look and is finished with the original Adidas trefoil badge.",
      "£56.95 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "And finally, we have a kit absolutely deserving of its crown. Sunderland have just returned to the Premier League but are impressing on the pitch and also in their kit releases.",
      "The third kit features 11 mandalas intermixed in the blacked-out base, with a unique black cat emblem used as the club badge.",
      "Perhaps the most cool part of this kit is the pair of amber cat eyes on the back of the neck of the top, meant to symbolise past battles and focus on the future.",
      "£60 - BUY IT HERE.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Ruben Amorim looks set to lose three regular starters at Manchester United as the Africa Cup of Nations comes calling. But the Red Devils are also at risk of losing another two first-team stars in their upcoming matches.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui each look destined for AFCON selection and will soon take a leave of absence. As if that didn't hamper the manager's selection enough, United's discipline (or lack thereof) could take another two players out of action.",
      "As if the impending exodus of AFCON-eligible players wasn't bad enough, suspensions could be incoming for both Casemiro and Patrick Dorgu. Each of the pair are just one caution away from meeting the five-booking threshold that would incur a one-game ban in each case.",
      "United, who sit 10th in the Premier League at present, could do with all the resources they can muster for a tough winter schedule. And it means both Casemiro and Dorgu will need to be on their best behaviour at Selhurst Park this weekend.",
      "And it may influence Amorim's selection for what's shaping up to be a very difficult trip to south London. Palace are undefeated in three and sit fifth, while United have gone more than a month without a win and slipped down to mid-table.",
      "On one hand, United's chief may prefer his players get booked sooner rather than later in order to get their suspensions out of the way before the AFCON exodus. On the other, he'll want to preserve their disciplinary record for as long as possible in the hopes neither Casemiro nor Dorgu hit the five-card limit.",
      "One of the major transfer stories developing at United concerns Casemiro, whose contract at Old Trafford expires next summer. And although the club retains the option to extend his stay by another 12 months, rumours have emerged touting Conor Gallagher as his preferred replacement.",
      "That storyline is now gathering pace after AS reported Amorim's side are at the head of the queue to land the Atletico Madrid midfielder. Gallagher, 25, was all but indispensable during his debut season under Diego Simeone last term but has since taken a backseat in recent months.",
      "The former Chelsea and Crystal Palace talisman has started just five games across all competitions so far this season. Atletico signed the player for a bargain fee of only £34million almost 18 months ago, though it's thought the Spanish giants would demand closer to £50m if they're to sell up in 2026.",
      "Gallagher, who is supposedly \"not satisified\" with his bit-part role at Atleti, would also come with added benefit that he would contribute towards United's quota of homegrown players. And he could even help get a little more out of former Chelsea comrade and fellow Blues academy graduate Mason Mount.",
      "There are understood to be concerns at United regarding the club's over-reliance on midfield stars like Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes. However, a Premier League comeback for Gallagher could give the squad a new all-action alternative fit for the role.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Stiller remains under contract until June 2028 and according to Sky Deutschland, Stuttgart value the player at £44million. A deal at that price would see him become the club's second-most expensive exit, following Nick Woltemade's move to Newcastle in the summer.",
      "But Schweinsteiger hopes to see Stiller remain in the Bundesliga; the 2014 World Cup winner would much rather see the 24-year-old return to the club where he started his career. \"Angelo is a very interesting player,\" said Schweinsteiger during a recent event with the Kings League. \"I would very much like to see him back at Bayern Munich.\"",
      "Stiller is drawing interest from around Europe and has also been linked to Real Madrid. The midfielder has notched one goal and six assists in 19 appearances this season.",
      "That has seen Stuttgart's sporting director, Fabian Wohlgemuth, address Stiller's future. The transfer chief appeared to push back on the prospect for now.",
      "He said: \"He has a contract with us. It's far too early to speculate about that. Of course, one or two clubs will have had their eye on him. He's having an outstanding season.",

Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Senne Lammens, and Diego Leon all made the move to Old Trafford during the summer transfer window, costing the club a hefty £236million.",

      "\"It's really hard for the manager to turn that situation around, so I think it's very important to act decisively in situations like that.",
      "\"So Amorim got rid of them. He replaced them with (Benjamin) Sesko, (Bryan) Mbeumo and (Matheus) Cunha, and now United are playing at a higher level than what we had before.",

      "Speaking to Pundit Arena, the former France international added: \"I think that was the main goal for United in the transfer market. Players who thought about themselves above the team, they needed to go.",
      "\"The squad is more balanced now. You need at least three quarters of your team to be dedicated, willing to sacrifice, and talented too.",
      "\"You can afford a few flair players who might not always have that attitude, but it has to be a small minority. Back when I was there, we had Gary and Phil Neville, John O’Shea, Wes Brown. They made life easier for us.\"",

      "Manchester United's Patrick Dorgu has stirred the pot by liking a social media post criticising Ruben Amorim's midfield selection of Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes. The Red Devils have had a rocky start to the season, currently sitting 10th in the Premier League with just five victories from their first 12 matches.",
      "Despite impressive wins such as their triumph over Liverpool at Anfield, their recent defeat to Everton at Old Trafford has dampened spirits. A key feature of United's strategy this season has been the midfield duo of skipper Fernandes and Casemiro.",
      "Both players were on the pitch for the disappointing 1-0 loss to the Toffees on Monday night, until Casemiro was replaced by Kobbie Mainoo just shy of the 60-minute mark after picking up a booking.",
      "However, it seems not everyone in the dressing room is on board with the manager's current player use. Dorgu gave his approval to an Instagram post arguing that Fernandes and Casemiro should not be playing together.",
      "The post, shared by \"mufcunion\", featured a screenshot from X which read: \"Any coach that sees Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes as a viable pivot is one that isn't serious.\"",
      "The caption of the Instagram post declared: \"Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro CANNOT play together,\" and received a like from Dorgu, who joined United from Lecce for £25m earlier this year. The wing-back has made 12 appearances across all competitions this season, contributing one assist.",
      "Fernandes and Casemiro have been a formidable duo for Manchester United this season, starting together in 10 out of the club's 13 matches across all competitions.",
      "The only exceptions were during a heavily rotated squad against Grimsby Town in the Carabao Cup second round, and two league games against Brentford and Manchester City.",
      "In those matches, Manuel Ugarte was chosen to partner Fernandes in place of Casemiro. However, the selection for the Brentford match was enforced due to Casemiro receiving a red card in the previous game against Chelsea.",
      "Casemiro's future at Old Trafford is currently up in the air as his contract nears its end. Despite having a better season compared to the last, it remains unclear whether the 33-year-old Brazilian will extend his stay with United.",
      "This has led to United being linked with several midfield reinforcements over the summer, including Brighton's Carlos Baleba, while Nottingham Forest's Elliot Anderson is the latest name to be thrown into the mix ahead of the January transfer window.",
      "However, such social media activity from Dorgu criticising the manager's selection decisions does not bode well for him, the manager or his teammates.",

      "Manchester United academy graduate Toby Collyer has suffered a major injury setback with a persistent hamstring injury continuing to plague him. The 21-year-old joined Championship side West Bromwich Albion in a season-long loan deal in the summer.",
      "A hamstring injury has limited the midfielder to just three Championship starts so far this season. Collyer returned earlier this month and was even deemed fit enough to start in Wednesday evening’s clash with Birmingham City.",
      "But Collyer’s return to the starting line-up lasted for just 11 minutes before he picked up another issue and was forced to depart. And West Brom boss Ryan Mason has claimed that his issue is a recurrence of an injury that has been blighting him for the past few years.",
      "\"It's a muscle injury, yes,\" Mason said. \"I think it's challenging for him, it's disappointing.",
      "\"He had a few last season at Man United, that's why I was very patient with him this season because I wanted to give him the best opportunity to grow into the demands of this league.",
      "\"But for something to happen after 10 minutes, it's disappointing. It looks like it (a hamstring issue). We'll assess him in the next couple of days and see where we're at with that.\"",
      "Collyer’s issue represents a fresh blow to the midfielder's hopes of adding some much-needed experience to his CV. Speaking earlier this month, Mason said: \"Toby's a young player, but we know we're going to need him and he's going to help us. I've wanted Toby for a few weeks now. He's someone that I really believe in, which is important and I have that belief in all of my players.",
      "\"But when you go on loan to somewhere, I think you need to feel like you're wanted from the club and the manager and he certainly is that. Hopefully we can help him because if we help him improve and grow as a player, then it's certainly going to be beneficial to us.",
      "\"I think there's loads of room and loads of growth to develop. That's certainly going to happen on the training pitch. The reality is the game is the best teacher.",
      "\"The more game exposure you can get, the better, especially at a young age. I'm sure and I expect that Toby knows that I believe in him, which for me is super important.",
      "\"I'm going to put a lot of energy, the same amount of energy that I've put into him as every other one of my players, to help them grow and improve.\"",

      "David Moyes' side went on to secure a 1-0 victory despite being reduced to 10 men for more than 80 minutes. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall netted the only goal shortly after Gueye's dismissal, and the Toffees managed to hold firm and claim a massive three points.",
      "You can listen to brand new episodes of In The Mixer on Spotify and Apple Podcasts!",
      "Lescott, who played alongside Gueye at Aston Villa during the 2015/16 season, has since spoken with his former team-mate. And he offered reassurance to the Senegal international, as revealed on the latest episode of In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet",
      "\"We've seen it with Idrissa as well, and I spoke to him after that and he was like, 'That was so out of character,'\" said Lescott. \"But I said, this happens, you're allowed to be out of character for one moment, you know what I mean? It's not like it's happened every week. It is okay.\"",
      "Everton took all three points from Old Trafford despite managing only 30% possession. They also registered just three shots at goal compared to United's 25, with goalkeeper Jordan Pickford making one particularly vital save from Joshua Zirkzee.",
      "Former England goalkeeper and podcast guest Joe Hart even suggested Gueye's dismissal could have been a blessing in disguise. While Everton wouldn't deliberately choose to play with 10 men, the team responded magnificently to the early blow and showed tremendous character when their task became significantly harder.",
      "\"Actually, in the hindsight of them winning the game, it's a massive moment. It can be a really big moment, good moment,\" said Hart. \"But it didn't feel right at the time. I was watching it thinking, 'What?' These are these are high emotional moments, you know.\"",
      "Gueye has since apologised to his Everton team-mates and reportedly spoke directly to Keane following Monday's result. However, he must still serve a three-match suspension that will rule him out during a crucial part of the winter schedule.",
      "In all probability, Gueye will link up with Senegal for the Africa Cup of Nations and would have been unavailable regardless. Nevertheless, he will miss at least the forthcoming matches against Newcastle, Bournemouth and Nottingham Forest.",
      "Lescott completed his final campaign in English football with Villa, while Gueye was still establishing himself in the Premier League when their paths crossed. After receiving support from his former colleague on Monday, Gueye issued a public apology for his conduct and abandoning his team-mates.",
      "\"I want to apologise first to Michael Keane,\" he said in a heartfelt post on social media. \"I take full responsibility for my reaction. I also apologise to my teammates, the staff, the fans and the club.",

      "One year after bringing the curtain down on a decorated career, City icon Hart has moved into the world of punditry himself. But the retired No. 1 is eager to stick to the facts and not allow his personal perceptions cloud his judgement.",
      "At least that's how he views Keane's past judgement of him as a person. And during a recent appearance on In The Mixer, brought to you by Sky Bet, Hart was asked about his reaction to Keane's \"cocky\" jibe and how he views those comments today.",

I was willing to work out what he was as a person. Was this something that he harboured deep inside him? He just says stuff.",

I know the impact, especially now social media, I know how that can bring needless attention to someone who's minding their own business and going about.\"",
      "It was back in 2012 that Keane suggested Hart had grown \"cocky\" in his England duties. The following year, he moved on by dubbing him outright \"arrogant\" and suggested he deserved to be dropped.",
      "In The Mixer regular Joleon Lescott, who spent five years playing alongside Hart at City, came to his old team-mate's defence. And it was his assertion that pundits should stick to commenting on what happens on the pitch, rather than delving into personal opinions of player personas.",
      "Hart continued: \"I agree with Joel, but I also think, 'You do you.' If that's how you want it, that's what you think and that's what's going to work for you. Like, I can't tell anyone how to behave. I've actually come into the punditry role now. Sometimes I question myself and I think, 'What is my job here?'",
      "\"Because sometimes early on in my career, I've been asked questions and I've gone, 'I don't want to answer that.' You know, constantly now, a conversation will come around someone's jobs. 'Do you think pressure’s starting to mount?'",
      "\"I just go, 'Look, I'm not talking about pressure [mounting]. That's someone's job, that's someone family'. I'm not gonna talk about it. You want me to talk about the results or how I think the team's playing? Not a problem. I'm not heaping any pressure on anyone's job or anyone's place in a team. That is not for me to do.\"",

      "Ruben Amorim has hit back at claims that he refuses to change his tactics. The United boss has routinely been criticised throughout his tenure for sticking with his preferred back-three formation, with some pundits and sections of supporters arguing that his squad are not best suited to the system.",
      "Earlier this season, Amorim claimed that not even the Pope could get him to change his system. However, the United boss has now admitted that he is willing to tweak his tactics and make in-game changes, referencing the fluid attack he adopted at Sporting CP which often saw Viktor Gyokeres operate out wide.",

And it's an option that we have, and nowadays, everyone, I think not only in the English league but in the Portuguese league, in all leagues, there's a great variation in how things are structured.",

      "Bayer Leverkusen chief Simon Rolfes has revealed that making the fastest sacking in Bundesliga history by parting ways with Erik ten Hag was best for both parties. The club's Managing Director for Sport said it was his job to be decisive when he saw the partnership was not heading in the right direction.",
      "Ten Hag replaced Xabi Alonso at Leverkusen in the summer but was afforded just three games in the dugout. The Dutch coach saw a comfortable win over fourth-tier side SG Sonnenhof Grossaspach in his first match, before giving up leads against Hoffenheim and 10-man Werder Bremen to take a single point in the league.",
      "The German side now sit third in the Bundesliga after 11 matches, and defeated Manchester City in the Champions League last time out, under the tutelage of Kasper Hjulmand. Goals from Alejandro Grimaldo and Patrik Schick put City to the sword as Pep Guardiola was left to consider his mistakes.",
      "Rolfe spoke ahead of that game at the Etihad and was plain in his reasoning over the decision. \"At the end of the day it is about the connection with the people,\" he said.",
      "\"And we had the feeling it wasn't working out or heading on a good direction. So that's why it is better to stop, for both sides, and thats why we made the change.",
      "\"If you're not convinced, then this is my role as a leader. Then I have to take decisions - I only think about what's best for results.\"",
      "The dismissal saw Ten hag given the boot for the second time in less than 12 months. The former Ajax boss was sacked by Manchester United last season. The Dutch coach criticised Leverkusen following his exit.",
      "\"The decision by Bayer Leverkusen this morning to put me on a leave of absence came as a complete surprise. To part ways with a manager after just two league matches is unprecedented,\" said Ten Hag.",
      "\"This summer, many key players who were part of past successes left the squad. Building a new, cohesive team is a careful process that requires both time and trust.",
      "\"A new coach deserves the space to implement his vision, set the standards, shape the squad and leave his mark on the style of play.",
      "\"I started this job with full conviction and energy, but unfortunately, the management was not willing to grant me the time and trust I needed, which I deeply regret. I feel this was never a relationship based on mutual trust.",
      "\"Throughout my career, every season I have been able to see through to the end as a coach has brought success. Clubs that placed their trust in me have been rewarded with success and silverware.\"",

      "Manchester United are considering letting three youngsters head out on loan once the January transfer window opens. United’s lack of European football this season and their early exit from the Carabao Cup has left Ruben Amorim with few opportunities to rotate and give fringe players minutes – and that could prompt action in the New Year.",
      "The team are generally only in action once per week, which means Amorim has been able to keep a level of consistency in his selections. While this did appear to be bearing fruit in a five-game unbeaten run in the Premier League before the 1-0 defeat by Everton on Monday, it has had some knock-on effects.",
      "United have a history of giving opportunities to academy graduates, but they have been thin on the ground this season. The situation is shown by Kobbie Mainoo’s struggles for game time, with the 20-year-old midfielder getting just 260 minutes across nine appearances so far this season, with his only start coming in the shambolic defeat by Grimsby in the Carabao Cup.",
      "Top young stars like Harry Amass and Radek Vitek left on loan to Sheffield Wednesday and Bristol City respectively and there are further plans in the works. The Daily Mail reports that Diego Leon, Sekou Kone and Ayden Heaven could be sent out on loan in January in order to get more game time.",
      "Leon joined United in a deal worth a potential £7million from Paraguayan side Cerro Porteno in the summer. But the 18-year-old left-back is yet to make his United first-team debut, with Luke Shaw and Patrick Dorgu among those ahead of him in the pecking order.",
      "He arrived with high hopes of breaking into Amorim’s plans, but has only made it onto the bench on four occasions this season. Having initially been reluctant to consider a loan move, Leon is frustrated by only playing for the under-21s and French side Nice – who are also owned by Ineos – could represent a good fit for him.",
      "Kone, a 19-year-old midfielder, joined United in the summer of 2024 and has been playing for the under-21s. He suffered a concussion in a National League Cup tie at Tamworth, which saw him taken to hospital last month, but has since returned to action.",
      "Heaven is highly rated by Amorim but has managed just 92 minutes of action this season. The centre-back was an unused substitute against Everton on Monday and faces further competition for places through the imminent return of Lisandro Martinez.",
      "The three youngsters’ exits are being weighed up, but those of Mainoo and Joshua Zirkzee are less likely to be sanctioned. Both players are unhappy with their lack of regular minutes for United, but Amorim has made the club’s position clear ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations starting next month, when United will lose Bryan Mbeumo, Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazraoui.",
      "\"I was a football player,\" he said on Monday. \"I understand everything, and I want to help my players in every situation. I understand the frustration of some players, seeing the World Cup is there. I know what it means.",
      "\"But the first thing is that the club comes first. If I can help the club and the players, I will be happy. If not, I have to think about the team.\"",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more.",

      "Former Manchester United ace Timothy Fosu-Mensah is reportedly on the radar of Sheffield Wednesday. The 27-year-old has been without a club since parting ways with Bayer Leverkusen in the summer of 2024, with current Real Madrid boss Xabi Alonso believed to have played a part in his early contract termination.",
      "Fosu-Mensah made the switch to the German outfit in a £1.8million move during the January transfer window of 2021 after spending five years at Old Trafford. Despite suffering serious knee and hamstring injuries that limited him to just 30 appearances over three-and-a-half years, he was part of their historic Bundesliga title triumph.",
      "Even though he hasn't played competitively since April 2023, the Star suggests that Sheffield Wednesday are considering bringing Fosu-Mensah on board. The Championship's bottom club is staring down the barrel of relegation to League One following a 12-point deduction.",
      "However, the Owls seem determined to stave off dropping into England's third tier next season, as evidenced by their interest in a player of Fosu-Mensah's calibre. Among those impressing at Hillsborough this season is United loanee Harry Amass, despite Sheffield Wednesday managing just a single win.",
      "Fosu-Mensah was given his first taste of senior team action at United by Louis van Gaal on the same day Marcus Rashford made his debut. He went on to make 30 first-team appearances, with 11 of those coming under the stewardship of Jose Mourinho.",
      "The right-back has been singing praises for the Portuguese manager, revealing that he played a significant role in his development.",
      "Speaking to The Sun in February 2024, he said: \"I spent the full season with the first team and, as a result, completed a full pre-season with them for the first time.",
      "\"I was still a teenager when Jose Mourinho arrived, and he helped me mature into becoming a man in footballing terms.",
      "\"Jose was tough on young players with his demands, but in a good way, because he wanted you to be ready to represent a club the size of Manchester United.\"",
      "However, despite Mourinho's guidance, Fosu-Mensah found it difficult to secure a regular spot at Old Trafford and decided to leave for more playing time.",
      "Fosu-Mensah explained: \"It was my decision. The manager was good to me but at the end, I was not playing a lot. When you are 22, 23, or 24 years old you need to be playing.",
      "\"I didn't play much and I wanted to. It was the best decision in the end to go somewhere else where I would get more minutes.\"",
      "Sadly, he only managed to clock up just 1,050 minutes for Leverkusen, but the former United academy star is clear about his goals for the future.",
      "In an interview with World Football Index last year, he stated: \"I have had a few spells out with injury so I want to stay injury free in order to play and perform at the highest level.",
      "\"Of course, I want to win more trophies in my career but the most important thing is to be able to enjoy my football and play at the highest level of the game.\"",

      "Manchester United chiefs accept that Ruben Amorim's squad is still limited despite allowing him to spend more than £200million on new players in the summer.",
      "The Portuguese boss, off the back of the club's worst ever Premier League showing, bought in Benjamin Sesko for £74m as well as Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo for a combined fee of over £120m. Senne Lammens also came in and has made the No 1 shirt his own.",
      "Despite the quality now available to him those at Old Trafford are tempering their expectations, acknowledging that Amorim can only do so much with the team he has. A number of positions still need to be strengthened before the head coach can be expected to produce regularly.",
      "United saw their momentum halted on Monday when they were beaten by Everton, ending a run of five games without defeat. They sit tenth after 12 games this term.",
      "The January transfer window opens in just over five weeks but, despite the need to bolster certain positions, ESPN reports that United are looking to bypass the mid-season window and instead do their business next summer.",
      "That said they remain open minded and will act if it is in their best interests. Injuries to key personnel may alter their stance but finding quality players for good value can often be a challenge midway through the season, when clubs tend to hike their prices.",
      "United believe their financial position will allow them to continue to invest in the squad, despite their notable outlay in the summer. They believe a number of top earners, the likes of Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho, will depart in the next sixth months, which will give them more freedom financially. A return to Europe would also aid their cause.",
      "Adding a central midfielder is among their priorities, likely in the summer. Several proven Premier League performers are already on their shortlist - the likes of Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Carlos Baleba. They have also assessed Wolves duo Joao Gomes and Andre.",
      "The club also believe that Amorim needs more depth at wing-back - especially given their importance in his system. Early enquiries have been made about the availability of a number of targets with United largely using conventional full-backs in those positions.",

United saw their five-match unbeaten run come to an end on Monday when Everton ran out 1-0 winners; however, the Old Trafford chief has already rejected suggestions that he is \"fixated\" on his tactics.",
      "The 10-man Toffees dispatched the hosts with ease despite playing over an hour with a man disadvantage. The defeat meant that United missed the opportunity to move into the top four and stake their claim to qualify for the Champions League.",
      "Criticism of Amorim has returned after they failed to make the extra man count, as well as capitalising on the joy they had throughout the exchanges against David Moyes ' side. The Portuguese tactician has faced scrutiny for persisting with his system, despite enduring difficult periods in his 12 months at Old Trafford.",
      "Mourinho returned to Portugal earlier this year when he was installed as the new Benfica manager. The Portuguese managerial icon spoke about the current era of managers failing to diversify from their system when the going gets tough.",

      "\"But they say, ‘I died, but I died with my idea.’ My friend, if you died by your ideas, you are stupid.”",
      "The run of five matches unbeaten saw United win three and draw twice, catapulting them up the table and alleviating pressure on Amorim.",
      "During their run, they beat fierce rivals Liverpool to further assert that they are not pushovers, after previously finding the Anfield club difficult customers prior to his arrival from Sporting CP.",
      "United have proved that they can mix it with their Premier League rivals, but often struggled against lesser teams. Amorim was under immense scrutiny going into this season after failing to heed the slump last season, when he succeeded Erik ten Hag.",
      "High-profile former footballers have taken aim at Amorim throughout his tenure in the Premier League over his failure to resist changing his system, including club icons Gary Neville and Wayne Rooney.",
      "Amorim has already had to defend his decisions and tactics to United legends criticising him and rejected claims again that he is unwilling to change in light of the defeat to Everton, saying: \"We did it against Liverpool, it wasn't with Bryan Mbeumo, it was with Cunha. And it's an option that we have, and nowadays, everyone, I think not only in the English league but in the Portuguese league, in all leagues, there's a great variation in how things are structured.",
      "\"We might say it’s a 4-4-2, but five minutes later it’s a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3. And therefore I'm willing to do anything, contrary to what many people think that I'm too fixated on one thing.",
      "\"I simply start with a basic foundation, but obviously, we can use it in the future. And we've already thought about that with Bryan [playing central] because he's very strong in transitions.",
      "\"I do think it's the best position for him [out wide] because he likes to be hidden, he doesn't like people watching him. He can attack, be more dangerous on one of the flanks, either the right or the left, rather than as a striker, but it's a good option, therefore I'll be able to use it in the future as I did several times at Sporting.\"",
      "Amorim's comments will no doubt please Mourinho, who clearly feels that the best managers need to adapt when the going gets tough.",
      "The 40-year-old United boss previously reiterated that his system was not the issue. He said: \"It is normal and you cannot run away from the results and then you have baggage from last season but for me last season doesn’t matter.",
      "\"We had six games this season and we lost three. We have to look to the games we lost, if we lost against Arsenal due to the system, it is your job to make the opinions. City and Brentford the way we gave away goals and created chances, it is nothing to do with the system. If we look to the games we didn’t win, people have different opinions and that is okay.\"",

However, La Liga commentator, Terry Gibson, has highlighted how the club's current financial state could prevent a deal from coming to fruition.",

      "\"It doesn't work out because they're playing 60 games a season. And I think it's pretty certain, I think, that Barcelona will pay the fee to make that permanent.\"",
      "However, the former United and Tottenham Hotspur star also conceded that it may not be a simple task for Barcelona to find the funds to complete Rashford's permanent transfer. He explained: \"Well, it's not as easy to find £30m for Barcelona as it is normally.",
      "\"But back in the new stadium now, charging a fortune for tickets at the moment, 45,000 at the weekend, it's going to keep creeping up. And then Barcelona, before long, will be back on a familiar financial footing. And they'll be setting their sights very high to bring back in superstars at Barcelona.\"",
      "Last month, it was reported that Barca had accrued an alarming transfer fee debt of around £138m after publishing their financial report for 2024/25, raising questions with regards to the long-term sustainability of the club. It was also claimed that the club will have to clear £121m of that sum by season's end to stay afloat.",
      "Rashford could see this as a major red flag in the long run, especially given his future with United is seemingly non-existent at present.",
      "He could also take issue with fan unrest at the club, given the price of tickets at Camp Nou, which is currently undergoing major refurbishment but recently opened once again at a limited-capacity of around 45,000.",
      "For context, the cheapest ticket available on the club's website for their clash with Alaves come Saturday, November 29 is £95.51 (€109), while the most cost-efficient ticket for their match with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, December 2 comes in at £148 (€169).",
      "However, Rashford has seemingly been impressed with his time on Spanish soil as of late. Speaking in September, he said: \"Playing for Barca is an amazing experience. I've always been a huge admirer of Barcelona.",
      "\"We want to win as much as possible. One hundred per cent I'm full of excitement. I'm very motivated and determined. The quality we have in the team excites me. It's so refreshing to play with these players.\"",
      "UK football fans can listen to Terry Gibson on co-commentary for Sevilla FC vs Real Betis on Premier Sports 1 come Sunday, November 30 at 3.10pm. FC Barcelona vs Atletico de Madrid is also available on Premier Sports 1 from 1.55pm on Tuesday, December 2.",

      "Former Manchester United defender Wes Brown has praised the club's no-nonsense approach to the summer transfer market and believes it is something we could see more of over the coming years. United entered the summer transfer window with plenty of work to do after a lowly 15th place finish in the Premier League.",
      "Without Champions League football, there was concern Ruben Amorim would not be able to sign the players he wanted. However, the Reds managed to strengthen plenty of areas within their squad. Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, Benjamin Sesko and Senne Lammens all arrived last summer.",
      "Speaking to MEN Sport, BetWright betting ambassador Brown praised United's approach and said it's something we could see more of from the club. He said: \"I think this is the first season as a collective group where the club have gone: 'We want to buy these players, so let’s buy them,' and they’ve managed to do so.",
      "\"I think that will continue for the next two years – football is a turning wheel, but I think Manchester United are going to see more players who will be outstanding for them and really take to the team. It’s taken a while, but at the same time, Amorim must have been under so much pressure to handle everything, so you have to give him credit for that.\"",
      "While the impact made by the new signings has been positive, there is still more work to do. Midfield is an area many hope will be addressed in the upcoming transfer windows.",
      "Casemiro is out of contract at the end of the season and, as things stand, the Brazilian will be leaving Old Trafford. Harry Maguire also finds himself heading towards the final six months of his deal and Brown believes talks with the duo are likely top begin in January.",
      "He added: \"Casemiro is playing excellently again, but it’s a tough one because when you get to a certain age, it becomes hard for the club to justify giving someone an extra couple of years – it doesn’t work like that. I think it will firstly all depend on whether each player has any other offers elsewhere, and secondly, if the club want them to stay on, would they be happy to perhaps not play every single week?",
      "\"There’s a lot of things to consider. When you get to a certain age, I feel like you’re shown more respect by the manager and the owners – they tell you more and are more open with you about things.",
      "\"The one thing I will say is that you see a lot of players at that age with a year to go on their deals and I’ve seen them fob it off, but Harry Maguire and Casemiro aren’t doing that. Harry is putting in some of the best performances coming on and helping the team despite receiving the most stick over the past three to four years that I’ve ever seen.",
      "You can tell Casemiro still knows the game and knows what his body is telling him. There will be conversations about it in January, but nothing is 100% with these things.\"",

      "There was a bizarre situation last weekend when Matheus Cunha was forced to miss an appearance to switch on Christmas lights in Altrincham. The organisers of the event posted on social media to say Cunha had pulled out due to “medical reasons.”",
      "Manchester United sources confirmed Cunha had suffered a knock in training. The issue was described as minor, but it was serious enough for him miss the Everton game on Monday. Amorim was asked to clarify the situation ahead of the clash with the Toffees, telling MUTV: \"It was a knock in training so I don’t know how long he’s going to stay out, I think it’s nothing serious.\"",
      "In a separate interview with NBC, Amorim said: “Let’s recover Cunha, and we’ll see if he will be ready for the next game.\" The Reds are next in action against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and the expectation is that Cunha will return to the squad, which is a boost after a shocking defeat against Everton.",
      "Everton had 10 men on the pitch for 77 minutes and United could not score. They struggled to create clear-cut opportunities and the few chances that were carved out landed to Zirkzee in the box. Zirkzee is not good enough to be starting for United in the Premier League, and fans will be desperately hoping for a positive update on Cunha ahead of this weekend.",
      "Palace have the second-best defensive record in the top flight this season, with only Arsenal conceding fewer goals (six) than Oliver Glasner's side (9), who are sitting fifth in the table. Glasner has done a magnificent job since his appointment in Croydon. Palace will be hard to break down on Sunday, and Cunha has the quality to create chances or find the back of the net himself.",
      "It would be a boost for Harry Maguire to return to the squad, which will depend on whether the England international has recovered from the hamstring injury he suffered before the international break.",
      "Everton dominated aerial duels at Old Trafford earlier in the week and Maguire's presence at the back was missed. If Maguire passes a fitness test this week, he should come into the starting team for Leny Yoro.",
      "Yoro struggled against Everton. He was culpable in the build-up to Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's goal from the edge of the box, failing to commit to the challenge, which allowed the Everton man to shoot.",
      "Maguire would have played himself back into the England squad by now if not for picking up a few minor injuries, and Amorim will give an update on his recovery at his press conference on Friday afternoon.",
      "The potential returns of Cunha and Maguire feel crucial for Amorim to pick his strongest possible XI this weekend. United started November with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, and fingers will be pointed at Amorim again if they end the month with back-to-back defeats.",
      "Amorim was named Premier League manager of the month for October and November was an opportunity to build further momentum ahead of the winter schedule, so the Palace clash is another big fixture.",
      "Mason Mount deserves a recall to the team and Diogo Dalot will likely start in the left wing-back role because Patrick Dorgu had another performance to forget against Everton. Dalot and Dorgu have both been unconvincing on the left this season and United need a new signing for that position.",
      "Strongest XI to face Palace: Lammens, De Ligt, Maguire, Shaw, Amad, Dalot, Casemiro, Fernandes, Mbeumo, Mount, Cunha.",

      "Manchester United are set to appoint Kyle Macaulay as head of senior scouting. It is understood Macaulay has been identified as the right person for the job after a four-month search to fill the vacancy.",
      "Christopher Vivell and Macaulay worked together at Chelsea between 2022 and 2023, the former as technical director and the latter as head of scouting while Graham Potter was at the helm. Macaulay has also worked with Potter at Ostersunds, Swansea City, Brighton and West Ham.",
      "With this being such a key role in United's recruitment set-up, Macaulay will be expected to hit the ground running when he starts his new job. The January transfer window is on the horizon and plans will already be in the works for next summer's window.",
      "MEN Sport has taken a look at the three positions in the team that should be on Macaulay's radar.",
      "New left wing-back",
      "Wing-backs are crucial in Amorim's system. On the right, United have Amad performing well and while defensively he can improve, he is the kind of outlet Amorim's system needs.",
      "The left is more of an issue. Patrick Dorgu has potential but he is still raw and his decision-making in the final third leaves a lot to be desired. Diogo Dalot and Noussair Mazraoui just don't look comfortable as left wing-backs.",
      "Diego Leon was signed in the summer but he is still raw and getting a feel for European football. Macaulay should be tasked with finding a new left wing-back to strengthen that position.",
      "Further attacking reinforcements",
      "Joshua Zirkzee started on Monday night against Everton but he showed he isn't the centre-forward the club need. Zirkzee is better as a No.10 and so Benjamin Sesko is the only out-and-out striker at the club.",
      "The Reds had success with the strikerless system when Matheus Cunha led the line, but there needs to be another centre-forward at the club to provide competition for Sesko.",
      "Midfield overhaul",
      "Even if Casemiro stays at Old Trafford beyond this season, a new central midfielder is needed. Kobbie Mainoo's future at the club is unclear and Manuel Ugarte is still struggling to find his feet after over a year in English football.",
      "Bruno Fernandes needs a partner in the middle and with Casemiro set to turn 34 before the end of the season, United would be wise to sign a new defensive midfielder. Plans for who United will target in the summer will already be being drawn up but Macaulay could still have his say.",

      "What makes a successful Manchester United team? That is the question which is undoubtedly spinning around the mind of Ruben Amorim this week after a disappointing defeat to Everton on Monday night. In the short-term, the answer seems simple.",
      "United need to purchase players who are going to drastically improve what they are currently offering. They started this approach in the summer with Bryan Mbeumo proving to be much better than those previously occupying the attack. The jury is still out on Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, albeit they have both had their moments.",
      "Meanwhile, Senne Lammens has been a revelation in goal. Even with his mistake this week, the Belgian has been a vast improvement on Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana. This transfer strategy is one which United will be looking to adopt moving forward but long-term, there needs to be a culture shift at Old Trafford.",
      "For too long there has been a sense of negativity around the club and a concern that too many players are here for the wage packet rather than to take the Reds back to the top. Amorim has worked hard to shape the club in an image which best suits his own.",
      "But changing the culture needs to be spearheaded by the players. And Amorim may find it difficult to replace one key man at the club. Speaking on the Inside Carrington podcast, Lammens was asked by Ben Foster who his 'big brother' was in the squad.",
      "He replied: \"Tom Heaton is the easy answer for me. Just the type of human he is with all the experience and making me feel at home as well. To be honest, the whole goalkeeping group is really good together.\"",
      "Third choice goalkeeper Heaton is out of contract at the end of this season and there is a feeling he may choose to retire this summer. But Lammens' comments are just further evidence of how difficult it will be to replace someone like Heaton in the dressing room.",
      "\"He (Amorim) feels quite strongly about having a group of players that have a strong influence on the dressing room and provides a little bit of support to Bruno [Fernandes],\" Heaton said of the role in August. \"I am obviously honoured as ever to be part of that and will try to have as much influence on it as I possibly can.\"",
      "Heaton is popular in the dressing room and is clearly a big help to Amorim and his staff. Amorim will have no shortage of options for the role if the 39-year-old does depart in the summer. It is about finding the right fit and personality for the dressing room who can use his experience, not only to help his fellow goalkeepers, but to create the perfect culture for success.",
      "Heaton does that role well as evidenced by Lammens' comments so United will need to be careful when it comes to finding a replacement.",

United looked at Baleba in the summer transfer window, but after being told Brighton's asking price was £100million the Reds agreed to delay their pursuit until next summer.",
      "Since then, the Cameroonian has struggled for form and he did not impress during Brighton's visit to Old Trafford in October as United won 4-2. The 21-year-old was a topic of conversation in Hurzeler's press conference on Thursday morning after he was substituted at half-time in the 2-1 victory over Brentford. Brighton's manager insisted that talk of Baleba leaving for United must now end as he looks to get his season back on track.",
      "\"I think it is a constant thing that we try to do extra work with him,\" he said. \"Every player we try to develop, no matter if he is playing or not, every player we try to get back to his full potential and that is what we try to do, step by step, without putting these kinds of players under pressure.",
      "\"Don’t put Carlos Baleba under pressure and say ‘you must play well’ because of course he wants to play well. It is about the small steps. It is about how he asks for the ball, the positioning he has when he receives the ball. How often he is switched on in trying to react when we lose the ball.",
      "\"These are all kinds of things he can influence and then we try to work with him. Sometimes you need to be patient. Sometimes you need to be more demanding, more ruthless with the players but, overall, you always need to create the right environment and the right supporters around him to give him the right help.\"",
      "When asked specifically about the United rumours, Hurzeler added: \"I think it has gone now. We are now four months into the season so we can’t speak about these rumours any more.",
      "\"It’s about being a Brighton player, it’s about performing well here and it is about getting him back to his best level. Avoid the noise, avoid all the rumours and focus on the things you can influence and the things you can do best and that’s football.\"",

      "United are said to value the young midfielder highly having been capped 13 times by his country at youth level. His impending arrival is part of an aggressive recruitment strategy by transfer chief Jason Wilcox who has swooped for the defensive midfielder.",
      "The 17-year-old will officially move to Old Trafford next year after celebrating his 18th birthday in July and sign his contract on his trip to Manchester.",
      "Orozco, who had only joined his current club Fortaleza in the summer, has drawn comparisons to fellow Colombian midfielder Moises Caicedo.",
      "The current Chelsea midfielder is one of best players in the Premier League at preset, and United chiefs may regret the decision to walk away from transfer talks in 2021.",
      "The club were in talks with Caicedo during his time at Independiente del Valle back in January 2021, but reportedly walked away from a deal due to interference from several agents.",
      "Caicedo's asking price of £5.5m was deemed too expensive, but would later break the British record transfer fee and sign for Chelsea for an incredible £115m",
      "United have shown they're making an attempt to learn from previous mistakes and have already signed a number of promising young talents from across the globe. In the summer they signed young left back Diego Leon as part of their explorations into South America.",
      "They also signed the highly rated Sekou Kone from Guidars FC last year and he has drawn comparisons to former Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure.",

      "A run of three successive wins in the Premier League, which turned into five unbeaten, hinted towards the possibility of the side kicking on - though a recent defeat to ten-men Everton raised some further concerns.",
      "While the jury is still out on whether Amorim will succeed at Man United, a decision over his future may have to be made sooner rather than later, all because of their rivals, Liverpool.",
      "The Merseyside outfit have been on a wretched run of form, losing nine of their last 12 games across all competitions, the latest of which was a 4-1 thrashing at the hands of PSV Eindhoven.",
      "That has now put some pressure on Arne Slot, with the possibility of a sacking not out of the question, as performances and results fall short of expectations - especially after spending £450m in the summer transfer window.",
      "While that may well be to the delight of United fans, there could be a huge impact on the club in Liverpool making a change to their managerial ranks.",
      "That's because Oliver Glasner has shot up to second-favourite for the job at Anfield after an impressive few seasons at Crystal Palace.",
      "Glasner has been linked with Man United as a possible option if they ever decide to part ways with Amorim, with his system seemingly suiting the move to Old Trafford, given how the squad has been built around a back three.",
      "However, there is no doubt that the Austrian boss would be on the radar at Liverpool if they want to make a change, given his calm and collected manner and the way he has managed to get the Eagles playing.",
      "That could well push the United hierarchy into making a move sooner rather than later, if they do decide that Glasner is the option to take them forward, or if they have any lingering doubts over Amorim.",
      "United are content with Amorim at the moment, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe recently hinting that he's prepared to give the Portuguese boss three years to prove he is the right man for the job.",
      "However, football is a results business, and if United start to falter again, Ratcliffe's commitment to Amorim will be tested.",
      "One other thing that maybe should be considered is how the manager could help United grab two transfer targets, with Adam Wharton and Jean-Philippe Mateta on the club's radar, who have impressed under the 51-year-old.",
      "Glasner has taken charge of 81 games with Crystal Palace, guiding them to FA Cup and Community Shield glory, as well as a first foray into Europe.",
      "In those 81 matches in the dugout, Glasner has won 40 games with 23 draws and 18 defeats, making the side incredibly hard to beat.",
      "Whether that would translate well to either Man United or Liverpool remains to be seen, however, both teams will have their resolve tested over their management situations over the coming weeks.",

      "The Cameroonian arrived knowing all eyes were on him at the Theatre of Dreams. However, if he was playing for a contract at United next season, it is fair to say he did not do enough. Baleba was replaced midway through the half and United were left counting their blessings.",
      "On Sunday, another audition for midfield will take place as United travel to Crystal Palace for the lunchtime kick-off. In Oliver Glasner's ranks is Adam Wharton, a player who can seemingly do no wrong at present. His performances for the Eagles have earned him call-ups to the England squad and he remains one of the standout stars in the Premier League.",
      "His long-term future is unlikely to be at Palace with a host of regular Champions League competing clubs lining up to launch bids for the midfielder in the summer. If Wharton excels on Sunday afternoon there could be clamours for United to win the race for him but if the audition is a success, there are reasons why Ruben Amorim & Co should not act on it.",
      "The main issue is Wharton not being the midfielder which United need right now. The 21-year-old has excelled as a playmaker but has less experience being the anchor in the middle.",
      "United's priority in the summer will be to sign a midfielder to replace Casemiro. Whether the Brazilian stays or goes, the Reds need to plan for the future and signing a young defensive midfielder should be the priority.",
      "Wharton is the right age but bringing him in to be the first choice for a role he isn't as comfortable in, would be a waste of money. Speaking of which, his price tag could also push United out of the contest.",
      "It has been reported Palace would want at least an eye-watering £100m for Wharton in the summer before allowing him to exit. He remains under contract for four more years after this season so the Eagles will be feeling relaxed and ready to wait to receive the figure they want.",
      "Whether United have the facilities to give Palace the money they want for Wharton is neither here nor there, if they are going to spend that amount, they need to buy a player who leaves few questions about his suitability. The Reds cannot afford to pay so much money and then misuse him.",
      "If Kobbie Mainoo, Bruno Fernandes or both were to leave in the summer transfer window, a move for Wharton and paying such a huge sum would make sense. If you want to buy best in class, you have it right there. He would slip into the midfield perfectly alongside a team=mate who can sit in and allow Wharton to influence attacks.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe once said of United they are the 'dumb money' due to their ability to spend big sums on players who are not worthy of such fees. Wharton would be a great addition to any team, including United, but as things stand it would be dumb to spend £100m on a player who is a square peg for a round hole at this club.",

      "Former Manchester United star Lee Sharpe believes a new left wing-back could be on the club's radar in the January transfer window. Last January, the Reds decided to splash the cash to bring Patrick Dorgu to Old Trafford after Ruben Amorim identified the left wing-back role as a position in need of strengthening.",
      "While Dorgu continues to adapt to the Premier League, he has struggled to hold down the position ahead of Diogo Dalot. The Portuguese full-back looks more comfortable on the right but due to Amad's good form has been moved to the left. With neither man quite doing enough to make the position their own, Adventure Games ambassador Sharpe explained to MEN Sport why he feels this is where the Reds could strengthen.",
      "He said: \"It is a difficult one really because I think in the main they are playing pretty well. [Bryan] Mbeumo and [Matheus] Cunha have been fantastic.",
      "\"Defensively they have an abundance of defenders. Maybe a left wing-back to help cover Dorgu. He has been up and down in form recently but once he gets up to speed after a couple of injuries and a lack of form, I think he is going to be a really good player.\"",
      "United have seen a shift in their recruitment strategy since the arrival of Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The Ineos founder, of course, is in charge of football operations at Old Trafford and Sharpe feels the jury remains out on the British billionaire.",
      "He added: \"You would probably put him [Ratcliffe] in the same category as the manager - I think he has been a little bit indifferent with some of the decisions he has made. Waiting and spending a lot of money bringing Dan Ashworth in and then getting rid of him pretty sharpish, giving [Erik] Ten Hag a new contract and then getting rid of him pretty sharpish. The staff cuts, money cuts, not giving staff tickets for the [FA] Cup final and stuff like that, there are questionable decisions that he has made.",
      "\"But again, you have got to see the positives. They have gone out and got Mbeumo, Cunha, [Senne] Lammens. They have strengthened in the areas that they needed to strengthen in. We are creating more chances, playing better football, so things are coming good and you have to say that is partly down to him. As well as making a few mistakes, he has done a few good things as well.\"",

      "It was during his time at Old Trafford that the forward earned his solitary cap for the Three Lions. That came against Iceland back in September 2020.",
      "But with his current form hard to ignore, it means going to the World Cup next summer has become a real aim.",

      "Since joining the French side for £26.6million, the 24-year-old has netted 33 goals in 53 matches. And prior to leaving Manchester on a permanent basis, Greenwood also had a successful loan spell in Spain with Getafe.",
      "American international Timothy Weah, son of football legend George Weah, believes Greenwood deserves a spot in the England squad and is committed to helping him.",
      "He told The Sun: \"When I speak about Mason it's a special feeling because it's very rare in a lifetime that you get to share the pitch with such an amazing player and amazing character.",
      "\"We've grown closer since I've joined the team and been here. Hopefully he gets that call-up soon.",

      "\"I have not spoken to him until now. I have not spoken to him or his camp,\" the Three Lions manager said.",

The Manchester United loannee was absent for their La Liga win over Athletic Club this past weekend because of illness with that also playing a part in Flick's decision.",
      "Even without Rashford, Barca strode to victory back at the Camp Nou for the first time in a few years by scoring four goals while also keeping a clean sheet.",
      "Torres grabbed a brace in that game and Flick therefore rewarded him for that by naming him in the starting XI for their trip to Stamford Bridge",
      "Flick, as quoted by Mundo Deportivo, said: \"Ferran scored two goals on Saturday, and Marcus had been out for three or four days due to his injury, but he’s ready to play at any moment.\"",
      "That latter phrase was confirmed by Flick at half-time with Rashford coming on for Torres, who had missed a great opportunity in the first half, before things unravelled for his side. A Jules Kounde own goal and Ronald Araujo red card saw Barcelona a man and goal down at the interval.",
      "Rashford struggled to get into the game with Chelsea able to extend their lead through a dazzling Estevao Willian strike and clinical Liam Delap finish.",
      "The 28-year-old is unlikely to be judged for his display in west London given the challenging circumstances with Flick a big fan of Rashford as he made perfectly clear when asked about his return to the fold.",
      "He said: \"I'm really very happy [he is back]. We will decide tomorrow [Tuesday] if he plays from the beginning or if he comes in from the bench. But as I said, I'm happy to have him in our team.",
      "\"Last time when we played Newcastle, I also said this. I have followed him, I think, his whole career. I was impressed about him, with his quality, what he is doing in the box, what he is doing in front of goal.",
      "\"He has also showed it in Barcelona, which is really good. But for him, this change to live in another culture. The people in Barcelona are fantastic, we have nice weather. For me, it's amazing.",
      "\"You can see now he is also smiling a lot, and if he can enjoy the atmosphere we have, it is also good for him.\"",
      "The decision to sign him permanently from United is unlikely to be made by Flick but 13 goal contributions this season shows he is putting himself in a great position to have the £26million buy-option in his loan switch activated.",
      "Ruben Amorim could certainly do with Rashford at the moment after his side failed to score against 10-man Everton on Monday evening.",
      "Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko missed the game through injury with the latter set to miss the next few weeks. Bryan Mbeumo will also be absent for a period across the New Year as he competes in AFCON for Cameroon.",

      "Despite the early sending off, Everton were the better side and deserved to draw first blood through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who beat Senne Lammens from the edge of the box. United pushed for an equaliser but couldn't find a breakthrough as Jordan Pickford denied Joshua Zirkzee with an excellent late save.",
      "Here are how United's players rated at Old Trafford:",
      "Senne Lammens",
      "Should have done better for Dewsbury-Hall's strike. His starting position made it difficult for him to get across to his left-hand side. 5",
      "Leny Yoro",
      "Didn't commit to the challenge when Dewsbury-Hall picked up the ball on the edge of the box, which proved costly. 5",
      "Matthijs de Ligt",
      "Was caught out of position a few times when Everton looked dangerous in the first half. Didn't have much to do after the break when United finally started to ask a few questions. 5",
      "Luke Shaw",
      "Made an excellent challenge at the beginning of the second half and tried to rally his teammates as Everton held onto their one-goal advantage. 5",
      "Noussair Mazraoui",
      "Didn't offer much going forward in the first 45 minutes and was hooked at the interval in a tactical tweak from Amorim. 4",
      "Casemiro",
      "Although Casemiro has become an influential figure again this season he looked like a 33-year-old and was passive. It wasn't a surprise to see him substituted in the 58th minute. 4",
      "Bruno Fernandes",
      "His passing was sloppy at times and he resorted to shooting from distance in an effort to get United back into the contest. Wasted a big chance from close range with 20 minutes remaining. 4",
      "Patrick Dorgu",
      "Looks low on confidence and was poor again at Old Trafford. He missed a decent chance in the first half - his end product must improve - and is likely to be replaced by Dalot at the weekend. 3",
      "Bryan Mbeumo",
      "The international break had the potential to disrupt Mbeumo's momentum. The 26-year-old showed determination on a night when United weren't at the races for large parts. 5",
      "Amad",
      "Was probably the pick of a bad bunch in the first half. Amad relocated to right wing-back when Mazraoui was brought off and he was still involved in most attacking phases of play. 5",
      "Joshua Zirkzee",
      "The highlight of Zirkzee's first half was his heated exchange with James Tarkowski. The Dutchman made his first start of the campaign and didn't do much until drawing a late save from Pickford. 4",
      "Mason Mount",
      "Made a difference when he came on. 6",
      "Diogo Dalot",
      "An improvement on Dorgu. 5",
      "Kobbie Mainoo",
      "Tried his best. 5",

      "Moyes had not won at Old Trafford in 17 attempts as a visiting manager, so history was stacked against Everton, but he oversaw an unlikely victory with just 10 men on the pitch.",
      "Amorim made two changes and both were enforced, with Harry Maguire and Matheus Cunha dropping out of the squad due to injury, opening the door for Leny Yoro and Joshua Zirkzee to start.",
      "The tactical battle was an interesting one in the opening exchanges. Everton played a high line and pressed with purpose. They wanted Senne Lammens to kick the ball long because they have the height to win aerial balls.",
      "James Tarkowski pushed Zirkzee to the floor in an off-the-ball incident. Zirkzee came close to squaring up with the defender, but referee Tony Harrington gave both a warning.",
      "There must have been something in the air because tensions then boiled over between Everton players. Idrissa Gana Gueye was unhappy with Michael Keane, and he slapped his own teammate in a moment of madness. Gueye was shown a red card and was red in the face as Jordan Pickford held him back.",
      "Bruno Fernandes stood yards away from the incident and couldn't believe what he was watching. The Everton analysts who were sitting in the press box looked equally dumbfounded.",
      "United had kept just one clean sheet in the league, which came against Sunderland, before the visit of Everton, but the sending off handed a huge opportunity to record another.",
      "That's without mentioning that Everton's strikers can't score for toffee. Thierno Barry was goalless in 11 league appearances but was given the nod to start, which meant Beto (one goal in 11) was on the bench. However, Iliman Ndiaye looked threatening at times and Jack Grealish was involved on the left.",
      "United started so badly that Gueye's sending off didn't stop Everton from being on the front foot. The travelling Evertonians chirped and erupted when Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall opened the scoring.",
      "\"Hit it,\" shouted the Everton analyst. Leny Yoro didn't commit to the challenge and Lammens should have done better. The goalkeeper's starting position was poor and the shot was saveable.",
      "Kobbie Mainoo and Lisandro Martinez returned to the squad after recovering from their respective injuries, although the latter's return was more significant given the length of his lay-off.",
      "Martinez had been sidelined for nine months with a cruciate ligament injury. It was great to see him back in the squad and he received a warm reception when he emerged to warm up.",
      "There was further applause for youngster Shea Lacey, who was named in a senior squad for the first time, reward for delivering consistently strong performances in academy fixtures. Lacey has a high ceiling and his squad inclusion is expected to be the first of many.",
      "Mani from The Stone Roses sadly passed away this month. United played \"I Want To Be Adored\" as kick-off approached, and \"This Is The One\" carried more meaning as the players walked out.",
      "The first half performance was reminiscent of last season. United must brush teams like Everton aside at home if they want to secure Champions League qualification next season. November started with draws against Nottingham Forest and Tottenham, but Everton was a much bigger setback.",
      "Most of those in red shirts looked disinterested in the first half, and Amorim hooked Noussair Mazraoui at the interval. Mason Mount was introduced and Amad relocated to right wing-back.",
      "Patrick Dorgu had another game to forget and was hauled off before the hour mark. The problem is his replacement, Diogo Dalot, has also been unconvincing from the left this season. The huge cheer for Mainoo as he replaced Casemiro showed what fans think about the handling of him.",
      "Amorim was widely praised after an excellent October, but United have not entered the winter as they would have liked. The games come thick and fast, and they must find another response.",
      "There were joyous scenes in the Everton section at the full-time whistle. Yoro slumped to his knees and Fernandes complained. The United captain should look at himself first after such a poor display.",
      "Moyes claimed an away win at Old Trafford on his 18th attempt. He'll argue it was worth the wait.",

      "To have a chance of signing Big Sam for the day, simply send your name, contact details, the name of your team and your league, in the form below. If you can't see the form,  click here.",
      "The winner will be drawn on December 1 and Sam will take charge of a game between January 1 and April 30, 2026.",
      "All entrants need to be part of an adult over 18s men’s or women’s 11-a-side team. Teams from walking football can enter.",
      "Allardyce was inspired to help the Every Minute Matters campaign by the shocking experience suffered by Fabrice Muamba, whose heart stopped beating for a total of 78 minutes after he suffered a cardiac arrest in an FA Cup match at White Hart Lane in 2012.",
      "Allardyce explains: “I can still vividly remember what happened to Fabrice a couple of years after I left Bolton. Thanks to immediate CPR and defibrillation, Fabrice made a full recovery. But most grassroots football teams don’t have a medical team on site, which is why it’s critical anyone who plays amateur football – at any level – knows how to perform CPR and use a defibrillator.",
      "“Too many people still think you have to be a medical professional to step in, but that’s simply not true. Anyone can learn these lifesaving skills and if someone collapses, you need to have the confidence to act. “And that confidence comes from training. That’s why I’m urging everyone in grassroots football to take 15 minutes to learn CPR and defibrillation with the BHF’s brilliant free online tool, RevivR.”",
      "This competition closes at 12pm on the 1st of December 2025."

      "Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt have revealed how they were once consulted over some potential transfer arrivals to the club in a secret meeting.",
      "The pair claim it happened during a spell when Ryan Giggs was named as the interim manager, which occurred during the 2013/14 season following the dismissal of David Moyes.",
      "At the time, Manchester United were looking to rebuild following the end of the Sir Alex Ferguson era, with plenty of big-name transfers following in an attempt to get the side back in the Premier League title picture.",
      "With that in mind, the executive vice-chairman at the time, Ed Woodward, sought out some help from Scholes and Butt to discuss transfer targets, with a four-man shortlist proposed to the pair.",
      "Speaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, the United legends were asked about how that meeting with Woodward led to Paul Pogba's return.",
      "Butt responded and said: \"I just remember Ryan [Giggs] took control of the club for four or five or six games at the end of the season... then me and Scholesy did it [the meeting] with him and Phil as well.",
      "\"And I remember obviously they were looking for the right manager to come in and take the job, so they obviously needed targets to go and get in the summer.",
      "\"So I had left the training ground and got called back, and there was a meeting with myself, Scholesy, Ryan, and Ed Woodward, and I think Ed Woodward was on a Zoom call; it wasn't so much face-to-face, I think he was in London, and it was like 'Who would you get?'",
      "\"And he gave us a list of midfielders, I know Pogba was one, Kroos weren't you saying? Fabregas might've been one.\"",
      "Scholes added: \"I think Fabregas might've been one as well, I think even Modric might've been one as well.\"",
      "Butt continued: \"I remember we were all discussing pros and cons to them all, and the end of the conversation was 'go for both of them, Kroos and Pogba, because we're Man United and we need to get back to the top'.",
      "\"And if you get one, it's like yin and yang, we mentioned it a while ago, about if you get centre-backs, with Harry Maguire, and you need a footballing player next to him, it's a bit of the same with midfielders.",
      "\"We're not all the same, and you need a bit to complement each other, and that was how it was left, and then they went all-out for Pogba.\"",
      "United went on to re-sign Pogba in August 2016, in a deal from Juventus that could have reached up to £93m with all of the add-ons included.",
      "The French midfielder went on to make 233 appearances for the club, scoring 39 goals and assisting 51 times for his teammates, before leaving in 2022 on a free transfer.",
      "Pogba's career is often reflected on in different ways, with many remembering the magic he could conjure up, while others believe he never found it consistently enough to match the large fee paid for him.",
      "Perhaps the addition of Toni Kroos, Luka Modric, or Cesc Fabregas alongside him could've changed those fortunes, with the former pair impressing at Real Madrid for many more years to come, while the latter had a spell back in England with Chelsea, before featuring in France and then Italy.",

      "Senne Lammens wore a polo shirt and a navy sweatshirt when he visited Old Trafford after signing for Manchester United. The young goalkeeper looked as though he could be joining United to work in their HR department.",
      "The same observation was made when Lammens reported for international duty with Belgium last week - the 23-year-old was dressed in a beige collared jacket, a khaki t-shirt and chinos.",
      "\"By accident, I saw an article saying he was wearing something boring when he reported for international duty and fans saying they hoped he stays like this,\" laughed Hayk Milkon, one of Lammens' former coaches.",
      "\"This 'boringness' is just the way Senne is, he's really calm and no excesses. He focuses on what he needs to focus on and is open with the people around him. He keeps his feet on the ground.\"",
      "If Lammens looks like someone who could work in an office, every workplace would love to have him in their five-a-side team. United believe they have signed a young goalkeeper with huge potential, and fans who were present at Old Trafford against Sunderland left the stadium buzzing about his debut.",
      "The quirk is that Lammens appears to be a different person when he wears his goalkeeper kit. He made a supremely confident United debut, aggressively commanded his area and kept a clean sheet.",
      "Milkon coached Lammens during their time together at Club Brugge. Milkon is now the youngest manager in the Belgian top-flight and Lammens plays for the biggest club in England.",
      "\"It was Senne with his headphones on. He would go into the gym to do his recovery or some extra top-ups. Or he would just go to relax by playing basketball - he loved to play basketball.\"",
      "Milkon coached in different roles at Club Brugge. He was the assistant of Club NXT (their reserve team), served as their interim manager, was in charge of the Under-18s and eventually became a first-team coach.",
      "His time at Club Brugge coincided with Lammens progressing from the academy to their first team, so he is uniquely positioned to provide insight into United's new goalkeeper signing.",
      "Lammens joined Club Brugge's academy when he was 12. \"He was a guy with huge potential,\" said Milkon. \"As I learned from colleagues who had worked with him when he was much younger, I heard there was a moment that clicked in his head when he became super professional.",
      "\"He was one of the guys during Covid - when the players were not able to train - who was doing a lot at home, he was really going far with this to be the best in these types of areas.",
      "\"Then he continued like this when he joined the first team to train with them. He always wanted to improve. We also had something in place to look at the parameters on which goalkeepers are judged.",
      "\"You see the potential of the goalkeeper based on what they do in games; so their positioning, their decision-making and so on, and Senne was always quite high in these areas.",
      "\"The only bad luck that he had was that the first-team goalkeeper was Simon Mignolet. He's an amazing goalkeeper, so it was difficult for Senne to stay over there in the role of No.2.",
      "\"That would have also blocked his growth, so it was good for him in the end to make the step to go to Antwerp and he did a tremendous job there. It was amazing to see how fast he adapted.\"",
      "Milkon continued: \"I think for us at Club Brugge, it was very clear to everyone that Senne was a top goalkeeper. He would have been the perfect fit for Club Brugge to be the No.1.",
      "\"That was not possible because Mignolet was there. But the parameters that we used to judge his performances indicated he was ticking so many boxes already, and he was consistently doing it.",
      "\"There weren't ups and downs with his performances. He was consistently really high and when you compare this to the top goalkeepers, you have a benchmark to say 'Ok, what potential does this guy have?'",
      "\"He had some chances with the first team at Club Brugge and made a mistake, or maybe two, but in the end it was very clear to everyone that he was a top goalkeeper.",
      "\"It was impossible to try to extend his contract because, again, you have Mignolet, and you cannot block a guy like this. You know he has to go out, he has to play, and he will improve even more.\"",
      "When asked about Lammens' strengths, he said: \"I would say that his decision-making was very good. He is very calm, he sees the solutions on the pitch, he has a quick reaction time and understands the balance between risk and reward, and which decisions are the right ones to make.",
      "\"His clean passing is great, his footwork was really good, and he's just an amazing goalkeeper with the shot-stopping. He made some incredible saves back then already. He's quite a complete goalkeeper.",
      "\"But making the right decisions at a very young age, being very mature with this, was really impressive. And the fact that he is good with both feet is another big strength.",
      "\"For me, Senne is a very calm guy and has all the qualities to be a top professional. That was my impression when I first met him when he was younger and he never changed.\"",
      "Lammens joined Royal Antwerp on a free transfer in the summer of 2023. He was handed his debut a few months later and served as an understudy that season, but earned first-choice status for 2024/2025.",
      "His performances drew attention from the Belgian media. Lammens saved four penalties across a successful first full campaign and received a call-up to Belgium's senior squad in March.",
      "Milkon said: \"I was not surprised when I saw Manchester United had come calling. And to record his first clean sheet, I was really happy for him. Senne is a potential No.1 for the Red Devils - the Belgium national team.",
      "\"He got his chance, he took it, and we're all really proud of him, but we knew it would happen. I believe he has all the capabilities to become the best in the world, so I wish him all the best. I'm sure he will have a very good career in England, and Manchester United should return to the big club they used to be.",
      "\"He will have a positive impact on that, for sure, and hopefully he will be Belgium's first-choice goalkeeper soon. I believe he has the potential, the skillset and the personality to do that.",
      "\"For me, it was just having a tiny little part in having an influence on him at Brugge, but it was the most positive memories of our relationship that we had during this spell.",
      "\"I'm very proud that he is reaching these high levels and not surprised. I believe he will be successful because he is a guy who will not change his focus or start to do something different. He is calm, that's his personality and character, and he wants to succeed. He is hungry and will keep working to be his best.",
      "\"He is so calm, and you have to be patient in football. You cannot worry too much and want things too early, but finding the balance between not being impatient and, at the same time, pushing and demanding what you deserve in a good way, means everything will sort itself out.\"",
      "United staff who have worked with Lammens at Carrington have echoed Milkon's sentiments. He has been described as \"really mature for his age\" and is said to have taken the move in his stride.",
      "Lammens is understood to have impressed coaches during training sessions and a United source said that lots of people have been speaking positively about him. He has already relocated from the luxury hotel where he was initially staying and into a house.",
      "It's no surprise that Lammens likes to play basketball at 6ft 3in, but he is a keen golfer, which is common ground with the likes of Tom Heaton, Luke Shaw, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire.",
      "Matthijs de Ligt, Amad, Maguire and Shaw jogged straight to Lammens to congratulate him after full-time against Sunderland. \"Are you Schmeichel in disguise?\" was chanted at Lammens from the Stretford End.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Lammens will start against Liverpool on Sunday, but it would be a surprise to see him on the bench after delivering a strong debut before the international break.",
      "There would be nothing boring about keeping another clean sheet - this time at Anfield.",
      "Kitbag has slashed the price of Man United kits and merch with up to 50% off select items.",

      "With six English teams participating in this season’s Champions League, and the league stage past at its halfway point, it’s already worth having a look to see just how many Premier League teams might get a crack at the Big Cup again next season.",
      "There will once again be 36 rather than 32 teams in next season’s Champions League, and two of those extra places will once again be awarded to the leagues who have been deemed to have performed best in Europe this season.",
      "In six of the last eight seasons, England would have claimed one of those two spots. The first time it actually mattered, they didn’t; England trailed in behind Germany and Italy, with Newcastle and Man United’s pre-Christmas exits from Europe a key early factor before a series of disappointments across all three competitions in the knockout stages.",
      "It proved to be quite a significant sliding doors moment; had England secured a fifth spot that season it would have gone to Tottenham, who instead went off and won the Europa League.",
      "They are thus the sixth Premier League entrant this season, with Newcastle’s prize for finishing fifth upgraded to a Champions League spot with England – unsurprisingly – coming out miles ahead at the top of the overall rankings on the back of winning two of the three trophies as well as having a losing finalist and semi-finalist.",
      "And the whopping nine English teams in European competition this season have already made a strong start in the quest to secure another bonus spot next season.",
      "The system for working out the co-efficient rating that decides which leagues come out on top is (relatively) simple.",
      "Every win in Europe – whether Champions, Europa or Conference League – is worth two points to your country’s tally, and every draw one. There are then assorted bonus points to be awarded based on finishing positions in the bumper final league tables as well as further points for reaching different knockout rounds.",
      "All teams competing in the Champions League phase are awarded six points just for being there – a huge early boost to England’s tally with two thirds of their nine teams in that competition. You get an additional 0.25 points for finishing 24th in the final table, with an extra 0.25 points on offer for each position from there up. So 23rd gets 0.5, 22nd gets 0.75 and so on all the way up to six points for the table-toppers. The Europa League has no bonus points for competing, but again offers 0.25 points to the team that ends 24th and six to the team finishing first on the same sliding scale as the Champions League.",
      "Just to keep us all on our toes, it’s slightly different again in the Conference. Here you get 0.125 points for 24th, and an extra 0.125 points for each position up to ninth, and then 0.25 points for each extra position you can climb in the top eight.",
      "Long story short, the table-toppers in the Champions League get 12 points altogether, Europa League toppers six points, and Conference League four.",
      "Champions League teams then get an extra 1.5 points for each knockout round they participate in (last 16, quarter-final, semi-final, final), Europa League teams one point for each round, and Conference League teams 0.5 points. There are no bonus points on offer for reaching the playoff round that teams finishing between ninth and 24th in each competition have to deal with, but you do still get result points.",
      "So if you qualify for, say, the Champions League quarter-final by winning both legs of your last-16 clash, you collect 5.5 points for your country’s tally: two for each win and a bonus 1.5 points for reaching the next stage. If you get through with a win and a defeat it’s 3.5 points (two for a win, plus the qualification bonus). And so on.",
      "The total number of points accrued by all teams from a particular league are then divided by the total number of teams from that league who began the season in European competition to obtain an average rating that determines the all-important standings.",
      "This also therefore means individual match wins are worth more to the score for a country that had fewer teams involved to begin with; a win for any Portuguese side this season, for instance, is worth 0.400pts to the final tally because it is two points divided by the five teams they had in contention when the season began, while for England a two-point win is worth only 0.222pts to the total after it has been divided by nine.",
      "",
      "Could pay the price down the line when teams start being eliminated and those that are left see their points still being divided by nine, but for now England are streaking clear. The six bonus points awarded to each of the six Champions League teams are a huge help, but they are also picking up consistently solid results.",
      "All six of England’s representatives there look set for the knockout stages, with none currently lower than 16th despite a ropey set of results on matchday five, while all three of England’s Thursday night warriors also look set for play-off rounds at worst.",
      "Total points: 97.500\nTotal teams: Nine\nTeams still active: Nine\nLeague stage: Liverpool (UCL), Arsenal (UCL), Manchester City (UCL), Chelsea (UCL), Newcastle (UCL), Tottenham (UCL), Aston Villa (UEL), Nottingham Forest (UEL), Crystal Palace (UECL)",
      "",
      "Missed out on an extra place this year, but that does make each individual win worth that little bit more this time. And so far there have been plenty of wins.",
      "Total points: 69.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Bayern Munich (UCL), Borussia Dortmund (UCL), Bayer Leverkusen (UCL), Eintracht Frankfurt (UCL), Freiburg (UEL), Stuttgart (UEL), Mainz (UECL)",
      "",
      "The concern for Italy – who collected one of the bonus spots in the first year of their existence – is that they are already playing catch-up and at serious risk of losing half their Champions League teams before the knockouts with Napoli and Juventus currently looking over their shoulders in 20th and 22nd.",
      "Total points: 67.000\nTotal teams: Seven\nTeams still active: Seven\nLeague stage: Inter (UCL), Atalanta (UCL), Napoli (UCL), Juventus (UCL), Roma (UEL), Bologna (UEL), Fiorentina (UECL)",
      "",
      "Only having five teams but a couple of them being very decent means Portugal are prone to starting deceptively well here, with any wins your Sportings and Portos pick up being worth a chunky 0.4pts apiece. But will inevitably slide down the table, especially with Santa Clara failing to reach the Conference league stage and Benfica unlikely to make the knockouts in the Champions League.",

      "All four of Poland’s European representatives have wound up in the Conference, but the fact they’re all still standing and racking up points that only need to be divided by four means a strong early total.",

      "Manchester United are planning an ambitious raid on Real Madrid for one of their best players who is reportedly not happy under manager Xabi Alonso, according to a report in the Spanish media, but TEAMtalk has analysed why he is very unlikely to move to Old Trafford.",
      "It has been well-documented that Man Utd are on the hunt for a new midfielder in 2026. With Ruben Amorim’s side aiming to finish in the Premier League top four this season, signing a new player for the middle of the park is the utmost priority for the Red Devils.",
      "TEAMtalk understands that Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest is Man Utd’s top midfield target in 2026.",
      "Crystal Palace star Adam Wharton, Brighton and Hove Albion ace Carlos Baleba and Wolves dynamo Joao Gomes also feature in the Red Devils’ wishlist.",
      "E-Noticies has now thrown another name into the mix, reporting that Man Utd want to sign Federico Valverde from Real Madrid.",
      "Man Utd are said to be ‘planning to submit an offer that would exceed €120million (£105.2m, $139m) for Valverde, who was described as a ‘machine in midfield’ and ‘one of the most dynamic and complete midfielders in world football’ in Breaking The Lines in July 2025.",
      "The report comes amid claims in another section of the Spanish media that the Uruguay international is not happy with Madrid manager Alonso.",
      "According to journalist Arancha Rodriguez of COPE, Valverde is one of six Madrid players who are ‘unhappy with Xabi Alonso’.",
      "Valverde has been a very reliable player for Madrid over the years, with his all-round display in the middle of the park making him hugely popular among the Santiago Bernabeu faithful.",
      "However, the 27-year-old Uruguay international, who has won LaLiga thrice and the Champions League twice with Madrid so far in his career, has failed to make a huge impact in Alonso’s system and has also been forced to play at right-back because of injuries.",

      "However, in fairness to E-Noticies, it has noted that Madrid have not made ‘a definitive decision’ on the future of Valverde and are ‘remaining cautious’",
      "While ‘there will be no drastic moves in January’, if Valverde gets back to his best by the end of the season, then Madrid will ‘close the door without hesitation’.",
      "This is not the first time in the Spanish media that rumours linking Valverde with Man Utd have emerged.",
      "In September, a report claimed that Man Utd were so keen on Valverde that they were ready to include Kobbie Mainoo in a deal.",
      "At the time, TEAMtalk’s transfer insider, Dean Jones, noted that Valverde will not drop down a level and join Man Utd.",
      "Jones said on September 22: “There feels pretty much no chance Man Utd will sign Valverde – even as the noise grows that they want to.",
      "“That’s the message I’m getting from people close to the Spanish end of this story, and it’s not really surprising.",
      "“He’s been around the club for almost 10 years now and has become a brilliant, crucial and adaptable player for them.",
      "“There is no need for him to drop down a level to join Man Utd, and that’s truly what it would be.",
      "“His profile would be great for Man Utd, but it just seems too ambitious to me.",
      "“The clubs may be on a similar level in terms of global status, but Madrid’s current team is in a much better place than Man Utd’s, and he is a key part of it.”",
      "It is late November now, but it is hard to think that Valverde’s stance on a potential move to Man Utd has changed.",
      "Meanwhile, Man Utd are growing in ‘optimism’ about their chances of signing a Brazilian midfielder, whose club are now ready to sell him.",
      "A Man Utd defender is ready to leave Old Trafford despite having only just arrived at the Premier League club.",

No denying that this season does represent one in which Arteta might completely lose the plot and go entirely off the rails. Or the one where he wins the league by 10 points. Feels like we’re odds-on to get one or the other.",

Nothing in between is acceptable or even conceivable. And it really is looking more and more like it’s the first one.",

Would they hit the ground running, or would they be a bit tired and out of sorts? For both, it’s been a little from column A, a little from column B.",
      "Maresca definitely still has some hearts and minds to win at Chelsea despite the fine finish to the season that saw them tick off Champions League qualification while completing their collection of UEFA pots and pans and then winning the actual Club World Cup.",
      "A home draw with Crystal Palace wasn’t ideal, but the paddling dished out to West Ham has what really should at least be some kind of halfway credible title bid up and running at least. And we strongly suspect Fulham won’t be the last team left scratching their head after losing to Maresca.",
      "There was some talk of ‘Maresca out’ after a draw with Brentford but that was surely only a minority view. After losing to Manchester United in shambolic fashion, there were more on the bandwagon.",
      "That win over Liverpool was big, though, and a particularly good one for Maresca himself. The second half thumping of Forest was handy, too, albeit inevitably saying far more of their opponents than it did of Chelsea. Home defeat to Sunderland saw awkward questions resurfacing, but it’s been three wins from three since then to leave Chelsea quite incongruously second in the league.",

      "Doing so well that even suffering the ultimate embarrassment of defeat at Old Trafford hasn’t dampened spirits for the most impressive promoted club in quite some time.",
      "Five wins in the bag already, a seven-point lead over Newcastle, and more points than Southampton managed in the entirety of 24/25. Widespread expectation that tougher games would bring Sunderland back down with a bump have thus far proved wide of the mark; there won’t be many teams unhappy at taking four points from two games against Chelsea and Arsenal this season.",

      "Fine end to 24/25 put a different complexion on Brighton’s season than at one time appeared likely. Ending up a clear best of the rest outside the quickly established top seven represented at least a passing grade and they’d have to make a truly awful start to the season to get in any kind of managerial-change bother.",
      "The win over Newcastle to go with victory at Chelsea to go with a win over City reaffirms Brighton’s big-boy-bothering calibre, but does also make some of their other results – draws with Fulham and Wolves, for instance – a bit annoying.",

Glasner absolutely could be poached with bigger beasts surely paying attention to the work he’s done at Selhurst Park.",
      "And if that poaching comes from outside the Premier League, then it comes with the possibility of making Glasner the next Premier League managerial casualty. But still very unlikely.",

How much continuity could there be at Brentford given they’d sold Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard, while Thomas Frank took most of the remaining coaching staff with him to Tottenham? It was a very Brentford move to promote from within and we’ll hold our hands up and admit we thought it would go far, far worse than it has.",

Three wins in four have a distinctly winnable Europa League campaign bubbling along nicely, too. An astonishing shift from what felt like an inexorable downward spiral not that long ago.",

Had Newcastle lost that, as all pre-interlull indications suggested they would, then the spotlight would have been harsh indeed on Howe and his team. They would at that point find themselves slap bang in the muck of a relegation scrap; instead they have lifted themselves back into the mid-table morass where – luckily for them – absolutely nobody is any good at all and the chance of re-establishing themselves in there and even emerging out the top is very real indeed.",
      "There are multiple reasons for Newcastle making such a sticky start to the season and very few of them are directly the fault of a man who did deliver the club’s first trophy in bloody ages last season. That one seismic result against City had vast implications for the title race – in that it confirms there almost certainly won’t now actually be one – but was so big for Newcastle and their manager themselves.",

      "Burnley really did have a horrible fixture list in these opening weeks under a manager with a horrible record at this level, and were given an opening-day reminder by the team that finished 17th last season of just how much harder the ‘simply don’t concede any goals at all’ tactic might be to deploy in the Premier League.",
      "Essentially, Burnley have got back to this level the same way Homer Simpson got to a heavyweight title fight. And Spurs and City have already given them a pummelling.",
      "Victories over Sunderland and Leeds were an impressive and necessary reminder that it might still be enough against teams more on their level, and while a 3-2 win at Wolves was not exactly The Burnley Way it’s still three points against an established – if struggling – Premier League side.",

He appeared to have already thoroughly De-Anged the lot of them only for them to then turn up against Bournemouth and defend like an Ange team while attacking like a Mourinho one.",
      "You know who else won their first couple of games, including one against Man City, after stepping up to Spurs from a smaller but less daft Premier League club? That’s right. But while the Nuno comparisons are obvious, it doesn’t quite feel like the same situation despite some rumblings of discontent.",
      "Crucially, there was no undignified scramble to find a new manager this time. Whatever your thoughts on the timing and manner of Ange Postecoglou’s sacking and the identity of his replacement, it’s also clear Spurs have got the man they wanted in a way they very obviously didn’t when Nuno came in.",
      "But it’s certainly starting to look uncomfortably similar in familiar ways; the small-time approach to big London derbies against Chelsea and Arsenal has not been well received and the fear grows that he just doesn’t understand what this job requires.

      "Vinicius Junior has informed Real Madrid president Florentino Perez that he is not of a mind to extend his Real Madrid contract beyond 2027 owing to his fraught relationship with manager Xabi Alonso.",
      "After shaking his head in disgust and muttering “always me, I’m leaving the team” after being substituted in the 72nd minute of El Clasico last month, his exit may in fact come sooner than that, with The Athletic revealing that tensions between Vinicius and Alonso ‘have only grown’ as the season’s gone on – ‘it is a topic of daily debate inside and outside the club.’",
      "The question Vinicius and his representatives must now be asking is which clubs in world football could offer the £150m likely required to sign him, at least match his £350,000-per-week wages and be comfortable with the reality of him having to be The Man at their club for fear of him throwing a hissy fit if that’s not the case.",
      "The smart money would be on the mad money coming from Saudi Arabia, but what about his Premier League options? We’ve ranked the Big Six on their chance of signing him.",
      "",
      "6) Tottenham",
      "Oh to be a fly on the dressing room wall as Thomas Frank explains to Vinicius the importance of timing his runs to get on the end of long ball flick-ons that Richarlison never wins.",
      "“Can’t we play through the lines, gaffer?” Vinicius says, to suppressed chuckles from the Spurs masses.",
      "“No, but look at our stadium,” Frank replies.",
      "",
      "5) Chelsea",
      "A Brazilian front three at Stamford Bridge would be fun, but spending big on ready-made stars isn’t part of a Chelsea plan based largely upon resale value and the key difference between Vinicius, Joao Pedro and Estevao is the Blues pair’s outstanding work off the ball as well as on it.",
      "There’s also a very good and highly amusing possibility that the Blues hierarchy may deem Vinicius a bit too old for them. At 25 he would be the fifth-oldest player in the squad.",
      "Would be well worth it purely to see Vinicius’ reaction to teammate and compatriot Estevao winning the Ballon d’Or ahead of him.",
      "MAILBOX: Estevao touted as new Neymar as Maresca hailed for keeping him on a leash",
      "",
      "4) Manchester City",
      "“Vinicius is… wow,” was a Pep Guardiola press conference snippet that’s predictably been cited as evidence of the Manchester City manager’s interest in signing the Brazilian by some outlets.",
      "But it was midway through an answer on the excellence of Jeremy Doku and how “incredible” Liverpool right-back Conor Bradley endured a nightmare against him in the recent 3-0 City win over the Reds having coped very comfortably indeed with the problems posed by Vinicius a few days.",
      "Guardiola did say in that same press conference that Doku “will never be a top, top scorer” and City could really do with some goals from their forwards beyond Erling Haaland’s contribution that Vinicius would provide. It could happen under Guardiola, but strikes us as a far more post-Pep panic move from a state-owned football club looking to sell shirts as they suffer a legacy boss comedown.",
      "",
      "3) Liverpool",
      "It would very New Liverpool for Richard Hughes and Michael Edwards to look at their alarming issues in defence, their stunning dip in midfield dynamism and the general lack of cohesion in a squad on the back of signing £420m-worth of big-name talent and think the best fix to be signing a famously stroppy, high-maintenance winger to play on the left over someone to play on the opposite side to replace their in-situ stroppy, high-maintenance winger.",
      "",
      "2) Manchester United",
      "Any teenager would think it mad that Vinicius Junior would even consider a move to Manchester United. Most of them won’t remember the last time they won the Premier League title in 2012 and will be relying on tales of their exasperating greatness from parents, grandparents or millennial friends and family in order to fathom why members of an Amazonic tribe are still wearing Nike AIG Cristiano Ronaldo No. 7 shirts.",
      "Vinicius would have just turned eight when Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez were leading the line for United in the 2008 Champions League final win over Chelsea. They weren’t just one of the biggest teams in world football then, they were actually one of the best. Chances are they would have been somewhere near the top of a Vini Jr dream football club list.",
      "Amid reports that a sponsor will ‘cover the cost’ of his transfer for Manchester United the immediate thought is that INEOS are doing things a bit differently to their predecessors. No whopping contracts for quick-fix superstars. Not buying British but buying British based at least; achieving some success in doing so with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo.",
      "But we must never discount the nagging Manchester United need to occasionally prove to the world that they are indeed Manchester United and can still attract the very biggest names in football, even when they’re not what they need in any way and are actually quite likely to undo the slight and evidently brittle improvements they’ve made under Ruben Amorim.",
      "",
      "1) Arsenal",
      "It doesn’t reflect at all well on Vinicius that a team as impeccably well-drilled and brilliant as Arsenal has to be able to cope with having him in the team. While the quality he would provide in attack may not be enough to offset his lack of contribution in defence for others in the Premier League, Mikel Arteta’s side may just be at a stage in his ‘process’ where they can afford a defensive passenger who can make such a difference in the final third. They’re ready to ‘break the bank’ as ‘favourites’ to sign him.",
      "Riccardo Calafiori has looked very comfortable on that left side of defence for Arsenal and Declan Rice can always shift across and defend when necessary as an all-round midfield master.",
      "Leandro Trossard was given his dues in the form of people who haven’t given him his dues saying others haven’t given him his dues after his excellent performance against Tottenham, but let’s be absolutely clear, Arsenal are still very much in the market for a new left winger.",
      "And with eyes on the Champions League either on top of the Premier League in 2026 or after it in 2027, it would be useful to have a guy who’s won it twice and scored in both of those finals.",
      "Is the title race over before the Christmas decorations go up if Arsenal win at Chelsea? And what next for Liverpool and Spurs? It’s a Big Weekend, all right.",
      "According to reports, Vinicius Junior has made a decision on whether to extend his contract at Real Madrid amid interest from several Premier League sides.",
      "Martin Zubimendi is one of four defensive midfielders in our top 10 Premier League signings of 25/26, highlighting the importance of having an elite No.6.",
      "With racism in football refusing to f*** all the way off, we want to hear your views and your experiences on one of the thorniest issues in the game…",
      "Getting Cristiano Ronaldo off is a genuine disgrace – but Gianni Infantino has plenty of form for being an awful, narcissistic dick.",
      "Is it as simple as Liverpool being so rotten because they are grieving Diogo Jota? There is an argument that no coach could combat that."

      "“He is a player and a person I hope the best for. He is a wonderful young lad and his talent is immense. He is one of the best products that have come out of Man United for many years, so they have to find a way for him to get into the team and perform.”",
      "He added: “He is a massive talent. Does he always make a difference? Maybe not, but he hasn’t been given the time and you are only as good as the people you are surrounded by. I definitely worry about his future.”",

      "Manchester United may need to remodel their left side, especially if Ruben Amorim is sticking around, while two midfielders must be replaced…",
      "Much of Amorim’s first summer in charge at Old Trafford was spent trying to shift players he did not want or saw no future for. It will be a similar story next year if United are serious about a rebuild.",
      "As Amorim marks a year since his first game, here are five players who ought not to be around in 12 months…",
      "",
      "It has been a rough week for Shaw, who bore the brunt of Gary Neville’s frustration on Monday night.",
      "Neville, irked by United’s lack of intensity while chasing the game against Everton, might have been venting but he wasn’t wrong. Shaw was ‘ambling’.",
      "It is an apt description of the former England defender who seem to have become more and more one-paced since entering his 30s. His defending can be passive and though he doesn’t get the same opportunities to bomb on as part of a back three as he might as a wing-back or full-back, you would have to question if Shaw is still capable of that.",
      "At least he is available. He has started all 12 games, compared to just 16 starts over the previous two seasons. Only once in the last four seasons has he started more than half of United’s Premier League games.",
      "Next summer, Shaw will have turned 31 and be entering the final year of a contract that makes him joint fifth among United’s highest earners. Those numbers don’t add up when it comes to INEOSonomics. They already decided the last one was a mistake in 2023.",
      "",
      "We have all held our hands up and admitted we were wrong to write off Casemiro. Some did so more forcefully, disrespectfully than others. This season, the Brazilian has once more become one of United’s most important players.",
      "It is safe to assume, though, that there is little longevity in that status. He will be 34 in February and in the last four months of his massive contract at Old Trafford.",
      "If INEOS were p*ssed about Shaw’s contract, Casemiro’s terms left Sir Jim Ratcliffe apoplectic. The Brazilian is the highest earner at the club, on a salary it is hard to envisage United ever offering again on Ratcliffe’s watch.",
      "More to the point, United desperately need a top-class central midfielder, maybe two. If Casemiro is still the first-choice no.6 next season, we know something has gone terribly wrong with their recruitment.",
      "",
      "Speaking of terrible recruitment…",
      "Ugarte, unfortunately, is damned by Scott McTominay’s stunning success at Napoli. United sold the Ballon d’Or nominee and put that money towards the £50million sent PSG’s way – presumably, much to their astonishment – in an effort to replace Casemiro.",
      "It is perhaps an unfair comparison, but hard to ignore given the trajectories of the two midfielders. McTominay has made himself one of Europe’s most wanted; Ugarte can’t get a game for a team in dire need of his supposed profile.",
      "It takes time to adapt to the Premier League, but it’s been almost a season and a half now. This was the season he needed to step up. And Ugarte looks further away than he ever did.",
      "Having worked with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon, it was thought that Ugarte would be one of the main beneficiaries of the manager’s appointment. But Amorim has been left stunned at the difference in player he bossed at Sporting Lisbon compared to the one who sits on his bench. “He is struggling in the moment,” said Amorim. “He needs to improve, especially in training.” That last part is damning indeed.",
      "Alarm bells were ringing immediately after United signed Zirkzee when no one could really identify what he was. When the question was put to the man himself he admitted that he was neither a no.9 nor a no.10. “I am what I call a false striker. Not a No 9, not a No 10. I am a 9.5.”",
      "It is bad enough when United sign players for positions that are not a priority, but signing a player in a position that does not actually exist was a new low.",
      "So it can come as no surprise that Zirkzee has struggled to adapt. A year after his arrival, United felt it necessary to buy a whole new strikeforce, which left the Netherlands forward in no doubt over his prospects.",
      "Injuries to Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha gave Zirkzee an opportunity to lead Amorim’s line against Everton. “He did alright,” said Amorim, damning the 24-year-old with the faintest of praise. It is not an opportunity he is likely to get again any time soon, assuming Cunha is back for the trip to Palace on Sunday.",
      "",
      "All we’re prepared to commit to here is that if United are to persist with wing-backs, they need a new one for the left flank.",
      "Neville effectively wrote off the entire left side as an attacking threat against Everton, and he wasn’t wrong. Which makes the looming AFCON all the more worrying for United since they will lose Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo, the two players that make their right side so much more potent.",
      "On the opposite side, Amorim seems to favour Dorgu but it’s a close-run thing since neither the Dane nor Dalot have been able to pin down the role as their own.",
      "That’s maybe more understandable in Dalot’s case since he is right-sided. Even if he starts high and wide – not his natural habitat – he is only ever going to drive inside into traffic. Dalot’s versatility has come in useful for numerous managers now since Jose Mourinho signed him while telling the world the Portuguese could be United’s right-back for 10 years. Almost eight years later, he’s not that.",
      "Dorgu, 21, is still a relative rookie having joined United from Parma less than a year ago. But in that time, in 32 appearances, he has as many red cards as assists (one) and no goals.",
      "Beyond the numbers, it is hard to recall any contribution of note. Just a run, a cross, a shot. Anyone?",
      "Dorgu seemed a strange signing given he was a relative rookie and the importance of wing-backs in Amorim’s system. Already, they need another.",
      "Is the title race over before the Christmas decorations go up if Arsenal win at Chelsea? And what next for Liverpool and Spurs? It’s a Big Weekend, all right.",
      "Martin Zubimendi is one of four defensive midfielders in our top 10 Premier League signings of 25/26, highlighting the importance of having an elite No.6.",
      "With racism in football refusing to f*** all the way off, we want to hear your views and your experiences on one of the thorniest issues in the game…",
      "Getting Cristiano Ronaldo off is a genuine disgrace – but Gianni Infantino has plenty of form for being an awful, narcissistic dick.",
      "Is it as simple as Liverpool being so rotten because they are grieving Diogo Jota? There is an argument that no coach could combat that.",
      "It seems Jurgen Klopp has already given Liverpool two names to replace Arne Slot and one of them is Steven Gerrard."

      "When David Moyes said Manchester United “must improve in a number of areas”, he listed three facets of their game. Or, well, the entire sport: “Passing, creating chances and defending.”",
      "He did not cite whipping balls into the box. Little wonder, as exactly two months later his team was breaking the record for the most crosses attempted by a team in a single Premier League game.",
      "Rene Meulensteen called the Manchester United approach “quite straightforward” and “easy to defend against”. Dan Burn had “never headed that many balls since the Conference” and was “happy for them to play like that”. Darren Bent “knew that was going to happen” and was also “happy for them to play like that,” having had as many touches in his own box as the opposition’s despite scoring a last-minute equaliser.",
      "And Moyes admitted it was “as bad as it gets”, with his P45 ultimately swung in 72 days after those 81 crosses epitomised his reign.",
      "This was worse. This was weeks of steadily building progress completely squandered, and Ruben Amorim’s most damaging proclivities coming to the fore again.",
      "It was Moyes securing his first ever Premier League win as a visiting manager at Old Trafford in 18 attempts dating back to 2002, Manchester United suffering their first ever Premier League home defeat after seeing the opposition have a player sent off, and Everton not failing to have a single shot after their goal, but instead rather sagely identifying the distinct lack of any need to try.",
      "They had Idrissa Gueye dismissed for a baffling moment of self-destruction in the 13th minute but produced a performance of determined grit and organised obduracy which had both managers praising the infighting post-match.",
      "MORE ON THE MANCHESTER UNITED MESS FROM F365\n👉 Neville slammed for ‘thinking he’s second coming of Guardiola’ with verdict of ‘ambling’ star\n👉 Amorim ‘furious’ with two stars for ‘completely disregarding instructions’ vs Everton\n👉 Ruben Amorim ‘asking for’ sack with Manchester United tactics v 10-man Everton",
      "“I quite like when my players have a fight,” said Moyes, resisting the obvious temptation to say only that the situation would be handled internally. “I don’t want them to accept someone not doing well enough.”",
      "“I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other,” Amorim added.",
      "But when the Portuguese also describes it as “my fault” that said players “didn’t understand the moments of the game during the 90 minutes,” and that he needs to better “explain to the players how to play in every situation of the game,” it is difficult to see how Casemiro scrapping with Matthijs de Ligt over a misplaced pass would help.",
      "At least Jose Mourinho controlled the “brain” if not the body of only Luke Shaw, the manager “making every decision” for a player who “cannot play with my understanding of the game”.",
      "Amorim has taken on that responsibility for an entire team which apparently cannot think for itself even when confronted by an opponent with one win in four games, reduced to ten men for 77 minutes and without a win of any kind at that stadium since December 2013, during the mess of the Moyes season when it felt like a team would record their first win at Old Trafford in decades every other week.",
      "If this group needs a coach to issue reminders about the need to raise their intensity and diversify their course of attack somewhat against a team down one player then it is yet again difficult to envisage quite how this arrangement ultimately works.",
      "Manchester United put in 38 crosses against Everton, bringing into question Amorim’s claim about having spent the international break watching what opposition managers do before coming to the conclusion that James Tarkowski and Michael Keane might struggle under an aerial assault.",
      "That is not even close to touching those absurd numbers posted against Fulham but still nine more than their previous season high across 120 minutes on that miserable evening at Grimsby, and their most in a Premier League game since October 2018.",
      "That was when Mourinho was to be sacked regardless of the result delivered against Newcastle, only for Alexis Sanchez to grant him a stay of execution with a last-minute winner in a wretched game.",
      "Mourinho was finally shown the door 73 days later, lasting about 24 hours longer than Moyes after he bore those 81 crosses.",
      "Perhaps that represents a harbinger of doom for Amorim, whose rollercoaster would finally end on February 5 going by that timeline. Manchester United’s last match before that execution date being at home to Fulham is almost too narratively satisfying.",
      "This was every bit as desperate as those displays under patently doomed managers, every inch as uninspiring a gameplan and reaction. That it was so thoroughly exposed by Moyes, long but no longer the poster boy for Manchester United’s era of sustained failure post-Ferguson, was most damning of all.",
      "The list of things Manchester United must improve remains painfully long more than a decade later; despite that slight recent upturn, the manager is still towards the top of it after all these years.",
      "Is the title race over before the Christmas decorations go up if Arsenal win at Chelsea? And what next for Liverpool and Spurs? It’s a Big Weekend, all right.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United chiefs are having ‘doubts’ about head coach Ruben Amorim as they prepare to block an ‘elite’ January signing.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are still backing Ruben Amorim as they are preparing to let eight players leave and make four priority signings.",
      "Martin Zubimendi is one of four defensive midfielders in our top 10 Premier League signings of 25/26, highlighting the importance of having an elite No.6.",
      "With racism in football refusing to f*** all the way off, we want to hear your views and your experiences on one of the thorniest issues in the game…",

      "FBREF explains that positive numbers suggest better luck or an above-average ability to stop shots.",
      "Including only those who have played three or more games, here’s how the Premier League shot-stoppers are performing this season.",
      "And here’s who was the best goalkeeper in 2024/25.",
      "",
      "Henderson had serene outings against Brentford, Brighton and Wolves, keeping consecutive clean sheets as Palace firm up again. The England keeper will doubtless fancy himself as Thomas Tuchel’s No.1 in USA next summer. Any chance?",
      "",
      "… Not with Pickford in his form. Consecutive clean sheets and a string of saves at Manchester United, who failed to score from a PSxG of 1.8, see the Everton stopper climb here. Pickford just needs to avoid a crash in form to cruise into the World Cup as Tuchel’s No.1.",
      "",
      "Spurs being wretched against Chelsea wasn’t bad news for everyone at Spurs – Vicario padded his stats by conceding just one from a PSxG of 3.2. But six goals conceded in the draw with Manchester United and the miserable north London derby defeat came from a combined PSxG of 4.6.",
      "",
      "Replacing clean sheet machine Trafford at Burnley, Dubravka has made a very solid start at Turf Moor. Which is handy since he has faced more shots than any other goalkeeper. Might already have save of the season tied up after preserving Burnley’s win at Wolves in the dying seconds but should have done more to prevent West Ham’s second and third goals.",
      "What a save from Dubravka 🧤 pic.twitter.com/YmY4Lq2abB",
      "",
      "Verbruggen’s rotten record last season didn’t stop him once again being linked with the likes of Bayern Munich in the summer. In recent weeks, the Dutchman looked more like a goalkeeper who might catch the eye of the big boys after a shakier start to the season and the late, win-preserving penalty save against Brentford sees him climb here.",
      "",
      "Fat lot of good topping this list after the first three games did Trafford. This is likely to be his number for the rest of the season unless Gianluigi Donnarumma suffers a misfortune.",
      "",
      "Sunderland fans have been raving about Roefs after his start to life on Wearside and everyone else is starting to see what the fuss is about. Only Dubravka has made more saves and no-one has a higher saves percentage (79.2%).",
      "",
      "The massive Italian has emerged as City’s undisputed No.1 to the shock of no one and the horror of James Trafford. Donnarumma has made a solid start to life in the Premier League but showed for the first time against Bournemouth some vulnerability to crosses.",
      "",
      "His England recall was scuppered by a concussion suffered at Brentford and a run of five clean sheets in the first seven games has been followed by none in five.",
      "",
      "Lammens dazzled United fans with some simple competency but the first questions were asked of the Belgian after Everton’s win at Old Trafford from 0.4 PSxG. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s shot was within reach, but Lammens was caught off balance and forced to push off the wrong foot, reducing the distance he could dive.",
      "",
      "A big climber after matchday 12 at Bournemouth, moving from 23rd to here and into the black after conceding twice from a PSxG of 4.1. Still has some way to go to convince Hammers fans he should be their long-term No.1.",
      "",
      "Life is rarely quiet when Martinez has the mitts on. He began the season well, then tailed off quite alarmingly, but a clean sheet and a penalty save against Bournemouth was more like it. Then he went to Leeds and conceded a shocker.",
      "",
      "Last season’s joint winner of the Golden Glove award had a wretched few weeks, falling 13 places in this list before facing Leeds then Liverpool. In no game have Forest faced fewer shots on target than Arne Slot’s side managed at Anfield.",
      "",
      "Johnstone has been more reliable than Jose Sa but Sunderland’s opener cut the ex-England keeper in half; Burnley’s first took him by surprise; and he might feel he could have kept out the first of Fulham’s three. Harsh? Probably. At Chelsea, he was powerless to stop any of the Blues’ three second-half goals and it was a similar story in the defeat to Palace.",
      "",
      "It almost doesn’t matter what Sanchez does, everyone has already decided that Chelsea need an upgrade. And they are probably correct.",

      "",
      "Leno was bouncing back from a poor season by his own high standards with an impressive start to this campaign but defeats at Villa and Bournemouth were expensive for the German when it comes to this particular metric. Clean sheets against Wolves and Sunderland have provided a small boost.",
      "",
      "Raya faced more shots on his target at Sunderland than the previous four games combined. He kept out neither of them. Then he conceded to Spurs from their only shot on target which had a PSxG of 0.1.",
      "",
      "Literally no one views Bayindir as a credible No.1, including Ruben Amorim. Since he was dropped for Lammens, United haven’t lost. Coincidence?",
      "",

      "You have to feel for Hermansen. He seemed to be bought on the hop by the Hammers and was thrown into a team flailing badly. Taken out of the firing line now, with Areola back in under Nuno.",

There have been goals for which the big Georgian was beaten rather easily so a clean sheet against Villa was much-needed for his confidence. Only to be stitched up by Virgil van Dijk at City, where saving an Erling Haaland penalty couldn’t spare him from falling here.",
      "Brentford were widely assumed to have got a bargain in Kelleher, and they probably have, even if he is currently keeping the wrong company down here.",

      "Just when there was a bit of momentum at Manchester United, and doubts about Ruben Amorim's much-maligned formation were vanishing - then came the loss to Everton.",
      "It was a game that put the Amorim project back to square one in terms of how much faith there is in this specific era. Gary Neville said the complacency shown by United will erode confidence in the team - but there was just as much criticism about the 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Despite playing over 75 minutes with an extra player after Everton's Idrissa Gueye was sent off, Amorim chose to stick with his preferred formation - keeping three centre-backs and two wing-backs on the pitch.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" asked Neville, while Jamie Carragher added: \"I don't understand how you can stick with something so steadfastly in a situation like that. You don't need three [centre-backs] there.\"",
      "Next up for United is a trip to Crystal Palace, where Oliver Glasner has made a success of that 3-4-2-1 formation. The Eagles sit in the top five - where United want to be - having won a trophy via the FA Cup, which has eluded Amorim in his year in charge thus far.",
      "Glasner's formation has even survived the departures of Michael Olise and Eberechi Eze, highlighting how the system thrives on more than a few top-level players - it is a collective structure that works. How United need that at the moment.",
      "\"We have found a system where we are very balanced, where we can threaten the opposition goal and also be very consistent in our defence,\" said Glasner last month. \"That's why we stick to it.\"",
      "So why does it bring success for Palace, but less so for Man Utd? Using the Palace boss' own words, we take a look at Glasner's formation from back to front.",
      "The back three of Chris Richards, Maxence Lacroix and Marc Guehi have marshalled things brilliantly in front of Dean Henderson - one of the statistically best goalkeepers in the division.",
      "Palace have the Premier League's second-best defence in terms of goals conceded - and are one of only two backlines to let in a single-digit goal tally after a dozen Premier League games. The other team is league leaders Arsenal.",
      "The central areas are the most important part of the pitch for Glasner, as it is the most vulnerable area for any side. \"The centre determines the game. It starts with the back three - you're talking about the core,\" he says.",
      "One of the reasons three centre-backs is a good system in the modern Premier League era is the way wide centre-backs protect the 'half space'.",
      "It is the area where most dangerous attacks emerge from via defence-breaking passes or runs - these areas are also described as the 'pockets'.",
      "As Glasner says: \"The half runs, which is where most of the assists are coming from, in defence you have to protect these areas.\" And Palace appear to have the right profiles in those centre-back positions.",
      "No Premier League defender has more interceptions this season than both Richards and Lacroix, while only six defenders have won more possession in the defensive third this season than Palace captain Guehi.",
      "Even Neville spoke about the importance of positioning the three centre-backs on Monday night against Everton. \"Matthijs de Ligt is much more dominant and certain in that central role,\" he said. \"When Harry Maguire plays, De Ligt goes into the right channel where he gets caught out and doesn't look comfortable.\"",
      "Palace have perfected their back three, but on the basis of recent displays, United need a bit more work.",
      "The four in Palace's midfield are divided into two areas: the wing-backs and the two sitting midfielders.",
      "The flying wing-backs of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell are critical to this Palace team because of the intensity they bring.",
      "Munoz is the most intense player in the Premier League, clocking nearly 14.5km per game at high intensity this season - nearly 1.5km more than the next-best player.",
      "It is not a singular thing to Munoz, it is part of Glasner's instructions. That's because Mitchell, on the opposite flank, sits fifth for current Premier League players in the same metric. Palace are the only team in the Premier League with two players in the top dozen top-flight players in this category.",
      "What is more striking is how Palace's wing-backs compare to Man Utd's wing-backs. For example, Munoz runs further per game at high intensity than Amad Diallo and Noussair Mazrouai combined.",
      "Meanwhile, Mitchell is streets clear of what United's left-wing-back options, Patrick Dorgu and Diogo Dalot, produce.",
      "Then comes the importance of the two sitting midfielders - rotated between Adam Wharton, Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma - who set the tone for Palace's play.",
      "\"The central midfielders, we call them the quarter-backs,\" says Glasner. \"They are responsible for the speed of our attacks, if we go forward or keep possession. So they are important.\"",
      "Palace and United's midfield set-up is similar. In Wharton, the Eagles have their own version of Bruno Fernandes - a player who sits and tries to break the opposition's lines.",
      "\"That's why the manager wants me there,\" said Man Utd captain Fernandes on Monday night. \"To have more of the ball and control the tempo of the team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] knows I can run a lot, press high and get my body back there when we need to get to the box and defend.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the other sitting midfielder - Kamada for Palace or Casemiro at Man Utd - sits and shares defensive duties with the other player.",
      "For Palace, the system works defensively as well as offensively. Kamada sits in the top five midfielders this season for tackles won per 90, with a slightly better record than Chelsea's Moises Caicedo.",
      "But for United, how Casemiro and Fernandes cope in midfield as a two has been much-maligned. They were cut wide open at times against Everton on Monday, with Gueye showing signs of frailty within the opening minutes.",
      "But even after the Everton midfielder's red card, the Toffees still had joy playing around United's midfield two - with the winning goal coming from direct passing through the middle of the pitch.",
      "But it is not just Palace's sitting midfielders who play Glasner's side progress the ball centrally - the two No 10s also help to create overloads in the most important area of the pitch.",
      "\"We try to play with the two No 10s narrow, with the striker - so we can maybe have eight players in the centre to combine together,\" says Glasner. Those eight players being three centre-backs, two sitting midfielders, two attacking midfielders and one striker.",
      "\"You can't pass with one touch if players are 30 or 40 yards away from each other in the distances,\" Glasner added. \"You need connections on the pitch.\"",
      "The two No 10s, normally Ismaila Sarr and Yeremy Pino in this Palace team, are helping them to break through the middle of the pitch by creating a four-man box with the sitting midfielders. No matter if you face a team with two or three in midfield, you will always have an overload.",
      "But they also assist in pinning opposition teams back. \"Some teams mark our No 10s with their No 6s [defensive midfielders] - so they're pretty much playing with a back six,\" says Glasner.",
      "If a busy striker like Jean-Philippe Mateta can occupy multiple centre-backs at once - as he tends to do - then the two No 10s need to be marked by midfielders. If they aren't, the likes of Sarr and Pino have more space.",
      "All those eight players being central can create a very congested area in the middle of the park, but Glasner has plans for that. \"If the opposition closes the middle, then somebody can drop out and you can overload the wing,\" he says.",
      "Palace's front three is a perfect system set up by the right profiles. \"You need pocket players, you need runners - the mix makes it,\" he says. The pocket players are Sarr and Pino, the runners are Munoz and Mitchell.",
      "It allows Mateta to do what he does best - be physical and hold the ball up. Mateta ranks top for the number of hold-ups in the Premier League this season.",
      "\"You need the right players for it,\" says Glasner about his attack. \"You can't ask all the players making runs in behind if they are used to playing in the pockets.\"",
      "United tried to address these forward areas in the transfer window, forking out big fees for Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.",
      "They fit the United structure in places, as has been seen this season in bright attacking moments. But any injuries - such as Cunha and Sesko's this past week - and there are holes. And they are holes that Palace do not seem to have."

      "Luke Shaw came under fire as Man Utd's defeat to Everton raised more questions of Ruben Amorim's system; Gary Neville on Luke Shaw against Everton: \"He's ambling. You can't do that. He should be running forward every single time\"",
      "By Nick Wright, Oliver Yew and Adam Smith",
      "Tuesday 25 November 2025 15:06, UK",
      "Gary Neville slammed Luke Shaw's lack of intensity as Manchester United slumped to another low under head coach Ruben Amorim with their 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton.",
      "The 30-year-old, playing as the left-sided centre-back in Ruben Amorim's back three, was singled out for \"ambling\" forward as Manchester United tried, and failed, to recover from a goal down.",
      "Shaw is one of four Manchester United players, along with Matthijs De Ligt, Bruno Fernandes and Bryan Mbeumo, to have started every Premier League game this season. It has been a rare period of availability for a player dogged by fitness issues.",
      "Last season, he only completed 90 minutes once in the Premier League, having only done so seven times in the campaign before that. You have to go back to 2022/23 for the last time he managed to feature consistently across a full season.",
      "Staying fit has proved a major challenge for Shaw.",
      "Once a marauding full-back with the energy to shuttle between the two boxes, his physicality is not what it used to be. His lack of intensity against Everton riled Neville with Manchester United trailing against 10 men and needing a goal.",
      "\"You have Shaw, [Leny] Yoro and [Matthijs] De Ligt behind the ball,\" he said on co-commentary. \"Shaw is getting forward more, but he's ambling forward, let's be clear. He's been bugging me for the last 20 minutes. He's ambling. You can't do that.",
      "\"He should be running forward every single time. I don't care. Yoro, I have a little bit more sympathy for but Shaw? That's a waste of time. I don't care. It's not conning anybody. I'm not having it.\"",
      "Shaw's physical decline can be seen in the numbers. There is a caveat in that he has been used in a role which requires less running under Amorim, as a centre-back rather than a full-back, but the drop-off in many areas predates the head coach's arrival.",
      "Shaw's sprints and kilometres covered per 90 minutes have followed a downward trend and his attacking output has also declined.",
      "Shaw has steadily contributed fewer crosses, goal involvements and chances created over the course of the last five seasons.",
      "Gary Neville says Manchester United's performance in the 1-0 defeat to 10-man Everton \"smelt of complacency\" and will \"erode trust\" in Ruben Amorim's team.",
      "Despite Shaw's limitations, Amorim's system once again came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Still trailing, Amorim made changes to try and get back into the game, bringing on Diogo Dalot for Patrick Dorgu and Kobbie Mainoo for Casemiro. They were like-for-like substitution as the United boss left Shaw, De Ligt and Yoro on the pitch, sticking with his three-at-the back system for the full 90 minutes.",
      "It was a move that left many Man Utd fans frustrated, particularly bringing on the right-footed Dalot to play in front of Shaw as the pair ended up getting in each other's way on Manchester United's left side.",
      "\"You have to have urgency and make the pitch as big as possible, and you have to put as many players as possible in forward areas,\" said Neville.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim has a question to answer,\" he added.",
      "\"Bringing Dalot on over there in front of Shaw? I don't quite see it. You have five at the back, why? Embarrassing.",
      "\"This should be like the Alamo. Really quick, high-tempo passing side-to-side, getting into good wide areas, putting crosses in, getting bodies in attack, sustaining attacks. It's very slow from United. There is no presence in the box whatsoever.\"",
      "Once again, Amorim being wedded to his 3-4-3 formation and his reluctance to change in-game proved costly for United. His devotion to playing three at the back has come to be seen as a flaw, especially when trying to chase games.",
      "Questions will be asked again of Amorim and his flexibility. It's hard to see why he kept his three central defenders on the pitch and didn't throw extra attackers on against Everton when it was obvious they were lacking a focal point in the absence of the injured Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha, something which was also highlighted by Jamie Carragher after the game on Monday Night Football.",
      "\"Ruben Amorim feels like the first manager I've seen who sticks with a system rather than an idea of how to play,\" Carragher said. \"It feels like the formation is his baby and to not change it or alter it in certain situations like that [against Everton], I don't understand how you can stick with it so steadfastly.",
      "\"If you have to stick with the system, put a midfielder in defence, which we have seen managers do in the past, because you are going to have so much of the ball.",
      "\"It's not about losing the three points against Everton, I think it is one of those moments where people will really question the manager. He will take a lot of the blame.\"",
      "Amorim still has Lisandro Martinez to return from injury. The Argentina international will likely slot back into the left-sided centre-back role, but Shaw looks unsuited to playing at wing-back and Amorim's other options are also underperforming.",
      "At Sporting, his wing-backs were attacking outlets vital in making his system work. In his final full season in charge, in 2023/24, Nuno Santos, Geny Catamo and Ricardo Esagio, his three most-used wing-backs, contributed a combined total of 26 goals or assists between them in league games alone.",
      "Amorim's wing-backs at Manchester United have contributed half as many goals or assists across a similar number of league games.",
      "And nine of their 13 goals and assists, roughly 70 per cent, have come from Amad Diallo, with the others used in the position, Dorgu, Dalot, Noussair Mazraoui, Harry Amass and Tyrell Malacia, only managing four between them in a combined 67 starts at wing-back.",
      "The struggles of Amorim's wing-backs raise further questions about Amorim's devotion to his system. If they are not contributing offensively, then what are they really bringing to the table?",
      "It is just one of many questions for their under-fire head coach, who can add Shaw's decline to a growing list of problems.",
      "Super 6 are starting the season by guaranteeing a £1,000,000 winner! Play for free."

      "Thursday 27 November 2025 20:46, UK",
      "Our football betting expert Jones Knows provides his insight across the Premier League and sees Newcastle slipping up on the road again at Everton.",
      "To have picked up 13 points from a possible 18 at home despite facing a tough fixture list of Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea and Aston Villa is an excellent barometer of the work Keith Andrews is doing at Brentford. There's been no ripping up of the tactical blueprint. No reinventing of any wheels. Just smart coaching and decision making that is utilising their strengths.",
      "Meanwhile, there's good intent, plenty of promise, lots of neat build-up at Burnley, but when the big moments come, the Clarets too often are brushed aside. Over 2.5 goals has landed in every one of their six away days so adding that line to a Brentford win results in a 5/4 shot to attack with Sky Bet.",
      "When a price looks wrong, it's usually because the market has failed to adapt to a change in circumstances. And in Rayan Cherki's case, the assumption is that the Premier League will treat him the same way Ligue 1 did when it comes to being fouled.",
      "The algorithms that price the \"fouls won\" markets are still feeding on French data, where he averaged 1.4 last season - it's a figure that is on the rise. He's been fouled two or more times in three of his four starts for City, where he is picking up the ball in the heart of the midfield battle, to an average of 1.9 fouls per 90. The 7/4 with Sky Bet for him to be fouled twice again is a lovely chunk of value.",
      "Sometimes the numbers don't whisper, they scream at you - and Bournemouth's away data is doing a full-blown fire alarm routine when it comes to backing goals in this encounter.",
      "Let's start with the headline stat: 3.85 goals per game in the last 20 Bournemouth's away fixtures.",
      "That isn't a trend, that's a lifestyle choice from Andoni Iraola, whose philosophy of how to play the game mirrors that chunky goal return. And when 18 of those 20 games on the road have sailed over 2.5 goals, you can stop calling it variance and start calling it what it is: a profitable betting theory when the prices are right.",
      "You don't hit overs in 18 of 20 by accident. Jump on the over 2.5 at 10/11 with Sky Bet. It's the bet of the weekend.",
      "Newcastle are about as reliable away from home as a toddler walking past a puddle.",
      "Dating back to last season, Newcastle have no win in eight Premier League away games - their worst run since December 2021 - and across all competitions they have lost four on the spin away from home sweet St James' Park.",
      "The energy, the press, the sharpness, everything that has made Eddie Howe's team a Premier League force, all goes down a gear on their travels. They have looked leggy, stretched and noticeably flatter in defeats at West Ham and Brentford of late.",
      "And, this game is of course their third game in eight days, too. Everton will be licking their lips.",
      "Newcastle away from home have a problem and Everton at home are a problem for them - just like Brentford and West Ham were - and the price hasn't quite caught up that fact. The 7/4 on offer from Sky Bet for a home win looks the smart play.",
      "Fulham to have 13 or more shots at 10/11 with Sky Bet has got my attention. Spurs are facing 12.7 shots per game this season. That's a marker of a team who are struggling to dominate territory and one which is happy to soak up pressure.",
      "And the teams clearing the 13-shot bar aren't exactly a who's who of juggernauts. Burnley, Bournemouth, Bodø/Glimt, Monaco and Leeds have all walked into Spurs matches and hit the magic 13 or more number.",
      "Also, Cristian Romero's suspension bodes well for a Fulham shots play.",
      "From a 23-game sample in the Premier League, Tottenham concede almost five more shots per match without their influential defender. A huge number. That's not a wobble, that's a structural collapse - one that Fulham can exploit on their way to a victory.",
      "Strip the names away, hide the crests and if this was Team A hosting Team B then Crystal Palace would be odds-on.",
      "Because every measurable facet of Palace's game carries more structure, coherence and repeatability than anything Manchester United are serving up right now. This is why the 13/10 on offer for a Palace home win is dripping in value.",
      "This isn't about history. It's about now. And right now, United play football that resembles a flickering lightbulb: occasionally bright but one bad moment away from plunging a room into darkness.",
      "Palace, under Oliver Glasner, are the opposite. They look like a team. A functioning one. A confident one. A side that knows how to create, how to control.",
      "You're getting a fantastic price here on a better-drilled side, the clearer identity, the team whose game has weight and repeatability, not a historical brand propped up by recreational money in the markets. Home win.",
      "The value doesn't live in the traditional markets here as Aston Villa are rightly dominating across the board - it's hiding where Wolves under Rob Edwards are on the improve and that's their set piece output. His teams work set plays meticulously.",
      "His Luton team ranked as the best team in the Championship from set piece goals scored and expected goals output in both spells in that league while his Forest Green side ranked second for expected goals from set pieces during their promotion from League Two.",
      "We've already seen signs in one game that Wolves are taking set pieces more seriously after creating 0.77 worth of expected goals from those scenarios in the defeat to Crystal Palace. Ladislav Krejci, who has had 10 shots in his last 10 games, was the main threat and first contact from corners last weekend. He looks a tasty bet at 12/1 with Sky Bet to score.",
      "If there's one thing betting teaches you, it's that bad beats are difficult to stomach no matter how long you've been in this game for. And last week's angle, Brentford on the double chance at Brighton - still lingers like a stubborn hangover. The logic was right, the bet looked to be cashing, right up until those football gods decided that Brentford would throw away a 1-0 lead with 10 minutes to go and Igor Thiago would miss a penalty with the final kick.",
      "But here we are again, staring at a very familiar setup. And, yes, I am going back to the well in taking on Brighton in this spot because the well is still overflowing with value. Brighton, for all their fluidity and lovely patterns, simply do not enjoy playing teams who go direct, who turn them.",
      "Under Fabian Hurzeler, Brighton have won 19 of 34 Premier League games when their opponents have played under 15 per cent of passes long, but only two of 16 games otherwise. Forest played 26 per cent of passes long vs Liverpool last week and a similar approach puts them in a great spot of getting another result with the 10/11 on the draw no bet standing out.",
      "Virgil van Dijk has made nine fouls in his last five games. The imperious, sometimes untouchable defender has gone missing and been replaced by a far scruffier version that is making more mistakes and committing more fouls.",
      "It took 11 games for Van Dijk to reach five fouls at the start of last season - now it looks like he can make five in one game.",
      "That player who glided through matches without needing to lay a glove on anyone is suddenly hacking, grabbing and stepping into late challenges like a man trying to put out fires with a watering can. Playing next to Ibrahima Konate can do that to a player.",
      "His direct opponent Callum Wilson is clever at tempting defenders into awkward contact and picking up soft fouls. Go back two seasons ago and Wilson was drawing 1.6 fouls per 90 in the Premier League and has won five fouls in four starts under Nuno Espirito Santo, who seems to trust him now to be the focal point.",
      "The price of 11/2 with Sky Bet for Van Dijk to make at least two fouls is massive - best price of the season territory. Take the value before the market catches up.",
      "This game stinks of caution.",
      "Those anticipating that one of these teams are going to play \"statement-making football\" could end up disappointed as these games can turn into an exercise in risk management, especially when you consider the hectic schedule both teams are facing at the moment.",
      "Enzo Maresca and Mikel Arteta are cut from the same cloth when it comes to control and not taking unnecessary risks, especially Arteta in these types of games away from home. Last season, Arsenal won just once away in their eight games with top nine opposition, drawing five of those matches. They've been beaten at Anfield this season and came through in gritty fashion at Newcastle in a very nip-and-tuck encounter.",
      "Arteta plays these games like a draw is just fine in the grand scheme of things - and he's not wrong.",
      "Both teams know that a point keeps the narrative intact. Nothing is lost, everything remains possible. The stalemate, the bet no one wants to back, is the shrewdest way to approach the outright market with 21/10 on offer with Sky Bet."

      "\"I see the ideal Manchester United midfielder as being able to do everything.\"",
      "The words of former Old Trafford metronome, Paul Scholes.",
      "United's midfield remains a problem. Ruben Amorim's system continues to be drawn into question, a set-up with its frailties further scrutinised as a result of an insistence on leaving two players anchoring in the middle of the park.",
      "Whether it be personnel or instruction, United's inability to consistently control games continues to cost them.",
      "In a test of Amorim's system against 10-man Everton on Monday night, United had very few answers. Instead, Amorim's rare unbeaten run of five matches fell to a dismal end as United were outplayed, outfought and outthought.",
      "With 718 appearances for United, 155 goals and a trophy haul to rival most English football clubs, very few have taken to the Old Trafford midfield like Scholes once did.",
      "As he sat in central London, given an opportunity to mull over the past ahead of a live event for his podcast, The Good the Bad, The Ugly, being asked \"What makes a Manchester United midfielder?\", the proverbial gears began to turn.",
      "\"It's a little bit different when I played because you hear these number 6s, number 8s, number 10s, I suppose, come into that midfield role as well,\" Scholes says.",
      "\"You can attack, you can defend, you can be part of everything. That's your job as a midfield player for Manchester United.\"",
      "Scholes did it all in the middle of the park. He partnered the greats in a traditional 4-4-2, spent a spell as a shadow striker and in the latter days, relied on a superior reading of the game to drop into a deeper role.",
      "While his career spanned over nearly two decades, it was an era that rarely referred to the number like today, instead, characteristics and traits defined your position.",
      "\"I go back to Brian Robson, Roy Keane, Nicky Butts, [they] are capable of doing everything,\" Scholes says, reeling off names cast into United's successes of the past.",
      "\"You have to be capable of doing that. The game's changed. There's a holding midfield player, there's maybe two attacking midfield players.\"",
      "Perhaps United's issue is that the club lack the all-rounders Scholes is eulogising about. Have the discernible roles harmed United's midfield? Or will United be able to find a happy medium?",
      "\"I think it [the Man Utd midfield] has got better. Casemiro's been really good this season.",
      "\"Are you going to win the league with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes in a central midfield partnership? I'm not too sure, it still seems a little bit away from that. But on the whole, the midfield has looked a little bit better.\"",
      "But while marginal improvements are evident, United's midfield seemingly feels aeons away from what it needs to be to close the proverbial gap on the league challengers. Is the answer closer to home?",
      "Kobbie Mainoo emerged as a key player for Erik ten Hag when he made his debut in 2023. That 'Everton debut' that fans reminisce about didn't see him deployed as a No 10, nor as a No 8. Instead, an 18-year-old Mainoo was United's deepest midfielder when he impressed.",
      "An England debut followed in the summer, where at the 2024 European Championship, England's performances improved when Mainoo started alongside Rice as a No 8 as the competition drew on.",
      "Mainoo started the Euro final for England but just two camps later, found himself hurled into the shadows as Rice's partner gained new suitors. Now 20, Mainoo is now on the periphery of United's first team plans, yet to start a Premier League game this season. It's the apparent stunting of a talent that hits Scholes personally.",
      "\"Kobbie Mainoo came on the other night [against Everton], he needs games of football, it looks like he was a little bit off the pace of the night because he's not played. You could expect that.",
      "\"One of the most disappointing things for me is Kobbie Mainoo not being involved in this Manchester United team,\" Scholes admits.",
      "\"We saw how good he was 18 months, two years ago, and for some reason it's not quite happened for him. The manager doesn't seem to quite fancy him, but we all know the qualities he has.",
      "\"But the manager's just for some reason preferring somebody else, and that's something he has to deal with.",
      "\"I think he's dealt with it quite well at this minute, but at some point, he will get frustrated.",
      "\"As I'm frustrated with watching Manchester United at times as well, and especially with Kobbie Mainoo, because home-grown talent, we don't have many of them anymore, and we want him in our team.",
      "\"He [Amorim] possibly doesn't trust him physically at the minute. Casemiro isn't the most physical, but he's streetwise. He knows the position, he's done it for so many years in a great Real Madrid team, so he's got that experience.",
      "\"Kobbie hasn't quite got that experience yet. I think Kobbie, if he's going to play, he needs to play in a midfield three, really. Manchester United don't do that.\"",
      "\"They've got a midfield two with two 10s. So, for him to get one of those positions is something he's got to work his way into doing now. Maybe you need two Bruno Fernandes.",
      "\"You need a Bruno Fernandes to be the playmaker, and one to be a No 10 as well. I think Kobbie Mainoo is more than capable of being that playmaker, next to a Casemiro or a [Manuel] Ugarte.",
      "\"I think he's clever enough in possession, but for some reason the manager doesn't seem to think he's the answer at the minute.\"",
      "Unfortunately, United don't have two Fernandeses. Much to the delight of Premier League officials. So United's problems remain. How have United both unsuccessfully and to some avail solved their conundrums in the past? A flashy new toy, a transfer for fans to enjoy for as long as they feel they are performing.",
      "So if given the choice, who would one of United's most esteemed performers choose as the club's midfield saviour?",
      "\"I think all three of them are really good players. Baleba is very young, but they're all quite young, aren't they?",
      "\"But Baleba is very young. Quality-wise, is he quite there? I think he's almost in a Caicedo type of way.",
      "\"He's done really well at Chelsea, don't get me wrong, but is that the type of player Manchester United need? I'm not sure.",
      "\"Adam Wharton is, again, a really good player. Can he get around the pitch? Old Trafford's a big pitch. It's a really big pitch to get around, and you need to have some physicality. You need to have legs in that position.",
      "\"I'd say, going off the England form, this has surprised me more than anything is Elliot Anderson. I really liked him when he was at Newcastle, but I thought he was more of an attacking player, maybe play the 8 or 10. I don't like saying numbers, but he looks more of an 8 or 10.",
      "\"He's come into that role for England and looks very accomplished, very stylish. Keeps the ball really well, will pass it forward as well. I'd like to see all three of them.",
      "\"I'd probably say I'd go Wharton. I still don't think they're any of the Manchester United style midfield players, they're more the style of football these days.",
      "\"I just think Wharton's got a little bit more quality. That's tough saying that. I think he's got more quality than Baleba.",
      "\"Baleba's got more legs, so that evens itself out a little bit. It's close between Elliot Anderson and Wharton. I'd just pick Wharton.\"",
      "Hypotheticals were something Scholes rarely dealt in as a player. A fully functioning midfield was part of the furniture for many years at Old Trafford. Unfortunately for him, his ideal United midfield man remains just an if, but and a maybe.",
      "One thing is for certain, though, United will continue the season, waiting for the midfielder that \"can do everything\".",

      "Neville says United, who could have gone fourth if they won by three but remain in 10th, \"were nowhere near good enough\" and \"an embarrassment at times\" as their five-game unbeaten run came to an end.",

      "\"You can lose football matches, but you can't lose them like that. That's nowhere near good enough, it's not acceptable.\"",

      "Man Utd head coach Ruben Amorim has claimed his side are \"nowhere near\" where they need to be and hopes they \"fight each other\" after losing to 10-man Everton.",
      "With Everton down to 10 men for over 75 minutes after Idrissa Gueye's red card for striking his own team-mate Michael Keane, Amorim's side failed to break down a team who have only mustered one away win all season - against bottom side Wolves.",
      "It was the first time United have ever lost a home Premier League game after seeing the opposition pick up a red card, with United winning 36 of the 46 games in which it has happened before. It was also David Moyes' first ever win at Old Trafford as an opposition manager at the 18th attempt.",
      "But overall, it represents a new low for Amorim, who celebrated one year in charge of United in dismal fashion.",

      "\"We have a lot to do. We have to be perfect to win games, we were not perfect today.",

      "\"These five weeks, everyone is praising our evolution. But I'm always saying the same things: we are nowhere near the moment we are meant to be in this club.\"",
      "Gueye's bizarre red card left Amorim wishing he had seen the same sort of fight from his own players.",
      "\"Fighting is not a bad thing,\" he added. \"Fighting doesn't mean you don't like each other. Fighting means you lose the ball and I will fight you because we will suffer a goal. That was my feeling.",
      "\"I don't agree with that red card. We can fight with team-mates. I know it's violent conduct because the referee explained but I don't agree.",
      "\"I hope my players, when they lose the ball, they fight each other - though they cannot get sent off! But that is a good feeling, not a bad feeling.\"",

      "Amorim was criticised throughout the match for not moving away from his much-maligned 3-4-2-1 formation and continuing with five defenders on the pitch, despite having the player advantage.",

      "In extraordinary scenes at Old Trafford, Gueye got into an argument with centre-back Keane early in the first half and replays showed the midfielder raise his hands to the Everton defender's face. Gueye apologised to his team-mates at full-time.",
      "That moment should have allowed United to completely control of the game - if anything it did the opposite. Amorim's side looked like the team with 10 men - and Everton deservedly took the lead through Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's stunner from distance.",
      "The midfielder's solo run got him to the edge of the box before he fired past Senne Lammens' outstretched gloves and into the net - with more questions falling to a United goalkeeper this season.",
      "United failed to take full advantage of their extra man in the first half, with their players booed off after their best chance was a Bruno Fernandes 30-yard strike which Jordan Pickford simply saved.",
      "United - missing Benjamin Sesko and Matheus Cunha through injury - started the second half in a similar vein. Half-time substitute Mason Mount put two chances wide, while Bryan Mbeumo saw an effort saved by Pickford.",
      "\"You have five at the back, why?\" said Neville. \"They still don't win the first ball or second ball. Embarrassing.",
