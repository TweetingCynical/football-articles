      "Lecce star Nikola Krstovic spoke earlier this season about his dream of a move to Manchester United. Instead, though, it's another Premier League team who want the Montenegro international.",
      "Krstovic top-scored for Lecce last season as they narrowly clung on to their Serie A status. The Giallorossi were able to survive despite a high-profile exit midway through the season, with Patrick Dorgu joining United in a big-money move.",
      "It looks as though the striker won't be joining his old team-mate at Old Trafford, though. Instead, it's Leeds United readying a move for the £30m-rated star.",
      "According to Corriere dello Sport (via Sport Witness), Leeds have an agreement in principle to sign Krstovic - potentially for substantially less than Lecce's £30m asking price. However, they have yet to agree personal terms.",
      "Sport Witness has also resurfaced comments from the 25-year-old from back in September. Back then, he discussed his next steps while making reference to compatriot Mirko Vucinic, who had spells at Roma and Juventus after leaving Lecce.",
      "“After the match against Torino he (Mirko Vucinic) told me ‘think about the next one’. Where would I never play? In Bari. My dream is Manchester United,” Krstovic is quoted as saying.",
      "“It’s only the second year here in Lecce. I am very happy, both me and my family. We have friends and we’re enjoying it, so let’s think about the present.”",
      "If Leeds are able to land Krstovic, he would be the second new arrival from Serie A after Jaka Bijol. Slovenia defender Bijol has joined on a long-term deal from Udinese as Daniel Farke's side prepare for a Premier League return, with the Whites also adding Lukas Nmecha to their ranks this summer.",
      "“I work for it and that's why I'm here, because it's a big challenge for everyone,\" Bijol told club media. \"It's a big challenge for me, for the club, and we're getting ready for it together. I think the club and myself are ready for the Premier League.",
      "“I can promise that I will give everything, that I will give everything in every training as well to be ready for the first game of the season and then just go from there.”",
      "The reigning Championship winners have also offloaded Rasmus Kristiansen and Joshua Guilavogui this summer. Guilavogui is a free agent after his short-term deal ended, while Kristiansen has made a permanent move to Eintracht Frankfurt after a successful loan.",

      "Manchester United will hold talks with Juventus on Wednesday after the Italian giants joined Fenerbahce in showing an interest in Jadon Sancho. United are desperate to find a buyer for Sancho and could be able to drive up their asking price by playing the two clubs off against each other.",
      "Sancho had initially appeared set to join Chelsea at the end of the season after spending the campaign on loan with the Blues. However, Chelsea turned down the opportunity to sign him permanently, deciding they would rather stump up a £5million fee than pay £25m for his services.",
      "That was an obvious blow, given Sancho is not in Ruben Amorim’s plans and his £300,000-a-week wages are a drain on their finances. But that disappointment hasn’t lasted long, with Fenerbahce and Juventus emerging as serious contenders for the 25-year-old winger.",
      "Turkish media reported on Tuesday that Sancho had agreed personal terms with Fenerbahce over a summer transfer. While Napoli were reportedly put off by his wage demands, Jose Mourinho’s side are willing to hand him a deal worth €10m (£8.5m) per year.",
      "United are reportedly willing to sell the winger could cost them £73m in 2021 for just €20m (£17m) because he only has a year left on his contract. And now it seems that Juventus are ready to challenge the Turkish club for Sancho.",
      "Italian media report that Juve officials will hold a video call with their United counterparts on Wednesday in an attempt to reach a deal. The Old Lady are in the market for a winger and general manager Damien Comolli is ready to offer players in part exchange.",
      "Juventus are reportedly willing to offer striker Dusan Vlahovic or midfielder Douglas Luiz to United. Vlahovic is paid £215,000-a-week and Juve want to reduce their wage bill by offloading the Serbia international.",
      "United will be more than happy to barter for Sancho, who has been a major flop since the club shelled out to sign him from Borussia Dortmund four years ago. The winger has just 12 goals and six assists in 83 games for United, but still has a good reputation elsewhere.",
      "He registered five goals and 10 assists in 42 appearances across all competitions for Chelsea last season, helping them win the Conference League. And it was only his reported wage demands that scuppered a permanent move to west London.",
      "United need to get Sancho off their books, along with the likes of Marcus Rashford, Antony and Alejandro Garnacho, in order to help finance a rebuild under Amorim. They have already splashed out £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and have offered over £60m to sign Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford.",

      "The Premier League's Key Match Incidents panel has identified 18 VAR mistakes across the 2024-25 season, an improvement on the previous campaign. The figure is a significant drop on the previous campaign, though there will still be some who expected perfection from the introduction of the new technology.",
      "All 20 clubs in the league voted on keeping VAR ahead of the season, with Wolves the only club to call for it to be scrapped entirely. Despite the league persisting with Video Assistant Referees, there were widespread calls for changes to improve the process.",
      "Premier League clubs made the case for more regular and better training for referees in an effort to improve the current state of play. They also asked for set teams of VAR officials to encourage better understanding between officials, as well as pushing for a drastic cut in delays and better messaging for fans in stadiums, with the latter an oft-repeated concern for match-going fans.",
      "So, about those 18 errors over the course of the 2024-25 season. The Key Match Officials panel comprises former players and/or coaches as well as one representative for the Premier League and one for PGMOL.",
      "The first VAR error took place on the opening weekend of the season. Bournemouth forward Ouattara thought he had scored a late winner, only for the effort to be chalked off for handball.",
      "The KMI panel voted unanimously that VAR got the decision wrong. That extra point for Newcastle was certainly helpful, with Eddie Howe's side ultimately qualifying for the Champions League on goal difference alone, though it's too simplistic to argue a decision on the opening weekend made all the difference.",
      "Another unanimous vote here. Fernandes was shown a straight red card during Manchester United's loss at home to Tottenham in September, with all five panelists believing that to be a mistake.",
      "United trailed 1-0 at the time and went on to lose 3-0. Fernandes' suspension was ultimately overturned on appeal, allowing the Portuguese to return to action.",
      "The KMI panel votes on the referee and the VAR in these instances. As with the Ouattara incident, the panel backed the on-field referee unanimously but went the other way when it came to the VAR intervention.",
      "No penalty was initially awarded after United defender De Ligt challenged Hammers striker Danny Ings late in the second half. A long VAR check saw referee Michael Oliver point to the spot, and Jarrod Bowen converted from 12 yards to win the game for West Ham.",
      "Brentford captain Norgaard was shown a straight red card during the first half of his team's draw at Everton. The Dane stretched for a ball at the back post and ended up connecting with home goalkeeper Jordan Pickford - enough for the VAR to intervene.",
      "This is the first split decision on the list, with the panel explaining (via ESPN): \"The panel were split (3:2), with the majority deeming the on-field decision correct as 'both players are committed to normal footballing actions.' Two panelists deemed the on-field decision incorrect as 'whilst this was a challenge for the ball, there was a high, full and forceful contact with the studs.'\"",
      "Some of the mistakes relate to non-intervention when VAR might have been better placed getting involved. One such instance relates to Maatsen's foul on Ismaila Sarr, with the panel arguing - by split decision - that he should have seen red.",
      "The argument comes down to whether Maatsen denied Sarr a clear goalscoring opportunity. While the on-field referee and VAR official believed there was a covering defender, the panel wasn't so sure.",
      "Not all of the decisions on this list had a huge bearing on the match outcome. Everton were already three goals to the good against Wolves when they benefited from what the panel considers to have been an incorrect call.",
      "Doucoure was ruled not to be interfering while stood in an offside position in the lead-up to a Craig Dawson own goal. Curiously, Everton had earlier seen a goal chalked off for a similar offence but were not punished for a second time.",
      "There was significant late drama when Forest beat Villa in December, with the home side scoring twice in the final five minutes to turn defeat into victory. However, the VAR controversy in the game came early on with the scores still level.",
      "Villa appealed for a penalty as Forest midfielder Anderson pulled back Morgan Rogers, but no spot-kick was forthcoming. The KMI panel argued by a margin of three to two that there was enough holding inside the box to warrant a penalty.",
      "When West Ham and Brighton played out a draw in December, all the drama took place after the break. Mats Wieffer and Mohammed Kudus exchanged goals, while Brighton defender Estupinan risked a late red card for serious foul play.",
      "Neither the on-field ref or the VAR felt the Ecuadorian deserved to be dismissed for his foul on Max Kilman, but the KMI panel didn't see things that way. \"The action of Estupinian has speed, force, intensity and endangers the safety of the opponent,\" they said.",
      "Just one week later, another Brighton player escaped a red card. Joao Pedro flung an elbow at Brentford's Yehor Yarmoliuk but stayed on the field.",
      "The Brazilian made no contact with his opponent, but this doesn't mean he should have escaped dismissal. Indeed, the KMI panel argued unanimously that the officials got it wrong.",
      "After finding themselves on the right end of a VAR penalty mistake in October, West Ham were on the wrong end in December. They might feel it could have made a big difference, too, with a 1-0 deficit growing into a 5-0 defeat after the decision.",
      "Mac Allister threw Carlos Soler to the ground off the ball, with the KMI panel split on the call as some argued it had no impact on play. The defeat ended up being Julen Lopetegui's last game at the London Stadium, with the manager dismissed after a loss at Manchester City a few days later.",
      "After finding themselves the beneficiaries of VAR errors in December, Brighton were on the other end in January. The Seagulls appealed for an early penalty at Ipswich after Burns impeded Jan Paul van Hecke, but didn't get the decision.",
      "Ultimately it didn't matter too much, with Fabian Hurzeler's side going on to win 2-0. Had they failed to find the breakthrough, though, they may well have dwelt on that missed call.",
      "Nottingham Forest's win against Southampton in January was far more tense than it needed to be. Part of that was the hosts seeing a 3-0 lead reduced to 3-2, and part comes down to the disallowed goal which might have stopped that happening.",
      "Milenkovic thought he'd made it 4-1 moments after the Saints' first, only for the goal to be chalked off for offside against team-mate Chris Wood. According to the panel, though, Wood made no impact on an opponent and the goal should have been allowed to stand.",
      "Arsenal youngster Lewis-Skelly received a first-half red card at Molineux after stopping a counter-attack. There were no arguments about him being penalised for his foul on Matt Doherty, but the visitors were shocked by the colour of the card shown to him.",
      "Arsenal still won the game, with Wolves also ending the game with 10 men, and Lewis-Skelly's suspension was later overturned. \"Yeah obviously really happy that the decision has been made and Myles is going to be available for us,\" Gunners boss Mikel Arteta said.",
      "After that January error, we had to wait until April for another VAR decision which the KMI panel felt to be the wrong one. However, it was one of two on the same day.",
      "Brighton youngster Hinshelwood avoided punishment for a foul on Jacob Ramsey, with the panel unanimously arguing Villa should have won a penalty. It didn't impact the final score, with Unai Emery's side going on to win 3-0.",
      "A second VAR mistake on April 2 and a second with a unanimous response from the KMI panel. Everton defender Tarkowski was only shown a yellow card for a foul on Alexis Mac Allister which many at the time felt should have earned him a red.",
      "\"The clear dangerous nature of the challenge is not mitigated by Tarkowski winning the ball first,\" the panel said. \"A clear example of endangering the safety of an opponent.\"",
      "Liverpool suffered just their second league defeat of the season in April when Fulham got the better of them at Craven Cottage. The London side even managed to shake off a controversial decision in which they were denied a penalty.",
      "Reds keeper Kelleher took out Fulham's Andreas Pereira after the Brazilian played the ball across. The Irish international wasn't punished, but it ultimately didn't stop the hosts running out 3-2 winners.",
      "Another moment of Bournemouth controversy after that opening day drama. Once again, Andoni Iraola's side may feel the VAR mistake impacted the result, as they led 1-0 at the time but ended up only drawing.",
      "Evanilson was sent off after a challenge on United's Noussair Mazraoui. He appeared to slip into the challenge, though, and this was cited in the panel's explanation, with the Brazilian's ban ultimately overturned.",
      "We end with relegated Ipswich, who were already down when they got a meaningless let-off against Brentford. Defender Tuanzebe dragged Bees counterpart Nathan Collins to the ground, but no penalty was awarded.",
      "The panel argued the holding between the players was not mutual, with Tuanzebe holding his opponent with both arms. The decision has no bearing on the result, with Brentford 1-0 up at the time and winning by the same scoreline.",
      "Brentford suffered the most from those incorrect decisions, finding themselves on the wrong end on three occasions and not benefiting from a mistake even once. At the other end of the scale are Everton, who gained on three occasions and lost out on none.",
      "ESPN also looked at the biggest beneficiaries of VAR decisions - not just those errors listed above - over the course of the season. Newcastle are out in front in that field, with 13 decisions in favour and just four against, with Bournemouth at the other end after four decisions in their favour and 11 against.",
      "Three teams - Chelsea, Leicester and Manchester City - were involved in no VAR errors all season long. In fact, City only had four VAR interventions in their games in total - three in their favour and one against.",
      "Sky will show at least 215 live Premier League games next season, an increase of up to 100 more."

      "Chelsea decided they would rather pay United a £5million fee than go through with signing Sancho for £25m in what was a major blow for Ruben Amorim’s side. Sancho doesn’t have a future in Amorim’s squad and his £300,000-a-week wages are a significant drain on the club’s finances.",

The Juventus striker has been linked with the Red Devils this week as part of a swap deal which would see him join United and Jadon Sancho head to Turin.",
      "According to Gazzetta dello Sport, the Serbian is deemed surplus to requirements at Juventus, who will try to offload him while securing United wantaway Sancho. Amorim is currently in the market for a new striker and, with Vlahovic inside the final 12 months of his contract, swapping Sancho for the 25-year-old could be a financially savvy move.",
      "United have been guilty of splashing out huge sums of money in recent years on various players who have crumbled under the bright Old Trafford lights, becoming a shadow of the players they once were.",
      "But Vlahovic presents a low-risk transfer opportunity both economically and due to the fact that he prides himself on his mental strength. When asked by The Telegraph if he feels any pressure back in 2022, the Serbia international was almost insulted by the suggestion.",
      "He said: “I like pressure. I like high expectations because I like the kind of adrenalin that comes out. I have never really suffered too much from pressure. Maybe when I was younger but not now and in 10 years time I will probably feel even better about it. I don’t really care too much when people talk about pressure.”",
      "The expectations are indeed high at United, where the team is expected to win silverware and qualify for Europe next season despite finishing near the relegation zone this term. Yet, Vlahovic appears to have the appetite to succeed - something Amorim undoubtedly values highly.",
      "He added: “I never want to rest. I am dedicated 24/7 and when I go home, what do I do? I watch football matches! I watch to have fun, to enjoy, but also to learn and improve. You notice things and figure them out and think, ‘I could have done this or that.’",
      "“I like spending time with my family, who have always been my force, and friends. I don’t like video games. I am not very good at them. I prefer going for a walk!",
      "“In the past I had the time to read books, but not now. Basically I am completely dedicated to football and, for me, it’s only the beginning, by the way. The best is yet to come.”",
      "It remains to be seen, however, if Vlahovic would entertain a move to the struggling Premier League side. He is said to have been 'unreceptive' to previous offers to leave Juventus and already snubbed proposals from Saudi Arabia and Turkey.",
      "Vlahovic is also no stranger to Premier League links. He was pursued by Arsenal before signing for Juve in a £60million deal back in 2021 and has also been the subject of interest from Chelsea in the past.",
      "Juventus are expected to push to sign Sancho, who is no longer wanted at Old Trafford, even if Vlahovic is not part of the deal. Gazzetta dello Sport claims they are willing to offer other players to United in a bid to get a deal for the winger over the line, including midfielder Douglas Luiz.",
      "Sancho is expected to leave the Red Devils on a permanent deal after Chelsea paid £5m to waive their obligation to buy clause at the end of his unsuccessful season-long loan move at Stamford Bridge. Napoli have also been credited with an interest in Sancho's services, but Juve are pushing to beat the Italian champions to a deal.",

      "Paul Pogba insists he \"hasn't signed anything\" amid reports the ex-Manchester United star is about to join Monaco. The Frenchman has been out of the game for nearly two years due to a doping ban and is looking for a new club.",
      "Most recently he had been on the books at Juventus but the Italian side have shown no interest in bringing him back for a third time. Pogba is now into his 30s but has proved to be hugely talented throughout his career, even if consistency has evaded him.",
      "Monaco, who are in the Champions League, are ready to take a put on the World Cup winner with Le Parisien reporting last week that Pogba was set to join the Ligue 1 side on a free transfer after agreeing a two-year deal. They claimed he had \"made significant financial sacrifices\" to secure the deal.",
      "It would be a huge boost for Monaco with Pogba potentially returning to his homeland for the first time since leaving Le Harve in 2009. However the player has come out and poured water on the idea of heading to the Riviera.",
      "He said on Sergio Aguero's podcast, La Casa del Kun: \"I haven't signed anything, but there's interest. We'll see.\"",
      "Pogba has also flirted with the idea of heading to South America to play with Argentine giants Boca Juniors, citing their fans as a huge draw. He said: \"In life, you never know. I loved the people who went to see Boca's match (at the Club World Cup), it's crazy because I went to Marseille, which is hot, Naples is hot, but Boca... I've never seen that in my life.\"",
      "The Frenchman's career is yet to hit the heights that were once expected of him. He first hit the heights when he left Manchester and excelled at Juventus, which prompted those at Old Trafford to spend a club-record fee to bring him back when Jose Mourinho was in charge.",
      "However his six years in Manchester were hugely inconsistent and, after claiming two trophies in his first year, he failed to pick up anymore silverware. He return to Juventus when his contract expired but the Old Lady were not the force of old and his stint was somewhat underwhelming.",

      "Christopher Nkunku is linked with Manchester United in a deal that could be two years in the making. The 27-year-old initially found himself on United's radar back in 2022, when then boss Ralf Rangnick eyed a move for the at the time RB Leipzig striker.",
      "Rangnick was the man responsible for taking Nkunku to the Bundesliga from Paris Saint-Germain three years earlier, signing him on a five-year contract for a reported £11million in a move which proved incredibly fruitful. While Rangnick left his post with Die Roten Bullen in July 2019, Nkunku remained at the Red Bull Arena until 2023, scoring 70 goals and providing 55 assists in 172 appearances.",
      "Rangnick ultimately went on to find his footing as the interim manager of Manchester United in 2021, following the dismissal of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. And the very next year, the 66-year-old showed an interest in reuniting with Nkunku, while the French talent reportedly reciprocated the sentiment.",
      "The issue at the time was that Manchester United had no scouting reports on Nkunku at the time, and as a result, he wasn't on the club's shortlist. Given Rangnick's relationship with the star, he was reportedly at a loss for words upon hearing of the situation, and was insistent that scouts watched him closely during Leipzig's clash with VfL Bochum in February 2022.",
      "Given United's resources at the time, it was thought that the club would have been able to meet Leipzig's £62m valuation of the star - as well as treble his £30,000 per-week wage with a move to Old Trafford. However, a deal ultimately failed to ever come to fruition, with Rangnick replaced by Erik ten Hag in May 2022.",
      "The Dutchman elected to spend £82m on Antony, £70m on Casemiro and £57m on Lisandro Martinez during the summer transfer window instead of strengthening his strikeforce, while Nkunku remained in Germany for another year. In 2023, Nkunku finally got his long-awaited move to the Premier League, albeit, making his way to Stamford Bridge rather than Old Trafford, where he has remained ever since.",
      "Chelsea forked out a reported £52m to acquire Nkunku on a six-year deal, but the forward - who can also operate as an attacking midfielder - has failed to live up to his price tag thus far. In 2025, Nkunku has managed just 17 goals in 57 games for the Blues due to injury and inconsistency",
      "And as a result, Enzo Maresca hasn't ruled out him leaving his post this summer if the price is right. Now, it is said that Chelsea and Manchester United are now looking at the possibility of a swap deal between Nkunku and Alejandro Garnacho, who is seemingly unsettled in the north west.",
      "Garnacho looks all but destined to leave United this summer after a fallout with Ruben Amorim, who has recently signed Matheus Cunha from Wolves, and is looking to secure the services of Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo. The Argentine found himself benched for the Red Devils' Europa League final loss to Tottenham last month, and was vocal about Amorim's decision in the aftermath while claiming his side had a \"s***\" season.",
      "Garnacho also butted heads with Amorim earlier in the season, after he was accused of ignoring his boss while receiving instructions during a Europa League game with Viktoria Plzen. The 20-year-old has reportedly been told that he has \"no future\" with United, and looks increasingly likely to make his way to the capital given that he was linked with the Blues in January.",
      "Nkunku, meanwhile, may struggle to earn minutes at his current club in 2025/26 given that Chelsea have just spent £30m on new striker Liam Delap, and are eager to acquire Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund in the coming weeks. It is claimed that Amorim is willing to give Nkunku a chance at leading the line at Old Trafford, given that Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee have failed to make a notable difference since arriving in 2023 and 2024 respectively.",
      "And while a swap deal for the two stars may well come to fruition, the Telegraph reports that separate transfers are more likely - though neither club has held talks on either transfer just yet.",

      "Garnacho, 20, fell out with Amorim towards the end of this season when he was dropped for key clashes against Tottenham and Aston Villa. And the Argentina international appears to have hinted he's ready to leave after posting an image of himself wearing a Villa jersey with Rashford's name and number on the back, having spent part of this term on loan in Birmingham.",
      "Nkunku, 27, had lofty ambitions after he joined Chelsea from RB Leipzig in 2023 for an eye-bulging £52million. However, the France international wouldn't be expected to fetch the same fee today despite scoring 14 times in 22 starts this season.",
      "His career in England may have panned out differently had the boardroom brains at Anfield got their way. The Reds recruitment team identified Nkunku as a likeable target during his time in Germany.",
      "However, The Times reported Klopp stepped in to insist his side signed Darwin Nunez from Benfica instead. The manager got his wish, though many might wonder if Nkunku would have been the superior signing given Nunez's struggles in front of goal.",
      "And Amorim, 40, could conduct a similar hijack as United step up their interest in Brentford winger Bryan Mbeumo. That's after seeing an initial offer of £45m plus £10m in add-ons rebuffed by the Bees.",
      "The Red Devils have now returned with a second bid totalling £60m for the Cameroon international. Amorim has already added Brazil international Matheus Cunha to his squad this summer but appears adamant to continue strengthening his options in attack.",
      "Despite missing out on European qualification for the coming campaign, United's spending power doesn't appear to have been dented as badly as some predicted. Or at least the club isn't shying away from lavish expenses, confident in their ability to balance the books via other means.",
      "Amorim hasn't wasted much time in attempting to put his own imprint on the team during his first summer window at the Old Trafford helm. And adding Mbeumo to his selection would represent another statement signing given the player could well hold out for a team playing among Europe's elite next season.",
      "Any pursuit of Nkunku could be seen as more appealing given the implication that it would help offload Garnacho. However, that would still require a significant piece of negotiation as the two deals would have to be treated individually, rather than a straight swap.",
      "In any case, United's follow-up bid for Mbeumo appears to suggest he has caught Amorim's eye as the more desirable target. And if that is the case, it would illustrate the Portuguese's powers of persuasion, not unlike former Liverpool boss Klopp."

      "Arne Slot's ruthlessness in the summer transfer window with Liverpool should come as no surprise, especially to Manchester United and Leeds United. The Dutchman has shot out of the gate when it comes to signings after leading the club to the Premier League title in his first season in charge.",
      "The Reds have already acquired Armin Pecsi from Puskas Akademia and Bayer Leverkusen duo Jeremie Frimpong and Florian Wirtz, with the latter being signed for £100million plus add-ons of £16m. With Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez also nearing a move to Anfield, it's been a busy window at Liverpool thus far for arrivals as Slot looks to match that business in regards to departures.",
      "As Jarell Quansah closes in on a £35m to Leverkusen, the Reds could part ways with the likes of Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz, Harvey Elliott and Andy Robertson as Slot continues building the team in his image.",
      "An overhaul of that many first team starters could be classed as being overwhelming for a head coach but Slot certainly has experience in the area, having carried out a similar strategy after his first season at Feyenoord.",
      "After finishing third in his debut campaign with the Eredivisie giants, Slot sold several of his starters including Tyrell Malacia to Man United and Luis Sinisterra to Leeds. He also sold defender Marco Senesi to Bournemouth while league top scorer Guus Till ended his loan spell before signing for rivals PSV.",
      "Despite the departure of several of his big hitters, Slot's recruitment and coaching saw Feyenoord go on to win their first league title in five years. The 46-year-old has made no qualms about only requiring the best players possible to play for Liverpool thanks to the standard set by Mohamed Salah.",
      "Speaking earlier this year, he said: \"If you want to play for Liverpool, you need to be at Mo Salah level. If you’re not at his level, you are almost useless to play at this club, we only need players at the top of their game. Why? Because this is one of, if not the best club in the world to play for!\"",
      "Despite the significant business already completed by Liverpool, the club continue their search to strengthen further with Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi and Eintracht Frankfurt star Hugo Ekitike reportedly liked by Anfield chiefs.",
      "The Reds' deal for Wirtz has the potential to be the biggest the Premier League has ever seen with the fee and add-ons coming out to £1m more than the £115m Chelsea paid for Moises Caicedo.",
      "Speaking after the move was completed, the German superstar told the club's official website: \"I feel very happy and very proud. Finally it’s done and I was waiting for a long time – finally it’s done and I am really happy.",
      "\"I'm really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League.",
      "\"Last season they won the Premier League so my goal is for sure to win it again and also to go further in the Champions League. I'm really ambitious. I'm not coming [to] have fun here, I want also to achieve something and give the fans what they deserve.\"",
      "Manchester United have launched their new home kit for the 2025/26 season with an Adidas shirt paying tribute to Old Trafford.",

      "And the 20-year-old raised some eyebrows after sharing a series of snaps from his holiday to Ibiza on social media, including one of him wearing a Villa shirt with Marcus Rashford's name and number on the back.",
      "Rashford is also expected to leave United, having spent the second half of last season on loan at Villa after he was frozen out at Old Trafford by Amorim. Although it has been claimed Garnacho's post was only meant to show support for Rashford, there has been plenty of backlash.",
      "And ex-Watford captain Deeney believes Garnacho needs a \"clip around the ear\" and branded the winger a \"little dope\". When asked about the post on talkSPORT, Deeney said: \"They obviously think they've got a move lined up.",
      "\"It's a new generation so I've got to be careful not to sound like the old, grumpy man. But he needs a clip around the ear. Give him a clip around the ear. He's bored and has got no respect.",
      "\"If it was me at United, if I was Fernandes, I'd wait until he came back and smash him in training. I genuinely would. I'm not even trying to make headlines, I'd smash him and say to him, 'this is Man United, who do you think you are you little dope?'\"",
      "The likes of Napoli and Chelsea have been linked with a move for Garnacho and reports have claimed that the player would like to stay in the Premier League and favours a move to London.",
      "Chelsea are in the market for a new winger after Mykhailo Mudryk was charged by the Football Association over a failed drugs test, with the Ukraine international now facing a four-year ban from football.",
      "\"We had already one entire season already without Mischa. We are going to decide to go for a winger,\" Blues boss Enzo Maresca said. \"In both cases, we have Noni Madueke and Pedro Neto as proper wingers, then we try to adapt with Tyrique George. It's a position we need to improve.",
      "\"I spoke with Mischa in Poland when we played the Conference League final. I haven't spoken with him since then. I didn't see the news but it was communicated to me. There's nothing more I can add because I don’t have more information.\"",

The forward, who has spent the entirety of his career on the books of his boyhood side, isn't expected to work his way back into Amorim's plans for next season, with the Portuguese tactician looking elsewhere to revitalise the squad he inherited from Erik ten Hag.",

      "A pat on the back and shout-out from Jose Mourinho, a \"dig\" from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and a brief ban under Erik ten Hag are some of yours truly's experiences covering Manchester United. 'Pat, Dig and Ban' is not a catchy book title.",
      "My ten years covering United in a dedicated capacity pale in comparison to Neil Custis of The Sun (26 not out) and The Mirror's David McDonnell (24 not out). They had the enviable privilege of regular audiences with Sir Alex Ferguson when the only devices that were visible in the room swere dictaphones. The pair of them should collaborate on a book like Woodward and Bernstein.",
      "Six years ago, I asked Neil what his most fascinating season covering United was, expecting him to say 2005-06. Roy Keane was sacked, United finished bottom of their Champions League group, Middlesbrough battered them 4-1, Ruud van Nistelrooy was exiled and rancour simmered from the Glazer family's takeover with many fans urging Ferguson to walk.",
      "Neil said it was probably the most recent season, 2018-19. Mourinho was dismissed, Solskjaer oversaw the longest and sweetest of honeymoon periods as caretaker before discovering the perils of a permanent manager at United. They won two of their final 12 matches.",
      "Reading Daniel Taylor's essential book on Ferguson, This Is the One, as a 20-year-old, it was apparent United are a more fascinating club when things are going awry. That epic is divided into two seasons: 2005-06 (annus horribilis) and 2006-07 (annus mirabilis). The contrasting was so great United unexpectedly ended their four-year title drought in the latter, arguably the finest of Ferguson's 13 championships.",
      "I was intent on becoming a football journalist from the age of eight, reading The Mirror at my grandparents'. Reading Taylor's book, there was no fleeting consderation for an alternative career.",
      "United have since become even more interesting. They are the rubbernecker's club, a car crash that elicits morbid curiosity.",
      "Real Madrid will forever be football's biggest club, the Mecca for any great player. United are sport's most scrutinised institution, though. Having covered United-Madrid pre-season friendly matches in San Jose and Miami, there were more dedicated correspondents from England than Spain.",
      "Only four of us attended the post-season tour in Malaysia and Hong Kong. The trip was confirmed relatively late in March, coincided with half term and there had been plenty of arduous travelling during United's Europa League odyssey.",
      "We got more than we bargained for in Asia and that week serves as a reminder that one can never underestimate the insatiable appetite for United coverage. Wherever United go, you have to follow.",
      "Louis van Gaal was in the manager's office when this correspondent moved to Manchester. Much more senior colleagues had much more time in Van Gaal's company and it was my good fortune that trips to Carrington became more frequent after Mourinho was appointed. A contact had told me Mourinho had dossiers compiled of the established writers on the Manchester patch.",
      "It was my misfortune that just as a rapport was developing with Mourinho he was suddenly sacked. The aforementioned shout-out was regarding team news leaks that I and another colleague often obtained. Mourinho had made reference to it on the eve of the 2018 FA Cup final six months earlier when he asked if I already knew the team.",
      "Mourinho later told me he had no issue whatsoever with a journalist sourcing team news and that his gripe was with someone privy to the information leaking it. In December, a friend messaged to say my derby team leak caused uproar on a particular message board, as if they think a journalist should conceal that information. We're not on the club's payroll.",
      "Given how familiar he was with the English press, Mourinho appreciated the value of press conferences. His fraught final pre-season tour in 2018 was so chaotic that club and manager were contradicting their own briefings.",
      "When Mourinho got wind that a staff member had communicated news about Anthony Martial's future, he cryptically suggested a reporter ask them for an update on Martial during a press conference in Miami. Cue nervous laughter from the present colleague.",
      "Solskjaer was not a natural in front of cameras and lights. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the lighting at Carrington was intensely blinding and could turn David Dickinson pale.",
      "On Solskjaer's first tour in Perth, we spoke with him sans cameras and lights at the team hotel. He remarked afterwards how much he enjoyed the half-hour chat and that he preferred that format. Neither we nor United's communications department ever seized on that.",
      "The \"dig\" from Solskjaer was a misunderstanding over a question asked over Zoom. He misinterpreted a query five days after the 5-0 annihilation by Liverpool and still had a bee in his bonnet about it on the post-match call at Tottenham the next day. Even after United won 3-0.",
      "Three days later, Solskjaer was his old self, answering my question cheerfully (Cristiano Ronaldo's added-time equaliser at Atalanta will have helped). It was the only flicker of insecurity he ever displayed.",
      "Michael Carrick was short-and-not-so-sweet. The Zoom era did not help and he was not as engaging as he was during our interview in September 2018. That was the day after Mourinho was filmed telling Paul Pogba to \"get out\" at the start of a training session.",
      "Carrington reopened post-pandemic with two months left to run on Ralf Rangnick's tenure. He made up for the lost time in our presence.",
      "Rangnick offered zingers that rivalled Mourinho. He startled staff so much they remained behind in a vain effort to contextualise his revelation that United blocked a striker signing in the winter transfer window.",
      "The carry-on continued the next day at Brighton. Karen Shotbolt, the press officer, asked me pre-match if I would mind asking Rangnick to essentially clarify his comments. United were battered 4-0. Other questions were more pressing.",
      "Ed Woodward once called us dedicated correspondents the \"conduits\". He had a point, despite his aversion to ever going on the record. At press conferences, we are often asking questions on behalf of supporters about issues that interest them and us.",
      "It is flattering and flustering to occasionally be asked for selfies at football grounds or press conferences. Other colleagues get such requests, particularly abroad.",
      "The people in Kuala Lumpur were as friendly as those I've encountered in Australia, the United States and Thailand. As recently as Sunday, attending Lancashire versus Kent at Blackpool Cricket Club, one of the security chaps recognised me and said how much he enjoys the MEN's United podcast. Walking past The Midland in Manchester a while ago, a chap asked, \"Are you the United guy?\"",
      "The majority of interactions are similarly warm. For all the online abuse football journalists get, from personal experience the only case of an in-person insult was after I collared someone for referring to a family member in a tweet. Their inebriated friend then started venting before leaving the scene.",
      "Ten Hag was direct, concise and blunt in press conferences. Sometimes too cold. Away from it, he loosened up considerably and was always approachable.",
      "Those of us who attended United's winter training camp in Cadiz spent two hours with Ten Hag on and off the record over lunch, a throwback to a bygone era. It was already apparent from our sit-down with Ten Hag in Melbourne that he was better value away from the cameras and he was the most amendable of the United managers yours truly has encountered.",
      "There was a tweak to press conferences at the start of Ten Hag's tenure. Reporters would be addressed by name and have the option of asking a follow-up question. That personable strategy, brought about by the outgoing director of communications Andrew Ward, introduced some decorum and humanised journalists. The small matter of the United manager knowing your name sometimes feels like a big difference.",
      "It was a pity that Ten Hag could not convey his breezy image in press conferences. Charisma can never be underestimated with a United manager and it helped get Ruben Amorim by as United slid down the table like a snake on a ladder.",
      "As for the one-match press conference ban four of us received in December 2023, it was not Ten Hag who solely did the banning. That was not a particularly authoritative look for a United manager when, in Ferguson's era, the innumerable bans doled were done so at the Scot's behest.",
      "Incredibly, United's then-director of communications, the seldom-seen Ellie Norman, attempted to suggest she jointly decided on it. It became a running joke that Ms Norman had coffee with a colleague in the Old Trafford boardroom and then did not recognise them on two future occasions.",
      "Amorim is curious in that he is the opposite of Ten Hag, warm on camera but business-like off it. A couple of colleagues tried to strike up a brief conversation with him in the bowels of Goodison Park and he completely blanked them. United had performed poorly and were fortunate to draw 2-2.",
      "On the record, Amorim is his mentor Mourinho's pupil, offering box-office lines and the odd editorial guidance. \"The worst team maybe in the history of Manchester United,\" he said in January. \"Here you go: your headline.\"",
      "The quirk of United's worst season in 51 years is it was one of the calmest to cover. The managerial change came about so early it was the day after the clocks went back in October, relegation was never a palpable threat and we had become so accustomed to United defeats from the 14 in the league the previous season.",
      "2023-24 was the most fraught. It unravelled quickly, barely a month went by without a crisis and United started picking fights with the press, which did nobody any favours.",
      "The shock factor was greater that season and, in particular, in the Solskjaer and Rangnick season, as well as David Moyes' tenure. Of all the crime scenes we have surveyed from press boxes, Brentford in August 2022 remains the most appalling.",
      "Those last-minute winners are still adrenaline rushes. Anthony Martial in the FA Cup semi-final was topped by Amad against Liverpool at the Stretford End. Improbably, Harry Maguire trumped him against Lyon in April. They inflict the professional pain of a rewrite and we utter more profanities than Malcolm Tucker.",
      "So I swear by a formula that saved a reporter in Camp Nou for the 1999 Champions League final. Their piece had begun by quoting Lothar Matthaus, who had paraphrased Gary Lineker: \"Football is a very easy thing. It’s about 22 men chasing after the ball and, in the end, the Germans always win.\"",
      "“Matthaus was right,\" the draft read after 89 minutes. At full-time, he changed it to \"Matthaus was wrong\".",
      "That merited a pat on the back."

      "After scoring 20 Premier League goals for Brentford last season, Manchester United transfer target Bryan Mbeumo has shown himself to be one of the league's top marksmen.",
      "Following Ivan Toney's switch to Saudi Arabian club Al-Ahli last summer, the onus was on Mbeumo to step up and shoulder the attacking burden at the Gtech Community Stadium last season.",
      "After scoring nine goals in 2023/24, Mbeumo successfully stepped up in the way Brentford wanted him to last term, more than doubling his goal tally from the previous campaign. His return of 20 goals marked his best-ever tally in a single season during his career.",
      "Mbeumo played predominantly on the right flank. According to data collected by Transfermarkt, 16 of his 20 goals were scored when he operated from the right. However, he did flex his muscles when deployed centrally, too, scoring four goals in six games as a centre-forward.",
      "The Cameroonian, 25, is equally comfortable playing out wide or through the middle, meaning he will bring a versatile presence to Old Trafford if United get a deal over the line. The Reds have tabled an improved offer in excess of £60m for the former Troyes man.",
      "United saw an opening offer for the attacker worth £55m turned down last month but their decision to increase their offer highlights their hunger to get a deal over the line. Mbeumo is equally keen to get it done.",
      "United operate in a 3-4-2-1 formation, meaning Mbeumo is expected to be tasked with operating as the right-sided No.10. However, it is possible he could also operate as the right wing-back in Ruben Amorim's preferred formation.",
      "He could also start up front and lead United's attack. The Reds, despite already signing Matheus Cunha and attempting to wrap up a deal for Mbeumo, remain determined to sign an out-and-out No.9 this summer.",
      "It is no secret that player sales are key to United's hopes of fulfilling all of their ambitions in this summer's window, meaning the addition of a striker may be one of the very last objectives they are able to complete. Recruitment is likely to slow once United wrap up a deal for Mbeumo until sales start to go through.",
      "Should United's striker search be delayed, Amorim may be confident enough to ask Mbeumo to lead the line in the absence of a recognised No.9.",
      "United have been criticised in recent years for not following the trend set by Arsenal and Liverpool in signing multi-functional forwards.",
      "In recent years, Arsenal have signed the likes of Gabriel Jesus, Leandro Trossard and Kai Havertz, who are all capable of playing in multiple positions across the frontline, while Liverpool have swooped for the likes of Darwin Nunez, Cody Gakpo, Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota, who are equally comfortable out wide or through the middle.",
      "United's attacking signings in recent years have been one-dimensional. For example, Antony is restricted to playing on the right-wing.",
      "However, Mbeumo is capable of playing from the flank or through the middle, meaning he would bring a versatile profile to the table. A multi-functional forward has been missing from United's attacking arsenal for too long."

      "Having agreed to sign Matheus Cunha on the opening day of this summer's transfer window, Manchester United signalled their intentions.",
      "Just 14 hours after the window had officially opened on June 1, United announced they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign the Brazilian after triggering his £62.5million release clause. The deal was officially completed 11 days later.",
      "United finished the 2024/25 campaign with a goal difference in the Premier League of -10, highlighting the need to strengthen their attacking options this summer. Cunha has arrived at Old Trafford on the back of scoring 17 goals last term.",
      "Having signed Cunha nice and early, United are now in hot pursuit of Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. After seeing an opening offer worth £55m knocked back earlier this month, the Reds have now tabled a new offer in excess of £60m.",
      "Mbeumo scored 20 Premier League goals last term, meaning only Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak of Newcastle United (23) and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland (22) scored more in the division.",
      "Mbeumo has informed confidants he wants to move to Old Trafford this summer, meaning both he and United are keen to get a deal over the line. The Reds would like to have a deal done ahead of pre-season starting on July 7.",
      "With Cunha scoring 17 goals last season and Mbeumo scoring 20, United have certainly prioritised strengthening the right area this summer. Despite ending the 2023/24 campaign with a negative goal difference, four of their five summer signings last year were defensive-minded.",
      "In addition to signing Cunha and hoping to get Mbeumo's signature secured, United also want to sign an out-and-out striker. They had identified Liam Delap as their top target prior to the start of the window, but Chelsea pipped them to his signature, signing him for £30m.",
      "If United can get Mbeumo over the line, they will be two thirds of the way towards fixing their attack. He and Cunha scored 35 Premier League goals between them last term, meaning they scored just nine fewer than United did as a team.",
      "With Cunha primed to occupy the left-sided No.10 spot and Mbeumo potentially the right-sided No.10 spot, it should ease the burden on United's No.9, whoever that proves to be.",
      "But having so far had little joy in their search for a striker, and sales being required to fund the addition of a natural goalscorer, they are looking as though they will have to play a waiting game.",
      "In addition to wanting a striker, a midfielder is also on Ruben Amorim's wish list - and that is where United's focus may have to switch to if they get Mbeumo over the line. They need fresh legs in that department amid concerns about Manuel Ugarte's ability on the ball.",
      "A striker remains a necessity for United this summer, but the addition of a midfielder may have to become the next priority if Mbeumo joins Cunha in Amorim's pool of attackers to increase their output."

      "Manchester United are trying to right transfer wrongs.",
      "The Reds have made a collection of expensive recruitment mistakes in the past decade and, facing a crucial summer, are determined to get things right this time around.",
      "United have improved their offer for Brentford's Bryan Mbeumo and remain confident of landing the forward. They have already secured the signature of Mathues Cunha from Wolves having activated his release clause.",
      "In recent days United have been linked with a surprising switch for Chelsea frontman Christopher Nkunku.",
      "But Nkunku, 27, is not an out-and-out striker. He started 22 games for Chelsea last season, with only nine coming in the Premier League. He also lost his place in the France squad this year and has not played in more than two months due to injury.",
      "He has struggled since signing for the Blues from RB Leipzig in 2023. The former PSG man caught the eye in Germany with a string of impressive performances and Chelsea shelled out more than £50million for his services.",
      "But he's managed just 11 Premier League starts in two injury-hit campaigns and has slipped down the pecking order at Stamford Bridge.",
      "In avoiding a move for the 14-cap France international, United have seemingly learnt from their recruitment mistakes of the past.",
      "Nkunku has a dire recent injury record and the Reds cannot afford to add another player to their squad who has question marks over his ability to stay fit.",
      "He is also at an age where there would be very little re-sale value should he be sold down the line, while he is not a natural fit for a central striker position.",
      "United have been rightly criticised for their recruitment in recent years and perhaps in past eras would have seen Nkunku as a viable solution.",
      "But under Ineos there has been a shift towards younger players with high ceilings, while even the additions of Cunha and Mbeumo are proven Premier League players with goalscoring returns - something Nkunku has not yet managed in two years in England.",
      "United signed Mason Mount from Chelsea in 2023 and he has struggled amid fitness issues. There is little to suggest the talented but seemingly fragile Nkunku will fare much better. It's a gamble the Reds are right to avoid."

      "The Reds are pursuing new additions to their squad after wrapping up a deal for Matheus Cunha. The club are working hard behind the scenes, with a new striker now said to be the top priority.",
      "Bryan Mbeumo has emerged as a key target, with the Brentford star reportedly considering offers from both Manchester United and Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrea Onana faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford.",
      "Emiliano Martinez has been linked as a potential replacement for the 29-year-old goalkeeper, who has drawn interest from Monaco. Meanwhile, Jadon Sancho, Marcus Rashford, and Alejandro Garnacho could also be on the move this summer as part of a major squad overhaul.",
      "The former Borussia Dortmund star, who spent last season on loan at Chelsea, could help United get their hands on a couple of new faces. Sancho has reportedly turned heads in the Serie A, so a swap deal could be on the cards.",
      "Former Man United goalkeeper Tim Howard believes selling Garnacho would not be a mistake.",
      "\"No, I don’t,\" Howard told CasinoBeats. \"We look at PSR and net gain.",
      "\"Unfortunately, that’s a big thing now. Those types of players, the young players, give you more net gain when you sell them, and that has to come into the equation. I know years ago that would sound stupid, but that’s actually the business of things these days.",
      "\"He’s young and he’s valuable, if they can receive a good return for him, then you then allow Ruben Amorim more room to go find the player that he wants to hand-pick and hand-select. On one hand, going back a few years, everybody would think that it was crazy to let a really good, talented player go. But in this landscape, I don’t think so.\"",
      "Howard also doesn't think Garnacho fits in Ruben Amorim's system. \"I don’t think he’s had enough time under Amorim to kind of see that he is or isn’t one of his players, or if he is or isn’t adapting to the style that Amorim plays with number nine and then the two 10’s underneath, tucked in tight,\" he explained.",
      "\"He doesn’t really seem to be the type of player to fill that role.\"",
      "According to Gianluca Di Marzio, Juventus are set to hold a video call with Manchester United over Jadon Sancho today (Wednesday).",
      "This follows reports from Turkey claiming that Sancho has agreed personal terms with Fenerbahce on a permanent deal. Sabah Spor reports that he has accepted a contract worth around £8.5million per year, with negotiations with United currently underway.",
      "However, the transfer saga appears far from over, with Juve also keen on the winger.",
      "Real Betis are reportedly preparing to sell midfielder Johnny Cardoso to raise funds for a move to sign Antony.",
      "Taking to X, Fabrizio Romano wrote: \"Jhonny Cardoso deal between Atletico Madrid and Real Betis will be sealed in the next 24 hours. The two clubs are finalising details of transfer fee and package worth over €30m. Matter of (short) time.\"",
      "The sale would provide funds to invest in signing Antony.",
      "Before Manchester United had even unveiled Ruben Amorim as their new head coach last November, almost all the conversation was about his preferred 3-4-2-1 system.",
      "Much of Amorim's success in Portugal stemmed from his unique system. With United in desperate need of new ideas, it was inevitable they would transition to a three-at-the-back formation. The system means width is provided by the wing-backs, who are responsible for being equally comfortably defensively and offensively.",
      "Amad and Diogo Dalot were the first to be tasked with that role. Eight months on, Patrick Dorgu looks set to go into next season as United's first choice left wing-back. Amad will face competition from Noussair Mazraoui, Dalot and potentially Bryan Mbeumo on the opposite flank.",
      "Read more here.",
      "Ruben Amorim reportedly wants to keep Joshua Zirkzee at Man United this summer and prefers to sell Rasmus Hojlund to raise funds.",
      "That's according to talkSPORT who claim Amorim has bigger plans for Zirkzee in his squad, with Hojlund more likely to leave Old Trafford just two years after arriving from Atalanta in a £72m deal.",
      "Hojlund only managed ten goals in 52 appearances for the Reds last season.",
      "Man United have stepped up their pursuit of Bryan Mbeumo with a new offer for the Brentford forward.",
      "The club have submitted an improved bid worth over £60 million for the Cameroon international.",
      "Tottenham are offering Bryan Mbeumo the chance to reunite with Thomas Frank, who left Brentford to take over from Ange Postecoglou at the Europa League winners. Spurs have already submitted a bid worth up to £70 million.",
      "However, Mbeumo is believed to favour a move to Old Trafford, where he could earn around £200,000 a week. United’s initial £55 million bid was rejected by Brentford, who are holding out for a fee at least matching the £62.5 million United paid Wolves for Matheus Cunha.",
      "Negotiations between the clubs are ongoing, and in the meantime, Mbeumo has taken to social media to share glimpses of his holiday. He posted a series of photos and videos on Instagram with the caption: \"Time off so far.\"",
      "According to talkSPORT, Man United are reportedly showing interest in Leicester midfielder Wilfred Ndidi.",
      "The Nigerian is available for a bargain fee this summer after the Foxes were relegated from the Premier League. The report adds that Everton are also keen and both clubs showed interest in Ndidi last summer, when they had the chance to sign him on a free transfer.",
      "Instead, Ndidi signed a new three-year contract extension to remain with Leicester following their Championship title win. The deal included a £9m release clause triggered if the Foxes were relegated straight back to the Championship.",
      "Man United have reportedly turned their attention to Palmeiras midfielder Richard Rios following his impressive displays in the Club World Cup.",
      "Journalist Ben Jacobs said: “I’ve heard a lot of noise about Rios. He’s been absolutely fantastic at the Club World Cup, and we are seeing growing interest as a consequence. I think Rios could [get a big move this summer].",
      "\"What I can tell you is Man United have scouted the player, but scouting doesn’t mean a great deal. Now that Palmeiras are through, we’re gonna have to be very patient with this saga.",
      "\"But at this stage, I’m not aware of Man United making any sort of club approach or any move on the player side at the moment. Nottingham Forest are the only Premier League team I know that have actually made contact on the player side. Tottenham are another club to watch, PSG also really like the player too, so Manchester United could be there.",
      "\"But actually, the player side has said if he moves, he doesn’t want to have these conversations now anyway, and that’s the key to succeeding with these kinds of transfers, you have to understand when the player wants to speak to you and when the player wants to focus on his football.",
      "\"It’s probably one for mid-July or even early August, which means that time is at least on Man United’s side.\"",

      "Rashford and Garnacho rank as two of the most sellable assets within the squad, but United would not be actively looking to sell them this summer if they had important roles to play.",

      "That is the going rate for a Premier League-standard forward. Only one of United's five arrivals last year was an attacker and Joshua Zirkzee also had a release clause. He was based in Italy, whose league has been in decline for nearly two decades and has become a dumping ground for English clubs. Ie. not United material but nearly as economical as Jasprit Bumrah's bowling.",
      "Sensibly, United have sought forwards with Premier League pedigree this year. Liam Delap was another they wanted on board and the eventual identity of their new No.9 (to consider Cunha or Mbeumo as one would be a complete cop-out) will be curious as it is unlikely to be a domestic deal.",
      "Before he purged his Twitter account, Berrada revelled in how much United had overpaid for Angel di Maria in 2014. Di Maria, a reigning Champions League winner who had recently helped Argentina to reach the World Cup final, commanded a British-record £59.7m fee.",
      "The problem with Di Maria was not the fee but the fact that he did not want to move to Manchester. United had a free run as Paris Saint-Germain, Di Maria's preferred choice, were out of the running due to financial fair play issues.",
      "Di Maria effectively covered the cost of James Rodriguez, Madrid's vanity signing. They still had change to get Toni Kroos, possibly the bargain of the decade, at £20m.",
      "Ed Woodward had also incepted the United tax by signing Marouane Fellaini for £4.5m more than was necessary in 2013. Back when FFP was not an issue for United and profitability and sustainability rules had not entered the football lexicon, Woodward operated as though spending inflated fees was a sound strategy. Luke Shaw became football's most expensive teenager two months before Di Maria was driven through the barriers at Carrington.",
      "Erik ten Hag aimed high in the Premier League market and the price was not right for United. They were not in the running when Declan Rice was available in 2023, having already earmarked Mason Mount as their central midfield target, and refused to test the waters with Tottenham for Harry Kane.",
      "Those two England internationals cost £187m combined when they moved to Arsenal and Bayern Munich. The negotiations of those deals involved 'big six' clubs, whereas Cunha and Mbeumo are more affordable, having operated outside of the elite, and are not England internationals.",
      "Brentford were looking for between £50m and £60m for Ivan Toney last year until it transpired that no Premier League clubs would meet them at the table. That drove his price down to £40m for Al Ahli. Mbeumo, in contrast, generated interest from Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United and outperformed any of Toney's top-flight campaigns before he decided on United. So he was never going to be as cheap.",
      "£60m is a figure that came to define United's 2023 summer window, one of their worst. Everyone at the club maintained that was the maximum they would pay for Rasmus Hojlund. Eventually, they overpaid with a final package of £72m.",
      "On the eve of the 2024 window, Berrada warned United would be on a \"slippery slope\" if they overpaid clubs, players and agents. Their spending was more disciplined, even if it eventually totalled £206m, but this year it is needs must after United's worst season in 51 years. A little more than £120m for two of the best forwards in the Premier League last season is a statement.",
      "United have made savings through their existence outside of the Champions League. For the third season out of four, players will be on a reduced salary due to their failure to qualify for the competition again.",
      "Two rounds of redundancies and slashing the non-playing workforce by roughly a third have also freed up funds after a decrease of £20m year-on-year on employee benefit expenses. United's net cash inflow of £22.3m during the last quarter was an increase of £7.2m from the same quarter last year.",
      "Sir Jim Ratcliffe's remark that United could have gone \"bust\" by Christmas always sounded like scaremongering. PSR has genuinely compromised them (they loaned in Wout Weghorst as Cristiano Ronaldo's mid-season replacement when Cody Gakpo was available), only it was undermined by squandering £625.43m under Ten Hag.",
      "United's market movement under Berrada has been hitherto inoffensive but the greater the price, the greater the scrutiny. And United are now going north of £60m."

      "The Premier League's Key Match Incidents panel has pinpointed 18 VAR errors throughout the 2024-25 season, marking an improvement on the previous year.",
      "All 20 clubs in the league cast their votes on retaining VAR ahead of the season, with Wolves being the sole club advocating for its complete removal. Despite the league's decision to continue with Video Assistant Referees, there were widespread appeals for modifications to enhance the process.",
      "Premier League clubs argued for more frequent and improved training for referees to better the current state of play. They also requested for fixed teams of VAR officials to foster better understanding among officials, as well as advocating for a drastic reduction in delays and improved communication for fans in stadiums, with the latter being a recurring concern for match-going supporters.",
      "The Key Match Officials panel consists of former players and/or coaches, along with one representative each from the Premier League and PGMOL.",
      "ESPN has highlighted the errors identified by the panel over the course of the most recent Premier League season. Here's some further insight into the mistakes - as well as which clubs were affected most.",
      "The first VAR error occurred on the season's opening weekend. Bournemouth striker Ouattara believed he had netted a late winner, only for it to be disallowed due to handball.",
      "The KMI panel unanimously agreed that VAR made an incorrect decision. That extra point for Newcastle proved beneficial, as Eddie Howe's team qualified for the Champions League based solely on goal difference, although it's overly simplistic to claim that a decision on the opening weekend was the deciding factor.",
      "Another unanimous vote here. Fernandes received a straight red card during Manchester United's home defeat to Tottenham in September, with all five panellists deeming it a mistake.",
      "United were 1-0 down at the time and ended up losing 3-0. Fernandes' suspension was eventually overturned on appeal.",
      "The KMI panel votes on both the referee and the VAR in these cases. As with the Ouattara incident, the panel unanimously supported the on-field referee but disagreed with the VAR intervention.",
      "Initially, no penalty was given after United defender De Ligt tackled West Ham forward Danny Ings late in the second half. A lengthy VAR review led referee Michael Oliver to award a penalty, which Jarrod Bowen successfully converted from 12 yards to secure the win for West Ham.",
      "Brentford skipper Norgaard was sent off in the first half of their stalemate at Everton after a challenge on goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, which led to VAR stepping in.",
      "The decision was contentious, with ESPN reporting that the panel was divided (3:2), stating: \"The panel were split (3:2), with the majority deeming the on-field decision correct as 'both players are committed to normal footballing actions.' Two panelists deemed the on-field decision incorrect as 'whilst this was a challenge for the ball, there was a high, full and forceful contact with the studs.'\".",
      "VAR's hesitance to intervene has also been questioned, particularly regarding Maatsen's tackle on Ismaila Sarr, which some argue warranted a red card.",
      "The debate hinges on whether Maatsen's foul on Sarr prevented a clear scoring chance. Despite the referee and VAR not finding sufficient evidence of this, the panel remained unconvinced.",
      "Not every controversial decision had a significant impact on the game's result. In the match where Everton dominated Wolves with a three-goal lead, the panel still found fault with what they considered an erroneous call.",
      "Doucoure was deemed not to be interfering with play while in an offside position in the build-up to a Craig Dawson own goal. Interestingly, Everton had a goal disallowed for a similar offence earlier in the match, but were not penalised on this occasion.",
      "The match between Forest and Villa in December saw late drama, with the home side scoring twice in the final five minutes to turn defeat into victory. However, the VAR controversy occurred early on, with the scores still level.",
      "Villa appealed for a penalty as Forest's Anderson pulled back Morgan Rogers, but it was not awarded. The KMI panel argued, with a 3-2 majority, that there was sufficient holding in the box to warrant a penalty.",
      "The match between West Ham and Brighton in December saw all the drama unfold after half-time. Mats Wieffer and Mohammed Kudus scored, while Brighton's Estupinan risked a late red card for serious foul play.",
      "Neither the on-field referee nor the VAR felt the Ecuadorian deserved to be dismissed for his foul on Max Kilman, but the KMI panel disagreed. \"The action of Estupinian has speed, force, intensity and endangers the safety of the opponent,\" they stated.",
      "Just a week later, another Brighton player avoided a red card. Joao Pedro threw an elbow at Brentford's Yehor Yarmoliuk but remained on the pitch.",
      "Despite making no contact with his opponent, the Brazilian should not have avoided a red card, according to the KMI panel, who unanimously agreed that the officials made an error.",
      "In December, West Ham found themselves on the wrong end of a VAR penalty mistake, having previously benefited from one in October. The Hammers may feel this could have significantly impacted the game, as their 1-0 deficit ballooned into a 5-0 loss following the decision.",
      "Mac Allister was seen throwing Carlos Soler to the ground off the ball, leading to a split decision among the KMI panel, with some arguing it had no impact on play. This defeat marked Julen Lopetegui's final match at the London Stadium, as he was sacked following a loss to Manchester City days later.",
      "Brighton, who had previously benefited from VAR errors in December, found themselves on the receiving end in January. The Seagulls appealed for an early penalty at Ipswich after Burns obstructed Jan Paul van Hecke, but the appeal was dismissed.",
      "Ultimately, it didn't make much difference, as Fabian Hurzeler's side went on to secure a 2-0 victory.",
      "Nottingham Forest's encounter with Southampton in January proved a nail-biter when it really shouldn't have. A comfortable 3-0 advantage was unnervingly slashed to 3-2, in part due to the controversy surrounding a disallowed goal which potentially could have halted Southampton's comeback.",
      "Milenkovic was under the impression he had extended the lead to 4-1 just after Saints' initial strike, only to see his effort ruled out for an offside decision against his colleague Chris Wood. The expert panel, nevertheless, agreed that Wood did not interfere with play and the goal should have stood.",
      "In the Wolves vs Arsenal clash, Myles Lewis-Skelly was shown a red card before the break at Molineux for halting a counter. There was little dispute over the foul on Matt Doherty warranting action, yet the severity of the card caught Arsenal off guard.",
      "Despite being a player down, Arsenal clinched victory, and Wolves concluded the match similarly handicapped, seeing one of their own dismissed. Following a review, Lewis-Skelly's red card was rescinded.",
      "\"Yeah obviously really happy that the decision has been made and Myles is going to be available for us,\" said Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta.",
      "It wasn't until April, after these contentious January moments, that another dubious VAR outcome emerged, as acknowledged by the KMI panel. However, this instance marked the first of two contentious calls made on that same day.",
      "Hinshelwood's challenge on Jacob Ramsey was overlooked by officials, and despite Villa claiming it was a clear penalty, they won the game 3-0.",
      "James Tarkowski was only booked for a contentious tackle on Alexis Mac Allister. The KMI panel unanimously agreed that despite winning the ball first, the dangerousness of Tarkowski's action warranted a red card, stating: \"The clear dangerous nature of the challenge is not mitigated by Tarkowski winning the ball first,\" and identified it as \"A clear example of endangering the safety of an opponent.\"",
      "Fulham, hosting Liverpool at Craven Cottage, won 3-2, marking just the second league defeat for the Reds this season in April. Fulham managed to overcome being denied a valid penalty when Liverpool's goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher fouled Andreas Pereira without receiving any consequence.",
      "United's game with Bournemouth also saw VAR controversy. The game ended in a draw after the home side had led, even though Evanilson's red card stirred debate over referee decisions once again.",
      "Evanilson was shown the red card following a tackle on United's Noussair Mazraoui. However, it seemed he slipped into the challenge, a point noted in the panel's explanation, leading to the Brazilian's ban being ultimately rescinded.",
      "Our list concludes with relegated Ipswich, who were already relegated when they received an inconsequential reprieve against Brentford. Defender Tuanzebe pulled Bees' Nathan Collins to the turf, but no penalty was given.",
      "The panel contended that the grappling between the players was not mutual, with Tuanzebe clutching his opponent with both arms. The decision had no impact on the outcome, as Brentford were 1-0 up at the time and won by the same margin.",
      "So, who benefited the most... and who suffered.",
      "Brentford bore the brunt of these incorrect decisions, finding themselves on the losing side three times without benefiting from a mistake even once. On the flip side are Everton, who profited three times without any losses.",
      "ESPN also examined the biggest beneficiaries of VAR decisions - not just the errors listed above - throughout the season. Newcastle lead the pack in this regard, with 13 decisions in their favour and only four against, while Bournemouth are at the opposite end with four decisions for them and 11 against.",
      "Three teams - Chelsea, Leicester and Manchester City - experienced no VAR errors throughout the entire season. In fact, City only had four VAR interventions in their matches all season - three in their favour and one against."

      "Onana is under contract at United until 2028 and the club would require a fee of £28.32million to sell him without making a loss under the Premier League's profitability and sustainability rules.",

      "Jesse Lingard has fired Paul Pogba a message ahead of a proposed return to professional football. The former Manchester United midfielder was provisionally suspended in September 2023 after a random drug test found increased levels of testosterone in his system.",
      "Pogba was then given a four-year ban in February 2024. The France international appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and his sanction was reduced to 18 months, making him eligible to return to first-team training in January.",
      "Before the 32-year-old could lace up his boots and play competitively again, Juventus terminated his contract, which wasn't set to expire until June 2026. Pogba has been a free agent ever since then, but he appears to have finally found himself a new club.",
      "According to ESPN and Le Parisien, the Frenchman will join AS Monaco this summer. The report adds that Pogba has verbally agreed to sign a two-year contract with the Ligue 1 outfit after turning down a lucrative offer from an unnamed team in the Saudi Pro League.",
      "Pogba teased his return to action on social media earlier this week. On Monday, he uploaded a handful of pictures from a private training session with Amir Richardson, a midfielder for Fiorentina, and Tyreek Hill, a wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, among others, too.",
      "\"I think it's time,\" wrote Pogba under the post, which has since eclipsed 1.3million likes. Among the thousands of comments from supporters, Jesse Lingard fuelled speculation of a move to Monaco and said: \"Hurry up, we ready my bro.\"",
      "While Pogba has been linked with a return to football, he's remained coy on the matter, at least publicly. Speaking on Sergio Aguero's podcast, La Casa del Kun, the former United star provided an update on his future.",
      "\"I haven't signed anything, but there's interest. We'll see,\" said Pogba. \"In life, you never know. I loved the people who went to see Boca's match [at the Club World Cup], it's crazy because I went to Marseille, which is hot, Naples is hot, but Boca... I've never seen that in my life.\"",
      "Then, in an interview with French television channel TF1, Pogba opened up about how he was treated by Juventus before being released. He said: \"I asked Juventus for help, but I wasn't given it.",
      "\"I asked to get a fitness coach. I had the right, and I was always part of the team. They weren't very kind to me, and they did not support me, and I was shocked. I did not understand why.",
      "\"I thought I was at war with anti-doping authorities, not Juventus. I couldn't keep taking my kids to school every day, passing by the stadium and the training centre, and knowing I wouldn't be able to play for a long time.",
      "\"My kids kept asking me when I'd be back on the pitch and when they could watch me at the stadium again.\"",
      "Pogba added: \"I'm mentally and physically ready, and I'm eager to start again. I'm 32, but I still feel like a young kid.\""

      "You would be hard-pressed to find a striker who has not been linked with Manchester United in this summer's transfer window already.",
      "After missing out on Liam Delap, United have been left with no choice but to explore alternative avenues in their search for a goalscorer.",
      "Delap was available for £30million this summer via a release clause, meaning he would have been a relatively straightforward signing to have got over the line.",
      "However, despite scoring a respectable tally of 12 Premier League goals for relegated Ipswich Town last season, United are in need of someone more proven and experienced. It is why ongoing reports linking them with Sporting Lisbon striker Viktor Gyokeres and Napoli ace Victor Osimhen make so much sense.",
      "The aforementioned duo have established themselves as two of Europe's most prolific and reliable goal-getters in the last couple of years. Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in the last two seasons for Sporting and Osimhen plundered 37 goals in 41 games on loan at Galatasaray in 2024/25.",
      "As a result, both of them will command hefty-sized transfer fees this summer. It is no secret United need to watch the pennies this summer, meaning outgoings will dictate what can be achieved amid their hunt for a striker.",
      "The Reds have already spent £62.5m on Matheus Cunha and Brentford ace Bryan Mbeumo looks set to command a similar fee. If they spend somewhere in the region of £120m just on those two, incomings are likely to cease until players are sold.",
      "It is why United, as desperate as they are for a No.9, may have to lower their expectations when trying to source a goal-getter and move away from those with such prestigious profiles.",
      "Among the strikers to have been linked with a move to Old Trafford in recent months is Crystal Palace ace Jean-Philippe Mateta. The Frenchman, who will turn 28 later this week, enjoyed an excellent 2024/25 campaign at Selhurst Park, scoring 17 goals across all competitions.",
      "Mateta has made impressive progress since joining Palace from German club Mainz in January 2021, initially on loan, scoring 46 goals in 152 games. However, he did need time to adjust and it was not until the 2023/24 campaign that he started to fulfil his potential.",
      "He scored 19 times that season, meaning he has scored 36 goals over the last two campaigns for Palace. He has also chipped in with ten assists during that time.",
      "Although he did not score during Palace's run to lifting the FA Cup at Wembley in May, he did play a key role. He was particularly key to their winning goal against Manchester City in the final.",
      "Using his physicality and strength to hold off Josko Gvardiol, Mateta played a cushioned pass to Daichi Kamada, got the return, took a few strides forward, slipped in Daniel Munoz, who had made an enterprising run down the right, and he sent in a low cross that was turned in by Eberechi Eze.",
      "Eze will always be remembered for scoring the goal that earned Palace their first major trophy, but Mateta played a key role in making it possible, showcasing what his profile is all about.",
      "First and foremost, Mateta is a goalscorer, but his all-round game is about much more, making him an attractive option. He would tick a lot of boxes for United.",
      "\"He's a boring striker to play against,\" Thierry Henry said of Mateta last year. \"He doesn't lose the ball much, and he goes at the last defender.",
      "\"He uses his physicality, he's good with his head, and he scores. It's important that a striker like that gives you another dimension.\"",
      "Although he would tie in with United's objective of signing proven Premier League players this summer, he is unlikely to be available at a price they could currently entertain. His contract was due to expire next summer, but Palace triggered the option they had to extend his stay until 2027 last December, meaning they have protected his value.",
      "Had his deal been up next summer, United may have been able to convince Palace into considering a sale at a cut-price fee amid the danger of him leaving for free next year.",
      "Instead, with two years remaining on his deal, Palace, in the event of suitors coming knocking, have plenty of leeway to try and demand as a high a price as possible for one of their star attractions. Their valuation is unlikely to be affordable for United right now."

      "Nearly six months after his last managerial role, Wayne Rooney has embarked on a new venture alongside one-time England colleague Michael Dawson.",
      "The 39-year-old Rooney has been absent from the touchline since parting ways with Plymouth Argyle by mutual agreement in late December. His departure left the Pilgrims languishing at the bottom of the Championship table, and they were subsequently relegated at the end of the season.",
      "This marked another setback for Rooney, whose managerial career has had a rocky start. His brief tenure with the Pilgrims was preceded by mixed spells at the helm of Birmingham City, DC United and Derby County.",
      "Now, the ex-England striker has secured a new position in Dubai, working with ex-Tottenham defender Dawson. The duo will participate in Football Escapes, a programme that offers children the opportunity to hone their skills under the supervision of UEFA-qualified coaches.",
      "The five-day course, scheduled for October, is billed as \"the ultimate family holiday and football experience.\" Rooney's role will involve offering daily guidance to the young participants - utilising his expertise to aid their development.",
      "He also took part in the previous edition of the course, which was held during the February half term. This move follows Rooney's suggestion that he would take a break from management for some time, with his attention likely to remain on television punditry work.",
      "When questioned about his future career steps after participating in Soccer Aid recently, he disclosed: \"Obviously just doing some TV work at the minute, so that's what I'm doing. I'm enjoying it. So, that's where I'll be.\"",
      "Rooney has previously expressed he would consider a managerial comeback if the conditions were favourable, stating on Stick to Football: \"I would like to go back in [to management], but it would have to be the right club, certainly the right club.",

      "After leaving his role at Birmingham last term, Manchester United hero Rooney intrigued many by indicating his ambition to manage at two of his previous clubs.",
      "Reflecting on his career aspirations, he mentioned on Match of the Day: \"Manchester United or Everton is the aim,\" highlighting that \"These big jobs are where you want to get to, but it's a process I have got to go through the steps and get myself back on track.\"",
      "Looking ahead, Rooney added: \"I want to get myself back into management to make sure in the next 10 years I'm hopefully in a position to go into one of the big jobs.\""

      "Manchester United cannot be accused of lacking ambition at the start of this summer's transfer window.",
      "After announcing they had reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Matheus Cunha for £62.5million on June 1, United then submitted an opening offer for Brentford star Bryan Mbeumo. They offered £45m up front and an additional £10m in add-ons.",
      "Brentford swiftly rejected United's opening offer for the Cameroonian, but talks between the two clubs continued amid Mbeumo's hunger to seal a move to Old Trafford this summer.",
      "United have now submitted a second offer in excess of £60m for the 25-year-old. Despite firm interest from Tottenham Hotspur, who recently appointed former Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach, Mbeumo's heart is set on a move to United.",
      "Cunha was pinpointed as their top target several months ago and he, like Mbeumo, was hungry to get a move to Old Trafford finalised. The deal was formally completed almost a fortnight ago and the Brazilian has signed a five-year deal.",
      "A specialist playmaker, Cunha is expected to occupy the left-sided No.10 position in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 set-up.",
      "Cunha was one of the Premier League's most exciting players to watch last term, scoring 15 goals and registering six assists in just 33 appearances.",
      "Goals were lacking from United's attack last term, highlighted by their tally of just 44 in the league, meaning Amorim is understandably desperate to add goals and creativity to his forward line. In Cunha, United have recruited a player who can provide both.",
      "In addition to scoring 15 goals and getting six assists in the league last season, he scored 12 goals and registered seven assists in the 2023/24 Premier League campaign. He has proven he can deliver the goods consistently.",
      "The same can be said of Mbeumo. The former Troyes man scored 20 goals in the Premier League last term, only being outscored by Liverpool star Mohamed Salah (29), Alexander Isak of Newcastle United (23) and Manchester City striker Erling Haaland (22).",
      "Mbeumo, who is a versatile operator, capable of playing out wide or through the middle, is expected to occupy the right-sided No.10 role in Amorim's system, It means United, should they also add the striker they are in such desperate need of, will have an exciting attack next season.",
      "United's attack was one of the bluntest in the league last term. Adding Mbeumo and a striker to the addition of Cunha could transform it into one of the division's strongest.",
      "United have not had a player score 20 league goals or more in a season since Robin van Persie plundered 26 in the 2012/13 season.",
      "United last had two players score 15 league goals or more in a single season back in the Covid-hit 2019/20 campaign when Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial helped themselves to 17 goals each. If Cunha and Mbeumo were to get 17 goals each next season, they would instantly rank among United's best signings in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Just getting into double figures would count as a success.",
      "No transfer is guaranteed to work out, but United are certainly targeting players of the right profile to fix their biggest problem."

      "You may have come across the late-night football programme El Chiringuito in Spain, a telenovela punditry programme where bad news is treated as a tragedy, almost cause for national mourning.",
      "It is so partisan that Florentino Perez, the Real Madrid president, used it as his platform to plug the Super League. Perez described Madrid as \"broke\" and went unchallenged. Months later, they bought Aurelien Tchouameni for €80million.",
      "The programme is live and much of it is undoubtedly scripted but it is not a parody. When Kylian Mbappe had the temerity to reject Madrid in 2022, José Félix Díaz, of Marca, turned to the camera and addressed Mbappe directly: \"You'll be a great player, but never a great man.\" Tomas Roncero vented that Mbappe must \"swallow the Eiffel Tower\" to ever play for Madrid.",
      "English football coverage is better off without its own El Chiringuito. You wonder how Marcus Rashford, who floated the possibility of playing at Barcelona in a chat with a Spanish influencer, would cope with the show's Catalan contingent if his body language regresses.",
      "Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho have become content-creation collaborators in the Manchester United departures' lounge. United still pay their wages but they brazenly undermined their employers with a choreographed stunt on Sunday.",
      "Rashford was injured for that humbling at Wembley but was present at the boxing at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium later that evening. We are long past the point where Rashford cared about the optics of his social life. He attended a birthday party on Deansgate hours after he was cheered off in a 3-0 Manchester derby defeat at Old Trafford.",
      "Any notion that Garnacho's post was not choreographed beggars belief. You can tell when he is uploading onto his Instagram page (his passive-aggressive pre-Europa League final story and return from the post-season tour).",
      "The other giveaway is Rashford's use of the word \"brother\" in the comments. It is the most hollow and meaningless noun in football. Rashford and Garnacho have only ever socialised during team-bonding dinners.",
      "Garnacho and Rashford rarely linked up on the pitch, never mind off it. Garnacho pinched Rashford's place on the left wing. One of Rashford's inner circle dubbed him a \"f*****g Ronaldo wannabe\". Now they are \"brothers\".",
      "In all probability, neither player literally posted or commented. Rashford's brother, Dwaine Maynard, accidentally sent a tweet intended for Rashford's Twitter account from the DN May Sports agency he runs in September 2021. Having interviewed Rashford, a thoughtful talker, his often banal captions never sound like something he would ever say.",
      "Maynard was summoned to United's Carrington training complex after Rashford's Belfast bender in January 2024. They know their race is run at United but it is still unedifying to see a player who joined the club's academy 20 years ago publicly stoop to such a petty low.",
      "Garnacho's own advisers, Carlos Cambeiro and Enrique de Lucas, have succeeded and failed with the Argentine. They have a client whose value was listed in excess of £100m last year but literally leave Garnacho to his own (smartphone) devices.",
      "He is a loose cannon, regularly sounding off on social media, and failing to gag his lippy brother. Cambeiro and De Lucas are part of the problem. They let the world know they were at Stamford Bridge in January, when Chelsea were giving serious consideration to bidding for Garnacho.",
      "Garnacho turns 21 next week yet acts like the finished article. He is finished at United and, in his desperation, has found an ally in Rashford.",
      "Rashford and Garnacho were both lucratively remunerated in 2023. Garnacho kicked on. It kicked off with Rashford. They had little in common other than their position until they irked Amorim in Plzen back in December.",
      "They were close on the morning of December 15, when both were training at Carrington having been dropped from the squad for the Manchester derby. Garnacho, to his credit, went in one direction and played in every remaining match last season bar the final day win over Villa. Rashford decided on a change of scenery.",
      "It is particularly sobering for United that the two upstarts are academy products that represent the best of both worlds. The local lad and the gem unearthed from abroad.",
      "Some in the United academy can be quick to pat themselves on the back when there is a history of some of their most talented products posing problems, from the frivolous to the serious. The academy cannot parent a player throughout their career or be held completely accountable, but it is cause to take stock.",
      "The brazenness of Garnacho's post and Rashford's comment is a throwback to Paul Pogba - another academy graduate - revelling in Jose Mourinho's sacking on Twitter with his 'Caption this' post. Pogba was never disciplined over that.",
      "United resisted selling Pogba, tolerated the late Mino Raiola declaring \"it's over\" for him on the eve of a decisive Champions League tie at RB Leipzig (that United lost) and released him. The Stretford End repeatedly chanted \"F**k off, Pogba\" after he was substituted against Norwich City in April 2022. He did. Pogba never played at Old Trafford again.",
      "Neither, most likely, will Rashford and Garnacho."

But the Reds seem to be lurking with intent to break the British transfer record, which will be necessary to tempt Newcastle. The Magpies want to keep the Swede, but they can sell a sale to their fans if they are getting silly money. And if Isak states a desire to move. Both things will need to happen. And they might…",

Speculative for the moment, but it could become an option later in the summer.",

Getting rid of Garnacho would be the big win, but Nkunku is not the type of forward they really need. If they sign Bryan Mbeumo to play as a no.10 alongside Matheus Cunha, then they are sorted for forwards off the front man – it’s the central striker they badly need. And if Chelsea get Gittens, with Geovany Quenda arriving in a year, do they really need Garnacho? They definitely don’t need his bullsh*t.",

Still, like James Trafford, below, Newcastle’s fondness for Elanga goes back a long way. And knowing them, they’ll probably walk away now.",
      "",

      "13) Benjamin Sesko – RB Leipzig to Arsenal\nThere was talk of Arsenal submitting a serious bid last week, but Arsenal are reluctant to meet Leipzig’s valuation, which falls somewhere between £68milion and £85million. Which was always going to be around the going rate for a top centre-forward this summer. Where there was more noise around Arsenal choosing Sesko, the momentum is building again around the other guy.",

The reality is, though, that there may ultimately be little they can do about it. Even if it means losing 80% of their back five from 2024/25.",

The contract situation is important; it means Liverpool will be reluctant to spend over the odds, and while Palace won’t have their pants pulled down, they cannot risk the prospect of their skipper leaving for free.",

      "9) 🔽 Ousmane Diomande – Sporting Lisbon to Crystal Palace\nThis could be a major coup for Palace, who are in for a player strongly linked with Arsenal, Manchester United and Spurs in the past. But they are making slow progress, if any. Palace offered £35million; Sporting want closer to £50million.",
      "",
      "8) 🔼 James Trafford – Burnley to Newcastle\nThis has been going on for over a year but Newcastle seem more intent to land the Clarets keeper than last summer. Talks are talking place, Trafford wants the move… expect this to happen once the new PSR year starts next week, probably for around £30million. Prompting some good old-fashion keeper dominoes.",

But now United have returned to Brentford with a second offer, how serious are Spurs about reuniting Mbeumo and Thomas Frank?",
      "",
      "6) Viktor Gyokeres – Sporting Lisbon to Arsenal\nApparently, Arsenal are hot again for Gyokeres having failed to agree a deal for Benjamin Sesko. So they’re back trying to negotiate with Sporting, who blew them out last time. Assuming they are serious and don’t switch targets for the 427th time, Arsenal want Gyokeres through the door before their pre-season tour to Asia. We just want Arsenal to pick a lane for this to be over.",

We wait to see Spurs’ reaction and whether they counter – Brentford will pray they do to prolong any bidding war. Apparently, United have been having conversations with the Bees so we have to assume they are confident this offer will suffice, but only if Daniel Levy and Thomas Frank don’t show similar intent.",

      "4) Sverre Nypan – Rosenborg to Manchester City\nArsenal fancied their chances of landing the Norwegian wonderkid, and Villa were in talks in recent months. But City are in the mood for signings and it looks like they have agreed a £12.5million deal for the 18-year-old attacking midfielder. A medical was scheduled for last week but we’ve heard nothing since, while City are in the United States for a nonsense tournament.",

      "Alejandro Garnacho’s latest misdemeanour won’t endear him to any coach who might have been tempted to take a punt on a player Manchester United desperately need shot of…",
      "It’s not entirely Alejandro Garnacho’s fault. Like all of us, he’s a product of his environment and his, for the last five years, has been one of the most dysfunctional in football. But even in a sea of sheltered, selfish stars, Garnacho’s attitude is up there among the most pungent to have stunk out Old Trafford in recent seasons.",
      "He’s in good company. The likelihood is that in less than a fortnight, Garnacho will return to Manchester United as part of a four-strong bomb squad for whom, to the surprise of absolutely no outside Carrington, there has been little interest amid a fire-sale in which the Red Devils will struggle to make half of the ridiculous sum they originally hoped.",
      "MAILBOX: Man Utd have signed another ‘knob-end’ in Mr Walky McWalkface",
      "Garnacho was expected to fetch the highest fee, originally in the region of £60million before – with no justification whatsoever – United bumped up the price by £10million. All for a player Ruben Amorim told to ‘pray’ for a new club.",
      "United really have not got the hang of this selling lark. The player they expected to make them the most money appears set to be the one still darkening their door come the start of the season.",
      "Marcus Rashford will find a new club, but most likely on loan with an option like that Aston Villa have so far refused (they are in enough PSR trouble). Jadon Sancho could be heading for Turkey with the last year of an undeserved salary seemingly safe. And Real Betis will probably come to some arrangement over Antony. But what about Garnacho?",
      "Doubtless United are pitching a premium, prodigious winger, a Puskas winner, an international with the World Cup winners, but what they are selling, no one is buying. Certainly not yet. While it is possible a market will form for Garnacho, it might be made up of summer shoppers waiting for the yellow stickers down the whoopsie aisle as closing time approaches at the end of the window.",
      "It wasn’t meant to be this way. It should not have been this way. When Garnacho stepped up from the youth team – to call him an Academy graduate is a stretch since he was no longer a schoolboy when he joined from Atletico Madrid – he was seen as one of United’s great hopes. As is too often the case with young talent at the very highest level, his profile grew disproportionally to his performances. And there were warning signs from the beginning; Erik ten Hag spoke more than once of the need for the teenager to buck up his ideas when he broke into the first team.",
      "His first senior start only came after warnings over his ‘attitude, resilience, determination’. Pushed on what specifically Garnacho had done wrong, Ten Hag gave him a pass.",
      "“Not wrong. It’s young kids, eh? They have to grow and to raise their personality, and they have to know what are the laws and demands in top football.",
      "“It’s not only about a trick or about scoring one goal. No, we have to win football games and that demands a lot and then you have to fulfil every day the highest standards.”",
      "Eighty-seven starts and a new manager later, it’s clear the message never got through. Garnacho’s patches of form over the last two-and-a-half years are roughly equal in number to the headaches he’s given Ten Hag and Amorim.",
      "Amid the club’s desperate attempts to portray Garnacho as the present and the future, Ten Hag had little choice but to persist with the winger, then a teenager, his youth earning unmerited passes from the increasingly beleaguered boss over his attitude, sloppiness, and social media mis-steps. Amorim, presumably given fair warning upon his arrival, was less forgiving. Garnacho was dropped for the derby in December, not just for this, but also as a consequence of behaviour patterns observed around Carrington. Too many strikes so he was out. Then in. Out again. In a bit, now definitely out.",
      "Posting a photo of himself in ‘brother’ Rashford’s Villa shirt boiled plenty of p*ss but Garnacho’s bridges were already torched at Old Trafford. All he achieved with his holiday pic was a thinning out of the few United fans who still stood in his corner.",
      "It won’t enamour Garnacho to any the few suitors he may have had. Certainly not when United are asking for silly money.",
      "🚨 MORE ON GARNACHO FROM F365\n🔴 ‘Immature’ Garnacho slammed for latest antics – ‘If I was Fernandes… I’d smash him’\n⚪ Roy Keane tells Man Utd star Garnacho to buck up or ‘get a job somewhere else’\n⚫ Ex-Man Utd man tears into Garnacho over behaviour and haircut; Amorim told to ‘ship him out’",
      "It would be daft even if Garnacho didn’t come with the baggage. Managers today want low maintenance, high performance. But when it comes to those most basic expectations, Garnacho seems to have got things woefully muddled.",
      "For coaches looking for a forward with range, Garnacho is not their guy. As a winger – Amorim has seen he’s no No.10 – he doesn’t have lightning speed and, coming off the left touchline, defenders know he has little intention of going outside them. Garnacho is most effective in a counter-attacking set up, lacking the guile to break massed ranks. And his best performances tend to come off the bench.",
      "If the anecdotal evidence doesn’t make buyers beware, the stats ought. Thirty-five matches separated his two Premier League assists last season – Manchester City’s goalkeeper doubled that tally – and he created only four big chances, fewer than 113 other players. Garnacho wasn’t much more effective when he was on the end of the opportunities. Though he scored six league goals, he missed 14 big chances.",
      "Such form isn’t that of a £70million player. With the statistical context contradicting the notion that he’s being dragged down by the underperformers around him, he would be dear at half that price. Then you consider the character witness testimonies… why the shuddering f*** do United and Garnacho seem so confident of attracting good offers?",
      "Perhaps the bravado masks a fear from the club and the player that they could be stuck with one other. Almost certainly, each will have to tolerate the other when pre-season starts. But parting is a must. And both United and Garnacho will have to try harder to make it happen.",
      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top ten.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho’s latest antics have seen him labelled a ‘little dope’ in need of a ‘clip around the ear’ by one prominent football pundit.",
      "A Manchester United transfer reportedly hinges on one condition, while a Red Devils star has been pictured wearing the shirt of a rival Premier League club.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea are targeting eight players for two positions, including four Premier League stars, to revamp Maresca’s attack as Mudryk faces a four-year ban."

Red carded in another game too. Spent more time than anyone in the league walking last season, look it up its legit! 72 or more percent off memory.",
      "I’m nailing my flag to mast right now – this isn’t going to work out for either party.",
      "Geezer has had one good season, has an ego bigger than Pogba’s and just looks to be a complete knob-end.",
      "Our changing room needs good honest pros, hard workers who will lead by example on and off the pitch. We are literally swapping players out that don’t seem like knobs, maybe Garnacho but it’s nothing a decent manager couldn’t sort out.",
      "Something doesn’t sit right with the me on this one. I don’t think we’ve done proper due diligence on this transfer. We haven’t considered what impact this character has on the dressing room and whether he has any sort of leadership qualities.",
      "Rashford will probably be gone. Is he that bad mentally and physically we don’t want him anymore? Is it beyond repair? I wonder what Amorim has done since coming in. Their relationship is a strange one.",
      "I’m also nailing that flag to the same mast – just a bit lower down it, Amorim is gone before Jan transfer window.",
      "I’ve seen nothing that suggests he can turn us into anything different just because he’s had a 6 week pre season with the same squad minus those that have already left, + Mr Walky McWalkface added to it.",

      "Sesko is younger, has apparently great potential but has low stats while Gyokeres seems to be the proven product coupled with a desire to join Arsenal–this should be a done deal. As for the other options, the suggestions of Osimhen, Nunez are just comedian jokes made at the end of his performance that suck.\nJamo, Nairobi (didn’t realize there were so many Jims out there)",
      "",
      "PSR is the enemy of ambition\nThe email about Newcastle selling Isak was a really good mailbox contribution – and it highlighted exactly the challenge that my club faces. PSR has put a huge glass ceiling above a lot of teams, but only Newcastle and Villa have bumped up against it in recent years.",
      "Essentially, because your revenues can’t catch up as quickly to the ‘big 6’, you always need to be on the look out for sales or managing your wage bill to be able to stay active in the market at all.",
      "Over the past couple of seasons Newcastle haven’t signed a first team player (Lloyd Kelly was a squad player for 6 months) and have lost Anderson (who’s great) and Minteh (who might be) as well as having to sell some of our depth (Kelly, Almiron) in January just to make ends meet. Yes, we technically paid money for Vlachidimos but that was very much a technicality with our backs against the wall in the Anderson deal.",
      "So, fast forward to this summer and finally we can buy. But we face two massive problems – 1. Everyone we want to buy, seemingly someone bigger does, and 2. We can’t (due to PSR) offer them as much in wages.",
      "This cost us last summer with Tosin going to Chelsea, or Mbeumo to Man U (now maybe Spurs) this one. As the Isak article pointed out, we could lose our best player because he can get paid triple at Liverpool (yes, there may be other reasons but this matters).",
      "We therefore have to tread a very narrow path of players who are both good enough to play for a team with grand ambitions and playing in the Champions League but don’t have huge wage demands/transfer fees or wanted by Chelsea.",
      "There’s not many players out there in that Venn diagram and it must be tough. The club could clearly do better here, and it’s not helped by the changes at board level, but many targets who are deemed good enough may get gobbled up by the bigger fish offering an extra £50-100k a week or £15m in transfer fees (Liverpool taking Szboszlai when we were negotiating, same happened with Ekitike and PSG).",
      "So you can build the depth even younger, which they’re doing – signing 16-18 year olds and hoping they come good. Or you have to start taking gambles. And gambles can be spectacularly good (Isak) or bad (see various). And gambling on players is easier if you’re midtable and looking up (Brighton, Brentford) but much harder if you’ve got Champions League football.",
      "It’s going to be a rough summer for Newcastle – people want our star players and we desperately need 5-6 players to flesh out the squad – but that narrow path to success feels out of reach at the moment.",
      "And then the problems multiply. A bad season, no Champions League and then Isak goes (if not before), and the vultures circle for the rest.",
      "PSR is solely to blame here – it’s ruining the opportunities to catch up to the big boys.\nJames, NUFC",
      "",
      "Liverpool: Not all that\nThere’s much excitement about Liverpool’s new signings and how they’ve already wrapped up the league for next season. I’m a Newcastle fan, here’s my thoughts.",
      "Liverpool didn’t look close to winning against us in the Carabao Cup final. Both teams had pretty much full strength teams out, so no injury excuses. Are you telling me that this Liverpool team, plus a couple of new signings are so good, they’ve already won the league next season?",
      "Salah and Van Dijk are 33, you’ve extended their contracts. They both struggled in the 2nd half of the season. Can you win the league with olds? Most clubs are looking to sell their old players, but Liverpool have kept them on. They had the most Premier League penalties last season (9) and conceded the 2nd least (2). Salah’s figures are boosted by these pens. Van Dijk was lucky with many decisions, where he could’ve had straight reds.",
      "So, well done for last season Liverpool, truly well deserved. But next season? I wouldn’t be so sure.\nSimon S, Cheshire",

      "The England international decided to leave the Red Devils after butting heads with Ruben Amorim over his poor training performances and attitude.",

      "It has also been widely reported that he is favouring a move to Barcelona, with a switch to the La Liga giants deemed his ‘dream’ transfer.",
      "Rashford’s improved form has attracted interest from Barcelona, who are in the market for a new winger, but his salary and Man Utd’s asking price are still obstacles.",
      "The forward was also recently dealt a further blow, with Barcelona stepping up their efforts to fend off competition from Bayern Munich and Arsenal to sign Nico Williams from Athletic Bilbao.",
      "Williams’ anticipated move to Barcelona had been expected to end Rashford’s hopes of joining Hansi Flick’s side, but a report from The Guardian claims they are ‘keen on a loan move even if’ the Spain international ‘arrives’.",

The Algerian felt he had a gentleman’s agreement that would allow him to walk proudly out of the door in summer 2017 but the Foxes were unmoved.",

      "When Arsenal needed a Proper Striker it was decided by Mikel Arteta that a sort of centre-forward would do, even though he was signed as Granit Xhaka’s midfield successor at the time.

      "",
      "2) Declan Rice – £100m rising to £105m (West Ham to Arsenal, July 2023)\nArsenal played an absolute blinder in laying the groundwork before keeping the bidding at a controlled level. Manchester City made one offer and promptly withdrew from the race upon its rejection, leaving the Gunners with a clear track.",

      "Pep Guardiola has reportedly asked Manchester City to include Jack Grealish in a deal for a Real Madrid superstar in order to lower the price of the deal.",
      "Chelsea have already directly replaced three transfer-listed players they are yet to sell this summer, with 10 stars available for £337.6m on their ways out.",
      "According to reports, Jack Grealish could join another Manchester City star in joining Everton this summer as Kyle Walker has ‘agreed a sensational’ move."

      "The player himself cited the owner’s “persistence” and a change in his circumstances with the imminent birth of his second young son as the key motivating factors behind the move.",
      "Milan president Silvio Berlusconi worded it slightly differently, saying that “his wife ordered him to London with their children where the fog will do their lungs the world of good”, and “when his wife shouts, he runs under the bed like a lap dog”.",
      "That presumably made for an awkward reunion when Shevchenko and his fog-filled lungs returned to Milan two years after he left for a loan which only further underlined how far he had fallen; the Ukrainian added two goals in 26 games to his glittering record with the Italian giants.",
      "Chelsea cut their considerable losses three years after making Shevchenko the most expensive footballer in British top-flight history, packing him back off to Dynamo Kyiv as a free transfer with as many Premier League goals as Gervinho in two more games.",

      "“You tell me what is wrong with Veron,” sounds more like a desperate plea to the bewildered journalists present than a defence of the Argentinean playmaker in retrospect.",
      "Sir Alex Ferguson would later write that ‘he was an individual’, a ‘free bird’, a ‘wildcard’ who ‘went wherever he liked’ and ‘just couldn’t play in our team’. If only Roy Keane hadn’t been there.",
      "",
      "16) Robinho – £32.5m, September 2008 (Real Madrid to Manchester City)\n“On the last day, Chelsea made a great proposal and I accepted,” said a clearly quite shell-shocked Robinho, the Blues having erroneously started to sell shirts with his name on the back before Manchester City marked their new takeover with a good old-fashioned transfer hijack.",
      "By the admission of manager Mark Hughes, there was also “probably a grain of truth in the rumour that Robinho thought he was actually signing for Manchester United”.",
      "But it was Manchester City the Brazilian blazed a trail for – for about three months. Robinho scored 12 of his 16 goals for the club between his arrival in September 2008 up to the end of that December, after which he soon faded from view before being completely phased out by Roberto Mancini.",
      "Manchester City made about half their money back within a couple of years but it required a helping hand from AC Milan.",

      "15) Enzo Fernandez – £106.8m, January 2023 (River Plate to Chelsea)\nThere is plenty of scope for Fernandez to improve his standing with Chelsea, the Argentinean having already overcome his first few injury and Pochettino-shaped hurdles at Stamford Bridge.",
      "This past season was the biggest step yet in the right direction as Fernandez established a more defined position, embraced a captaincy he should never have been awarded and inspired the Blues to Conference League glory.",
      "A little more is needed to justify an absurd outlay but the good news is that Fernandez has time to do it with seven years left on his contract.",
      "",
      "14) Stan Collymore – £8.5m, July 1995 (Nottingham Forest to Liverpool)\nFew could have expected that Collymore closing in would mark the peak of his record-breaking Liverpool move and arguably his trophyless professional playing career as a whole.",
      "The raw numbers are far from shameful: 35 goals and 16 assists in 81 appearances for the Reds, who almost broke even when Aston Villa signed him in May 1997.",
      "But the issues which would plague and ultimately prevent Collymore from realising his potential were already bubbling under the surface and the emergence of Michael Owen meant Liverpool quickly outgrew him.",
      "",
      "13) Paul Pogba – £93.9m, August 2016 (Juventus to Manchester United)\nIt might forever be the penultimate world-record transfer, considering just how ludicrously how the market-shattering bar was set by Paris Saint-Germain and Neymar a year later.",
      "At least the French giants recouped a healthy percentage of that fee back; Manchester United managed to let Pogba go to Juventus for free twice while spending what remains a club-record sum to sign him in between.",
      "There was a Europa League, League Cup and PFA Team of the Year place but viruses, haircuts, dancing and feuding with Graeme Souness – not all four with Souness, to be clear – defined most of a mutually disappointing six years.",

      "12) Moises Caicedo – £100m rising to £115m, August 2023 (Brighton to Chelsea)\nThe add-ons built into their embarrassing climbdown on Caicedo were described as eminently ‘achievable’. Some were related to European qualification with the rest thought to be tied to appearances.",
      "If winning the Conference League, reaching the Champions League and making 95 appearances for Chelsea has not triggered those extra payments then it is only a matter of time.",
      "It is entirely feasible that Caicedo ends up among the more illustrious names on this list. The 23-year-old has overcome some early teething problems to emerge as the all-action midfielder Chelsea thought they had signed and it is instructive how infrequently to fee is mentioned two years on.",
      "",
      "11) Rio Ferdinand – £18m, November 2000 (West Ham to Leeds)\nThe atrocity of a pundit has made it easy to forget the magnificence of the player. It is not worth thinking about how many times Ferdinand might have repeated ‘Ballon d’Or’ had he ever been able to egomaniacally watch himself from the stands instead of tapes of Phil Jagielka at his peak.",
      "Leeds paid £18m for 18 months which feel like a forgotten footnote in Ferdinand’s career, but it was the perfect snapshot of how the club, in the immortal words of Peter Ridsdale, “lived the dream”: they finished fourth and fifth in the Premier League and reached the Champions League semi-finals, Ferdinand himself scoring in a win over Deportivo in the quarters.",
      "“I’m satisfied I’ve done the best job for Leeds United,” said Ridsdale with no hint of sarcasm of self-awareness when explaining the sale of Ferdinand to a bitter rival soon after. “If you invest £18m and get £30m you’ve done a good job,” he added. Leeds supporters might disagree.",
      "",
      "10) Fernando Torres – £50m, January 2011 (Liverpool to Chelsea)\nIf bringing Gary Neville to climax at the Nou Camp automatically qualifies any signing as a success then Torres can look back on his Chelsea career with immense pride.",
      "The Spaniard won three trophies with the Blues and played a significant part in the capture of each, so likely does not carry around the baggage of Stamford Bridge failure many have tried to saddle him with.",
      "But it is startling that he both played 30 more games for Chelsea than he did Liverpool, and scored 36 fewer goals. Torres crammed nine goals into his final half-season with the Reds before moving in the winter of 2011; in his best league campaign for the Blues he only found the net eight times.",
      "",
      "9) Chris Sutton – £5m, July 1994 (Norwich to Blackburn)\nAnother whose punditry present masks a playing past, Sutton was good enough to become the highest-paid player in the Premier League for a time as the title-unlocking foil for Alan Shearer.",
      "The 25 goals Sutton plundered in a Norwich title challenge which quickly faded remained his best career return in a season including even his Celtic stint, but that contribution to Blackburn’s ascent to the English top-flight throne was crucial.",
      "",
      "8) Jack Grealish – £100m, August 2021 (Aston Villa to Manchester City)\nAs eager as Manchester City are to write off their record signing four years after heartlessly plucking the free spirit from Aston Villa and meticulously teaching him how to pass backwards, it is important to remember what Grealish has achieved at the Etihad.",
      "Only seven teammates played more minutes in their Treble season and just six supplied more goals and assists as Grealish was made the headline star of the celebrations, backing up his objective when leaving Villa Park: to “have as many winner’s medals as possible”.",
      "Another Premier League title has since been added alongside a Super Cup and Club World Cup, but the more peripheral role Grealish played in those successes has only served to see him pushed out of the door entirely.",
      "",
      "7) Ruud van Nistelrooy – £19m, July 2001 (PSV to Manchester United)\n“This signing demonstrates that Manchester United are a force in Europe,” said Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon of a deal Ferguson hoped would fill the club’s transfer remit of “improving the team by one or two per cent every year”.",
      "Manchester United had won the Premier League title three seasons in a row but followed up Champions League glory in 1999 with a pair of quarter-final exits to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, so the explicit reason for bringing in Van Nistelrooy could only have been to push them past that continental barrier.",
      "Yet in Van Nistelrooy’s five seasons at Old Trafford, the club’s Champions League performance in chronological order – semi-final, quarter-final, last 16, last 16 and group-stage exits – coincided with the Dutchman scoring well over a goal every other game even with injuries.",
      "A record of 150 goals in 219 appearances underlined his individual brilliance but it was eventually decided that it came at the overall expense of the team, especially when your Cristiano Ronaldos and the Wayne Rooneys of this world started to blossom.",
      "",
      "6) Alan Shearer – £3.6m, July 1992 (Southampton to Blackburn)\nShearer “felt the time was right to come to Blackburn” and few could have argued with his logic. With his choice of clubs as a 22-year-old coming off the back of a 20-goal season with Southampton, he sensed a shift in the sands with Jack Walker’s 1991 takeover.",
      "Rovers had secured promotion under Kenny Dalglish and Shearer was earmarked as the ideal signing. In four seasons at Ewood Park he scored 130 goals in 171 games, delivering the Premier League title.",
      "And the time was right for him to leave Blackburn when he did too; Shearer’s 31 goals were only good enough for 7th place in 1995/96 when he cashed in on his stock to secure his next move, and Rovers were relegated three years later.",
      "",
      "5) Andy Cole – £7m, January 1995 (Newcastle to Manchester United)\nA transfer so controversial Kevin Keegan felt compelled to defend it to fans on the steps of St James’ Park, Cole himself can have no regrets.",
      "After 68 goals in 84 matches for Newcastle were only good for third place and some early cup exits, a breakdown in the relationship between Cole and Keegan meant their productive union was, in the player’s own words, “a bit of borrowed time”.",
      "The optics were uncomfortable for Newcastle in selling to the enemy, but Cole made the most of his opportunity with five Premier League titles, two FA Cups – including one final won against the Magpies – and a Champions League.",
      "",
      "4) Alan Shearer – £15m, July 1996 (Blackburn to Newcastle)\nManchester United fans have spent the best part of the subsequent two decades imploring Shearer to cheer up and reminding him of the preposterous probably trophy haul he rejected not once but twice, but the all-time record Premier League scorer has always denied any regret he might have at joining the handful of world-class players to turn down Old Trafford and Ferguson.",
      "Some might still see it as a hollow coping mechanism but for Shearer, the honour of becoming his boyhood club’s greatest ever scorer outweighs what he could have achieved at Manchester United.",
      "And a dressing room containing both him and Roy Keane might well have imploded anyway.",
      "",
      "3) Dennis Bergkamp – £7.5m, June 1995 (Inter to Arsenal)\n“I would have taken Stan Collymore ahead of Bergkamp, even for £1million more. Liverpool have got a better deal than Arsenal,” will forever stand as one of the great early Premier League quotes.",
      "Stuart Pearce, then still playing for Nottingham Forest, went on to say “the odds” were “loaded against” Bergkamp “making any kind of impression in an Arsenal shirt” under a newspaper headline of ‘BERGY’S A WASTE OF MONEY’.",
      "Seven goalless games seemed to back up the assertion that Arsenal had been fleeced when tripling their club-record transfer, but the Dutchman was soon flying on a route which would take him to six trophies, 120 goals and his very own statue.",
      "",
      "2) Rio Ferdinand – £29.3m, July 2002 (Leeds to Manchester United)\nIf signing Veron the previous year represented a gargantuan risk Manchester United could nevertheless afford, preying on the financial difficulties at Leeds to poach Ferdinand was anything but.",
      "A 23-year-old with more than 180 career Premier League appearances to go with extensive international and Champions League experience was as close to a guarantee of prosperity as possible – and one of the best examples of a transfer ‘policy’ the club have revived.",
      "The David Moyes season was regrettable and made Morgan Amalfitano seem like the world’s greatest player for a couple of minutes, but six Premier League titles and a Champions League speak for themselves.",
      "",
      "1) Roy Keane – £3.75m, June 1993 (Nottingham Forest to Manchester United)\nIt does not feel likely that a relegated player could prompt a British record transfer chase in the modern day but the culmination of the inaugural Premier League season saw future title rivals Blackburn and Manchester United engage in their first true battle.",
      "Rovers would have won if their negotiations were concluded earlier on that fateful Friday afternoon. But with no-one in the office at Ewood Park to sort the paperwork, Ferguson swooped with a classic hijack.",
      "The Scot might never have made a more important signing; it provided the foundations for glory which spanned generations, Keane leaving on typically bitter terms well over a decade later armed with seven Premier League titles, a Champions League and numerous other trinkets to potentially stick up Mick McCarthy’s arse or bollocks.",
      "Liverpool will hope Alexander Isak can become one of the finest signings made by a Premier League champion, but Manchester United will take some budging.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has claimed that the striker he “wants” the Red Devils to sign is “waiting” for a move to Old Trafford.",
      "Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has set a Premier League “finish” target for head coach Ruben Amorim heading into next season.",
      "Man Utd legend Rio Ferdinand insists that Sporting CP striker Viktor Gyokeres is not “the guy” to score goals for the Red Devils next season.",
      "Roy Keane has tipped an England player to be “fuming” at manager Thomas Tuchel for the role he gave him in the Three Lions’ 3-1 loss to Senegal on Tuesday.",
      "Roy Keane singled out one England player for being “lazy” during the Three Lions’ 3-1 defeat to Senegal in an international friendly match."

      "Football kits are no longer just football kits. There are now so many of them, with pretty much every team releasing at least three brand new ones – plus goalkeeper efforts – every single season.",
      "The actual inspiration for these kits is as it always was, of course: to separate fans from their hard-earned. But it’s absolutely vital that nobody directly involved ever say that quiet part out loud.",
      "And with prices ever increasing – 85 quid for a ‘replica’ now appears to be the industry standard for a short-sleeve adult shirt – alongside the physical number of new shirts, more and more convoluted justification is now required.",
      "Every kit is now inspired by something that definitely isn’t billionaires getting their hands on your 85 pounds, no. As football clubs grow ever less tethered to their immediate surroundings, so kits become more and more ‘inspired’ by their ‘iconic’ stadium or city or shopping centre.",
      "It’s all complete guff and like so much about football we hate-love it enormously. It’s yet another thing that was on our list of things that we definitely don’t care about, thanks, that we’ve now written yet another 1000 words about. No, you shut up.",
      "Here are the top five best/worst examples so far this year, bearing in mind there are loads more of these things to come yet with new-kit season really only a few weeks old at this point.",
      "",
      "5) Chelsea home",
      "Celebrate the storied history of the club and the ever-evolving, vibrant spirit of London with Chelsea FC’s 2025-26 Home kit. This replica jersey features classic Chelsea blue and a subtle print inspired by the city’s architecture. Inspired by London’s iconic landmarks and creative culture. The very fabric of London is in the Chelsea blue fabric.",
      "Inspired by London and its culture and its vibrant spirit and its architecture and its iconic London iconic landmarks and iconic architecture that is so very iconic. Made in Georgia.",
      "Also scores more general points for obeying one of the ancient laws of the press release, which is to include a capital letter on a random word where it has no business being. Step forward, ‘Home’. The clumsy, unrhythmic repetition of ‘fabric’ in that pay-off line another absolute treat.",
      "The Fabric of London, woven into every thread.",

      "4) Manchester United home",
      "The stadium in every stitch. The new Home kit features an abstract sleeve graphic inspired by the Theatre of Dreams. Few sporting stages can match the drama Manchester United’s iconic home ground has generated over the years. So this adidas jersey pays tribute to the stadium in which it will be starring in 25/26 with a “Theatre of Dreams” sign-off and abstract Old Trafford-inspired graphics on the sleeves.",
      "Football kit PR writers avoid using the word ‘iconic’ challenge: impossible. It cannot be done. There will never again exist a football kit that is just a football kit without ‘drawing inspiration from’ some ‘iconic’ time or place or thing.",

      "We’re also just fundamentally not sure on any level that in big 2025 any new Man United thing should be tying itself too directly to Old Trafford, a ground now infamously and visibly past its prime with a leaky roof and fading paintwork. It doesn’t scream pristine long-lasting garment worth 85 of your hard-earned pounds.",

      "Also crowingly self-dubbed a ‘London masterpiece’ – which is surely not for Chelsea themselves to say – this kit ‘continues’ a celebration of excellence by making the first reference to it in over 50 years for no real apparent reason beyond someone somewhere flicking through old Chelsea kits to find one to be inspired by/rip off that hadn’t already been done yet. Magnificent guff.",

      "2) Aston Villa away",
      "On away days, this Aston Villa FC jersey reminds players and fans of their home city. The print on its raglan sleeves was inspired by the striking facade of a world-famous Birmingham landmark.",
      "The best bit here is deeming said landmark to be so world-famous it doesn’t even need to be named, which we’re going to go right ahead and assume is some kind of convoluted legal issue involving copyright or naming rights or somesuch that probably involved multiple back-and-forths, 27 Teams meetings, 164 emails and 73 rewrites before they settled on just how clearly they could hint at it.",
      "You know they’re treading carefully when the source of a kit’s inspiration isn’t even described as iconic. But obviously it’s the Bullring. Even if you haven’t seen the kit you already know it’s the Bullring. If it’s Birmingham it’s always the Bullring. Specifically that shiny wavy bit with all silver circles on it with a Selfridges in.",
      "And in fairness, unlike most of these inspirations, you can actually see what they mean on the kit. No ‘abstract’ cheats or ‘subtle nods’ here, except in the press release itself.",

      "1) Tottenham away",
      "Tottenham Hotspur’s 2025-26 away shirt welcomes you to match day in the year 2082. This London-inspired battle armour uses tonal blacks and cutting-edge trims to create an innovative, stealthy look that the enemy won’t see coming.",
      "The trophies just keep coming for Spurs. First the Europa League, then the Harshest But Probably Correct In The Cold Light Of Day Sacking trophy, and now the Most Egregious Kit Launch Bullshit award. The trophy cabinet is positively bulging these days.",
      "Just as well, too. We don’t know but we assume the layers of approval this kind of assault on the English language has to negotiate mean initial sign-off on that astonishing pair of sentences probably happened months ago, meaning Spurs are unbelievably lucky not to have left themselves as wide open as their defence to the easiest of ‘and the trophy drought goes on’ banters with that batsh*t bit about 2082.",
      "We very much enjoy the fact that even though it has now been 30 years since black ceased to be the preserve of referees, and that Spurs themselves had a black away kit over 10 years ago now, and that somewhere close to half the Premier League appears to have a black away or third kit this season that Tottenham and/or Nike adorably appear to be believe it is nevertheless some wildly unimaginable futuristic flourish that will baffle and astonish.",
      "Of course it’s ‘London-inspired’ because every kit this season apparently comes with such geographical influence as standard for your 85 pounds, but we are entirely unsure what precisely about this football kit qualifies it as so inspired, or indeed as ‘battle armour’. It appears to possess as few protective qualities as any other recycled polyester weave.",
      "And this apparent ‘stealth’ mode sounds ominously like it could be a bit self-defeating in a Man United grey kit fashion.",
      "We like the idea of ‘tonal blacks’, but this does feel like a missed opportunity to go full Spinal Tap. It’s a pastel black. And how much more black and London-inspired could it be? And the answer is none. None… more black and London-inspired.",

      "Manchester United have suffered two of the greatest market value decreases of Premier League players this year, but one team owns four of the top 10.",
      "These are the greatest decreases in market value since January 1 of players contracted to Premier League clubs, with figures taken from Transfermarkt.",
      "",
      "10) Joel Ndala (Manchester City)\nIt could still be that Ndala is soon entered into the Manchester City cheat code as the 19-year-old is yet to make his debut for the club he joined aged 10.",
      "But if this past season was designed to mark his professional breakthrough after forming part of the travelling Etihad squad for the 2023 Club World Cup and winning the 2024 FA Youth Cup final, the plan went awry somewhere along the line.",
      "A loan to PSV with an £8.4m option to buy went so well that Manchester City cancelled it in February to send Ndala to Nottingham Forest with the same clause, only this time worth £4m.",
      "That rather neatly captures the fall in value suffered by the forward, who will be stuck this summer until Manchester City get around to sorting new temporary homes for those players who have fallen through the cracks between the Academy and the first team.",
      "",
      "9) Deivid Washington (Chelsea)\n“Leaving was God’s plan. I wanted to stay at Santos, but I spoke to my parents and had the chance to go to Chelsea. We chose together. God spoke to me and we went to Chelsea,” said Washington in a risible endorsement of the divine one’s work as an agent earlier this year.",
      "The Brazilian forward is right to put his own personal slant and transparently brave face on things but if “God’s plan” as a footballer ever involves being signed for £14m, making three substitute appearances of a combined 25 minutes and being sent back to your former club within 18 months with five years remaining on your contract with the team which has clearly forgotten about your existence and bought a handful more younger players in your position, then God has messed up.",
      "“It was not a mistake,” Washington continued to insist as he slowly shrank and transformed into a corn cob, having scored one goal in 14 games back at Santos. “I left when I had to leave and came back when I had to come back,” he added, summing up the life of a Chelsea player destined to be loaned out about seven more times before his deal expires.",
      "",
      "8) Adrian Mazilu (Brighton)\nBrighton are far from above speculating to accumulate. The key difference which separates them from most in the transfer market is how phenomenal they are at it.",
      "But there are no cast-iron guarantees in player identification and recruitment; Brighton’s impressive hit-rate only means the chances of them developing the next Moises Caicedo or Alexis Mac Allister rather than Valentin Barco or Abdallah Sima’s successor is akin to a coin flip.",
      "Mazilu has fallen by that wayside hard. An exciting January 2024 signing made in advance, the Romanian forward was sent on an immediate loan to Vitesse as Brighton turned the tables and copied Chelsea’s homework.",
      "With opportunities difficult to come by in the Eredivisie, it was instead decided that Mazilu would spend this past season under the watchful eye of the Seagulls, who perhaps did not expect for him to suffer a foreboding hamstring injury and myriad recovery setbacks which have sidelined him until this summer.",
      "When Mazilu is introduced back into the fold, it won’t be as part of the first team. But it will be with three years left on his contract.",
      "",
      "7) Kendry Paez (Chelsea)\nNothing sums BlueCo Chelsea up quite like two of Mauricio Pochettino’s first ‘signings’ as manager: a player bought during the reign of his predecessor; and a player whose pre-arranged purchase means he will make his debut for the club under the Argentinean’s successor.",
      "Paez might consider his £17.27m move from Independiente del Valle to be a triumph if he makes it as far as actually playing for Enzo Maresca, who confirmed that the teenager had belatedly joined them on Club World Cup duty in the United States this summer after some confusion.",
      "But with that came a familiar harbinger of bomb squad ruin. “We’ll see what the plan is in the next few weeks,” said the head coach, who will presumably spend that time perfecting his phrasing of ‘You ever heard of Strasbourg, fella?’.",
      "",
      "6) Facundo Buonanotte (Brighton)\nEven with some eye-catching performances on loan, that filthy Leicester brush was bound to tar Buonanotte.",
      "Brighton had stockpiled more than enough talent to afford to send some down the Premier League food chain last season. Ipswich borrowed Julio Enciso, West Ham were loaned Evan Ferguson, Buonanotte was posted to Leicester and Southampton were left wondering what they’d done wrong.",
      "Buonanotte impressed in bursts as one of the bigger fish in a small and cursed pond, but also incited the fury of Ruud van Nistelrooy after one particularly wasteful substitute appearance and only featured infrequently thereafter.",
      "",
      "5) Alejandro Garnacho (Manchester United)\nIt feels like Manchester United would take that £40m if offered again. It doesn’t bear thinking about how many people Sir Jim Ratcliffe would be willing to make redundant for Napoli to pick up the phone and start things where they left off in January.",
      "“You better pray that you can find a club to sign you,” Ruben Amorim told Garnacho in front of his Manchester United teammates at the end of the season, yet a willing buyer was right there in the winter to answer that invocation.",
      "The way Garnacho and his team have systematically decimated his value in a matter of months is almost impressive. A 20-year-old Argentina international forward who trailed just Bruno Fernandes, Noussair Mazraoui and Diogo Dalot for outfield minutes at Manchester United last season – and only Fernandes for goals – sounds entirely worthy of that £60m valuation.",
      "But it is preposterous considering his ostracisation under this manager is painfully public knowledge, Garnacho’s reaction to which has involved taking some increasingly childish measures specifically designed to court controversy.",
      "",
      "4) Kobbie Mainoo (Manchester United)\nThere will be no rival shirts worn with the name of a similarly exiled teammate pointedly emblazoned on the back, no habitual middle finger deployment at the sign of a camera, no agent-based buffoonery.",
      "But the fall of Mainoo from teenage midfield sensation to an injury-prone potential sale with no fixed position needs to be studied and proves how deep the toxicity at Old Trafford runs.",
      "Amorim is yet to establish where he feels Mainoo best fits into his system. The England international has been trialled in more defensive roles and as a centre-forward but it is yet to click for player or manager.",
      "The idea Manchester United could still generate £150m from offloading both Mainoo and Garnacho feels absurd but a decision must be made as to whether they rehabilitate the former themselves or let someone else pay a knockdown fee for the honour.",
      "",
      "3) Ibrahim Osman (Brighton)\n“When you perform at Brighton, you get to play. That’s why I chose Brighton,” said Osman recently, having had neither the chance to perform nor play on the coast.",
      "Brighton announced Osman’s signing from Nordsjaelland in February 2024 and sent him on loan to Feyenoord by that August in the hope it would provide some extra seasoning, including Champions League experience.",
      "The Ghanaian forward received precisely that, even starting and impressing against runners-up Inter in the knockouts.",
      "The expectation from Brighton might have been for Osman to start more than six Eredivisie games before returning but three goals and assists apiece for the country’s third-best team suggested there is a player for Fabian Hurzeler to work with if he so wishes.",
      "",
      "2) Luis Guilherme (West Ham)\nAs a £25.5m signing from Palmeiras, Luis Guilherme might have foreseen an easier path to the West Ham first team.",
      "A Brazilian teenager living and playing outside of his home country for the first time, the winger would have accepted a period of acclimatisation was necessary.",
      "But his 13 appearances for the Hammers last season were spread out across 139 underwhelming minutes under two different managers, neither of whom seemed to know what to do with former Liverpool target Guilherme. It doesn’t feel like Graham Potter will have learned over the course of the summer.",
      "",
      "1) Evan Ferguson (Brighton)\nThe West Ham curse is real, although again it is ultimately Brighton whose model has harmed some players as much as it has helped others.",
      "An ankle ligament injury requiring surgery did the most damage to Ferguson’s stratospheric ascent through the ranks and onto that most inevitable of places for a thriving teenage goalscorer: the transfer shortlists of Chelsea and Manchester United.",
      "But managerial changes and the club’s general shift away from a style of play which more suited Ferguson has seen him crash to maybe fifth in the centre-forward pecking order.",
      "Brighton felt they had a £100m asset and for a time they probably did, but one goal in his last 44 games across all competitions has seen Ferguson’s stock fall as hard as it rose.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho’s latest juvenile act won’t endear him to any coach who might have been tempted to take a punt on a player Manchester United desperately need shot of…",
      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",
      "Alejandro Garnacho’s latest antics have seen him labelled a ‘little dope’ in need of a ‘clip around the ear’ by one prominent football pundit.",
      "A Manchester United transfer reportedly hinges on one condition, while a Red Devils star has been pictured wearing the shirt of a rival Premier League club.",
      "Napoli newbie Kevin De Bruyne has reportedly requested a ‘reunion’ with one of his former Manchester City teammates in a ‘blow’ for Manchester United.",
      "Chelsea are targeting eight players for two positions, including four Premier League stars, to revamp Maresca’s attack as Mudryk faces a four-year ban."

      "According to reports, Manchester United have made an outrageous demand for winger Alejandro Garnacho, who is attracting interest from Chelsea.",
      "The Blues have been heavily linked with Garnacho over the past six months as he’s been an option for Enzo Maresca’s side since the January transfer window.",
      "In January, Man Utd opened the door to Garnacho leaving as they looked to sanction pure profit sales to balance the books, but they are currently actively looking to offload their academy product.",
      "This follows his major fallout with head coach Ruben Amorim, who has reportedly told Garnacho to ‘find a new club’ after he spat his dummy out following Man Utd’s loss to Spurs in the Europa League final.",
      "Garnacho endured a disappointing campaign in 2024/25 as the talented winger was often infuriating to watch as he was consistently wasteful in the final third.",
      "The Argentina international is also unsuited to Amorim’s preferred 3-4-3 formation as he has struggled to adapt to the No.10 role. He slipped in the pecking order during the run-in and only made a 20-minute cameo off the bench in the Europa League final.",
      "READ: Every Man Utd signing post-Sir Alex ranked: Sancho, Antony bottom five, Ronaldo 7th; Mbeumo next?",
      "Garnacho subsequently hit out at Man Utd’s sh*t season and has recently further alienated himself, posing in a Aston Villa shirt with Marcus Rashford’s name on the back.",
      "Now, a report from The Telegraph confirms Chelsea are still in the running to sign Garnacho, as they and Man Utd are ‘weighing up’ deals for the winger and Christopher Nkunku.",
      "The report adds:",
      "‘Nkunku and Garnacho both want to quit their respective clubs and the prospect of them trading places has not been ruled out, although there is no expectation of a swap deal being negotiated.",
      "‘Separate transfers involving Nkunku and Garnacho moving in opposite directions would solve headaches for both United and Chelsea, but the clubs are yet to hold direct talks on the matter this summer.’",
      "The Athletic have provided more details on Garnacho’s situation, as he’s decided that a move to London is at the ‘top of his list’ of options.",
      "Chelsea are mentioned as an option, but Man Utd’s huge demand for Garnacho has ruled out a move to Bayer Leverkusen. The report adds:",
      "‘A price of £70million has been communicated to suitors, which is too high for Bayer Leverkusen.",
      "‘The German side had been linked, with their head coach Erik ten Hag having brought Garnacho through to the first team while in charge at Old Trafford, but they will not be pursuing an approach at that cost.’",
      "Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Antony are also expected to leave Man Utd this summer, with the report claiming the latter’s potential exit is the ‘most advanced’ as ‘Real Betis wishes to turn his loan move into a permanent transfer’.",

      "Bryan Mbeumo will almost definitely be taking a step down to complete his dream move to Manchester United, and few have done so at greater expense.",
      "Brentford forward Mbeumo has reportedly expressed his preference to join Ruben Amorim’s side and is unmoved by them being utter sh*te.",
      "He will not be the first to do so, nor the most expensive at around £60m. But he will find himself among these, the biggest ever signings involving a player joining a club lower in the Premier League.",
      "",
      "N’Golo Kante – £32m in July 2016",
      "From: Leicester (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (10th)",
      "It is not often a player can leave the popular, newly-crowned miracle champions for a loathed mid-table team with barely an eyebrow raised or an unkind word spoken. But the combination of Kante’s inherent likeability and the Freaky Friday scenario Leicester and Chelsea found themselves locked in a decade ago led to one of the strangest yet most straightforward transfers imaginable.",
      "Chelsea, at the start of their rebuild under Antonio Conte, faced basically no competition for very possibly the best player of the previous season, although Arsene Wenger inevitably fluttered his eyelashes and PSG sniffed around.",
      "Eight players moved to Premier League teams for bigger fees than Chelsea paid Leicester for Kante in the same summer. Arsenal spent more on Granit Xhaka, Spurs invested as much on Moussa Sissoko and Manchester United paid about three times more for Paul Pogba. Phenomenal work from all involved.",
      "",
      "Alex Iwobi – £34m in August 2019",
      "From: Arsenal (5th)\nTo: Everton (8th)",
      "Marco Silva kept a straight face when describing Iwobi as “one of our main targets”, despite the Toffees having to rush through a move in the final two hours of the 2019 transfer window after finally abandoning their summer-long pursuit of Wilfried Zaha.",
      "Iwobi’s future was intrinsically linked to that of the Crystal Palace talisman either way. The Nigerian said he would have to consider leaving Arsenal if Zaha joined the Gunners due to the added “stress” of competing for places, with that pressure enough to evoke panic even when it was only Nicolas Pepe who moved to north London.",
      "Everton had finished 16 points behind Arsenal but in the midst of a period of lavish spending reached up the table to make Iwobi the third-most expensive player in their history at the time.",
      "The gap was actually closed to seven points in 2019/20, with Iwobi a late substitute in an abysmal game watched from the stands by incoming managers Mikel Arteta and Carlo Ancelotti.",
      "",
      "Lewis Hall – £35m in July 2024",
      "From: Chelsea (6th)\nTo: Newcastle (7th)",
      "A slightly different case, Hall’s marriage with Newcastle was arranged when the Magpies were eight places higher than Chelsea, but by the time that loan was made permanent a year later the Blues were one position and three points ahead.",
      "It is unknown whether or indeed how many of the £7m add-ons included in the deal have been triggered, but more than 50 appearances, an actual trophy and a couple of England caps might leave Champions League qualification as the only box left unticked.",
      "",
      "Juan Mata – £37.1m in January 2014",
      "From: Chelsea (3rd)\nTo: Manchester United (7th)",
      "While Manchester United were officially Premier League champions for a little under four more soul-sapping months, their star had already fallen by the time Mata’s helicopter landed at Carrington.",
      "David Moyes welcomed the Spaniard with unsurprisingly open arms, hoping he could galvanise his fading first season at Old Trafford as Manchester United sat seventh, a point clear of Newcastle.",
      "Chelsea were third at the time the deal went through, much to the chagrin of Wenger. “Some teams have already played twice against one opponent and some others not. I think if you want to respect the fairness for everybody exactly the same, that should not happen.”",
      "He would loan Kim Kallstrom later that month in protest.",
      "Mata, on the other hand, will probably forever remain the top scorer of Ryan Giggs’ entire career as a club manager.",
      "",
      "Nemanja Matic – £40m in July 2017\nFrom: Chelsea (1st)\nTo: Manchester United (6th)",
      "The first of a great many awkward midfield keys signed to unlock Paul Pogba, it was Matic who Jose Mourinho described as having “everything he wants in a footballer” in what was presumably intended as a compliment but is actually a damning indictment beyond about 2015.",
      "Conte was furious and for once entirely justified as Chelsea used the funds to restock their cupboards with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater before Ross Barkley arrived in January.",
      "The Blues fell to fifth in what amounted to a solid title defence considering their previous efforts, beating Manchester United in the FA Cup final after Mourinho secured his self-identified greatest achievement of finishing second to Manchester City and waiting patiently for the title to be reallocated years later.",
      "",
      "Cole Palmer – £42.5m in September 2023",
      "From: Manchester City (1st)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "Enough steaming missiles have been launched at the walls of Stamford Bridge, Cobham and any other property Chelsea have sold to themselves over the years for some to stick. Yet Palmer is still probably the one unqualified success story for Clearlake’s recruitment strategy.",
      "How wasteful it would have been had he heard Pep Guardiola out and decided to stay at Manchester City on the promise of a steady increase in minutes. Palmer felt he was already better than the 13 starts afforded to him in two seasons as a first-teamer and backed himself for a lead role elsewhere instead of playing a part in a supporting cast.",
      "Chelsea provided that platform and their sole regret will be that Palmer’s contract only runs for another eight years.",
      "",
      "Kyle Walker – £53m in July 2017",
      "From: Tottenham (2nd)\nTo: Manchester City (3rd)",
      "The game went in the summer of 2017 and Walker was held responsible by many.",
      "The mere concept of a full-back being sold for upwards of £50m caused a thousand think-pieces about the sport’s spiralling finances, followed by weeks of introspection as everyone pondered what part they had played in this and how they could possibly have stopped it.",
      "Kyle Walker. £50m. Entire heads fell off across the country.",
      "Forgotten in the ensuing madness was the fact that Walker had ostensibly taken a step down. He helped Tottenham claim the Put The Pressure On Cup, securing his place in the PFA Team of the Year in the process, before being dropped by Mauricio Pochettino for the FA Cup semi-final, a north London derby and a match with Manchester United. Those seven minutes in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane in May 2017 happened to mark Walker’s last in a Spurs shirt.",
      "The right-back joined Manchester City that summer – for £50m! – and immediately explained that he moved to a team which finished eight points behind Spurs and was knocked out in the last 16 of the Champions League in Pep Guardiola’s debut trophyless season “to go on and pick up silverware”.",
      "Walker will leave the Etihad this summer with 17 winner’s medals in eight years. Listen, fair play.",
      "",
      "Moises Caicedo – £115m in August 2023",
      "From: Brighton (6th)\nTo: Chelsea (12th)",
      "The Liverpool copium was remarkably strong when their ambitious midfield transfer overhaul was slightly undermined by the panicked £111m bid Chelsea duly hijacked with a £115m offer of their own shortly after.",
      "Their frustration and consternation was broadly understandable. Chelsea had just finished in the bottom half under Frank Lampard in what was until recently an unthinkably embarrassing crash through the glass ceiling the Big Six clubs installed long ago; there are two Europa League finalists who would take 12th right now.",
      "Liverpool were far from the peak of their powers, finishing fifth and suffering early exits from the three knockout competitions, but they had Jurgen Klopp and a clear plan moving forward.",
      "That centered around the midfield and when Jude Bellingham proved one immutable Real Madrid truth, the money the Reds put aside was thrown in the general direction of Caicedo. Brighton, who ended the 2022/23 just a place behind Liverpool, were happy enough to watch the auction unfold and escalate.",
      "Alexander Isak almost certainly won’t leave Newcastle for Liverpool but if he does, he will join the legion of £50m transfers between Premier League clubs.",
      "Mo Salah’s 29 goals and 18 assists make him an overwhelming favourite to pick up his third award.",
      "We’ve reassigned some of the Premier League’s most notable bomb squad players to new homes – including three Man City cast-offs and Marcus Rashford.",
      "Chelsea signed Ipswich striker Liam Delap in the summer, and it’s already been noted by Micah Richards how he’ll link up “very well” with Cole Palmer after their first match ...",
      "Former Everton CEO Keith Wyness has suggested the club need to get “heating allowance for pensioners” in one position after a report surfaced suggesting an ageing Manchester City star was ...",

      "51) Harry Maguire (£78.3m) (41)\nOften the scapegoat and always mocked, the former Man Utd captain has put in many good displays for the club. However, the bad outweighs the good and as a result, he has not even come close to nearly justifying his hefty price tag.",
      "",
      "50) Tom Heaton (free) (29)\nSee Lee Grant. But Heaton was a free transfer.",
      "",
      "49) Dan James (£16m) (24)\nJames was never good enough for Man Utd and was probably only signed as he was seen as Young And Hungry. The best thing to come from his move is that they turned a rare profit when they sold him to Leeds United.",
      "",
      "48) Mason Mount (£55.4m) (22)\nHe cost an absolute fortune with only a year left on his Chelsea contract and even when fit, he has been very underwhelming.",
      "We all know the ability Mount possesses but we have not seen it since 2022, which is quite a while ago.",
      "",
      "47) Eric Bailly (£34m) (22)\nErratic and amusing, Bailly was signed for big money and was more of a comical than he was convincing at defending. Injuries didn’t help him, to be fair.",
      "",
      "46) Romelu Lukaku (£76m) (35)\nHe scored a decent amount of goals but didn’t do enough to merit a £76m transfer fee.",
      "",
      "45) Tahith Chong (free) (17)\nHaving paid no transfer fee for the young Dutch winger, Man Utd looked like they did pretty well. He didn’t get much of a chance and was sold to Birmingham City for £1.5m after a successful year on loan before getting his chance in the Premier League with Luton Town, who he did quite well for.",
      "The Red Devils were right to sell Chong but definitely could have got more for him.",
      "",
      "44) Timothy Fosu-Mensah (£342k) (28)\nFosu-Mensah was pretty cheap and the club turned a profit in the end. He made 30 first-team appearances and was quite useful due to his versatility.",
      "",
      "43) Matteo Darmian (£16m) (27)\nThe Italian was bang average for United and was only sold for £2m.",
      "",
      "42) Marcos Rojo (£18m) (25)\nOften erratic, Rojo was box office at times but had an average spell at Old Trafford.",
      "",
      "41) Wout Weghorst (£2.6m loan fee) (23)\nWeghorst came in to fill a gap between January and June 2023 and was signed for peanuts, unlike Ighalo. Even still, it was a weird spell for everyone involved.",
      "",
      "40) Henrikh Mkhitaryan (£37.8m) (21)\nThe other half of the worst deal on this list, Mkhitaryan joined with lofty expectations having provided 90 goal contributions in 140 games for Borussia Dortmund.",
      "He scored in a Europa League final victory for United. He also scored a scorpion kick (that would not have counted in the VAR era). Anything good he did for the club was eclipsed by the woeful swap deal which saw him go to Arsenal.",
      "",
      "39) Hannibal Mejbri (£9m) (18)\nBought from Monaco in 2019, Mejbri spent the 22/23 campaign on loan at Birmingham and wasted the second half of last season on loan at Sevilla. He is now at Burnley in the Championship.",
      "",
      "38) Nemanja Matic (£40m) (23)\nMan Utd signed Matic four years too late.",
      "",
      "37) Facundo Pellistri (£7.6m) (20)\nThere was plenty of faith in Pellistri to come good at Old Trafford but not enough apparently. He joined Panathinaikos for around £5m in the summer.",
      "",
      "36) Rasmus Hojlund (£64.7m) (17)\nIt’s make or break for Hojlund next season…if he’s still at the club.",
      "",
      "35) Tyrell Malacia (£13m) (15)\nMalacia quickly shifted Luke Shaw out of the starting XI before generously giving his spot back to the England international. Not a good signing, even for the price.",
      "",
      "34) Joshua Zirkzee (£36.5m) (26)\nZirkzee has had a horrible time of it since moving to Old Trafford from Bologna last summer. Ruben Amorim hung him out to dry with his first-half substitution against Newcastle. He actually bounced back pretty well but it would be very generous to say he looks like he belongs.",
      "",
      "33) Daley Blind (£15.7m) (16)\nBlind was a handy player to have. Versatile, consistent, rarely outstanding. He played over 140 times in four years at Old Trafford and is currently thriving at Girona.",
      "",
      "32) Alex Telles (£13.5m) (14)\nTelles was decent when called upon but Erik ten Hag sent him out on loan to Sevilla in his first summer at Old Trafford. He joined Al Nassr permanently last July and is now playing for Botafogo.",
      "",
      "31) Marouane Fellaini (£29m) (26)\nFellaini was the first signing post-Ferguson after David Moyes bought him on deadline day for a higher price than the release clause that was active earlier in the window. He made 177 appearances for the Red Devils before leaving for Shandong Taishan in 2019.",
      "",
      "30) Anthony Martial (£54m) (12)\nMartial joined as the most expensive teenager in world football, scored a wonderful goal on his debut and was being compared to Thierry Henry. He scored 17 goals in 32 Premier League matches in 19/20 and looked like he was coming of age. After that terrific year, he looked slow and poor in front of goal.",
      "After an underwhelming loan spell at Sevilla, Ten Hag gave Martial another chance with his fitness letting him down. He joined AEK Athens on a free transfer in September.",
      "",
      "29) Sofyan Amrabat (£8.5m loan fee) (24)\nIf Amrabat played like he did in his last month at Old Trafford all season, he would be a lot higher.",
      "",
      "28) Victor Lindelof (£31.5m) (11)\nAnother expensive centre-half, Lindelof has not been a bad signing. But ‘not bad’ doesn’t really cut the mustard for Manchester United. After all, This Is Manchester United We’re Talking About. Leaving on a free transfer this summer. He’s so Turkish Super Lig, isn’t he?",
      "",
      "27) Patrick Dorgu (£25m) (NE)\nThe jury is most certainly out on this one.",
      "",
      "26) Manuel Ugarte (£42.3m) (23)\nA signing that looks amazing on paper, Ugarte is not up to speed yet.",
      "",
      "25) Aaron Wan-Bissaka (£49.5m) (40)\nWan-Bissaka was one of Erik ten Hag’s biggest success stories at Man Utd. The right-back enjoyed a very productive 22/23 campaign but was never able to usurp Diogo Dalot and his transfer fee will always look very silly.",
      "",
      "24) Matthijs de Ligt (£38.4m) (24)\nAjax, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Manchester United. Matthijs de Ligt has an impressive CV. An impressive CV is one thing, performing on the pitch is another.",
      "",
      "23) Raphael Varane (£36m) (7)\nVarane failed to convince everyone that he is in fact a four-time Champions League winner in his time at Old Trafford. Injuries absolutely did not help but what a disappointment he was.",
      "The Frenchman joined Cesc Fabregas’ Como in the summer and swiftly retired after suffering another serious injury.",
      "",
      "22) Sergio Romero (free) (8)\nAs far as back-up goalkeepers go, Romero was pretty good. And he cost bugger all, which is always a bonus.",
      "",
      "21) Andre Onana (£45.2m) (11)\nUpgrading on David de Gea should have been Ten Hag’s top priority when he took over and it took him a year to realise the Spaniard needed to be replaced. Do not be blinded by his 2022/23 Golden Glove.",
      "We thought Onana would be a big upgrade on De Gea but that’s not been the case. He makes far too many errors and his distribution is shaky, despite that being a compelling reason for ditching DDG for him.",
      "",
      "20) Jonny Evans (free) (38)\nIt is hilarious how high Evans is here. Genuinely astounding.",
      "",
      "19) Leny Yoro (£52m) (12)\nYoro’s potential is astronomical but that was a debut season to forget.",
      "",
      "18) Marcel Sabitzer (loan) (21)\nAs far as half-season emergency loans go, this was a success. Ten Hag decided against signing Sabitzer on a permanent basis. Silly man.",
      "",
      "17) Ayden Heaven (£1.5m) (NE)\nHe might already be United’s best centre-half.",
      "",
      "16) Matheus Cunha (£62.5m) (NE)\nSurely…surely this can’t go wrong.",
      "",
      "15) Juan Mata (£40m) (15)\nDavid Moyes’ second major signing after Fellaini, Mata joined from Chelsea with high expectations. The Spaniard played 285 times for the Red Devils, with game time hard to come from the start of 20/21 up until his departure in June 2022.",
      "",
      "14) Fred (£53m) (10)\nA few years ago Fred was in the same bracket as Lukaku, Pogba, and others as the big-money flops. But the Brazilian midfielder massively improved in his last two years at the club.",
      "£53m is still pretty bloody steep, mind.",
      "",
      "13) Christian Eriksen (free) (4)\nA lot of us fancied Eriksen to be the bargain of the 2022/23 campaign and his transfer fee – or lack of – is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Will leave for nothing this summer.",
      "",
      "12) Edinson Cavani (free) (9)\nSeventeen goals in 39 games in his first season was a great return from a player signed on a free transfer. He was rewarded with a new contract before Man Utd bought Cristiano Ronaldo, which screwed the Uruguayan over.",
      "",
      "11) Amad Diallo (£19m) (19)\nAfter a rubbish loan spell with Rangers, Diallo was being written off by many (myself included). However, his time with Sunderland was superb with the young Ivorian increasing his transfer value and staking a claim for minutes in the Premier League.",
      "His transfer fee could rise to £37m, which is beginning to look like decent value for money…finally.",
      "",
      "10) Lisandro Martinez (£50m) (5)\nMartinez is a fine footballer who adapted to Premier League life very quickly despite being written off before kicking a ball because of his height. The Argentine World Cup winner attracted interest from Arsenal before joining the Red Devils and it is clear to see why. His return from injury at the end of 2023/24 helped Ten Hag win the FA Cup.",
      "",
      "9) Ander Herrera (£32m) (6)\nHerrera was named Manchester United Fans’ Player of the Season in 2017 after he helped them win the League Cup and Europa League. He played 189 times for the Red Devils and was a fan favourite due to his passion, tireless work rate, and man-marking techniques; just ask Eden Hazard.",
      "",
      "8) Noussair Mazraoui (£12.8m) (17)\nHe is comfortably the best signing Man Utd made last summer.",
      "",
      "7) Cristiano Ronaldo (£13.5m) (4)\nThere’s not a lot to say that has not already been said. £13.5m for the most marketable footballer on the planet isn’t too bad at the end of the day. Even if it ended up turning into the biggest circus in world football.",
      "",
      "6) Casemiro (£61.5m) (3)\nAfter spending the whole 2022 summer transfer window chasing Frenkie de Jong, Man Utd realised that Casemiro was sitting right there willing to slot straight into their midfield.",
      "This is such a weird one now. In his debut season, Casemiro was outstanding and the main reason Ten Hag was able to end the club’s trophy drought and finish third in the Premier League, which is why he is so high here.",
      "In his second season, the Brazilian was awful. He looked remarkably off the pace and Man Utd prayed a Saudi Arabian club would bail them out in the summer.",
      "And then in 2024/25, he was one of Amorim’s better players. Funny ol’ game, innit?",
      "At this stage, the Red Devils shouldn’t be too bothered about what transfer fee they get; it’s all about getting Casemiro’s monstrous contract off the books. We’re not sure Saudi Arabia are even that stupid.",
      "",
      "5) Luke Shaw (£33.7m) (3)\nFitness issues and injuries have been the bane of Shaw’s Manchester United career.",
      "",
      "4) Diogo Dalot (£19.8m) (13)\nDalot’s time at the club looked up in the summer of 2021 with Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma circling, however, he has since established himself as the club’s first-choice right-back ahead of Wan-Bissaka, before it became the flip of a coin for Ten Hag.",
      "",
      "3) Alejandro Garnacho (£400k) (10)\nWhat a bargain and Man Utd intend to make some lovely profit in the summer.",
      "",
      "2) Zlatan Ibrahimovic (free) (2)\nThis is arguably the first signing on this list which was/has been a huge, unqualified success at Old Trafford. It only took 63 players to get here but at least we did.",
      "Zlatan scored 28 goals and provided 10 assists in his only full season, helped the Red Devils win the Europa League and scored a brace in the final of the League Cup as they beat Southampton 3-2 at Wembley. In 17/18, he struggled for fitness and left for LA Galaxy, for whom he scored 22 goals in 27 games in the same campaign.",
      "",
      "1) Bruno Fernandes (£56.7m) (1)\nAlthough his performances are not as good as they were during the behind-closed-doors days, Bruno Fernandes has been a revelation at Old Trafford. In his first season and a half, Fernandes provided 65 goal contributions in 80 games and was the best player in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side by a country mile.",
      "He is one of the best midfielders in the Premier League and a rare bit of great business by the Red Devils. It will take a lot to bump him off top spot – especially after he proved his loyalty by snubbing silly Saudi Arabian money to stay.",
      "According to reports, Arsenal have plotted a shock move to sign a Manchester United star as they have ‘asked’ whether a move would be possible.",
      "According to reports, one Manchester United star is on the brink of leaving the Premier League side as he has ‘said yes’ to a move to a European giant.",
      "According to reports, Manchester United are in ‘direct contact’ over a swap deal ‘solution’ with Serie A giants Juventus regarding Jadon Sancho.",
      "A Manchester United transfer reportedly hinges on one condition, while a Red Devils star has been pictured wearing the shirt of a rival Premier League club.",
      "A Liverpool fan does not think the Reds are firm favourites for the Premier League title due to four concerns, with Florian Wirtz the ‘new Kai Havertz’.",
      "Juventus have joined Serie A champions Napoli in the race to bring in a Premier League winger in the summer transfer window."

      "Man Utd have made a quick and assertive start to the summer transfer window by signing Matheus Cunha, approaching Brentford for Bryan Mbeumo, while Bruno Fernandes has turned down a move to Saudi Arabia; how could all three fit into Ruben Amorim's team next season?",
      "Wednesday 25 June 2025 09:17, UK",
      "Manchester United's road back has begun.",
      "For all the disappointment of last season's 15th place finish and no trophies to soften the blow, there have been some early - albeit minor wins - off the pitch.",
      "Matheus Cunha's move from Wolves has been announced. But the forward is not the only attacking talent still keen for Ruben Amorim's project. Bryan Mbeumo's decision to pursue an Old Trafford move from Brentford - despite other elite clubs in the running - is a positive sign.",
      "Captain Bruno Fernandes has turned down the temptation of a money-fuelled Saudi Arabia move that could have given United more money to rebuild the team. The project is far from being alive again, but it's a start.",
      "\"Cunha and Mbeumo have Premier League experience, and are the right type,\" said Gary Neville. But that is not the only reason those two have been categorised as the answer to United's problems.",
      "Putting the ball in the back of the net proved to be an issue for United last season. They ranked sixth for chances created but finished second bottom for converting shots into goals, while they were also fourth bottom for shot accuracy.",
      "Overall, United failed to score in 15 Premier League matches last season - only relegated Southampton and Leicester managed more. Eleven of those matches were under Amorim.",
      "They also had the second-worst Expected Goals underperformance record in the division, with the numbers saying they should have scored at least nine more goals than their final league tally of 44.",
      "This is where Cunha and Mbeumo could help - if last season's performances are anything to go by.",
      "As United floundered in front of goal, Mbeumo was the league's best overperformer in terms of xG. Using the same process as above, the Bees forward scored seven more goals than he should have done, with Cunha ranking third in the same category.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo could therefore bring that clinical edge that United are missing. But would they go straight into the team - and if so, where?",
      "Amorim has repeatedly said he will not deviate from his way of playing via the 3-4-2-1 formation. The plus point for Cunha is that Vitor Pereira used the same system at Wolves in the second half of last season.",
      "Cunha turned out in the 'left No 10' role in Pereira's system and while the forward's 15-goal league season saw him strike consistently across the campaign, it arguably hit top gear under Pereira.",
      "Cunha scored in Pereira's first two matches in charge from that position, while he then hit five goals across seven straight games between the start of February and April.",
      "The issue with Cunha playing that role in United colours? Bruno Fernandes. He is the most common appearance maker in that role for Amorim.",
      "The United captain ended the season a little bit deeper, actually playing as one of the two sitting midfielders, with Mason Mount taking that 'No 10' role ahead of him. It was that same set-up when United lost the Europa League final to Spurs.",
      "But is it so simple that Fernandes will settle for the deeper role and Cunha sits in front of him? Firstly, there are doubts about the balance of United's team, but there is a heavier dilemma at play.",
      "At Sporting, that same No 10 role belonged to Pedro Goncalves, also known as Pote. He was not necessarily the star of the team but very much the attacking engine of it.",
      "While players like Viktor Gyokeres took the headlines, Pote engineered a lot of the attacking combinations - he got 30 goals and 27 assists during the final 73 league games of Amorim's Sporting era.",
      "So that pocket of attacking space often belongs to the important cog of Amorim's team. The United head coach will need to determine whether that position at Old Trafford belongs to Fernandes or Cunha.",
      "Like Cunha, Mbeumo will be looking to turn his upward trajectory into some early form at Old Trafford.",
      "Only Mohamed Salah won more points for his team from goals and assists than the Brentford forward. His goal contributions didn't just put him among the league's best in terms of numbers, but also as one of the division's best at deciding games when it matters.",
      "While Cunha is eyeing up that 'left No 10' role, Mbeumo will be targeting the spot on the right. Going back to his Sporting days, Amorim's system always had a right-footed natural winger playing in that role - with Marcus Edwards and Francisco Trincao among those options in Lisbon.",
      "At United, Mbeumo will want that position - but so will Amad Diallo. The 22-year-old has spent most of the Amorim era at United on the injury table but has briefly shown glimpses of being the shining light in this dark period for the club.",
      "His goal and assist to win the Manchester derby at rivals City came from that 'Right No 10' position, as did his start in the Europa League final defeat, where he looked like the only player capable of breaking the deadlock against the Spurs defence.",
      "So, two things could happen if Mbeumo completes his Old Trafford move. Either the load on young prodigy Amad is lessened and the two compete for the same role. Or Amad is shifted to right wing-back.",
      "In Amorim's United system, the wing-backs appear to be the most scrutinised area of the pitch, alongside the No 10s - but the pursuits of Cunha and Mbeumo are addressing those holes.",
      "United's inability to have recognised options in those positions was symbolised by the early acquisition of Patrick Dorgu in January, who may not be the finished article but at least fits the profile.",
      "In an era where transitions from one pitch to the other and open spaces in wide areas are pretty common, efficient wing-backs are vital in any system like Amorim's.",
      "That has not just been evident in Pereira's 3-4-2-1 system at Wolves, but also at Oliver Glasner's Crystal Palace side. The industrious running of Daniel Munoz and Tyrick Mitchell was a key feature in the Eagles winning the FA Cup and reaching Europe, a level that United would even take right now.",
      "Meanwhile United's wing-back options, despite having a lot of running to do, are not among the league's elite runners, with Amorim once citing a \"lack of urgency to defend or attack the box\" as a contributor to defeats.",
      "But Amad has shown he can operate in that wing-back role. Amorim's first four Premier League games at United saw the youngster start in that position - he got four assists in that run. After a period further forward, his next start at wing-back ended in a late hat-trick against Southampton.",
      "And in another throwback to Sporting, Amorim even played 17-year-old Geovany Quenda in that right wing-back role during his final few months at Lisbon, highlighting how he can give huge running responsibility to young and attack-minded shoulders.",
      "Cunha and Mbeumo's arrivals - one finalised and the other being plotted - are the first steps in United's blueprints in the bid to bounce back. They promise not only to change those two players' lives - but the responsibilities of those around them.",
      "Part of the reasoning for United going so many games without a goal was a lack of presence in the centre forward position.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund ended the season with the fewest shots and second-fewest Expected Goals per 90 out of any recognised forward in the Premier League last season. He also had 14 starts that failed to include a shot, while Amorim feels back-up Joshua Zirkzee is better off as a No 10 option.",
      "Both Cunha and Mbeumo share the same status when it comes to being a centre forward. They can do it if needed, but it's not their strong suit.",
      "Wolves boss Pereira confessed Cunha was not a striker last season, when he was forced to play in that role in moments when Jorgen Strand Larsen was struggling with fitness.",
      "Mbeumo - meanwhile - has played centrally before for Brentford and Thomas Frank has highlighted the Cameroon international's hold-up play as one of his strong suits. But his striker outings mainly came in a 3-5-2 set-up where he would work off Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, rather than be a focal point himself.",
      "United's pursuit of Liam Delap - who eventually chose Chelsea - demonstrated Amorim's desire to improve the centre forward area. While the club have got off to a good start in the window, there is still work to do."

      "2025 AFCON takes place in Morocco between December 21, 2025 and January 18, 2026; Liverpool, Man Utd, Man City, Chelsea and Spurs are all set to lose key players for a number of potentially pivotal Premier League games during the tournament; Arsenal & Newcastle have no players competing",
      "Thursday 19 June 2025 20:30, UK",
      "Morocco will host the 24-team tournament, which was originally scheduled to take place between June and July 2025 to avoid clashing with European clubs' schedules, only for the new expanded FIFA Club World Cup to put an end to those plans.",
      "As a result, it will now take place between December 21, 2025 and January 18, 2026, earlier than the 2023 tournament that happened between January and February 2024 due to the final two league games in the new enlarged Champions League being scheduled for January 20-21 and 28 next year.",
      "And so these Premier League clubs will be missing a number of players for, potentially, several crucial fixtures at an integral part of next season:",
      "Mohamed Salah will captain Egypt at the tournament, meaning the Premier League champions will be without last season's FWA Footballer of the Year for a critical juncture of their title defence.",
      "The forward contributed an incredible 29 goals and 18 assists to help Arne Slot's side win the 2024/25 Premier League and given he suffered a debilitating hamstring injury while playing for Egypt at the 2023/24 AFCONs that seriously impacted Liverpool's title challenge that season, Reds head coach Arne Slot will be praying his star man comes back fit from Morocco.",
      "Either way, the 33-year-old could miss these top-flight fixtures - depending on how far Egypt go in the tournament [they were knocked out at the round-of-16 stage in 2024] - including a potentially defining clash at last season's runners-up Arsenal:",

      "Pep Guardiola is set to be without both Egypt striker Omar Marmoush and summer-signing Rayan Ait Nouri during next season's AFCON.",
      "Marmoush made an instant impact after moving to the Etihad from Eintracht Frankfurt in January, scoring seven goals in just 16 Premier League games, while City's new Algeria left-back is expected to play a key role for Guardiola's team next season.",
      "And that means City could be without both players for these league encounters, including the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on January 17, were either nation to make it as far as the semi-finals:",

      "United manager Ruben Amorim could be missing goalkeeper Andre Onana [Cameroon], right-back Noussair Mazraoui [Morocco] and forward Amad Diallo [Ivory Coast] all for a key month of his first full campaign in charge at Old Trafford.",
      "If Bryan Mbeumo does complete a move from Brentford this summer, United will also be without their new Cameroon forward during the tournament.",
      "And with Amorim desperate to improve on the club's worst-ever Premier League finish last season, the Portuguese would not have wanted to be without that key trio - and maybe event quartet - for these possible matches, including potentially pivotal clashes at Aston Villa and Leeds United and home to Newcastle United and arch-rivals Man City.",

      "The impact for Enzo Maresca appears less severe than for others, with the Blues head coach only likely to have to make do without the services of Senegal striker Nicolas Jackson during AFCON.",
      "And while the 23-year-old's 10 Premier League goals did play a key part in Chelsea securing Champions League football last season, the Blues have since signed Liam Delap, who can replace him in attack during the tournament for these fixtures:",
